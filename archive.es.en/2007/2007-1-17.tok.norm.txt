she stressed the need for progress on an eu constitution but also the fight against religious extremism . ahead of the address , eu watchers were most curious about what the german chancellor would propose to end the stalemate over the bloc 's proposed constitution , which failed to pass national referenda in france and the netherlands last year .
but merkel began her speech by stressing diversity as a core european value , saying the eu had to be vigorous in defending its freedoms . " tolerance , " merkel said in one of the speech 's central lines , " is the soul of europe . "
among the liberties in need of protection , she cited freedom to voice opinions that upset others , freedom to believe or not to believe in religion and freedom of artistic expression . " europe , " she said , " should never have the slightest understanding for intolerance , for violence by right-or left-wing extremists or violence carried out in the name of a religion . " " tolerance , " she added , " digs its own grave , if it does not defend itself against intolerance . " such remarks could hardly have failed to remind listeners of the threat of islamist terrorism as well as last year 's controversy over danish caricatures depicting the prophet mohammed , which some muslims found offensive . " failure would be a historic mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes for more harmony among eu member states merkel promised to present a plan to end the deadlock over the eu constitution by the end of germany 's presidency this june .
but she did not specify what form a proposed solution might take , other than to say that the bloc needed " clear descriptions about the authority of the eu and of the national states . " eighteen member states have ratified the constitution , and eu experts think that germany will negotiate with the remaining nine about what would have be removed from the treaty for it to be passed , preferably without national referenda . merkel called for the issue to be resolved before the next eu parliamentary elections in 2009 , warning that failure to do so would be " a historic mistake . "
she also stressed the need for the eu to have a foreign minister . " the time for deliberation is over , " she said .
" we have to reach new decisions . " closer ties to the us and less bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting the bloc 's bloated bureaucracy will be one of merkel 's main tasks merkel said the eu needed to cooperate more with the us on the issue of climate change in the efforts to achieve a global environmental treat by the year 2012 . " access to energy and protecting the climate , " she said , " are two challenges affecting all of humanity in our age . " she also said the bloc should strength its economic ties with the us .
america , she said , was still the eu 's most important trading partner , adding " a common trans-atlantic is very much in european interests . " in addition , merkel stressed the need to get rid of bureaucracy , saying it was crucial to creating jobs - an issue very much on people 's minds here in germany .

she stressed the need for progress on an eu constitution but also the fight against religious extremism . ahead of the address , eu watchers were most curious about what the german chancellor would propose to end the stalemate over the bloc 's proposed constitution , which failed to pass national referenda in france and the netherlands last year .
but merkel began her speech by stressing diversity as a core european value , saying the eu had to be vigorous in defending its freedoms . " tolerance , " merkel said in one of the speech 's central lines , " is the soul of europe . "
among the liberties in need of protection , she cited freedom to voice opinions that upset others , freedom to believe or not to believe in religion and freedom of artistic expression . " europe , " she said , " should never have the slightest understanding for intolerance , for violence by right-or left-wing extremists or violence carried out in the name of a religion . " " tolerance , " she added , " digs its own grave , if it does not defend itself against intolerance .

" eighteen member states have ratified the constitution , and eu experts think that germany will negotiate with the remaining nine about what would have be removed from the treaty for it to be passed , preferably without national referenda . merkel called for the issue to be resolved before the next eu parliamentary elections in 2009 , warning that failure to do so would be " a historic mistake . "
she also stressed the need for the eu to have a foreign minister . " the time for deliberation is over , " she said .
" we have to reach new decisions .

" access to energy and protecting the climate , " she said , " are two challenges affecting all of humanity in our age . " she also said the bloc should strength its economic ties with the us .
america , she said , was still the eu 's most important trading partner , adding " a common trans-atlantic is very much in european interests . " in addition , merkel stressed the need to get rid of bureaucracy , saying it was crucial to creating jobs - an issue very much on people 's minds here in germany .

she stressed the need for progress on an eu constitution but also the fight against religious extremism . ahead of the address , eu watchers were most curious about what the german chancellor would propose to end the stalemate over the bloc 's proposed constitution , which failed to pass national referenda in france and the netherlands last year .
but merkel began her speech by stressing diversity as a core european value , saying the eu had to be vigorous in defending its freedoms . " tolerance , " merkel said in one of the speech 's central lines , " is the soul of europe . "
among the liberties in need of protection , she cited freedom to voice opinions that upset others , freedom to believe or not to believe in religion and freedom of artistic expression . " europe , " she said , " should never have the slightest understanding for intolerance , for violence by right-or left-wing extremists or violence carried out in the name of a religion . " " tolerance , " she added , " digs its own grave , if it does not defend itself against intolerance . " such remarks could hardly have failed to remind listeners of the threat of islamist terrorism as well as last year 's controversy over danish caricatures depicting the prophet mohammed , which some muslims found offensive . " failure would be a historic mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes for more harmony among eu member states merkel promised to present a plan to end the deadlock over the eu constitution by the end of germany 's presidency this june .
but she did not specify what form a proposed solution might take , other than to say that the bloc needed " clear descriptions about the authority of the eu and of the national states . " eighteen member states have ratified the constitution , and eu experts think that germany will negotiate with the remaining nine about what would have be removed from the treaty for it to be passed , preferably without national referenda . merkel called for the issue to be resolved before the next eu parliamentary elections in 2009 , warning that failure to do so would be " a historic mistake . "
she also stressed the need for the eu to have a foreign minister . " the time for deliberation is over , " she said .
" we have to reach new decisions . " closer ties to the us and less bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting the bloc 's bloated bureaucracy will be one of merkel 's main tasks merkel said the eu needed to cooperate more with the us on the issue of climate change in the efforts to achieve a global environmental treat by the year 2012 . " access to energy and protecting the climate , " she said , " are two challenges affecting all of humanity in our age . " she also said the bloc should strength its economic ties with the us .
america , she said , was still the eu 's most important trading partner , adding " a common trans-atlantic is very much in european interests . " in addition , merkel stressed the need to get rid of bureaucracy , saying it was crucial to creating jobs - an issue very much on people 's minds here in germany .

the two met for an initial six hours on tuesday and another one-and-a half hours on wednesday . the men declined to comment after wednesday 's meeting . " when you have six hours of conversations and you 're going to have some more ... certainly you can characterize them as useful discussions , " christopher hill told guests at an american academy event after the first round of talks . he declined to answer questions on the substance of the meeting but said he hoped the six-party talks , which collapsed in december in beijing with no discernible progress , would start again in january .
" the north koreans have to understand that they have come to a crossroads , " hill said in a speech at the american academy .
" -lrb- they -rrb- have to decide if they want nuclear weapons or if they want a place in the international community . " the berlin meetings came ahead of hill 's visits beginning friday to south korea , china and japan to continue consultations with key partners in the six-party talks on how to make progress in the next round of negotiations .
rice in berlin hill , who was also to brief us secretary of state condoleezza rice - who arrived in berlin wednesday evening - on the meetings , noted that the berlin talks were the first bilateral discussions he had held with kim outside beijing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice arrived in berlin wednesday night the two powers held landmark talks in berlin in 1999 that ultimately led to the lifting of a half-century of restrictions on trade , travel and banking against north korea after it agreed to a moratorium on missile tests .
but the crisis erupted again in 2002 . six-party negotiations involving the united states , the two koreas , japan , russia and china were suspended in late 2005 after north korea walked out in protest at us financial sanctions imposed on a macau bank accused of illicit dealings on behalf of pyongyang . the talks resumed in december last year - following the north 's oct .
9 nuclear weapons test - and ended in deadlock as pyongyang insisted the financial sanctions be lifted before it would discuss nuclear disarmament .
russia criticizes sanctions russia on wednesday called the us sanctions an obstacle to the resumption of talks and urged flexibility on both sides . " the united states should have taken some steps toward the koreans on lifting financial sanctions and discussing this question with them , " deputy foreign minister alexander losyukov , the head russian negotiator on north korea , was quoted as saying by state-run news agency ria novosti . losyukov also called on north korea to reconsider its refusal to rejoin the negotiations on account of the us sanctions .
" the link is not 100 percent justified , " he was quoted as saying . hill declined to discuss the specifics of the latest negotiations but said the sanctions over the macau bank were " a separate process from the issue of denuclearization . "
he said the other powers involved in the negotiations had a raft of economic and diplomatic incentives to convince pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons program . " we have a lot of options for dealing with it but we do n't have the option of walking away from it , " he said .
" we 'd really like to move this along as quickly as possible . "
high hopes japan and south korea welcomed the berlin talks and voiced hope for an early resumption of multilateral discussions on pyongyang 's nuclear arms program .

despite hill 's relatively upbeat assessment , the former us ambassador to the un , john bolton , said the six-way talks had failed and a breakthrough would only come after kim jong-il 's regime ended . " six-party talks have not worked , " he said .

at least not officially .
that is n't because there are n't any , but because they 've decided keeping their sexuality hidden is preferable to the career-ending scorn , ridicule and even physical danger they would face if they came out of the closet . that was the bottom line of a cover story by the popular german soccer magazine rund last month which interviewed players who kept their homosexuality tightly under wraps . " soccer is still unbelievably backward when it comes to homosexuality .
gays on the pitch remain a huge taboo , " said rainer schäfer , chief editor at rund , who spent two years researching the topic and winning the trust of two gay players in the two highest german soccer leagues .
they eventually agreed to tell their stories provided they remained anonymous . creating a ' normal ' image both spoke of going to great lengths to hide their sexuality from their clubs , managers and teammates and living in constant fear of being discovered . one player , who is married , said even his wife had no idea he was gay and that he was involved in a long-term relationship with a childhood friend .
" but what am i to do ?
coming out would mean death , " he was quoted as saying in the article . the other gay player profiled said that a female friend in the know often accompanied him to club celebrations and parties to give the impression that he was straight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supermodel heidi klum added some glamour to the world cup last year clubs also sometimes step in if gay rumors persistently circulate around a player .
they usually enlist pr agencies to create a " normal " heterosexual image for the player , which includes parading hired models and kids around the players during publicity events . " constructing a fake identity and an elaborate web of lies takes a heavy toll on the players and does n't make it easier for them to focus on their game , " said schäfer , who added he was taken aback by how widespread homophobia continued to be in the soccer world . germany , in fact , is considered fairly liberal regarding gay rights .
same-sex unions are legal here and it 's not unusual to see high-profile personalities open about their sexuality .
berlin 's mayor , for example , is gay and appears at functions with his partner . macho attitudes though there are no figures on the number of gay players in germany , tatjana eggeling from the institute of cultural anthropology and european ethnology at the university of göttingen said she estimated there were about 30 in the top two leagues . that guess is based on statistics that say around 5 to 10 percent of the adult population in germany is gay or lesbian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rough and tumble soccer only for tough virile men , goes a cliche eggeling added that a combination of macho attitudes and prejudices is to blame for the enduring gay taboo in soccer . " sport is one of the most conservative fields in society .
it 's still dominated by men and 19th century values such as honor and bravery as male virtues , " said eggeling .
" soccer does n't allow you to be different . " she pointed out that being homosexual was often equated in sport with being effeminate and weak - a view that is perpetuated in soccer clubs with players calling their colleagues " pansy " or " fag " the moment they show any weakness . learning from britain ? apart from the straights-only attitude within clubs , some say homophobia in stadiums - in the form of chanting and jeering - remains a problem that has n't been taken seriously in germany by either the clubs or the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justin fashanu played for norwich , nottingham forests and hearts many point to britain as an example of a country that has taken steps to address the problem .
in 2001 , the football association - four years after the suicide of britain 's only openly gay player , justin fashanu - changed its charter , which imposed penalties for sexually discriminatory behavior .
recently two norwich city fans were sentenced to time in jail for violating those rules . but a spokesman for the dfb who declined to be named said the german association 's charter did not penalize sexually discriminatory behavior and said he did not see why it needed to . some say it 's this refusal by the authorities to even acknowledge there is a problem that makes it difficult for gay players to come out of the closet .
things are made worse by straight players often refusing to acknowledge publicly that they have gay teammates . " it would be a big help if heterosexual players would stand up and say ' i have a gay colleague on the team and he plays great soccer , that 's it , " ' said eggeling . " as things stand now , i would n't advise a single german soccer player to come out because it would be just too much of a risk for him , both for his career and personal life , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corny littmann is the only openly gay figure in the german soccer world corny littmann , president of hamburg 's st. pauli club and the only openly gay figure on germany 's soccer circuit , told german news agency dpa last year he did not expect any player to come out anytime soon . " if one did come out , there would be a media frenzy .
i do n't know how a 20- or 25-year-old would handle it , " littmann said , adding the player would be the target of abuse both on and off the pitch .
" being gay just frightens people . " " soccer is everything , even gay " so far even the handful of gay and lesbian fan clubs attached to the bundesliga has been unable to put an end to homophobic behavior in stadiums . gerd eiserbeck , a member of hertha junxx - the first gay and lesbian bundesliga fan club in germany - said that though their debut in 2001 had initially led to some " verbal confrontation " between ostensibly straight hertha bsc fans and gay fans , they were now largely accepted .
even their rainbow-colored banner reading " soccer is everything , even gay , " is tolerated in berlin 's olympia stadium , said eiserbeck . " but we still do n't travel to away games , " he said .
" that 's too risky because we do n't know how the opposing fans will react . " more discussion needed despite the odds , some believe that pushing the topic into the public consciousness and keeping it there will eventually create enough pressure on the dfb to deal with it . " remember that 's exactly what happened with racism .
the dfb eventually gave in to the campaigns and imposed harsh penalties for racist behavior , " said schäfer . " the same could happen with homophobia , hopefully .

in 2001 , the football association - four years after the suicide of britain 's only openly gay player , justin fashanu - changed its charter , which imposed penalties for sexually discriminatory behavior .
recently two norwich city fans were sentenced to time in jail for violating those rules . but a spokesman for the dfb who declined to be named said the german association 's charter did not penalize sexually discriminatory behavior and said he did not see why it needed to . some say it 's this refusal by the authorities to even acknowledge there is a problem that makes it difficult for gay players to come out of the closet .
things are made worse by straight players often refusing to acknowledge publicly that they have gay teammates . " it would be a big help if heterosexual players would stand up and say ' i have a gay colleague on the team and he plays great soccer , that 's it , " ' said eggeling .

politicians , pop stars and artists coming out of the closet hardly raise eyebrows in germany .
but it 's an entirely different ballgame on the soccer field , where being openly gay remains strictly taboo . german professional soccer has n't seen a gay player to date .
at least not officially .
that is n't because there are n't any , but because they 've decided keeping their sexuality hidden is preferable to the career-ending scorn , ridicule and even physical danger they would face if they came out of the closet . that was the bottom line of a cover story by the popular german soccer magazine rund last month which interviewed players who kept their homosexuality tightly under wraps . " soccer is still unbelievably backward when it comes to homosexuality .
gays on the pitch remain a huge taboo , " said rainer schäfer , chief editor at rund , who spent two years researching the topic and winning the trust of two gay players in the two highest german soccer leagues .
they eventually agreed to tell their stories provided they remained anonymous . creating a ' normal ' image both spoke of going to great lengths to hide their sexuality from their clubs , managers and teammates and living in constant fear of being discovered . one player , who is married , said even his wife had no idea he was gay and that he was involved in a long-term relationship with a childhood friend .
" but what am i to do ?
coming out would mean death , " he was quoted as saying in the article . the other gay player profiled said that a female friend in the know often accompanied him to club celebrations and parties to give the impression that he was straight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supermodel heidi klum added some glamour to the world cup last year clubs also sometimes step in if gay rumors persistently circulate around a player .
they usually enlist pr agencies to create a " normal " heterosexual image for the player , which includes parading hired models and kids around the players during publicity events . " constructing a fake identity and an elaborate web of lies takes a heavy toll on the players and does n't make it easier for them to focus on their game , " said schäfer , who added he was taken aback by how widespread homophobia continued to be in the soccer world . germany , in fact , is considered fairly liberal regarding gay rights .
same-sex unions are legal here and it 's not unusual to see high-profile personalities open about their sexuality .
berlin 's mayor , for example , is gay and appears at functions with his partner . macho attitudes though there are no figures on the number of gay players in germany , tatjana eggeling from the institute of cultural anthropology and european ethnology at the university of göttingen said she estimated there were about 30 in the top two leagues . that guess is based on statistics that say around 5 to 10 percent of the adult population in germany is gay or lesbian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rough and tumble soccer only for tough virile men , goes a cliche eggeling added that a combination of macho attitudes and prejudices is to blame for the enduring gay taboo in soccer . " sport is one of the most conservative fields in society .
it 's still dominated by men and 19th century values such as honor and bravery as male virtues , " said eggeling .
" soccer does n't allow you to be different . " she pointed out that being homosexual was often equated in sport with being effeminate and weak - a view that is perpetuated in soccer clubs with players calling their colleagues " pansy " or " fag " the moment they show any weakness . learning from britain ? apart from the straights-only attitude within clubs , some say homophobia in stadiums - in the form of chanting and jeering - remains a problem that has n't been taken seriously in germany by either the clubs or the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justin fashanu played for norwich , nottingham forests and hearts many point to britain as an example of a country that has taken steps to address the problem .

the two met for an initial six hours on tuesday and another one-and-a half hours on wednesday . the men declined to comment after wednesday 's meeting . " when you have six hours of conversations and you 're going to have some more ... certainly you can characterize them as useful discussions , " christopher hill told guests at an american academy event after the first round of talks . he declined to answer questions on the substance of the meeting but said he hoped the six-party talks , which collapsed in december in beijing with no discernible progress , would start again in january .
" the north koreans have to understand that they have come to a crossroads , " hill said in a speech at the american academy .
" -lrb- they -rrb- have to decide if they want nuclear weapons or if they want a place in the international community . " the berlin meetings came ahead of hill 's visits beginning friday to south korea , china and japan to continue consultations with key partners in the six-party talks on how to make progress in the next round of negotiations .
rice in berlin hill , who was also to brief us secretary of state condoleezza rice - who arrived in berlin wednesday evening - on the meetings , noted that the berlin talks were the first bilateral discussions he had held with kim outside beijing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice arrived in berlin wednesday night the two powers held landmark talks in berlin in 1999 that ultimately led to the lifting of a half-century of restrictions on trade , travel and banking against north korea after it agreed to a moratorium on missile tests .
but the crisis erupted again in 2002 . six-party negotiations involving the united states , the two koreas , japan , russia and china were suspended in late 2005 after north korea walked out in protest at us financial sanctions imposed on a macau bank accused of illicit dealings on behalf of pyongyang . the talks resumed in december last year - following the north 's oct .
9 nuclear weapons test - and ended in deadlock as pyongyang insisted the financial sanctions be lifted before it would discuss nuclear disarmament .
russia criticizes sanctions russia on wednesday called the us sanctions an obstacle to the resumption of talks and urged flexibility on both sides . " the united states should have taken some steps toward the koreans on lifting financial sanctions and discussing this question with them , " deputy foreign minister alexander losyukov , the head russian negotiator on north korea , was quoted as saying by state-run news agency ria novosti . losyukov also called on north korea to reconsider its refusal to rejoin the negotiations on account of the us sanctions .
" the link is not 100 percent justified , " he was quoted as saying . hill declined to discuss the specifics of the latest negotiations but said the sanctions over the macau bank were " a separate process from the issue of denuclearization . "
he said the other powers involved in the negotiations had a raft of economic and diplomatic incentives to convince pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons program . " we have a lot of options for dealing with it but we do n't have the option of walking away from it , " he said .
" we 'd really like to move this along as quickly as possible . "
high hopes japan and south korea welcomed the berlin talks and voiced hope for an early resumption of multilateral discussions on pyongyang 's nuclear arms program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hill -lrb- far left -rrb- and kim kye-gwan -lrb- far right -rrb- at the six-party talks in beijing " dialogue is a good thing , " japanese chief cabinet secretary yasuhisa shiozaki , the top government spokesman , told reporters .
" the berlin meeting should lay a good groundwork for an agreement on what initial steps to take to implement the september 19 statement , " south korea 's foreign minister , song min-soon , said , referring to a 2005 accord offering the north security and economic aid guarantees in return for disarmament . hill described that agreement as " a sort of bible for us " and said he hoped it would be the basis for a new agreement .
despite hill 's relatively upbeat assessment , the former us ambassador to the un , john bolton , said the six-way talks had failed and a breakthrough would only come after kim jong-il 's regime ended . " six-party talks have not worked , " he said .

he could now get off with a fine and a suspended sentence . once one of the country 's most respected managers , hartz , 65 , was accused of sanctioning illegal bonuses while director of volkswagen 's human resources department .
the payments were allegedly used to finance lavish foreign trips , mainly by the head of the company 's works council , klaus volkert , and his south american mistress .
other charges relate to visits to brothels and sex parties financed with company funds . hartz , who played a key role in drafting germany 's labor and social welfare reforms under former chancellor gerhard schröder , left the company in july 2005 .
he admitted in october to " a criminal responsibility for giving preferential treatment to the former works council head .

this included allegations about flying around high-class prostitutes . the charges against hartz came after an 18-month investigation , which has also seen the indictment of hans-juergen uhl , a former member of the works council , who is also a member of parliament in berlin . uhl , who represents the co-governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , has been indicted on two counts of being an accessory to fraud and five counts of making false statements under oath . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus volkert volkert was arrested last year because of concerns about the suppression of evidence , but released after two months . the former works council chief is alleged to have been paid illegal bonuses worth 1.9 million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- by hartz between 1994 and 2005 .

the two met for an initial six hours on tuesday and another one-and-a half hours on wednesday . the men declined to comment after wednesday 's meeting . " when you have six hours of conversations and you 're going to have some more ... certainly you can characterize them as useful discussions , " christopher hill told guests at an american academy event after the first round of talks . he declined to answer questions on the substance of the meeting but said he hoped the six-party talks , which collapsed in december in beijing with no discernible progress , would start again in january .
" the north koreans have to understand that they have come to a crossroads , " hill said in a speech at the american academy .
" -lrb- they -rrb- have to decide if they want nuclear weapons or if they want a place in the international community . " the berlin meetings came ahead of hill 's visits beginning friday to south korea , china and japan to continue consultations with key partners in the six-party talks on how to make progress in the next round of negotiations .
rice in berlin hill , who was also to brief us secretary of state condoleezza rice - who arrived in berlin wednesday evening - on the meetings , noted that the berlin talks were the first bilateral discussions he had held with kim outside beijing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice arrived in berlin wednesday night the two powers held landmark talks in berlin in 1999 that ultimately led to the lifting of a half-century of restrictions on trade , travel and banking against north korea after it agreed to a moratorium on missile tests .
but the crisis erupted again in 2002 . six-party negotiations involving the united states , the two koreas , japan , russia and china were suspended in late 2005 after north korea walked out in protest at us financial sanctions imposed on a macau bank accused of illicit dealings on behalf of pyongyang . the talks resumed in december last year - following the north 's oct .
9 nuclear weapons test - and ended in deadlock as pyongyang insisted the financial sanctions be lifted before it would discuss nuclear disarmament .
russia criticizes sanctions russia on wednesday called the us sanctions an obstacle to the resumption of talks and urged flexibility on both sides . " the united states should have taken some steps toward the koreans on lifting financial sanctions and discussing this question with them , " deputy foreign minister alexander losyukov , the head russian negotiator on north korea , was quoted as saying by state-run news agency ria novosti . losyukov also called on north korea to reconsider its refusal to rejoin the negotiations on account of the us sanctions .
" the link is not 100 percent justified , " he was quoted as saying . hill declined to discuss the specifics of the latest negotiations but said the sanctions over the macau bank were " a separate process from the issue of denuclearization . "
he said the other powers involved in the negotiations had a raft of economic and diplomatic incentives to convince pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons program . " we have a lot of options for dealing with it but we do n't have the option of walking away from it , " he said .
" we 'd really like to move this along as quickly as possible . "

she stressed the need for progress on an eu constitution but also the fight against religious extremism . ahead of the address , eu watchers were most curious about what the german chancellor would propose to end the stalemate over the bloc 's proposed constitution , which failed to pass national referenda in france and the netherlands last year .

among the liberties in need of protection , she cited freedom to voice opinions that upset others , freedom to believe or not to believe in religion and freedom of artistic expression . " europe , " she said , " should never have the slightest understanding for intolerance , for violence by right-or left-wing extremists or violence carried out in the name of a religion . " " tolerance , " she added , " digs its own grave , if it does not defend itself against intolerance .

" eighteen member states have ratified the constitution , and eu experts think that germany will negotiate with the remaining nine about what would have be removed from the treaty for it to be passed , preferably without national referenda . merkel called for the issue to be resolved before the next eu parliamentary elections in 2009 , warning that failure to do so would be " a historic mistake . "
she also stressed the need for the eu to have a foreign minister . " the time for deliberation is over , " she said .

she stressed the need for progress on an eu constitution but also the fight against religious extremism . ahead of the address , eu watchers were most curious about what the german chancellor would propose to end the stalemate over the bloc 's proposed constitution , which failed to pass national referenda in france and the netherlands last year .

among the liberties in need of protection , she cited freedom to voice opinions that upset others , freedom to believe or not to believe in religion and freedom of artistic expression .

the two met for an initial six hours on tuesday and another one-and-a half hours on wednesday . the men declined to comment after wednesday 's meeting . " when you have six hours of conversations and you 're going to have some more ... certainly you can characterize them as useful discussions , " christopher hill told guests at an american academy event after the first round of talks . he declined to answer questions on the substance of the meeting but said he hoped the six-party talks , which collapsed in december in beijing with no discernible progress , would start again in january .
" the north koreans have to understand that they have come to a crossroads , " hill said in a speech at the american academy .
" -lrb- they -rrb- have to decide if they want nuclear weapons or if they want a place in the international community . " the berlin meetings came ahead of hill 's visits beginning friday to south korea , china and japan to continue consultations with key partners in the six-party talks on how to make progress in the next round of negotiations .
rice in berlin hill , who was also to brief us secretary of state condoleezza rice - who arrived in berlin wednesday evening - on the meetings , noted that the berlin talks were the first bilateral discussions he had held with kim outside beijing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice arrived in berlin wednesday night the two powers held landmark talks in berlin in 1999 that ultimately led to the lifting of a half-century of restrictions on trade , travel and banking against north korea after it agreed to a moratorium on missile tests .
but the crisis erupted again in 2002 . six-party negotiations involving the united states , the two koreas , japan , russia and china were suspended in late 2005 after north korea walked out in protest at us financial sanctions imposed on a macau bank accused of illicit dealings on behalf of pyongyang . the talks resumed in december last year - following the north 's oct .
9 nuclear weapons test - and ended in deadlock as pyongyang insisted the financial sanctions be lifted before it would discuss nuclear disarmament .
russia criticizes sanctions russia on wednesday called the us sanctions an obstacle to the resumption of talks and urged flexibility on both sides . " the united states should have taken some steps toward the koreans on lifting financial sanctions and discussing this question with them , " deputy foreign minister alexander losyukov , the head russian negotiator on north korea , was quoted as saying by state-run news agency ria novosti . losyukov also called on north korea to reconsider its refusal to rejoin the negotiations on account of the us sanctions .
" the link is not 100 percent justified , " he was quoted as saying . hill declined to discuss the specifics of the latest negotiations but said the sanctions over the macau bank were " a separate process from the issue of denuclearization . "
he said the other powers involved in the negotiations had a raft of economic and diplomatic incentives to convince pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons program . " we have a lot of options for dealing with it but we do n't have the option of walking away from it , " he said .
" we 'd really like to move this along as quickly as possible . "
high hopes japan and south korea welcomed the berlin talks and voiced hope for an early resumption of multilateral discussions on pyongyang 's nuclear arms program .

" the berlin meeting should lay a good groundwork for an agreement on what initial steps to take to implement the september 19 statement , " south korea 's foreign minister , song min-soon , said , referring to a 2005 accord offering the north security and economic aid guarantees in return for disarmament . hill described that agreement as " a sort of bible for us " and said he hoped it would be the basis for a new agreement .
despite hill 's relatively upbeat assessment , the former us ambassador to the un , john bolton , said the six-way talks had failed and a breakthrough would only come after kim jong-il 's regime ended . " six-party talks have not worked , " he said .
" they are not likely to work .

" it is important to be as inclusive as possible with russia , although that does not necessarily mean as comprehensive as possible , " an eu diplomat said , according to afp news service . russia is a long-time ally of serbia and both believe that not enough time has been given to talks on how much autonomy kosovo should win , which started almost a year ago but were halted in october for lack of progress . kosovo albanians insist they will accept nothing short of independence , but belgrade is offering only " broad autonomy , " saying it would never accept secession . eu foreign policy chief javier solana " has been in touch with all levels in russia " including president vladimir putin , another eu official told afp , also on condition of anonymity . " we are doing as much as possible to ensure that this period , which is not going to be easy , is developing as smoothly as possible , " she said . making the deal acceptable to belgrade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian prime minister kostunica says no country would willingly give up a part of its territory reports quoting a serbian government statement said that putin had promised to veto any initiative in the un security council which belgrade rejects during a telephone call with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica . kosovo , defined by serbia 's constitution as an integral part of its territory , has been run by the united nations since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign ended a crackdown by belgrade on separatist ethnic albanians there . un envoy martti ahtisaari had been expected to make proposals on kosovo 's future status late last year , but he has pushed back publication of his recommendations until after elections in serbia on sunday . to accommodate russia , the eu has offered its support to a proposal of new talks in vienna , perhaps in march , between kosovo and serbian authorities and led by ahtisaari . " this engagement can be very positive , " the eu official said . the talks could run anywhere from two weeks to a month . irreconcilable differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the differences between serbs and kosovo albanians may be impossible to bridge according to an international crisis group expert , they would address russia 's concerns but at the same time demonstrate publicly that the parties are too far apart for their differences to be resolved soon . " this is an attempt to get around what is likely to be a significant blockage at the security council , " said kosovo-based analyst for the think tank alexander anderson . despite albanian cries for full independence and serbia 's refusal to offer anything more than autonomy , experts say that ahtisaari 's proposals will most likely involve a broad , non-specific formula that the united nations will tease out into a clearer degree of autonomy to be introduced over a reasonably long period . " i think there is no other solution than to find a status somewhere between wider autonomy and a programmed independence , " said bernard kouchner , former head of the un 's kosovo mission . a hot election topic the future of kosovo has figured prominently in election campaigning and may even influence how long it takes sunday 's winner to form a new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cedomir jovanovic says that kosovo is no longer serbian yet most of the players in serbian politics - ranging from the ultra-nationalist radical party to kostunica 's democratic party of serbia and serbian president boris tadic 's democratic party - seem to agree in principle that kosovo should not become an independent country . the most notable exception is a coalition lead by the liberal democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- . " we have to accept the reality , " said ldp president and former student leader cedomir jovanovic , " and the reality is that kosovo has been independent from belgrade since 1999 . " ldp , however , is a small player on the serbian political scene and , according to some polls , may barely win the 5 percent of votes necessary to enter the parliament . time is running out if a solution to kosovo 's status is not found in the nearest future , the tensions that have regularly surfaced in kosovo over the last seven years could mount again . the worst case was in march 2004 , when several days of anti-serb riots left 19 people dead , thousands more homeless , and dozens of serbian orthodox monasteries and churches destroyed or damaged . responsibility for kosovo 's future security will fall mostly into the hands of the 27-nation european union . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned sunday that stability in the balkans depended on how the future status of kosovo is resolved and said the eu will work to ensure peace in the serbian province .

the two met for an initial six hours on tuesday and another one-and-a half hours on wednesday . the men declined to comment after wednesday 's meeting . " when you have six hours of conversations and you 're going to have some more ... certainly you can characterize them as useful discussions , " christopher hill told guests at an american academy event after the first round of talks . he declined to answer questions on the substance of the meeting but said he hoped the six-party talks , which collapsed in december in beijing with no discernible progress , would start again in january .
" the north koreans have to understand that they have come to a crossroads , " hill said in a speech at the american academy .
" -lrb- they -rrb- have to decide if they want nuclear weapons or if they want a place in the international community . " the berlin meetings came ahead of hill 's visits beginning friday to south korea , china and japan to continue consultations with key partners in the six-party talks on how to make progress in the next round of negotiations .
rice in berlin hill , who was also to brief us secretary of state condoleezza rice - who arrived in berlin wednesday evening - on the meetings , noted that the berlin talks were the first bilateral discussions he had held with kim outside beijing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice arrived in berlin wednesday night the two powers held landmark talks in berlin in 1999 that ultimately led to the lifting of a half-century of restrictions on trade , travel and banking against north korea after it agreed to a moratorium on missile tests .
but the crisis erupted again in 2002 . six-party negotiations involving the united states , the two koreas , japan , russia and china were suspended in late 2005 after north korea walked out in protest at us financial sanctions imposed on a macau bank accused of illicit dealings on behalf of pyongyang . the talks resumed in december last year - following the north 's oct .
9 nuclear weapons test - and ended in deadlock as pyongyang insisted the financial sanctions be lifted before it would discuss nuclear disarmament .
russia criticizes sanctions russia on wednesday called the us sanctions an obstacle to the resumption of talks and urged flexibility on both sides . " the united states should have taken some steps toward the koreans on lifting financial sanctions and discussing this question with them , " deputy foreign minister alexander losyukov , the head russian negotiator on north korea , was quoted as saying by state-run news agency ria novosti . losyukov also called on north korea to reconsider its refusal to rejoin the negotiations on account of the us sanctions .
" the link is not 100 percent justified , " he was quoted as saying . hill declined to discuss the specifics of the latest negotiations but said the sanctions over the macau bank were " a separate process from the issue of denuclearization . "
he said the other powers involved in the negotiations had a raft of economic and diplomatic incentives to convince pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons program . " we have a lot of options for dealing with it but we do n't have the option of walking away from it , " he said .
" we 'd really like to move this along as quickly as possible . "
high hopes japan and south korea welcomed the berlin talks and voiced hope for an early resumption of multilateral discussions on pyongyang 's nuclear arms program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hill -lrb- far left -rrb- and kim kye-gwan -lrb- far right -rrb- at the six-party talks in beijing " dialogue is a good thing , " japanese chief cabinet secretary yasuhisa shiozaki , the top government spokesman , told reporters .
" the berlin meeting should lay a good groundwork for an agreement on what initial steps to take to implement the september 19 statement , " south korea 's foreign minister , song min-soon , said , referring to a 2005 accord offering the north security and economic aid guarantees in return for disarmament . hill described that agreement as " a sort of bible for us " and said he hoped it would be the basis for a new agreement .
despite hill 's relatively upbeat assessment , the former us ambassador to the un , john bolton , said the six-way talks had failed and a breakthrough would only come after kim jong-il 's regime ended . " six-party talks have not worked , " he said .

the two met for an initial six hours on tuesday and another one-and-a half hours on wednesday . the men declined to comment after wednesday 's meeting . " when you have six hours of conversations and you 're going to have some more ... certainly you can characterize them as useful discussions , " christopher hill told guests at an american academy event after the first round of talks . he declined to answer questions on the substance of the meeting but said he hoped the six-party talks , which collapsed in december in beijing with no discernible progress , would start again in january .
" the north koreans have to understand that they have come to a crossroads , " hill said in a speech at the american academy .
" -lrb- they -rrb- have to decide if they want nuclear weapons or if they want a place in the international community . " the berlin meetings came ahead of hill 's visits beginning friday to south korea , china and japan to continue consultations with key partners in the six-party talks on how to make progress in the next round of negotiations .
rice in berlin hill , who was also to brief us secretary of state condoleezza rice - who arrived in berlin wednesday evening - on the meetings , noted that the berlin talks were the first bilateral discussions he had held with kim outside beijing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice arrived in berlin wednesday night the two powers held landmark talks in berlin in 1999 that ultimately led to the lifting of a half-century of restrictions on trade , travel and banking against north korea after it agreed to a moratorium on missile tests .
but the crisis erupted again in 2002 . six-party negotiations involving the united states , the two koreas , japan , russia and china were suspended in late 2005 after north korea walked out in protest at us financial sanctions imposed on a macau bank accused of illicit dealings on behalf of pyongyang . the talks resumed in december last year - following the north 's oct .
9 nuclear weapons test - and ended in deadlock as pyongyang insisted the financial sanctions be lifted before it would discuss nuclear disarmament .
russia criticizes sanctions russia on wednesday called the us sanctions an obstacle to the resumption of talks and urged flexibility on both sides . " the united states should have taken some steps toward the koreans on lifting financial sanctions and discussing this question with them , " deputy foreign minister alexander losyukov , the head russian negotiator on north korea , was quoted as saying by state-run news agency ria novosti . losyukov also called on north korea to reconsider its refusal to rejoin the negotiations on account of the us sanctions .
" the link is not 100 percent justified , " he was quoted as saying . hill declined to discuss the specifics of the latest negotiations but said the sanctions over the macau bank were " a separate process from the issue of denuclearization . "
he said the other powers involved in the negotiations had a raft of economic and diplomatic incentives to convince pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons program . " we have a lot of options for dealing with it but we do n't have the option of walking away from it , " he said .
" we 'd really like to move this along as quickly as possible . "
high hopes japan and south korea welcomed the berlin talks and voiced hope for an early resumption of multilateral discussions on pyongyang 's nuclear arms program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hill -lrb- far left -rrb- and kim kye-gwan -lrb- far right -rrb- at the six-party talks in beijing " dialogue is a good thing , " japanese chief cabinet secretary yasuhisa shiozaki , the top government spokesman , told reporters .
" the berlin meeting should lay a good groundwork for an agreement on what initial steps to take to implement the september 19 statement , " south korea 's foreign minister , song min-soon , said , referring to a 2005 accord offering the north security and economic aid guarantees in return for disarmament . hill described that agreement as " a sort of bible for us " and said he hoped it would be the basis for a new agreement .
despite hill 's relatively upbeat assessment , the former us ambassador to the un , john bolton , said the six-way talks had failed and a breakthrough would only come after kim jong-il 's regime ended . " six-party talks have not worked , " he said .

" it is important to be as inclusive as possible with russia , although that does not necessarily mean as comprehensive as possible , " an eu diplomat said , according to afp news service . russia is a long-time ally of serbia and both believe that not enough time has been given to talks on how much autonomy kosovo should win , which started almost a year ago but were halted in october for lack of progress . kosovo albanians insist they will accept nothing short of independence , but belgrade is offering only " broad autonomy , " saying it would never accept secession . eu foreign policy chief javier solana " has been in touch with all levels in russia " including president vladimir putin , another eu official told afp , also on condition of anonymity . " we are doing as much as possible to ensure that this period , which is not going to be easy , is developing as smoothly as possible , " she said . making the deal acceptable to belgrade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian prime minister kostunica says no country would willingly give up a part of its territory reports quoting a serbian government statement said that putin had promised to veto any initiative in the un security council which belgrade rejects during a telephone call with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica . kosovo , defined by serbia 's constitution as an integral part of its territory , has been run by the united nations since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign ended a crackdown by belgrade on separatist ethnic albanians there . un envoy martti ahtisaari had been expected to make proposals on kosovo 's future status late last year , but he has pushed back publication of his recommendations until after elections in serbia on sunday . to accommodate russia , the eu has offered its support to a proposal of new talks in vienna , perhaps in march , between kosovo and serbian authorities and led by ahtisaari . " this engagement can be very positive , " the eu official said . the talks could run anywhere from two weeks to a month . irreconcilable differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the differences between serbs and kosovo albanians may be impossible to bridge according to an international crisis group expert , they would address russia 's concerns but at the same time demonstrate publicly that the parties are too far apart for their differences to be resolved soon . " this is an attempt to get around what is likely to be a significant blockage at the security council , " said kosovo-based analyst for the think tank alexander anderson . despite albanian cries for full independence and serbia 's refusal to offer anything more than autonomy , experts say that ahtisaari 's proposals will most likely involve a broad , non-specific formula that the united nations will tease out into a clearer degree of autonomy to be introduced over a reasonably long period . " i think there is no other solution than to find a status somewhere between wider autonomy and a programmed independence , " said bernard kouchner , former head of the un 's kosovo mission . a hot election topic the future of kosovo has figured prominently in election campaigning and may even influence how long it takes sunday 's winner to form a new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cedomir jovanovic says that kosovo is no longer serbian yet most of the players in serbian politics - ranging from the ultra-nationalist radical party to kostunica 's democratic party of serbia and serbian president boris tadic 's democratic party - seem to agree in principle that kosovo should not become an independent country . the most notable exception is a coalition lead by the liberal democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- . " we have to accept the reality , " said ldp president and former student leader cedomir jovanovic , " and the reality is that kosovo has been independent from belgrade since 1999 . " ldp , however , is a small player on the serbian political scene and , according to some polls , may barely win the 5 percent of votes necessary to enter the parliament . time is running out if a solution to kosovo 's status is not found in the nearest future , the tensions that have regularly surfaced in kosovo over the last seven years could mount again . the worst case was in march 2004 , when several days of anti-serb riots left 19 people dead , thousands more homeless , and dozens of serbian orthodox monasteries and churches destroyed or damaged . responsibility for kosovo 's future security will fall mostly into the hands of the 27-nation european union . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned sunday that stability in the balkans depended on how the future status of kosovo is resolved and said the eu will work to ensure peace in the serbian province .

" it is important to be as inclusive as possible with russia , although that does not necessarily mean as comprehensive as possible , " an eu diplomat said , according to afp news service . russia is a long-time ally of serbia and both believe that not enough time has been given to talks on how much autonomy kosovo should win , which started almost a year ago but were halted in october for lack of progress . kosovo albanians insist they will accept nothing short of independence , but belgrade is offering only " broad autonomy , " saying it would never accept secession . eu foreign policy chief javier solana " has been in touch with all levels in russia " including president vladimir putin , another eu official told afp , also on condition of anonymity . " we are doing as much as possible to ensure that this period , which is not going to be easy , is developing as smoothly as possible , " she said . making the deal acceptable to belgrade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian prime minister kostunica says no country would willingly give up a part of its territory reports quoting a serbian government statement said that putin had promised to veto any initiative in the un security council which belgrade rejects during a telephone call with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica . kosovo , defined by serbia 's constitution as an integral part of its territory , has been run by the united nations since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign ended a crackdown by belgrade on separatist ethnic albanians there . un envoy martti ahtisaari had been expected to make proposals on kosovo 's future status late last year , but he has pushed back publication of his recommendations until after elections in serbia on sunday . to accommodate russia , the eu has offered its support to a proposal of new talks in vienna , perhaps in march , between kosovo and serbian authorities and led by ahtisaari . " this engagement can be very positive , " the eu official said . the talks could run anywhere from two weeks to a month . irreconcilable differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the differences between serbs and kosovo albanians may be impossible to bridge according to an international crisis group expert , they would address russia 's concerns but at the same time demonstrate publicly that the parties are too far apart for their differences to be resolved soon . " this is an attempt to get around what is likely to be a significant blockage at the security council , " said kosovo-based analyst for the think tank alexander anderson . despite albanian cries for full independence and serbia 's refusal to offer anything more than autonomy , experts say that ahtisaari 's proposals will most likely involve a broad , non-specific formula that the united nations will tease out into a clearer degree of autonomy to be introduced over a reasonably long period . " i think there is no other solution than to find a status somewhere between wider autonomy and a programmed independence , " said bernard kouchner , former head of the un 's kosovo mission . a hot election topic the future of kosovo has figured prominently in election campaigning and may even influence how long it takes sunday 's winner to form a new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cedomir jovanovic says that kosovo is no longer serbian yet most of the players in serbian politics - ranging from the ultra-nationalist radical party to kostunica 's democratic party of serbia and serbian president boris tadic 's democratic party - seem to agree in principle that kosovo should not become an independent country . the most notable exception is a coalition lead by the liberal democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- . " we have to accept the reality , " said ldp president and former student leader cedomir jovanovic , " and the reality is that kosovo has been independent from belgrade since 1999 . " ldp , however , is a small player on the serbian political scene and , according to some polls , may barely win the 5 percent of votes necessary to enter the parliament . time is running out if a solution to kosovo 's status is not found in the nearest future , the tensions that have regularly surfaced in kosovo over the last seven years could mount again . the worst case was in march 2004 , when several days of anti-serb riots left 19 people dead , thousands more homeless , and dozens of serbian orthodox monasteries and churches destroyed or damaged . responsibility for kosovo 's future security will fall mostly into the hands of the 27-nation european union . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned sunday that stability in the balkans depended on how the future status of kosovo is resolved and said the eu will work to ensure peace in the serbian province .

she stressed the need for progress on an eu constitution but also the fight against religious extremism . ahead of the address , eu watchers were most curious about what the german chancellor would propose to end the stalemate over the bloc 's proposed constitution , which failed to pass national referenda in france and the netherlands last year .
but merkel began her speech by stressing diversity as a core european value , saying the eu had to be vigorous in defending its freedoms . " tolerance , " merkel said in one of the speech 's central lines , " is the soul of europe . "
among the liberties in need of protection , she cited freedom to voice opinions that upset others , freedom to believe or not to believe in religion and freedom of artistic expression . " europe , " she said , " should never have the slightest understanding for intolerance , for violence by right-or left-wing extremists or violence carried out in the name of a religion . " " tolerance , " she added , " digs its own grave , if it does not defend itself against intolerance . " such remarks could hardly have failed to remind listeners of the threat of islamist terrorism as well as last year 's controversy over danish caricatures depicting the prophet mohammed , which some muslims found offensive . " failure would be a historic mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes for more harmony among eu member states merkel promised to present a plan to end the deadlock over the eu constitution by the end of germany 's presidency this june .
but she did not specify what form a proposed solution might take , other than to say that the bloc needed " clear descriptions about the authority of the eu and of the national states . " eighteen member states have ratified the constitution , and eu experts think that germany will negotiate with the remaining nine about what would have be removed from the treaty for it to be passed , preferably without national referenda . merkel called for the issue to be resolved before the next eu parliamentary elections in 2009 , warning that failure to do so would be " a historic mistake . "
she also stressed the need for the eu to have a foreign minister . " the time for deliberation is over , " she said .
" we have to reach new decisions . " closer ties to the us and less bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting the bloc 's bloated bureaucracy will be one of merkel 's main tasks merkel said the eu needed to cooperate more with the us on the issue of climate change in the efforts to achieve a global environmental treat by the year 2012 . " access to energy and protecting the climate , " she said , " are two challenges affecting all of humanity in our age . " she also said the bloc should strength its economic ties with the us .
america , she said , was still the eu 's most important trading partner , adding " a common trans-atlantic is very much in european interests . " in addition , merkel stressed the need to get rid of bureaucracy , saying it was crucial to creating jobs - an issue very much on people 's minds here in germany . " one thing is certain , " she said , " a slow-paced , bureaucratic and quarrelling europe will not be able to cope with the tasks that have to be dealt with .

politicians , pop stars and artists coming out of the closet hardly raise eyebrows in germany .
but it 's an entirely different ballgame on the soccer field , where being openly gay remains strictly taboo . german professional soccer has n't seen a gay player to date .
at least not officially .
that is n't because there are n't any , but because they 've decided keeping their sexuality hidden is preferable to the career-ending scorn , ridicule and even physical danger they would face if they came out of the closet . that was the bottom line of a cover story by the popular german soccer magazine rund last month which interviewed players who kept their homosexuality tightly under wraps . " soccer is still unbelievably backward when it comes to homosexuality .
gays on the pitch remain a huge taboo , " said rainer schäfer , chief editor at rund , who spent two years researching the topic and winning the trust of two gay players in the two highest german soccer leagues .
they eventually agreed to tell their stories provided they remained anonymous . creating a ' normal ' image both spoke of going to great lengths to hide their sexuality from their clubs , managers and teammates and living in constant fear of being discovered . one player , who is married , said even his wife had no idea he was gay and that he was involved in a long-term relationship with a childhood friend .
" but what am i to do ?
coming out would mean death , " he was quoted as saying in the article . the other gay player profiled said that a female friend in the know often accompanied him to club celebrations and parties to give the impression that he was straight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supermodel heidi klum added some glamour to the world cup last year clubs also sometimes step in if gay rumors persistently circulate around a player .
they usually enlist pr agencies to create a " normal " heterosexual image for the player , which includes parading hired models and kids around the players during publicity events . " constructing a fake identity and an elaborate web of lies takes a heavy toll on the players and does n't make it easier for them to focus on their game , " said schäfer , who added he was taken aback by how widespread homophobia continued to be in the soccer world . germany , in fact , is considered fairly liberal regarding gay rights .
same-sex unions are legal here and it 's not unusual to see high-profile personalities open about their sexuality .
berlin 's mayor , for example , is gay and appears at functions with his partner . macho attitudes though there are no figures on the number of gay players in germany , tatjana eggeling from the institute of cultural anthropology and european ethnology at the university of göttingen said she estimated there were about 30 in the top two leagues . that guess is based on statistics that say around 5 to 10 percent of the adult population in germany is gay or lesbian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rough and tumble soccer only for tough virile men , goes a cliche eggeling added that a combination of macho attitudes and prejudices is to blame for the enduring gay taboo in soccer . " sport is one of the most conservative fields in society .
it 's still dominated by men and 19th century values such as honor and bravery as male virtues , " said eggeling .
" soccer does n't allow you to be different . " she pointed out that being homosexual was often equated in sport with being effeminate and weak - a view that is perpetuated in soccer clubs with players calling their colleagues " pansy " or " fag " the moment they show any weakness . learning from britain ? apart from the straights-only attitude within clubs , some say homophobia in stadiums - in the form of chanting and jeering - remains a problem that has n't been taken seriously in germany by either the clubs or the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justin fashanu played for norwich , nottingham forests and hearts many point to britain as an example of a country that has taken steps to address the problem .
in 2001 , the football association - four years after the suicide of britain 's only openly gay player , justin fashanu - changed its charter , which imposed penalties for sexually discriminatory behavior .
recently two norwich city fans were sentenced to time in jail for violating those rules . but a spokesman for the dfb who declined to be named said the german association 's charter did not penalize sexually discriminatory behavior and said he did not see why it needed to . some say it 's this refusal by the authorities to even acknowledge there is a problem that makes it difficult for gay players to come out of the closet .
things are made worse by straight players often refusing to acknowledge publicly that they have gay teammates . " it would be a big help if heterosexual players would stand up and say ' i have a gay colleague on the team and he plays great soccer , that 's it , " ' said eggeling . " as things stand now , i would n't advise a single german soccer player to come out because it would be just too much of a risk for him , both for his career and personal life , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corny littmann is the only openly gay figure in the german soccer world corny littmann , president of hamburg 's st. pauli club and the only openly gay figure on germany 's soccer circuit , told german news agency dpa last year he did not expect any player to come out anytime soon . " if one did come out , there would be a media frenzy .
i do n't know how a 20- or 25-year-old would handle it , " littmann said , adding the player would be the target of abuse both on and off the pitch .
" being gay just frightens people . " " soccer is everything , even gay " so far even the handful of gay and lesbian fan clubs attached to the bundesliga has been unable to put an end to homophobic behavior in stadiums . gerd eiserbeck , a member of hertha junxx - the first gay and lesbian bundesliga fan club in germany - said that though their debut in 2001 had initially led to some " verbal confrontation " between ostensibly straight hertha bsc fans and gay fans , they were now largely accepted .
even their rainbow-colored banner reading " soccer is everything , even gay , " is tolerated in berlin 's olympia stadium , said eiserbeck . " but we still do n't travel to away games , " he said .
" that 's too risky because we do n't know how the opposing fans will react . " more discussion needed despite the odds , some believe that pushing the topic into the public consciousness and keeping it there will eventually create enough pressure on the dfb to deal with it . " remember that 's exactly what happened with racism .
the dfb eventually gave in to the campaigns and imposed harsh penalties for racist behavior , " said schäfer . " the same could happen with homophobia , hopefully .

politicians , pop stars and artists coming out of the closet hardly raise eyebrows in germany .
but it 's an entirely different ballgame on the soccer field , where being openly gay remains strictly taboo . german professional soccer has n't seen a gay player to date .
at least not officially .
that is n't because there are n't any , but because they 've decided keeping their sexuality hidden is preferable to the career-ending scorn , ridicule and even physical danger they would face if they came out of the closet . that was the bottom line of a cover story by the popular german soccer magazine rund last month which interviewed players who kept their homosexuality tightly under wraps . " soccer is still unbelievably backward when it comes to homosexuality .
gays on the pitch remain a huge taboo , " said rainer schäfer , chief editor at rund , who spent two years researching the topic and winning the trust of two gay players in the two highest german soccer leagues .
they eventually agreed to tell their stories provided they remained anonymous . creating a ' normal ' image both spoke of going to great lengths to hide their sexuality from their clubs , managers and teammates and living in constant fear of being discovered . one player , who is married , said even his wife had no idea he was gay and that he was involved in a long-term relationship with a childhood friend .
" but what am i to do ?
coming out would mean death , " he was quoted as saying in the article . the other gay player profiled said that a female friend in the know often accompanied him to club celebrations and parties to give the impression that he was straight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supermodel heidi klum added some glamour to the world cup last year clubs also sometimes step in if gay rumors persistently circulate around a player .
they usually enlist pr agencies to create a " normal " heterosexual image for the player , which includes parading hired models and kids around the players during publicity events . " constructing a fake identity and an elaborate web of lies takes a heavy toll on the players and does n't make it easier for them to focus on their game , " said schäfer , who added he was taken aback by how widespread homophobia continued to be in the soccer world . germany , in fact , is considered fairly liberal regarding gay rights .
same-sex unions are legal here and it 's not unusual to see high-profile personalities open about their sexuality .
berlin 's mayor , for example , is gay and appears at functions with his partner . macho attitudes though there are no figures on the number of gay players in germany , tatjana eggeling from the institute of cultural anthropology and european ethnology at the university of göttingen said she estimated there were about 30 in the top two leagues . that guess is based on statistics that say around 5 to 10 percent of the adult population in germany is gay or lesbian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rough and tumble soccer only for tough virile men , goes a cliche eggeling added that a combination of macho attitudes and prejudices is to blame for the enduring gay taboo in soccer . " sport is one of the most conservative fields in society .
it 's still dominated by men and 19th century values such as honor and bravery as male virtues , " said eggeling .
" soccer does n't allow you to be different . " she pointed out that being homosexual was often equated in sport with being effeminate and weak - a view that is perpetuated in soccer clubs with players calling their colleagues " pansy " or " fag " the moment they show any weakness . learning from britain ? apart from the straights-only attitude within clubs , some say homophobia in stadiums - in the form of chanting and jeering - remains a problem that has n't been taken seriously in germany by either the clubs or the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justin fashanu played for norwich , nottingham forests and hearts many point to britain as an example of a country that has taken steps to address the problem .
in 2001 , the football association - four years after the suicide of britain 's only openly gay player , justin fashanu - changed its charter , which imposed penalties for sexually discriminatory behavior .
recently two norwich city fans were sentenced to time in jail for violating those rules . but a spokesman for the dfb who declined to be named said the german association 's charter did not penalize sexually discriminatory behavior and said he did not see why it needed to . some say it 's this refusal by the authorities to even acknowledge there is a problem that makes it difficult for gay players to come out of the closet .
things are made worse by straight players often refusing to acknowledge publicly that they have gay teammates . " it would be a big help if heterosexual players would stand up and say ' i have a gay colleague on the team and he plays great soccer , that 's it , " ' said eggeling . " as things stand now , i would n't advise a single german soccer player to come out because it would be just too much of a risk for him , both for his career and personal life , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corny littmann is the only openly gay figure in the german soccer world corny littmann , president of hamburg 's st. pauli club and the only openly gay figure on germany 's soccer circuit , told german news agency dpa last year he did not expect any player to come out anytime soon . " if one did come out , there would be a media frenzy .
i do n't know how a 20- or 25-year-old would handle it , " littmann said , adding the player would be the target of abuse both on and off the pitch .
" being gay just frightens people . " " soccer is everything , even gay " so far even the handful of gay and lesbian fan clubs attached to the bundesliga has been unable to put an end to homophobic behavior in stadiums . gerd eiserbeck , a member of hertha junxx - the first gay and lesbian bundesliga fan club in germany - said that though their debut in 2001 had initially led to some " verbal confrontation " between ostensibly straight hertha bsc fans and gay fans , they were now largely accepted .
even their rainbow-colored banner reading " soccer is everything , even gay , " is tolerated in berlin 's olympia stadium , said eiserbeck . " but we still do n't travel to away games , " he said .
" that 's too risky because we do n't know how the opposing fans will react . " more discussion needed despite the odds , some believe that pushing the topic into the public consciousness and keeping it there will eventually create enough pressure on the dfb to deal with it . " remember that 's exactly what happened with racism .
the dfb eventually gave in to the campaigns and imposed harsh penalties for racist behavior , " said schäfer . " the same could happen with homophobia , hopefully .

coming out would mean death , " he was quoted as saying in the article . the other gay player profiled said that a female friend in the know often accompanied him to club celebrations and parties to give the impression that he was straight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supermodel heidi klum added some glamour to the world cup last year clubs also sometimes step in if gay rumors persistently circulate around a player .
they usually enlist pr agencies to create a " normal " heterosexual image for the player , which includes parading hired models and kids around the players during publicity events . " constructing a fake identity and an elaborate web of lies takes a heavy toll on the players and does n't make it easier for them to focus on their game , " said schäfer , who added he was taken aback by how widespread homophobia continued to be in the soccer world . germany , in fact , is considered fairly liberal regarding gay rights .
same-sex unions are legal here and it 's not unusual to see high-profile personalities open about their sexuality .
berlin 's mayor , for example , is gay and appears at functions with his partner . macho attitudes though there are no figures on the number of gay players in germany , tatjana eggeling from the institute of cultural anthropology and european ethnology at the university of göttingen said she estimated there were about 30 in the top two leagues . that guess is based on statistics that say around 5 to 10 percent of the adult population in germany is gay or lesbian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rough and tumble soccer only for tough virile men , goes a cliche eggeling added that a combination of macho attitudes and prejudices is to blame for the enduring gay taboo in soccer . " sport is one of the most conservative fields in society .
it 's still dominated by men and 19th century values such as honor and bravery as male virtues , " said eggeling .
" soccer does n't allow you to be different . " she pointed out that being homosexual was often equated in sport with being effeminate and weak - a view that is perpetuated in soccer clubs with players calling their colleagues " pansy " or " fag " the moment they show any weakness . learning from britain ? apart from the straights-only attitude within clubs , some say homophobia in stadiums - in the form of chanting and jeering - remains a problem that has n't been taken seriously in germany by either the clubs or the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justin fashanu played for norwich , nottingham forests and hearts many point to britain as an example of a country that has taken steps to address the problem .
in 2001 , the football association - four years after the suicide of britain 's only openly gay player , justin fashanu - changed its charter , which imposed penalties for sexually discriminatory behavior .
recently two norwich city fans were sentenced to time in jail for violating those rules . but a spokesman for the dfb who declined to be named said the german association 's charter did not penalize sexually discriminatory behavior and said he did not see why it needed to . some say it 's this refusal by the authorities to even acknowledge there is a problem that makes it difficult for gay players to come out of the closet .
things are made worse by straight players often refusing to acknowledge publicly that they have gay teammates . " it would be a big help if heterosexual players would stand up and say ' i have a gay colleague on the team and he plays great soccer , that 's it , " ' said eggeling . " as things stand now , i would n't advise a single german soccer player to come out because it would be just too much of a risk for him , both for his career and personal life , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corny littmann is the only openly gay figure in the german soccer world corny littmann , president of hamburg 's st. pauli club and the only openly gay figure on germany 's soccer circuit , told german news agency dpa last year he did not expect any player to come out anytime soon . " if one did come out , there would be a media frenzy .
i do n't know how a 20- or 25-year-old would handle it , " littmann said , adding the player would be the target of abuse both on and off the pitch .
" being gay just frightens people . " " soccer is everything , even gay " so far even the handful of gay and lesbian fan clubs attached to the bundesliga has been unable to put an end to homophobic behavior in stadiums . gerd eiserbeck , a member of hertha junxx - the first gay and lesbian bundesliga fan club in germany - said that though their debut in 2001 had initially led to some " verbal confrontation " between ostensibly straight hertha bsc fans and gay fans , they were now largely accepted .
even their rainbow-colored banner reading " soccer is everything , even gay , " is tolerated in berlin 's olympia stadium , said eiserbeck . " but we still do n't travel to away games , " he said .
" that 's too risky because we do n't know how the opposing fans will react . " more discussion needed despite the odds , some believe that pushing the topic into the public consciousness and keeping it there will eventually create enough pressure on the dfb to deal with it . " remember that 's exactly what happened with racism .
the dfb eventually gave in to the campaigns and imposed harsh penalties for racist behavior , " said schäfer . " the same could happen with homophobia , hopefully .

the two met for an initial six hours on tuesday and another one-and-a half hours on wednesday . the men declined to comment after wednesday 's meeting . " when you have six hours of conversations and you 're going to have some more ... certainly you can characterize them as useful discussions , " christopher hill told guests at an american academy event after the first round of talks . he declined to answer questions on the substance of the meeting but said he hoped the six-party talks , which collapsed in december in beijing with no discernible progress , would start again in january .
" the north koreans have to understand that they have come to a crossroads , " hill said in a speech at the american academy .
" -lrb- they -rrb- have to decide if they want nuclear weapons or if they want a place in the international community . " the berlin meetings came ahead of hill 's visits beginning friday to south korea , china and japan to continue consultations with key partners in the six-party talks on how to make progress in the next round of negotiations .
rice in berlin hill , who was also to brief us secretary of state condoleezza rice - who arrived in berlin wednesday evening - on the meetings , noted that the berlin talks were the first bilateral discussions he had held with kim outside beijing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice arrived in berlin wednesday night the two powers held landmark talks in berlin in 1999 that ultimately led to the lifting of a half-century of restrictions on trade , travel and banking against north korea after it agreed to a moratorium on missile tests .
but the crisis erupted again in 2002 . six-party negotiations involving the united states , the two koreas , japan , russia and china were suspended in late 2005 after north korea walked out in protest at us financial sanctions imposed on a macau bank accused of illicit dealings on behalf of pyongyang . the talks resumed in december last year - following the north 's oct .
9 nuclear weapons test - and ended in deadlock as pyongyang insisted the financial sanctions be lifted before it would discuss nuclear disarmament .
russia criticizes sanctions russia on wednesday called the us sanctions an obstacle to the resumption of talks and urged flexibility on both sides . " the united states should have taken some steps toward the koreans on lifting financial sanctions and discussing this question with them , " deputy foreign minister alexander losyukov , the head russian negotiator on north korea , was quoted as saying by state-run news agency ria novosti . losyukov also called on north korea to reconsider its refusal to rejoin the negotiations on account of the us sanctions .
" the link is not 100 percent justified , " he was quoted as saying . hill declined to discuss the specifics of the latest negotiations but said the sanctions over the macau bank were " a separate process from the issue of denuclearization . "
he said the other powers involved in the negotiations had a raft of economic and diplomatic incentives to convince pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons program . " we have a lot of options for dealing with it but we do n't have the option of walking away from it , " he said .
" we 'd really like to move this along as quickly as possible . "
high hopes japan and south korea welcomed the berlin talks and voiced hope for an early resumption of multilateral discussions on pyongyang 's nuclear arms program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hill -lrb- far left -rrb- and kim kye-gwan -lrb- far right -rrb- at the six-party talks in beijing " dialogue is a good thing , " japanese chief cabinet secretary yasuhisa shiozaki , the top government spokesman , told reporters .
" the berlin meeting should lay a good groundwork for an agreement on what initial steps to take to implement the september 19 statement , " south korea 's foreign minister , song min-soon , said , referring to a 2005 accord offering the north security and economic aid guarantees in return for disarmament . hill described that agreement as " a sort of bible for us " and said he hoped it would be the basis for a new agreement .
despite hill 's relatively upbeat assessment , the former us ambassador to the un , john bolton , said the six-way talks had failed and a breakthrough would only come after kim jong-il 's regime ended . " six-party talks have not worked , " he said .

" we are doing as much as possible to ensure that this period , which is not going to be easy , is developing as smoothly as possible , " she said . making the deal acceptable to belgrade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian prime minister kostunica says no country would willingly give up a part of its territory reports quoting a serbian government statement said that putin had promised to veto any initiative in the un security council which belgrade rejects during a telephone call with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica . kosovo , defined by serbia 's constitution as an integral part of its territory , has been run by the united nations since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign ended a crackdown by belgrade on separatist ethnic albanians there . un envoy martti ahtisaari had been expected to make proposals on kosovo 's future status late last year , but he has pushed back publication of his recommendations until after elections in serbia on sunday . to accommodate russia , the eu has offered its support to a proposal of new talks in vienna , perhaps in march , between kosovo and serbian authorities and led by ahtisaari . " this engagement can be very positive , " the eu official said . the talks could run anywhere from two weeks to a month . irreconcilable differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the differences between serbs and kosovo albanians may be impossible to bridge according to an international crisis group expert , they would address russia 's concerns but at the same time demonstrate publicly that the parties are too far apart for their differences to be resolved soon . " this is an attempt to get around what is likely to be a significant blockage at the security council , " said kosovo-based analyst for the think tank alexander anderson . despite albanian cries for full independence and serbia 's refusal to offer anything more than autonomy , experts say that ahtisaari 's proposals will most likely involve a broad , non-specific formula that the united nations will tease out into a clearer degree of autonomy to be introduced over a reasonably long period . " i think there is no other solution than to find a status somewhere between wider autonomy and a programmed independence , " said bernard kouchner , former head of the un 's kosovo mission . a hot election topic the future of kosovo has figured prominently in election campaigning and may even influence how long it takes sunday 's winner to form a new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cedomir jovanovic says that kosovo is no longer serbian yet most of the players in serbian politics - ranging from the ultra-nationalist radical party to kostunica 's democratic party of serbia and serbian president boris tadic 's democratic party - seem to agree in principle that kosovo should not become an independent country . the most notable exception is a coalition lead by the liberal democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- . " we have to accept the reality , " said ldp president and former student leader cedomir jovanovic , " and the reality is that kosovo has been independent from belgrade since 1999 . " ldp , however , is a small player on the serbian political scene and , according to some polls , may barely win the 5 percent of votes necessary to enter the parliament . time is running out if a solution to kosovo 's status is not found in the nearest future , the tensions that have regularly surfaced in kosovo over the last seven years could mount again . the worst case was in march 2004 , when several days of anti-serb riots left 19 people dead , thousands more homeless , and dozens of serbian orthodox monasteries and churches destroyed or damaged . responsibility for kosovo 's future security will fall mostly into the hands of the 27-nation european union . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned sunday that stability in the balkans depended on how the future status of kosovo is resolved and said the eu will work to ensure peace in the serbian province .

politicians , pop stars and artists coming out of the closet hardly raise eyebrows in germany .
but it 's an entirely different ballgame on the soccer field , where being openly gay remains strictly taboo . german professional soccer has n't seen a gay player to date .
at least not officially .
that is n't because there are n't any , but because they 've decided keeping their sexuality hidden is preferable to the career-ending scorn , ridicule and even physical danger they would face if they came out of the closet . that was the bottom line of a cover story by the popular german soccer magazine rund last month which interviewed players who kept their homosexuality tightly under wraps . " soccer is still unbelievably backward when it comes to homosexuality .
gays on the pitch remain a huge taboo , " said rainer schäfer , chief editor at rund , who spent two years researching the topic and winning the trust of two gay players in the two highest german soccer leagues .
they eventually agreed to tell their stories provided they remained anonymous . creating a ' normal ' image both spoke of going to great lengths to hide their sexuality from their clubs , managers and teammates and living in constant fear of being discovered . one player , who is married , said even his wife had no idea he was gay and that he was involved in a long-term relationship with a childhood friend .
" but what am i to do ?
coming out would mean death , " he was quoted as saying in the article . the other gay player profiled said that a female friend in the know often accompanied him to club celebrations and parties to give the impression that he was straight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supermodel heidi klum added some glamour to the world cup last year clubs also sometimes step in if gay rumors persistently circulate around a player .
they usually enlist pr agencies to create a " normal " heterosexual image for the player , which includes parading hired models and kids around the players during publicity events . " constructing a fake identity and an elaborate web of lies takes a heavy toll on the players and does n't make it easier for them to focus on their game , " said schäfer , who added he was taken aback by how widespread homophobia continued to be in the soccer world . germany , in fact , is considered fairly liberal regarding gay rights .
same-sex unions are legal here and it 's not unusual to see high-profile personalities open about their sexuality .
berlin 's mayor , for example , is gay and appears at functions with his partner . macho attitudes though there are no figures on the number of gay players in germany , tatjana eggeling from the institute of cultural anthropology and european ethnology at the university of göttingen said she estimated there were about 30 in the top two leagues . that guess is based on statistics that say around 5 to 10 percent of the adult population in germany is gay or lesbian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rough and tumble soccer only for tough virile men , goes a cliche eggeling added that a combination of macho attitudes and prejudices is to blame for the enduring gay taboo in soccer . " sport is one of the most conservative fields in society .
it 's still dominated by men and 19th century values such as honor and bravery as male virtues , " said eggeling .
" soccer does n't allow you to be different . " she pointed out that being homosexual was often equated in sport with being effeminate and weak - a view that is perpetuated in soccer clubs with players calling their colleagues " pansy " or " fag " the moment they show any weakness . learning from britain ? apart from the straights-only attitude within clubs , some say homophobia in stadiums - in the form of chanting and jeering - remains a problem that has n't been taken seriously in germany by either the clubs or the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justin fashanu played for norwich , nottingham forests and hearts many point to britain as an example of a country that has taken steps to address the problem .
in 2001 , the football association - four years after the suicide of britain 's only openly gay player , justin fashanu - changed its charter , which imposed penalties for sexually discriminatory behavior .
recently two norwich city fans were sentenced to time in jail for violating those rules . but a spokesman for the dfb who declined to be named said the german association 's charter did not penalize sexually discriminatory behavior and said he did not see why it needed to . some say it 's this refusal by the authorities to even acknowledge there is a problem that makes it difficult for gay players to come out of the closet .
things are made worse by straight players often refusing to acknowledge publicly that they have gay teammates . " it would be a big help if heterosexual players would stand up and say ' i have a gay colleague on the team and he plays great soccer , that 's it , " ' said eggeling . " as things stand now , i would n't advise a single german soccer player to come out because it would be just too much of a risk for him , both for his career and personal life , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corny littmann is the only openly gay figure in the german soccer world corny littmann , president of hamburg 's st. pauli club and the only openly gay figure on germany 's soccer circuit , told german news agency dpa last year he did not expect any player to come out anytime soon . " if one did come out , there would be a media frenzy .
i do n't know how a 20- or 25-year-old would handle it , " littmann said , adding the player would be the target of abuse both on and off the pitch .
" being gay just frightens people . " " soccer is everything , even gay " so far even the handful of gay and lesbian fan clubs attached to the bundesliga has been unable to put an end to homophobic behavior in stadiums . gerd eiserbeck , a member of hertha junxx - the first gay and lesbian bundesliga fan club in germany - said that though their debut in 2001 had initially led to some " verbal confrontation " between ostensibly straight hertha bsc fans and gay fans , they were now largely accepted .
even their rainbow-colored banner reading " soccer is everything , even gay , " is tolerated in berlin 's olympia stadium , said eiserbeck . " but we still do n't travel to away games , " he said .
" that 's too risky because we do n't know how the opposing fans will react . " more discussion needed despite the odds , some believe that pushing the topic into the public consciousness and keeping it there will eventually create enough pressure on the dfb to deal with it . " remember that 's exactly what happened with racism .
the dfb eventually gave in to the campaigns and imposed harsh penalties for racist behavior , " said schäfer . " the same could happen with homophobia , hopefully .

the two met for an initial six hours on tuesday and another one-and-a half hours on wednesday . the men declined to comment after wednesday 's meeting . " when you have six hours of conversations and you 're going to have some more ... certainly you can characterize them as useful discussions , " christopher hill told guests at an american academy event after the first round of talks . he declined to answer questions on the substance of the meeting but said he hoped the six-party talks , which collapsed in december in beijing with no discernible progress , would start again in january .
" the north koreans have to understand that they have come to a crossroads , " hill said in a speech at the american academy .
" -lrb- they -rrb- have to decide if they want nuclear weapons or if they want a place in the international community . " the berlin meetings came ahead of hill 's visits beginning friday to south korea , china and japan to continue consultations with key partners in the six-party talks on how to make progress in the next round of negotiations .

" the link is not 100 percent justified , " he was quoted as saying . hill declined to discuss the specifics of the latest negotiations but said the sanctions over the macau bank were " a separate process from the issue of denuclearization . "
he said the other powers involved in the negotiations had a raft of economic and diplomatic incentives to convince pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons program . " we have a lot of options for dealing with it but we do n't have the option of walking away from it , " he said .

" the north koreans have to understand that they have come to a crossroads , " hill said in a speech at the american academy .
" -lrb- they -rrb- have to decide if they want nuclear weapons or if they want a place in the international community .

" the link is not 100 percent justified , " he was quoted as saying . hill declined to discuss the specifics of the latest negotiations but said the sanctions over the macau bank were " a separate process from the issue of denuclearization . "
he said the other powers involved in the negotiations had a raft of economic and diplomatic incentives to convince pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons program . " we have a lot of options for dealing with it but we do n't have the option of walking away from it , " he said .

politicians , pop stars and artists coming out of the closet hardly raise eyebrows in germany .
but it 's an entirely different ballgame on the soccer field , where being openly gay remains strictly taboo . german professional soccer has n't seen a gay player to date .
at least not officially .
that is n't because there are n't any , but because they 've decided keeping their sexuality hidden is preferable to the career-ending scorn , ridicule and even physical danger they would face if they came out of the closet . that was the bottom line of a cover story by the popular german soccer magazine rund last month which interviewed players who kept their homosexuality tightly under wraps . " soccer is still unbelievably backward when it comes to homosexuality .
gays on the pitch remain a huge taboo , " said rainer schäfer , chief editor at rund , who spent two years researching the topic and winning the trust of two gay players in the two highest german soccer leagues .
they eventually agreed to tell their stories provided they remained anonymous . creating a ' normal ' image both spoke of going to great lengths to hide their sexuality from their clubs , managers and teammates and living in constant fear of being discovered . one player , who is married , said even his wife had no idea he was gay and that he was involved in a long-term relationship with a childhood friend .
" but what am i to do ?
coming out would mean death , " he was quoted as saying in the article . the other gay player profiled said that a female friend in the know often accompanied him to club celebrations and parties to give the impression that he was straight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supermodel heidi klum added some glamour to the world cup last year clubs also sometimes step in if gay rumors persistently circulate around a player .
they usually enlist pr agencies to create a " normal " heterosexual image for the player , which includes parading hired models and kids around the players during publicity events . " constructing a fake identity and an elaborate web of lies takes a heavy toll on the players and does n't make it easier for them to focus on their game , " said schäfer , who added he was taken aback by how widespread homophobia continued to be in the soccer world . germany , in fact , is considered fairly liberal regarding gay rights .
same-sex unions are legal here and it 's not unusual to see high-profile personalities open about their sexuality .
berlin 's mayor , for example , is gay and appears at functions with his partner . macho attitudes though there are no figures on the number of gay players in germany , tatjana eggeling from the institute of cultural anthropology and european ethnology at the university of göttingen said she estimated there were about 30 in the top two leagues . that guess is based on statistics that say around 5 to 10 percent of the adult population in germany is gay or lesbian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rough and tumble soccer only for tough virile men , goes a cliche eggeling added that a combination of macho attitudes and prejudices is to blame for the enduring gay taboo in soccer . " sport is one of the most conservative fields in society .
it 's still dominated by men and 19th century values such as honor and bravery as male virtues , " said eggeling .
" soccer does n't allow you to be different . " she pointed out that being homosexual was often equated in sport with being effeminate and weak - a view that is perpetuated in soccer clubs with players calling their colleagues " pansy " or " fag " the moment they show any weakness . learning from britain ? apart from the straights-only attitude within clubs , some say homophobia in stadiums - in the form of chanting and jeering - remains a problem that has n't been taken seriously in germany by either the clubs or the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justin fashanu played for norwich , nottingham forests and hearts many point to britain as an example of a country that has taken steps to address the problem .
in 2001 , the football association - four years after the suicide of britain 's only openly gay player , justin fashanu - changed its charter , which imposed penalties for sexually discriminatory behavior .
recently two norwich city fans were sentenced to time in jail for violating those rules . but a spokesman for the dfb who declined to be named said the german association 's charter did not penalize sexually discriminatory behavior and said he did not see why it needed to . some say it 's this refusal by the authorities to even acknowledge there is a problem that makes it difficult for gay players to come out of the closet .
things are made worse by straight players often refusing to acknowledge publicly that they have gay teammates . " it would be a big help if heterosexual players would stand up and say ' i have a gay colleague on the team and he plays great soccer , that 's it , " ' said eggeling . " as things stand now , i would n't advise a single german soccer player to come out because it would be just too much of a risk for him , both for his career and personal life , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corny littmann is the only openly gay figure in the german soccer world corny littmann , president of hamburg 's st. pauli club and the only openly gay figure on germany 's soccer circuit , told german news agency dpa last year he did not expect any player to come out anytime soon . " if one did come out , there would be a media frenzy .
i do n't know how a 20- or 25-year-old would handle it , " littmann said , adding the player would be the target of abuse both on and off the pitch .
" being gay just frightens people . " " soccer is everything , even gay " so far even the handful of gay and lesbian fan clubs attached to the bundesliga has been unable to put an end to homophobic behavior in stadiums . gerd eiserbeck , a member of hertha junxx - the first gay and lesbian bundesliga fan club in germany - said that though their debut in 2001 had initially led to some " verbal confrontation " between ostensibly straight hertha bsc fans and gay fans , they were now largely accepted .
even their rainbow-colored banner reading " soccer is everything , even gay , " is tolerated in berlin 's olympia stadium , said eiserbeck . " but we still do n't travel to away games , " he said .
" that 's too risky because we do n't know how the opposing fans will react . " more discussion needed despite the odds , some believe that pushing the topic into the public consciousness and keeping it there will eventually create enough pressure on the dfb to deal with it . " remember that 's exactly what happened with racism .
the dfb eventually gave in to the campaigns and imposed harsh penalties for racist behavior , " said schäfer . " the same could happen with homophobia , hopefully .

they eventually agreed to tell their stories provided they remained anonymous . creating a ' normal ' image both spoke of going to great lengths to hide their sexuality from their clubs , managers and teammates and living in constant fear of being discovered . one player , who is married , said even his wife had no idea he was gay and that he was involved in a long-term relationship with a childhood friend .
" but what am i to do ?
coming out would mean death , " he was quoted as saying in the article . the other gay player profiled said that a female friend in the know often accompanied him to club celebrations and parties to give the impression that he was straight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supermodel heidi klum added some glamour to the world cup last year clubs also sometimes step in if gay rumors persistently circulate around a player .
they usually enlist pr agencies to create a " normal " heterosexual image for the player , which includes parading hired models and kids around the players during publicity events . " constructing a fake identity and an elaborate web of lies takes a heavy toll on the players and does n't make it easier for them to focus on their game , " said schäfer , who added he was taken aback by how widespread homophobia continued to be in the soccer world . germany , in fact , is considered fairly liberal regarding gay rights .
same-sex unions are legal here and it 's not unusual to see high-profile personalities open about their sexuality .
berlin 's mayor , for example , is gay and appears at functions with his partner . macho attitudes though there are no figures on the number of gay players in germany , tatjana eggeling from the institute of cultural anthropology and european ethnology at the university of göttingen said she estimated there were about 30 in the top two leagues . that guess is based on statistics that say around 5 to 10 percent of the adult population in germany is gay or lesbian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rough and tumble soccer only for tough virile men , goes a cliche eggeling added that a combination of macho attitudes and prejudices is to blame for the enduring gay taboo in soccer . " sport is one of the most conservative fields in society .
it 's still dominated by men and 19th century values such as honor and bravery as male virtues , " said eggeling .
" soccer does n't allow you to be different . " she pointed out that being homosexual was often equated in sport with being effeminate and weak - a view that is perpetuated in soccer clubs with players calling their colleagues " pansy " or " fag " the moment they show any weakness . learning from britain ? apart from the straights-only attitude within clubs , some say homophobia in stadiums - in the form of chanting and jeering - remains a problem that has n't been taken seriously in germany by either the clubs or the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justin fashanu played for norwich , nottingham forests and hearts many point to britain as an example of a country that has taken steps to address the problem .
in 2001 , the football association - four years after the suicide of britain 's only openly gay player , justin fashanu - changed its charter , which imposed penalties for sexually discriminatory behavior .
recently two norwich city fans were sentenced to time in jail for violating those rules . but a spokesman for the dfb who declined to be named said the german association 's charter did not penalize sexually discriminatory behavior and said he did not see why it needed to . some say it 's this refusal by the authorities to even acknowledge there is a problem that makes it difficult for gay players to come out of the closet .
things are made worse by straight players often refusing to acknowledge publicly that they have gay teammates . " it would be a big help if heterosexual players would stand up and say ' i have a gay colleague on the team and he plays great soccer , that 's it , " ' said eggeling . " as things stand now , i would n't advise a single german soccer player to come out because it would be just too much of a risk for him , both for his career and personal life , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corny littmann is the only openly gay figure in the german soccer world corny littmann , president of hamburg 's st. pauli club and the only openly gay figure on germany 's soccer circuit , told german news agency dpa last year he did not expect any player to come out anytime soon . " if one did come out , there would be a media frenzy .
i do n't know how a 20- or 25-year-old would handle it , " littmann said , adding the player would be the target of abuse both on and off the pitch .
" being gay just frightens people . " " soccer is everything , even gay " so far even the handful of gay and lesbian fan clubs attached to the bundesliga has been unable to put an end to homophobic behavior in stadiums . gerd eiserbeck , a member of hertha junxx - the first gay and lesbian bundesliga fan club in germany - said that though their debut in 2001 had initially led to some " verbal confrontation " between ostensibly straight hertha bsc fans and gay fans , they were now largely accepted .
even their rainbow-colored banner reading " soccer is everything , even gay , " is tolerated in berlin 's olympia stadium , said eiserbeck . " but we still do n't travel to away games , " he said .
" that 's too risky because we do n't know how the opposing fans will react . " more discussion needed despite the odds , some believe that pushing the topic into the public consciousness and keeping it there will eventually create enough pressure on the dfb to deal with it .

politicians , pop stars and artists coming out of the closet hardly raise eyebrows in germany .
but it 's an entirely different ballgame on the soccer field , where being openly gay remains strictly taboo . german professional soccer has n't seen a gay player to date .
at least not officially .
that is n't because there are n't any , but because they 've decided keeping their sexuality hidden is preferable to the career-ending scorn , ridicule and even physical danger they would face if they came out of the closet . that was the bottom line of a cover story by the popular german soccer magazine rund last month which interviewed players who kept their homosexuality tightly under wraps . " soccer is still unbelievably backward when it comes to homosexuality .
gays on the pitch remain a huge taboo , " said rainer schäfer , chief editor at rund , who spent two years researching the topic and winning the trust of two gay players in the two highest german soccer leagues .
they eventually agreed to tell their stories provided they remained anonymous . creating a ' normal ' image both spoke of going to great lengths to hide their sexuality from their clubs , managers and teammates and living in constant fear of being discovered . one player , who is married , said even his wife had no idea he was gay and that he was involved in a long-term relationship with a childhood friend .
" but what am i to do ?
coming out would mean death , " he was quoted as saying in the article . the other gay player profiled said that a female friend in the know often accompanied him to club celebrations and parties to give the impression that he was straight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supermodel heidi klum added some glamour to the world cup last year clubs also sometimes step in if gay rumors persistently circulate around a player .
they usually enlist pr agencies to create a " normal " heterosexual image for the player , which includes parading hired models and kids around the players during publicity events . " constructing a fake identity and an elaborate web of lies takes a heavy toll on the players and does n't make it easier for them to focus on their game , " said schäfer , who added he was taken aback by how widespread homophobia continued to be in the soccer world . germany , in fact , is considered fairly liberal regarding gay rights .
same-sex unions are legal here and it 's not unusual to see high-profile personalities open about their sexuality .
berlin 's mayor , for example , is gay and appears at functions with his partner . macho attitudes though there are no figures on the number of gay players in germany , tatjana eggeling from the institute of cultural anthropology and european ethnology at the university of göttingen said she estimated there were about 30 in the top two leagues . that guess is based on statistics that say around 5 to 10 percent of the adult population in germany is gay or lesbian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rough and tumble soccer only for tough virile men , goes a cliche eggeling added that a combination of macho attitudes and prejudices is to blame for the enduring gay taboo in soccer . " sport is one of the most conservative fields in society .
it 's still dominated by men and 19th century values such as honor and bravery as male virtues , " said eggeling .
" soccer does n't allow you to be different . " she pointed out that being homosexual was often equated in sport with being effeminate and weak - a view that is perpetuated in soccer clubs with players calling their colleagues " pansy " or " fag " the moment they show any weakness . learning from britain ? apart from the straights-only attitude within clubs , some say homophobia in stadiums - in the form of chanting and jeering - remains a problem that has n't been taken seriously in germany by either the clubs or the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justin fashanu played for norwich , nottingham forests and hearts many point to britain as an example of a country that has taken steps to address the problem .

she stressed the need for progress on an eu constitution but also the fight against religious extremism . ahead of the address , eu watchers were most curious about what the german chancellor would propose to end the stalemate over the bloc 's proposed constitution , which failed to pass national referenda in france and the netherlands last year .
but merkel began her speech by stressing diversity as a core european value , saying the eu had to be vigorous in defending its freedoms . " tolerance , " merkel said in one of the speech 's central lines , " is the soul of europe . "
among the liberties in need of protection , she cited freedom to voice opinions that upset others , freedom to believe or not to believe in religion and freedom of artistic expression . " europe , " she said , " should never have the slightest understanding for intolerance , for violence by right-or left-wing extremists or violence carried out in the name of a religion . " " tolerance , " she added , " digs its own grave , if it does not defend itself against intolerance . " such remarks could hardly have failed to remind listeners of the threat of islamist terrorism as well as last year 's controversy over danish caricatures depicting the prophet mohammed , which some muslims found offensive . " failure would be a historic mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes for more harmony among eu member states merkel promised to present a plan to end the deadlock over the eu constitution by the end of germany 's presidency this june .
but she did not specify what form a proposed solution might take , other than to say that the bloc needed " clear descriptions about the authority of the eu and of the national states . " eighteen member states have ratified the constitution , and eu experts think that germany will negotiate with the remaining nine about what would have be removed from the treaty for it to be passed , preferably without national referenda . merkel called for the issue to be resolved before the next eu parliamentary elections in 2009 , warning that failure to do so would be " a historic mistake . "
she also stressed the need for the eu to have a foreign minister . " the time for deliberation is over , " she said .
" we have to reach new decisions . " closer ties to the us and less bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting the bloc 's bloated bureaucracy will be one of merkel 's main tasks merkel said the eu needed to cooperate more with the us on the issue of climate change in the efforts to achieve a global environmental treat by the year 2012 . " access to energy and protecting the climate , " she said , " are two challenges affecting all of humanity in our age . " she also said the bloc should strength its economic ties with the us .
america , she said , was still the eu 's most important trading partner , adding " a common trans-atlantic is very much in european interests . " in addition , merkel stressed the need to get rid of bureaucracy , saying it was crucial to creating jobs - an issue very much on people 's minds here in germany . " one thing is certain , " she said , " a slow-paced , bureaucratic and quarrelling europe will not be able to cope with the tasks that have to be dealt with .

she stressed the need for progress on an eu constitution but also the fight against religious extremism . ahead of the address , eu watchers were most curious about what the german chancellor would propose to end the stalemate over the bloc 's proposed constitution , which failed to pass national referenda in france and the netherlands last year .
but merkel began her speech by stressing diversity as a core european value , saying the eu had to be vigorous in defending its freedoms . " tolerance , " merkel said in one of the speech 's central lines , " is the soul of europe . "
among the liberties in need of protection , she cited freedom to voice opinions that upset others , freedom to believe or not to believe in religion and freedom of artistic expression . " europe , " she said , " should never have the slightest understanding for intolerance , for violence by right-or left-wing extremists or violence carried out in the name of a religion . " " tolerance , " she added , " digs its own grave , if it does not defend itself against intolerance .

" failure would be a historic mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes for more harmony among eu member states merkel promised to present a plan to end the deadlock over the eu constitution by the end of germany 's presidency this june .
but she did not specify what form a proposed solution might take , other than to say that the bloc needed " clear descriptions about the authority of the eu and of the national states . " eighteen member states have ratified the constitution , and eu experts think that germany will negotiate with the remaining nine about what would have be removed from the treaty for it to be passed , preferably without national referenda . merkel called for the issue to be resolved before the next eu parliamentary elections in 2009 , warning that failure to do so would be " a historic mistake . "
she also stressed the need for the eu to have a foreign minister . " the time for deliberation is over , " she said .
" we have to reach new decisions .

" access to energy and protecting the climate , " she said , " are two challenges affecting all of humanity in our age . " she also said the bloc should strength its economic ties with the us .
america , she said , was still the eu 's most important trading partner , adding " a common trans-atlantic is very much in european interests . " in addition , merkel stressed the need to get rid of bureaucracy , saying it was crucial to creating jobs - an issue very much on people 's minds here in germany .

" when you have six hours of conversations and you 're going to have some more ... certainly you can characterize them as useful discussions , " christopher hill told guests at an american academy event after the first round of talks . he declined to answer questions on the substance of the meeting but said he hoped the six-party talks , which collapsed in december in beijing with no discernible progress , would start again in january .
" the north koreans have to understand that they have come to a crossroads , " hill said in a speech at the american academy .
" -lrb- they -rrb- have to decide if they want nuclear weapons or if they want a place in the international community . " the berlin meetings came ahead of hill 's visits beginning friday to south korea , china and japan to continue consultations with key partners in the six-party talks on how to make progress in the next round of negotiations .
rice in berlin hill , who was also to brief us secretary of state condoleezza rice - who arrived in berlin wednesday evening - on the meetings , noted that the berlin talks were the first bilateral discussions he had held with kim outside beijing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice arrived in berlin wednesday night the two powers held landmark talks in berlin in 1999 that ultimately led to the lifting of a half-century of restrictions on trade , travel and banking against north korea after it agreed to a moratorium on missile tests .
but the crisis erupted again in 2002 . six-party negotiations involving the united states , the two koreas , japan , russia and china were suspended in late 2005 after north korea walked out in protest at us financial sanctions imposed on a macau bank accused of illicit dealings on behalf of pyongyang . the talks resumed in december last year - following the north 's oct .
9 nuclear weapons test - and ended in deadlock as pyongyang insisted the financial sanctions be lifted before it would discuss nuclear disarmament .
russia criticizes sanctions russia on wednesday called the us sanctions an obstacle to the resumption of talks and urged flexibility on both sides . " the united states should have taken some steps toward the koreans on lifting financial sanctions and discussing this question with them , " deputy foreign minister alexander losyukov , the head russian negotiator on north korea , was quoted as saying by state-run news agency ria novosti . losyukov also called on north korea to reconsider its refusal to rejoin the negotiations on account of the us sanctions .
" the link is not 100 percent justified , " he was quoted as saying . hill declined to discuss the specifics of the latest negotiations but said the sanctions over the macau bank were " a separate process from the issue of denuclearization . "
he said the other powers involved in the negotiations had a raft of economic and diplomatic incentives to convince pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons program . " we have a lot of options for dealing with it but we do n't have the option of walking away from it , " he said .
" we 'd really like to move this along as quickly as possible . "
high hopes japan and south korea welcomed the berlin talks and voiced hope for an early resumption of multilateral discussions on pyongyang 's nuclear arms program .

" the berlin meeting should lay a good groundwork for an agreement on what initial steps to take to implement the september 19 statement , " south korea 's foreign minister , song min-soon , said , referring to a 2005 accord offering the north security and economic aid guarantees in return for disarmament . hill described that agreement as " a sort of bible for us " and said he hoped it would be the basis for a new agreement .
despite hill 's relatively upbeat assessment , the former us ambassador to the un , john bolton , said the six-way talks had failed and a breakthrough would only come after kim jong-il 's regime ended . " six-party talks have not worked , " he said .
" they are not likely to work .

she stressed the need for progress on an eu constitution but also the fight against religious extremism . ahead of the address , eu watchers were most curious about what the german chancellor would propose to end the stalemate over the bloc 's proposed constitution , which failed to pass national referenda in france and the netherlands last year .
but merkel began her speech by stressing diversity as a core european value , saying the eu had to be vigorous in defending its freedoms . " tolerance , " merkel said in one of the speech 's central lines , " is the soul of europe . "
among the liberties in need of protection , she cited freedom to voice opinions that upset others , freedom to believe or not to believe in religion and freedom of artistic expression . " europe , " she said , " should never have the slightest understanding for intolerance , for violence by right-or left-wing extremists or violence carried out in the name of a religion . " " tolerance , " she added , " digs its own grave , if it does not defend itself against intolerance . " such remarks could hardly have failed to remind listeners of the threat of islamist terrorism as well as last year 's controversy over danish caricatures depicting the prophet mohammed , which some muslims found offensive . " failure would be a historic mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes for more harmony among eu member states merkel promised to present a plan to end the deadlock over the eu constitution by the end of germany 's presidency this june .
but she did not specify what form a proposed solution might take , other than to say that the bloc needed " clear descriptions about the authority of the eu and of the national states . " eighteen member states have ratified the constitution , and eu experts think that germany will negotiate with the remaining nine about what would have be removed from the treaty for it to be passed , preferably without national referenda . merkel called for the issue to be resolved before the next eu parliamentary elections in 2009 , warning that failure to do so would be " a historic mistake . "
she also stressed the need for the eu to have a foreign minister . " the time for deliberation is over , " she said .
" we have to reach new decisions . " closer ties to the us and less bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting the bloc 's bloated bureaucracy will be one of merkel 's main tasks merkel said the eu needed to cooperate more with the us on the issue of climate change in the efforts to achieve a global environmental treat by the year 2012 . " access to energy and protecting the climate , " she said , " are two challenges affecting all of humanity in our age . " she also said the bloc should strength its economic ties with the us .
america , she said , was still the eu 's most important trading partner , adding " a common trans-atlantic is very much in european interests . " in addition , merkel stressed the need to get rid of bureaucracy , saying it was crucial to creating jobs - an issue very much on people 's minds here in germany . " one thing is certain , " she said , " a slow-paced , bureaucratic and quarrelling europe will not be able to cope with the tasks that have to be dealt with .

" it is important to be as inclusive as possible with russia , although that does not necessarily mean as comprehensive as possible , " an eu diplomat said , according to afp news service . russia is a long-time ally of serbia and both believe that not enough time has been given to talks on how much autonomy kosovo should win , which started almost a year ago but were halted in october for lack of progress . kosovo albanians insist they will accept nothing short of independence , but belgrade is offering only " broad autonomy , " saying it would never accept secession . eu foreign policy chief javier solana " has been in touch with all levels in russia " including president vladimir putin , another eu official told afp , also on condition of anonymity .

the two met for an initial six hours on tuesday and another one-and-a half hours on wednesday . the men declined to comment after wednesday 's meeting . " when you have six hours of conversations and you 're going to have some more ... certainly you can characterize them as useful discussions , " christopher hill told guests at an american academy event after the first round of talks . he declined to answer questions on the substance of the meeting but said he hoped the six-party talks , which collapsed in december in beijing with no discernible progress , would start again in january .

" the link is not 100 percent justified , " he was quoted as saying . hill declined to discuss the specifics of the latest negotiations but said the sanctions over the macau bank were " a separate process from the issue of denuclearization . "
he said the other powers involved in the negotiations had a raft of economic and diplomatic incentives to convince pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons program . " we have a lot of options for dealing with it but we do n't have the option of walking away from it , " he said .

the two met for an initial six hours on tuesday and another one-and-a half hours on wednesday . the men declined to comment after wednesday 's meeting . " when you have six hours of conversations and you 're going to have some more ... certainly you can characterize them as useful discussions , " christopher hill told guests at an american academy event after the first round of talks . he declined to answer questions on the substance of the meeting but said he hoped the six-party talks , which collapsed in december in beijing with no discernible progress , would start again in january .
" the north koreans have to understand that they have come to a crossroads , " hill said in a speech at the american academy .
" -lrb- they -rrb- have to decide if they want nuclear weapons or if they want a place in the international community . " the berlin meetings came ahead of hill 's visits beginning friday to south korea , china and japan to continue consultations with key partners in the six-party talks on how to make progress in the next round of negotiations .
rice in berlin hill , who was also to brief us secretary of state condoleezza rice - who arrived in berlin wednesday evening - on the meetings , noted that the berlin talks were the first bilateral discussions he had held with kim outside beijing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice arrived in berlin wednesday night the two powers held landmark talks in berlin in 1999 that ultimately led to the lifting of a half-century of restrictions on trade , travel and banking against north korea after it agreed to a moratorium on missile tests .
but the crisis erupted again in 2002 . six-party negotiations involving the united states , the two koreas , japan , russia and china were suspended in late 2005 after north korea walked out in protest at us financial sanctions imposed on a macau bank accused of illicit dealings on behalf of pyongyang . the talks resumed in december last year - following the north 's oct .
9 nuclear weapons test - and ended in deadlock as pyongyang insisted the financial sanctions be lifted before it would discuss nuclear disarmament .
russia criticizes sanctions russia on wednesday called the us sanctions an obstacle to the resumption of talks and urged flexibility on both sides . " the united states should have taken some steps toward the koreans on lifting financial sanctions and discussing this question with them , " deputy foreign minister alexander losyukov , the head russian negotiator on north korea , was quoted as saying by state-run news agency ria novosti . losyukov also called on north korea to reconsider its refusal to rejoin the negotiations on account of the us sanctions .
" the link is not 100 percent justified , " he was quoted as saying . hill declined to discuss the specifics of the latest negotiations but said the sanctions over the macau bank were " a separate process from the issue of denuclearization . "
he said the other powers involved in the negotiations had a raft of economic and diplomatic incentives to convince pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons program . " we have a lot of options for dealing with it but we do n't have the option of walking away from it , " he said .
" we 'd really like to move this along as quickly as possible . "
high hopes japan and south korea welcomed the berlin talks and voiced hope for an early resumption of multilateral discussions on pyongyang 's nuclear arms program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hill -lrb- far left -rrb- and kim kye-gwan -lrb- far right -rrb- at the six-party talks in beijing " dialogue is a good thing , " japanese chief cabinet secretary yasuhisa shiozaki , the top government spokesman , told reporters .
" the berlin meeting should lay a good groundwork for an agreement on what initial steps to take to implement the september 19 statement , " south korea 's foreign minister , song min-soon , said , referring to a 2005 accord offering the north security and economic aid guarantees in return for disarmament . hill described that agreement as " a sort of bible for us " and said he hoped it would be the basis for a new agreement .

she stressed the need for progress on an eu constitution but also the fight against religious extremism . ahead of the address , eu watchers were most curious about what the german chancellor would propose to end the stalemate over the bloc 's proposed constitution , which failed to pass national referenda in france and the netherlands last year .

among the liberties in need of protection , she cited freedom to voice opinions that upset others , freedom to believe or not to believe in religion and freedom of artistic expression . " europe , " she said , " should never have the slightest understanding for intolerance , for violence by right-or left-wing extremists or violence carried out in the name of a religion .

" eighteen member states have ratified the constitution , and eu experts think that germany will negotiate with the remaining nine about what would have be removed from the treaty for it to be passed , preferably without national referenda . merkel called for the issue to be resolved before the next eu parliamentary elections in 2009 , warning that failure to do so would be " a historic mistake .

" such remarks could hardly have failed to remind listeners of the threat of islamist terrorism as well as last year 's controversy over danish caricatures depicting the prophet mohammed , which some muslims found offensive . " failure would be a historic mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes for more harmony among eu member states merkel promised to present a plan to end the deadlock over the eu constitution by the end of germany 's presidency this june .
but she did not specify what form a proposed solution might take , other than to say that the bloc needed " clear descriptions about the authority of the eu and of the national states . " eighteen member states have ratified the constitution , and eu experts think that germany will negotiate with the remaining nine about what would have be removed from the treaty for it to be passed , preferably without national referenda . merkel called for the issue to be resolved before the next eu parliamentary elections in 2009 , warning that failure to do so would be " a historic mistake . "
she also stressed the need for the eu to have a foreign minister . " the time for deliberation is over , " she said .
" we have to reach new decisions . " closer ties to the us and less bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting the bloc 's bloated bureaucracy will be one of merkel 's main tasks merkel said the eu needed to cooperate more with the us on the issue of climate change in the efforts to achieve a global environmental treat by the year 2012 . " access to energy and protecting the climate , " she said , " are two challenges affecting all of humanity in our age . " she also said the bloc should strength its economic ties with the us .
america , she said , was still the eu 's most important trading partner , adding " a common trans-atlantic is very much in european interests . " in addition , merkel stressed the need to get rid of bureaucracy , saying it was crucial to creating jobs - an issue very much on people 's minds here in germany .

she stressed the need for progress on an eu constitution but also the fight against religious extremism . ahead of the address , eu watchers were most curious about what the german chancellor would propose to end the stalemate over the bloc 's proposed constitution , which failed to pass national referenda in france and the netherlands last year .
but merkel began her speech by stressing diversity as a core european value , saying the eu had to be vigorous in defending its freedoms . " tolerance , " merkel said in one of the speech 's central lines , " is the soul of europe . "
among the liberties in need of protection , she cited freedom to voice opinions that upset others , freedom to believe or not to believe in religion and freedom of artistic expression . " europe , " she said , " should never have the slightest understanding for intolerance , for violence by right-or left-wing extremists or violence carried out in the name of a religion . " " tolerance , " she added , " digs its own grave , if it does not defend itself against intolerance .

the two met for an initial six hours on tuesday and another one-and-a half hours on wednesday . the men declined to comment after wednesday 's meeting . " when you have six hours of conversations and you 're going to have some more ... certainly you can characterize them as useful discussions , " christopher hill told guests at an american academy event after the first round of talks . he declined to answer questions on the substance of the meeting but said he hoped the six-party talks , which collapsed in december in beijing with no discernible progress , would start again in january .
" the north koreans have to understand that they have come to a crossroads , " hill said in a speech at the american academy .
" -lrb- they -rrb- have to decide if they want nuclear weapons or if they want a place in the international community . " the berlin meetings came ahead of hill 's visits beginning friday to south korea , china and japan to continue consultations with key partners in the six-party talks on how to make progress in the next round of negotiations .
rice in berlin hill , who was also to brief us secretary of state condoleezza rice - who arrived in berlin wednesday evening - on the meetings , noted that the berlin talks were the first bilateral discussions he had held with kim outside beijing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice arrived in berlin wednesday night the two powers held landmark talks in berlin in 1999 that ultimately led to the lifting of a half-century of restrictions on trade , travel and banking against north korea after it agreed to a moratorium on missile tests .
but the crisis erupted again in 2002 . six-party negotiations involving the united states , the two koreas , japan , russia and china were suspended in late 2005 after north korea walked out in protest at us financial sanctions imposed on a macau bank accused of illicit dealings on behalf of pyongyang . the talks resumed in december last year - following the north 's oct .
9 nuclear weapons test - and ended in deadlock as pyongyang insisted the financial sanctions be lifted before it would discuss nuclear disarmament .
russia criticizes sanctions russia on wednesday called the us sanctions an obstacle to the resumption of talks and urged flexibility on both sides . " the united states should have taken some steps toward the koreans on lifting financial sanctions and discussing this question with them , " deputy foreign minister alexander losyukov , the head russian negotiator on north korea , was quoted as saying by state-run news agency ria novosti . losyukov also called on north korea to reconsider its refusal to rejoin the negotiations on account of the us sanctions .
" the link is not 100 percent justified , " he was quoted as saying . hill declined to discuss the specifics of the latest negotiations but said the sanctions over the macau bank were " a separate process from the issue of denuclearization . "
he said the other powers involved in the negotiations had a raft of economic and diplomatic incentives to convince pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons program . " we have a lot of options for dealing with it but we do n't have the option of walking away from it , " he said .
" we 'd really like to move this along as quickly as possible . "
high hopes japan and south korea welcomed the berlin talks and voiced hope for an early resumption of multilateral discussions on pyongyang 's nuclear arms program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hill -lrb- far left -rrb- and kim kye-gwan -lrb- far right -rrb- at the six-party talks in beijing " dialogue is a good thing , " japanese chief cabinet secretary yasuhisa shiozaki , the top government spokesman , told reporters .
" the berlin meeting should lay a good groundwork for an agreement on what initial steps to take to implement the september 19 statement , " south korea 's foreign minister , song min-soon , said , referring to a 2005 accord offering the north security and economic aid guarantees in return for disarmament . hill described that agreement as " a sort of bible for us " and said he hoped it would be the basis for a new agreement .
despite hill 's relatively upbeat assessment , the former us ambassador to the un , john bolton , said the six-way talks had failed and a breakthrough would only come after kim jong-il 's regime ended . " six-party talks have not worked , " he said .

the two met for an initial six hours on tuesday and another one-and-a half hours on wednesday . the men declined to comment after wednesday 's meeting . " when you have six hours of conversations and you 're going to have some more ... certainly you can characterize them as useful discussions , " christopher hill told guests at an american academy event after the first round of talks . he declined to answer questions on the substance of the meeting but said he hoped the six-party talks , which collapsed in december in beijing with no discernible progress , would start again in january .
" the north koreans have to understand that they have come to a crossroads , " hill said in a speech at the american academy .
" -lrb- they -rrb- have to decide if they want nuclear weapons or if they want a place in the international community . " the berlin meetings came ahead of hill 's visits beginning friday to south korea , china and japan to continue consultations with key partners in the six-party talks on how to make progress in the next round of negotiations .
rice in berlin hill , who was also to brief us secretary of state condoleezza rice - who arrived in berlin wednesday evening - on the meetings , noted that the berlin talks were the first bilateral discussions he had held with kim outside beijing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice arrived in berlin wednesday night the two powers held landmark talks in berlin in 1999 that ultimately led to the lifting of a half-century of restrictions on trade , travel and banking against north korea after it agreed to a moratorium on missile tests .
but the crisis erupted again in 2002 . six-party negotiations involving the united states , the two koreas , japan , russia and china were suspended in late 2005 after north korea walked out in protest at us financial sanctions imposed on a macau bank accused of illicit dealings on behalf of pyongyang . the talks resumed in december last year - following the north 's oct .
9 nuclear weapons test - and ended in deadlock as pyongyang insisted the financial sanctions be lifted before it would discuss nuclear disarmament .
russia criticizes sanctions russia on wednesday called the us sanctions an obstacle to the resumption of talks and urged flexibility on both sides . " the united states should have taken some steps toward the koreans on lifting financial sanctions and discussing this question with them , " deputy foreign minister alexander losyukov , the head russian negotiator on north korea , was quoted as saying by state-run news agency ria novosti . losyukov also called on north korea to reconsider its refusal to rejoin the negotiations on account of the us sanctions .
" the link is not 100 percent justified , " he was quoted as saying . hill declined to discuss the specifics of the latest negotiations but said the sanctions over the macau bank were " a separate process from the issue of denuclearization . "
he said the other powers involved in the negotiations had a raft of economic and diplomatic incentives to convince pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons program . " we have a lot of options for dealing with it but we do n't have the option of walking away from it , " he said .
" we 'd really like to move this along as quickly as possible . "
high hopes japan and south korea welcomed the berlin talks and voiced hope for an early resumption of multilateral discussions on pyongyang 's nuclear arms program .

despite hill 's relatively upbeat assessment , the former us ambassador to the un , john bolton , said the six-way talks had failed and a breakthrough would only come after kim jong-il 's regime ended . " six-party talks have not worked , " he said .

" the united states should have taken some steps toward the koreans on lifting financial sanctions and discussing this question with them , " deputy foreign minister alexander losyukov , the head russian negotiator on north korea , was quoted as saying by state-run news agency ria novosti . losyukov also called on north korea to reconsider its refusal to rejoin the negotiations on account of the us sanctions .
" the link is not 100 percent justified , " he was quoted as saying . hill declined to discuss the specifics of the latest negotiations but said the sanctions over the macau bank were " a separate process from the issue of denuclearization . "
he said the other powers involved in the negotiations had a raft of economic and diplomatic incentives to convince pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons program . " we have a lot of options for dealing with it but we do n't have the option of walking away from it , " he said .
" we 'd really like to move this along as quickly as possible . "
high hopes japan and south korea welcomed the berlin talks and voiced hope for an early resumption of multilateral discussions on pyongyang 's nuclear arms program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hill -lrb- far left -rrb- and kim kye-gwan -lrb- far right -rrb- at the six-party talks in beijing " dialogue is a good thing , " japanese chief cabinet secretary yasuhisa shiozaki , the top government spokesman , told reporters .
" the berlin meeting should lay a good groundwork for an agreement on what initial steps to take to implement the september 19 statement , " south korea 's foreign minister , song min-soon , said , referring to a 2005 accord offering the north security and economic aid guarantees in return for disarmament . hill described that agreement as " a sort of bible for us " and said he hoped it would be the basis for a new agreement .
despite hill 's relatively upbeat assessment , the former us ambassador to the un , john bolton , said the six-way talks had failed and a breakthrough would only come after kim jong-il 's regime ended . " six-party talks have not worked , " he said .

she stressed the need for progress on an eu constitution but also the fight against religious extremism . ahead of the address , eu watchers were most curious about what the german chancellor would propose to end the stalemate over the bloc 's proposed constitution , which failed to pass national referenda in france and the netherlands last year .
but merkel began her speech by stressing diversity as a core european value , saying the eu had to be vigorous in defending its freedoms . " tolerance , " merkel said in one of the speech 's central lines , " is the soul of europe . "
among the liberties in need of protection , she cited freedom to voice opinions that upset others , freedom to believe or not to believe in religion and freedom of artistic expression . " europe , " she said , " should never have the slightest understanding for intolerance , for violence by right-or left-wing extremists or violence carried out in the name of a religion . " " tolerance , " she added , " digs its own grave , if it does not defend itself against intolerance . " such remarks could hardly have failed to remind listeners of the threat of islamist terrorism as well as last year 's controversy over danish caricatures depicting the prophet mohammed , which some muslims found offensive . " failure would be a historic mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes for more harmony among eu member states merkel promised to present a plan to end the deadlock over the eu constitution by the end of germany 's presidency this june .
but she did not specify what form a proposed solution might take , other than to say that the bloc needed " clear descriptions about the authority of the eu and of the national states . " eighteen member states have ratified the constitution , and eu experts think that germany will negotiate with the remaining nine about what would have be removed from the treaty for it to be passed , preferably without national referenda . merkel called for the issue to be resolved before the next eu parliamentary elections in 2009 , warning that failure to do so would be " a historic mistake . "
she also stressed the need for the eu to have a foreign minister . " the time for deliberation is over , " she said .
" we have to reach new decisions . " closer ties to the us and less bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting the bloc 's bloated bureaucracy will be one of merkel 's main tasks merkel said the eu needed to cooperate more with the us on the issue of climate change in the efforts to achieve a global environmental treat by the year 2012 . " access to energy and protecting the climate , " she said , " are two challenges affecting all of humanity in our age . " she also said the bloc should strength its economic ties with the us .
america , she said , was still the eu 's most important trading partner , adding " a common trans-atlantic is very much in european interests . " in addition , merkel stressed the need to get rid of bureaucracy , saying it was crucial to creating jobs - an issue very much on people 's minds here in germany . " one thing is certain , " she said , " a slow-paced , bureaucratic and quarrelling europe will not be able to cope with the tasks that have to be dealt with .

" it is important to be as inclusive as possible with russia , although that does not necessarily mean as comprehensive as possible , " an eu diplomat said , according to afp news service . russia is a long-time ally of serbia and both believe that not enough time has been given to talks on how much autonomy kosovo should win , which started almost a year ago but were halted in october for lack of progress . kosovo albanians insist they will accept nothing short of independence , but belgrade is offering only " broad autonomy , " saying it would never accept secession . eu foreign policy chief javier solana " has been in touch with all levels in russia " including president vladimir putin , another eu official told afp , also on condition of anonymity . " we are doing as much as possible to ensure that this period , which is not going to be easy , is developing as smoothly as possible , " she said . making the deal acceptable to belgrade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian prime minister kostunica says no country would willingly give up a part of its territory reports quoting a serbian government statement said that putin had promised to veto any initiative in the un security council which belgrade rejects during a telephone call with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica . kosovo , defined by serbia 's constitution as an integral part of its territory , has been run by the united nations since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign ended a crackdown by belgrade on separatist ethnic albanians there . un envoy martti ahtisaari had been expected to make proposals on kosovo 's future status late last year , but he has pushed back publication of his recommendations until after elections in serbia on sunday . to accommodate russia , the eu has offered its support to a proposal of new talks in vienna , perhaps in march , between kosovo and serbian authorities and led by ahtisaari . " this engagement can be very positive , " the eu official said . the talks could run anywhere from two weeks to a month . irreconcilable differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the differences between serbs and kosovo albanians may be impossible to bridge according to an international crisis group expert , they would address russia 's concerns but at the same time demonstrate publicly that the parties are too far apart for their differences to be resolved soon . " this is an attempt to get around what is likely to be a significant blockage at the security council , " said kosovo-based analyst for the think tank alexander anderson . despite albanian cries for full independence and serbia 's refusal to offer anything more than autonomy , experts say that ahtisaari 's proposals will most likely involve a broad , non-specific formula that the united nations will tease out into a clearer degree of autonomy to be introduced over a reasonably long period . " i think there is no other solution than to find a status somewhere between wider autonomy and a programmed independence , " said bernard kouchner , former head of the un 's kosovo mission . a hot election topic the future of kosovo has figured prominently in election campaigning and may even influence how long it takes sunday 's winner to form a new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cedomir jovanovic says that kosovo is no longer serbian yet most of the players in serbian politics - ranging from the ultra-nationalist radical party to kostunica 's democratic party of serbia and serbian president boris tadic 's democratic party - seem to agree in principle that kosovo should not become an independent country . the most notable exception is a coalition lead by the liberal democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- . " we have to accept the reality , " said ldp president and former student leader cedomir jovanovic , " and the reality is that kosovo has been independent from belgrade since 1999 . " ldp , however , is a small player on the serbian political scene and , according to some polls , may barely win the 5 percent of votes necessary to enter the parliament . time is running out if a solution to kosovo 's status is not found in the nearest future , the tensions that have regularly surfaced in kosovo over the last seven years could mount again . the worst case was in march 2004 , when several days of anti-serb riots left 19 people dead , thousands more homeless , and dozens of serbian orthodox monasteries and churches destroyed or damaged . responsibility for kosovo 's future security will fall mostly into the hands of the 27-nation european union . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned sunday that stability in the balkans depended on how the future status of kosovo is resolved and said the eu will work to ensure peace in the serbian province .

she stressed the need for progress on an eu constitution but also the fight against religious extremism . ahead of the address , eu watchers were most curious about what the german chancellor would propose to end the stalemate over the bloc 's proposed constitution , which failed to pass national referenda in france and the netherlands last year .
but merkel began her speech by stressing diversity as a core european value , saying the eu had to be vigorous in defending its freedoms . " tolerance , " merkel said in one of the speech 's central lines , " is the soul of europe . "
among the liberties in need of protection , she cited freedom to voice opinions that upset others , freedom to believe or not to believe in religion and freedom of artistic expression . " europe , " she said , " should never have the slightest understanding for intolerance , for violence by right-or left-wing extremists or violence carried out in the name of a religion . " " tolerance , " she added , " digs its own grave , if it does not defend itself against intolerance . " such remarks could hardly have failed to remind listeners of the threat of islamist terrorism as well as last year 's controversy over danish caricatures depicting the prophet mohammed , which some muslims found offensive . " failure would be a historic mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes for more harmony among eu member states merkel promised to present a plan to end the deadlock over the eu constitution by the end of germany 's presidency this june .
but she did not specify what form a proposed solution might take , other than to say that the bloc needed " clear descriptions about the authority of the eu and of the national states . " eighteen member states have ratified the constitution , and eu experts think that germany will negotiate with the remaining nine about what would have be removed from the treaty for it to be passed , preferably without national referenda . merkel called for the issue to be resolved before the next eu parliamentary elections in 2009 , warning that failure to do so would be " a historic mistake . "
she also stressed the need for the eu to have a foreign minister . " the time for deliberation is over , " she said .
" we have to reach new decisions . " closer ties to the us and less bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting the bloc 's bloated bureaucracy will be one of merkel 's main tasks merkel said the eu needed to cooperate more with the us on the issue of climate change in the efforts to achieve a global environmental treat by the year 2012 . " access to energy and protecting the climate , " she said , " are two challenges affecting all of humanity in our age . " she also said the bloc should strength its economic ties with the us .
america , she said , was still the eu 's most important trading partner , adding " a common trans-atlantic is very much in european interests . " in addition , merkel stressed the need to get rid of bureaucracy , saying it was crucial to creating jobs - an issue very much on people 's minds here in germany . " one thing is certain , " she said , " a slow-paced , bureaucratic and quarrelling europe will not be able to cope with the tasks that have to be dealt with .

he could now get off with a fine and a suspended sentence . once one of the country 's most respected managers , hartz , 65 , was accused of sanctioning illegal bonuses while director of volkswagen 's human resources department .
the payments were allegedly used to finance lavish foreign trips , mainly by the head of the company 's works council , klaus volkert , and his south american mistress .
other charges relate to visits to brothels and sex parties financed with company funds . hartz , who played a key role in drafting germany 's labor and social welfare reforms under former chancellor gerhard schröder , left the company in july 2005 .
he admitted in october to " a criminal responsibility for giving preferential treatment to the former works council head .

but it quickly widened to include claims that vw paid for so-called pleasure trips for work council members to win their allegiance .
this included allegations about flying around high-class prostitutes . the charges against hartz came after an 18-month investigation , which has also seen the indictment of hans-juergen uhl , a former member of the works council , who is also a member of parliament in berlin . uhl , who represents the co-governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , has been indicted on two counts of being an accessory to fraud and five counts of making false statements under oath . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus volkert volkert was arrested last year because of concerns about the suppression of evidence , but released after two months . the former works council chief is alleged to have been paid illegal bonuses worth 1.9 million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- by hartz between 1994 and 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 17.01.2007 germany 's gay soccer players stuck firmly in the closet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how about tough , talented and gay ?
politicians , pop stars and artists coming out of the closet hardly raise eyebrows in germany .
but it 's an entirely different ballgame on the soccer field , where being openly gay remains strictly taboo . german professional soccer has n't seen a gay player to date .
at least not officially .
that is n't because there are n't any , but because they 've decided keeping their sexuality hidden is preferable to the career-ending scorn , ridicule and even physical danger they would face if they came out of the closet . that was the bottom line of a cover story by the popular german soccer magazine rund last month which interviewed players who kept their homosexuality tightly under wraps . " soccer is still unbelievably backward when it comes to homosexuality .
gays on the pitch remain a huge taboo , " said rainer schäfer , chief editor at rund , who spent two years researching the topic and winning the trust of two gay players in the two highest german soccer leagues .
they eventually agreed to tell their stories provided they remained anonymous . creating a ' normal ' image both spoke of going to great lengths to hide their sexuality from their clubs , managers and teammates and living in constant fear of being discovered . one player , who is married , said even his wife had no idea he was gay and that he was involved in a long-term relationship with a childhood friend .
" but what am i to do ?
coming out would mean death , " he was quoted as saying in the article . the other gay player profiled said that a female friend in the know often accompanied him to club celebrations and parties to give the impression that he was straight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supermodel heidi klum added some glamour to the world cup last year clubs also sometimes step in if gay rumors persistently circulate around a player .
they usually enlist pr agencies to create a " normal " heterosexual image for the player , which includes parading hired models and kids around the players during publicity events . " constructing a fake identity and an elaborate web of lies takes a heavy toll on the players and does n't make it easier for them to focus on their game , " said schäfer , who added he was taken aback by how widespread homophobia continued to be in the soccer world . germany , in fact , is considered fairly liberal regarding gay rights .
same-sex unions are legal here and it 's not unusual to see high-profile personalities open about their sexuality .
berlin 's mayor , for example , is gay and appears at functions with his partner . macho attitudes though there are no figures on the number of gay players in germany , tatjana eggeling from the institute of cultural anthropology and european ethnology at the university of göttingen said she estimated there were about 30 in the top two leagues . that guess is based on statistics that say around 5 to 10 percent of the adult population in germany is gay or lesbian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rough and tumble soccer only for tough virile men , goes a cliche eggeling added that a combination of macho attitudes and prejudices is to blame for the enduring gay taboo in soccer . " sport is one of the most conservative fields in society .
it 's still dominated by men and 19th century values such as honor and bravery as male virtues , " said eggeling .
" soccer does n't allow you to be different . " she pointed out that being homosexual was often equated in sport with being effeminate and weak - a view that is perpetuated in soccer clubs with players calling their colleagues " pansy " or " fag " the moment they show any weakness . learning from britain ? apart from the straights-only attitude within clubs , some say homophobia in stadiums - in the form of chanting and jeering - remains a problem that has n't been taken seriously in germany by either the clubs or the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justin fashanu played for norwich , nottingham forests and hearts many point to britain as an example of a country that has taken steps to address the problem .
in 2001 , the football association - four years after the suicide of britain 's only openly gay player , justin fashanu - changed its charter , which imposed penalties for sexually discriminatory behavior .
recently two norwich city fans were sentenced to time in jail for violating those rules . but a spokesman for the dfb who declined to be named said the german association 's charter did not penalize sexually discriminatory behavior and said he did not see why it needed to . some say it 's this refusal by the authorities to even acknowledge there is a problem that makes it difficult for gay players to come out of the closet .
things are made worse by straight players often refusing to acknowledge publicly that they have gay teammates . " it would be a big help if heterosexual players would stand up and say ' i have a gay colleague on the team and he plays great soccer , that 's it , " ' said eggeling . " as things stand now , i would n't advise a single german soccer player to come out because it would be just too much of a risk for him , both for his career and personal life , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corny littmann is the only openly gay figure in the german soccer world corny littmann , president of hamburg 's st. pauli club and the only openly gay figure on germany 's soccer circuit , told german news agency dpa last year he did not expect any player to come out anytime soon . " if one did come out , there would be a media frenzy .

politicians , pop stars and artists coming out of the closet hardly raise eyebrows in germany .
but it 's an entirely different ballgame on the soccer field , where being openly gay remains strictly taboo . german professional soccer has n't seen a gay player to date .
at least not officially .
that is n't because there are n't any , but because they 've decided keeping their sexuality hidden is preferable to the career-ending scorn , ridicule and even physical danger they would face if they came out of the closet . that was the bottom line of a cover story by the popular german soccer magazine rund last month which interviewed players who kept their homosexuality tightly under wraps . " soccer is still unbelievably backward when it comes to homosexuality .
gays on the pitch remain a huge taboo , " said rainer schäfer , chief editor at rund , who spent two years researching the topic and winning the trust of two gay players in the two highest german soccer leagues .
they eventually agreed to tell their stories provided they remained anonymous . creating a ' normal ' image both spoke of going to great lengths to hide their sexuality from their clubs , managers and teammates and living in constant fear of being discovered . one player , who is married , said even his wife had no idea he was gay and that he was involved in a long-term relationship with a childhood friend .
" but what am i to do ?
coming out would mean death , " he was quoted as saying in the article . the other gay player profiled said that a female friend in the know often accompanied him to club celebrations and parties to give the impression that he was straight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supermodel heidi klum added some glamour to the world cup last year clubs also sometimes step in if gay rumors persistently circulate around a player .
they usually enlist pr agencies to create a " normal " heterosexual image for the player , which includes parading hired models and kids around the players during publicity events . " constructing a fake identity and an elaborate web of lies takes a heavy toll on the players and does n't make it easier for them to focus on their game , " said schäfer , who added he was taken aback by how widespread homophobia continued to be in the soccer world . germany , in fact , is considered fairly liberal regarding gay rights .
same-sex unions are legal here and it 's not unusual to see high-profile personalities open about their sexuality .
berlin 's mayor , for example , is gay and appears at functions with his partner . macho attitudes though there are no figures on the number of gay players in germany , tatjana eggeling from the institute of cultural anthropology and european ethnology at the university of göttingen said she estimated there were about 30 in the top two leagues . that guess is based on statistics that say around 5 to 10 percent of the adult population in germany is gay or lesbian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rough and tumble soccer only for tough virile men , goes a cliche eggeling added that a combination of macho attitudes and prejudices is to blame for the enduring gay taboo in soccer . " sport is one of the most conservative fields in society .
it 's still dominated by men and 19th century values such as honor and bravery as male virtues , " said eggeling .
" soccer does n't allow you to be different . " she pointed out that being homosexual was often equated in sport with being effeminate and weak - a view that is perpetuated in soccer clubs with players calling their colleagues " pansy " or " fag " the moment they show any weakness . learning from britain ? apart from the straights-only attitude within clubs , some say homophobia in stadiums - in the form of chanting and jeering - remains a problem that has n't been taken seriously in germany by either the clubs or the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justin fashanu played for norwich , nottingham forests and hearts many point to britain as an example of a country that has taken steps to address the problem .
in 2001 , the football association - four years after the suicide of britain 's only openly gay player , justin fashanu - changed its charter , which imposed penalties for sexually discriminatory behavior .
recently two norwich city fans were sentenced to time in jail for violating those rules . but a spokesman for the dfb who declined to be named said the german association 's charter did not penalize sexually discriminatory behavior and said he did not see why it needed to . some say it 's this refusal by the authorities to even acknowledge there is a problem that makes it difficult for gay players to come out of the closet .
things are made worse by straight players often refusing to acknowledge publicly that they have gay teammates . " it would be a big help if heterosexual players would stand up and say ' i have a gay colleague on the team and he plays great soccer , that 's it , " ' said eggeling . " as things stand now , i would n't advise a single german soccer player to come out because it would be just too much of a risk for him , both for his career and personal life , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corny littmann is the only openly gay figure in the german soccer world corny littmann , president of hamburg 's st. pauli club and the only openly gay figure on germany 's soccer circuit , told german news agency dpa last year he did not expect any player to come out anytime soon . " if one did come out , there would be a media frenzy .

politicians , pop stars and artists coming out of the closet hardly raise eyebrows in germany .
but it 's an entirely different ballgame on the soccer field , where being openly gay remains strictly taboo . german professional soccer has n't seen a gay player to date .
at least not officially .
that is n't because there are n't any , but because they 've decided keeping their sexuality hidden is preferable to the career-ending scorn , ridicule and even physical danger they would face if they came out of the closet . that was the bottom line of a cover story by the popular german soccer magazine rund last month which interviewed players who kept their homosexuality tightly under wraps . " soccer is still unbelievably backward when it comes to homosexuality .
gays on the pitch remain a huge taboo , " said rainer schäfer , chief editor at rund , who spent two years researching the topic and winning the trust of two gay players in the two highest german soccer leagues .
they eventually agreed to tell their stories provided they remained anonymous . creating a ' normal ' image both spoke of going to great lengths to hide their sexuality from their clubs , managers and teammates and living in constant fear of being discovered . one player , who is married , said even his wife had no idea he was gay and that he was involved in a long-term relationship with a childhood friend .
" but what am i to do ?
coming out would mean death , " he was quoted as saying in the article . the other gay player profiled said that a female friend in the know often accompanied him to club celebrations and parties to give the impression that he was straight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supermodel heidi klum added some glamour to the world cup last year clubs also sometimes step in if gay rumors persistently circulate around a player .
they usually enlist pr agencies to create a " normal " heterosexual image for the player , which includes parading hired models and kids around the players during publicity events . " constructing a fake identity and an elaborate web of lies takes a heavy toll on the players and does n't make it easier for them to focus on their game , " said schäfer , who added he was taken aback by how widespread homophobia continued to be in the soccer world . germany , in fact , is considered fairly liberal regarding gay rights .
same-sex unions are legal here and it 's not unusual to see high-profile personalities open about their sexuality .
berlin 's mayor , for example , is gay and appears at functions with his partner . macho attitudes though there are no figures on the number of gay players in germany , tatjana eggeling from the institute of cultural anthropology and european ethnology at the university of göttingen said she estimated there were about 30 in the top two leagues . that guess is based on statistics that say around 5 to 10 percent of the adult population in germany is gay or lesbian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rough and tumble soccer only for tough virile men , goes a cliche eggeling added that a combination of macho attitudes and prejudices is to blame for the enduring gay taboo in soccer . " sport is one of the most conservative fields in society .
it 's still dominated by men and 19th century values such as honor and bravery as male virtues , " said eggeling .
" soccer does n't allow you to be different . " she pointed out that being homosexual was often equated in sport with being effeminate and weak - a view that is perpetuated in soccer clubs with players calling their colleagues " pansy " or " fag " the moment they show any weakness . learning from britain ? apart from the straights-only attitude within clubs , some say homophobia in stadiums - in the form of chanting and jeering - remains a problem that has n't been taken seriously in germany by either the clubs or the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justin fashanu played for norwich , nottingham forests and hearts many point to britain as an example of a country that has taken steps to address the problem .
in 2001 , the football association - four years after the suicide of britain 's only openly gay player , justin fashanu - changed its charter , which imposed penalties for sexually discriminatory behavior .
recently two norwich city fans were sentenced to time in jail for violating those rules . but a spokesman for the dfb who declined to be named said the german association 's charter did not penalize sexually discriminatory behavior and said he did not see why it needed to . some say it 's this refusal by the authorities to even acknowledge there is a problem that makes it difficult for gay players to come out of the closet .
things are made worse by straight players often refusing to acknowledge publicly that they have gay teammates . " it would be a big help if heterosexual players would stand up and say ' i have a gay colleague on the team and he plays great soccer , that 's it , " ' said eggeling . " as things stand now , i would n't advise a single german soccer player to come out because it would be just too much of a risk for him , both for his career and personal life , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corny littmann is the only openly gay figure in the german soccer world corny littmann , president of hamburg 's st. pauli club and the only openly gay figure on germany 's soccer circuit , told german news agency dpa last year he did not expect any player to come out anytime soon . " if one did come out , there would be a media frenzy .
i do n't know how a 20- or 25-year-old would handle it , " littmann said , adding the player would be the target of abuse both on and off the pitch .
" being gay just frightens people . " " soccer is everything , even gay " so far even the handful of gay and lesbian fan clubs attached to the bundesliga has been unable to put an end to homophobic behavior in stadiums . gerd eiserbeck , a member of hertha junxx - the first gay and lesbian bundesliga fan club in germany - said that though their debut in 2001 had initially led to some " verbal confrontation " between ostensibly straight hertha bsc fans and gay fans , they were now largely accepted .
even their rainbow-colored banner reading " soccer is everything , even gay , " is tolerated in berlin 's olympia stadium , said eiserbeck . " but we still do n't travel to away games , " he said .
" that 's too risky because we do n't know how the opposing fans will react . " more discussion needed despite the odds , some believe that pushing the topic into the public consciousness and keeping it there will eventually create enough pressure on the dfb to deal with it .

he could now get off with a fine and a suspended sentence . once one of the country 's most respected managers , hartz , 65 , was accused of sanctioning illegal bonuses while director of volkswagen 's human resources department .
the payments were allegedly used to finance lavish foreign trips , mainly by the head of the company 's works council , klaus volkert , and his south american mistress .
other charges relate to visits to brothels and sex parties financed with company funds . hartz , who played a key role in drafting germany 's labor and social welfare reforms under former chancellor gerhard schröder , left the company in july 2005 .
he admitted in october to " a criminal responsibility for giving preferential treatment to the former works council head . " sources close to the case said that no witnesses were expected to be called during the two-day trial in braunschweig , close to the town of wolfsburg , where volkswagen has its headquarters . hartz is said to have cooperated extensively with prosecutors . paid pleasure trips bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's biggest carmaker has some image polishing to do the vw scandal , which surfaced in june 2005 , originally centered on allegations of bribes from potential suppliers and the creation of dummy companies which were used to secure lucrative contracts abroad .
but it quickly widened to include claims that vw paid for so-called pleasure trips for work council members to win their allegiance .
this included allegations about flying around high-class prostitutes . the charges against hartz came after an 18-month investigation , which has also seen the indictment of hans-juergen uhl , a former member of the works council , who is also a member of parliament in berlin . uhl , who represents the co-governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , has been indicted on two counts of being an accessory to fraud and five counts of making false statements under oath . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus volkert volkert was arrested last year because of concerns about the suppression of evidence , but released after two months . the former works council chief is alleged to have been paid illegal bonuses worth 1.9 million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- by hartz between 1994 and 2005 .

" it is important to be as inclusive as possible with russia , although that does not necessarily mean as comprehensive as possible , " an eu diplomat said , according to afp news service . russia is a long-time ally of serbia and both believe that not enough time has been given to talks on how much autonomy kosovo should win , which started almost a year ago but were halted in october for lack of progress . kosovo albanians insist they will accept nothing short of independence , but belgrade is offering only " broad autonomy , " saying it would never accept secession . eu foreign policy chief javier solana " has been in touch with all levels in russia " including president vladimir putin , another eu official told afp , also on condition of anonymity . " we are doing as much as possible to ensure that this period , which is not going to be easy , is developing as smoothly as possible , " she said . making the deal acceptable to belgrade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian prime minister kostunica says no country would willingly give up a part of its territory reports quoting a serbian government statement said that putin had promised to veto any initiative in the un security council which belgrade rejects during a telephone call with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica . kosovo , defined by serbia 's constitution as an integral part of its territory , has been run by the united nations since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign ended a crackdown by belgrade on separatist ethnic albanians there . un envoy martti ahtisaari had been expected to make proposals on kosovo 's future status late last year , but he has pushed back publication of his recommendations until after elections in serbia on sunday . to accommodate russia , the eu has offered its support to a proposal of new talks in vienna , perhaps in march , between kosovo and serbian authorities and led by ahtisaari . " this engagement can be very positive , " the eu official said . the talks could run anywhere from two weeks to a month . irreconcilable differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the differences between serbs and kosovo albanians may be impossible to bridge according to an international crisis group expert , they would address russia 's concerns but at the same time demonstrate publicly that the parties are too far apart for their differences to be resolved soon . " this is an attempt to get around what is likely to be a significant blockage at the security council , " said kosovo-based analyst for the think tank alexander anderson . despite albanian cries for full independence and serbia 's refusal to offer anything more than autonomy , experts say that ahtisaari 's proposals will most likely involve a broad , non-specific formula that the united nations will tease out into a clearer degree of autonomy to be introduced over a reasonably long period . " i think there is no other solution than to find a status somewhere between wider autonomy and a programmed independence , " said bernard kouchner , former head of the un 's kosovo mission . a hot election topic the future of kosovo has figured prominently in election campaigning and may even influence how long it takes sunday 's winner to form a new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cedomir jovanovic says that kosovo is no longer serbian yet most of the players in serbian politics - ranging from the ultra-nationalist radical party to kostunica 's democratic party of serbia and serbian president boris tadic 's democratic party - seem to agree in principle that kosovo should not become an independent country . the most notable exception is a coalition lead by the liberal democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- . " we have to accept the reality , " said ldp president and former student leader cedomir jovanovic , " and the reality is that kosovo has been independent from belgrade since 1999 . " ldp , however , is a small player on the serbian political scene and , according to some polls , may barely win the 5 percent of votes necessary to enter the parliament . time is running out if a solution to kosovo 's status is not found in the nearest future , the tensions that have regularly surfaced in kosovo over the last seven years could mount again . the worst case was in march 2004 , when several days of anti-serb riots left 19 people dead , thousands more homeless , and dozens of serbian orthodox monasteries and churches destroyed or damaged . responsibility for kosovo 's future security will fall mostly into the hands of the 27-nation european union . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned sunday that stability in the balkans depended on how the future status of kosovo is resolved and said the eu will work to ensure peace in the serbian province .

the two met for an initial six hours on tuesday and another one-and-a half hours on wednesday . the men declined to comment after wednesday 's meeting . " when you have six hours of conversations and you 're going to have some more ... certainly you can characterize them as useful discussions , " christopher hill told guests at an american academy event after the first round of talks . he declined to answer questions on the substance of the meeting but said he hoped the six-party talks , which collapsed in december in beijing with no discernible progress , would start again in january .
" the north koreans have to understand that they have come to a crossroads , " hill said in a speech at the american academy .
" -lrb- they -rrb- have to decide if they want nuclear weapons or if they want a place in the international community . " the berlin meetings came ahead of hill 's visits beginning friday to south korea , china and japan to continue consultations with key partners in the six-party talks on how to make progress in the next round of negotiations .
rice in berlin hill , who was also to brief us secretary of state condoleezza rice - who arrived in berlin wednesday evening - on the meetings , noted that the berlin talks were the first bilateral discussions he had held with kim outside beijing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice arrived in berlin wednesday night the two powers held landmark talks in berlin in 1999 that ultimately led to the lifting of a half-century of restrictions on trade , travel and banking against north korea after it agreed to a moratorium on missile tests .
but the crisis erupted again in 2002 . six-party negotiations involving the united states , the two koreas , japan , russia and china were suspended in late 2005 after north korea walked out in protest at us financial sanctions imposed on a macau bank accused of illicit dealings on behalf of pyongyang . the talks resumed in december last year - following the north 's oct .
9 nuclear weapons test - and ended in deadlock as pyongyang insisted the financial sanctions be lifted before it would discuss nuclear disarmament .
russia criticizes sanctions russia on wednesday called the us sanctions an obstacle to the resumption of talks and urged flexibility on both sides . " the united states should have taken some steps toward the koreans on lifting financial sanctions and discussing this question with them , " deputy foreign minister alexander losyukov , the head russian negotiator on north korea , was quoted as saying by state-run news agency ria novosti . losyukov also called on north korea to reconsider its refusal to rejoin the negotiations on account of the us sanctions .
" the link is not 100 percent justified , " he was quoted as saying . hill declined to discuss the specifics of the latest negotiations but said the sanctions over the macau bank were " a separate process from the issue of denuclearization . "
he said the other powers involved in the negotiations had a raft of economic and diplomatic incentives to convince pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons program . " we have a lot of options for dealing with it but we do n't have the option of walking away from it , " he said .
" we 'd really like to move this along as quickly as possible . "
high hopes japan and south korea welcomed the berlin talks and voiced hope for an early resumption of multilateral discussions on pyongyang 's nuclear arms program .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hill -lrb- far left -rrb- and kim kye-gwan -lrb- far right -rrb- at the six-party talks in beijing " dialogue is a good thing , " japanese chief cabinet secretary yasuhisa shiozaki , the top government spokesman , told reporters .
" the berlin meeting should lay a good groundwork for an agreement on what initial steps to take to implement the september 19 statement , " south korea 's foreign minister , song min-soon , said , referring to a 2005 accord offering the north security and economic aid guarantees in return for disarmament . hill described that agreement as " a sort of bible for us " and said he hoped it would be the basis for a new agreement .
despite hill 's relatively upbeat assessment , the former us ambassador to the un , john bolton , said the six-way talks had failed and a breakthrough would only come after kim jong-il 's regime ended . " six-party talks have not worked , " he said .

politicians , pop stars and artists coming out of the closet hardly raise eyebrows in germany .
but it 's an entirely different ballgame on the soccer field , where being openly gay remains strictly taboo . german professional soccer has n't seen a gay player to date .
at least not officially .
that is n't because there are n't any , but because they 've decided keeping their sexuality hidden is preferable to the career-ending scorn , ridicule and even physical danger they would face if they came out of the closet . that was the bottom line of a cover story by the popular german soccer magazine rund last month which interviewed players who kept their homosexuality tightly under wraps . " soccer is still unbelievably backward when it comes to homosexuality .
gays on the pitch remain a huge taboo , " said rainer schäfer , chief editor at rund , who spent two years researching the topic and winning the trust of two gay players in the two highest german soccer leagues .
they eventually agreed to tell their stories provided they remained anonymous . creating a ' normal ' image both spoke of going to great lengths to hide their sexuality from their clubs , managers and teammates and living in constant fear of being discovered . one player , who is married , said even his wife had no idea he was gay and that he was involved in a long-term relationship with a childhood friend .
" but what am i to do ?
coming out would mean death , " he was quoted as saying in the article . the other gay player profiled said that a female friend in the know often accompanied him to club celebrations and parties to give the impression that he was straight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supermodel heidi klum added some glamour to the world cup last year clubs also sometimes step in if gay rumors persistently circulate around a player .
they usually enlist pr agencies to create a " normal " heterosexual image for the player , which includes parading hired models and kids around the players during publicity events . " constructing a fake identity and an elaborate web of lies takes a heavy toll on the players and does n't make it easier for them to focus on their game , " said schäfer , who added he was taken aback by how widespread homophobia continued to be in the soccer world . germany , in fact , is considered fairly liberal regarding gay rights .
same-sex unions are legal here and it 's not unusual to see high-profile personalities open about their sexuality .
berlin 's mayor , for example , is gay and appears at functions with his partner . macho attitudes though there are no figures on the number of gay players in germany , tatjana eggeling from the institute of cultural anthropology and european ethnology at the university of göttingen said she estimated there were about 30 in the top two leagues . that guess is based on statistics that say around 5 to 10 percent of the adult population in germany is gay or lesbian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rough and tumble soccer only for tough virile men , goes a cliche eggeling added that a combination of macho attitudes and prejudices is to blame for the enduring gay taboo in soccer . " sport is one of the most conservative fields in society .
it 's still dominated by men and 19th century values such as honor and bravery as male virtues , " said eggeling .
" soccer does n't allow you to be different . " she pointed out that being homosexual was often equated in sport with being effeminate and weak - a view that is perpetuated in soccer clubs with players calling their colleagues " pansy " or " fag " the moment they show any weakness . learning from britain ? apart from the straights-only attitude within clubs , some say homophobia in stadiums - in the form of chanting and jeering - remains a problem that has n't been taken seriously in germany by either the clubs or the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justin fashanu played for norwich , nottingham forests and hearts many point to britain as an example of a country that has taken steps to address the problem .
in 2001 , the football association - four years after the suicide of britain 's only openly gay player , justin fashanu - changed its charter , which imposed penalties for sexually discriminatory behavior .
recently two norwich city fans were sentenced to time in jail for violating those rules . but a spokesman for the dfb who declined to be named said the german association 's charter did not penalize sexually discriminatory behavior and said he did not see why it needed to . some say it 's this refusal by the authorities to even acknowledge there is a problem that makes it difficult for gay players to come out of the closet .
things are made worse by straight players often refusing to acknowledge publicly that they have gay teammates . " it would be a big help if heterosexual players would stand up and say ' i have a gay colleague on the team and he plays great soccer , that 's it , " ' said eggeling . " as things stand now , i would n't advise a single german soccer player to come out because it would be just too much of a risk for him , both for his career and personal life , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corny littmann is the only openly gay figure in the german soccer world corny littmann , president of hamburg 's st. pauli club and the only openly gay figure on germany 's soccer circuit , told german news agency dpa last year he did not expect any player to come out anytime soon . " if one did come out , there would be a media frenzy .
i do n't know how a 20- or 25-year-old would handle it , " littmann said , adding the player would be the target of abuse both on and off the pitch .
" being gay just frightens people . " " soccer is everything , even gay " so far even the handful of gay and lesbian fan clubs attached to the bundesliga has been unable to put an end to homophobic behavior in stadiums . gerd eiserbeck , a member of hertha junxx - the first gay and lesbian bundesliga fan club in germany - said that though their debut in 2001 had initially led to some " verbal confrontation " between ostensibly straight hertha bsc fans and gay fans , they were now largely accepted .
even their rainbow-colored banner reading " soccer is everything , even gay , " is tolerated in berlin 's olympia stadium , said eiserbeck . " but we still do n't travel to away games , " he said .
" that 's too risky because we do n't know how the opposing fans will react . " more discussion needed despite the odds , some believe that pushing the topic into the public consciousness and keeping it there will eventually create enough pressure on the dfb to deal with it . " remember that 's exactly what happened with racism .
the dfb eventually gave in to the campaigns and imposed harsh penalties for racist behavior , " said schäfer . " the same could happen with homophobia , hopefully .

" -lrb- they -rrb- have to decide if they want nuclear weapons or if they want a place in the international community . " the berlin meetings came ahead of hill 's visits beginning friday to south korea , china and japan to continue consultations with key partners in the six-party talks on how to make progress in the next round of negotiations .
rice in berlin hill , who was also to brief us secretary of state condoleezza rice - who arrived in berlin wednesday evening - on the meetings , noted that the berlin talks were the first bilateral discussions he had held with kim outside beijing .

" it is important to be as inclusive as possible with russia , although that does not necessarily mean as comprehensive as possible , " an eu diplomat said , according to afp news service . russia is a long-time ally of serbia and both believe that not enough time has been given to talks on how much autonomy kosovo should win , which started almost a year ago but were halted in october for lack of progress . kosovo albanians insist they will accept nothing short of independence , but belgrade is offering only " broad autonomy , " saying it would never accept secession . eu foreign policy chief javier solana " has been in touch with all levels in russia " including president vladimir putin , another eu official told afp , also on condition of anonymity . " we are doing as much as possible to ensure that this period , which is not going to be easy , is developing as smoothly as possible , " she said . making the deal acceptable to belgrade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian prime minister kostunica says no country would willingly give up a part of its territory reports quoting a serbian government statement said that putin had promised to veto any initiative in the un security council which belgrade rejects during a telephone call with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica . kosovo , defined by serbia 's constitution as an integral part of its territory , has been run by the united nations since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign ended a crackdown by belgrade on separatist ethnic albanians there . un envoy martti ahtisaari had been expected to make proposals on kosovo 's future status late last year , but he has pushed back publication of his recommendations until after elections in serbia on sunday . to accommodate russia , the eu has offered its support to a proposal of new talks in vienna , perhaps in march , between kosovo and serbian authorities and led by ahtisaari . " this engagement can be very positive , " the eu official said . the talks could run anywhere from two weeks to a month . irreconcilable differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the differences between serbs and kosovo albanians may be impossible to bridge according to an international crisis group expert , they would address russia 's concerns but at the same time demonstrate publicly that the parties are too far apart for their differences to be resolved soon . " this is an attempt to get around what is likely to be a significant blockage at the security council , " said kosovo-based analyst for the think tank alexander anderson . despite albanian cries for full independence and serbia 's refusal to offer anything more than autonomy , experts say that ahtisaari 's proposals will most likely involve a broad , non-specific formula that the united nations will tease out into a clearer degree of autonomy to be introduced over a reasonably long period . " i think there is no other solution than to find a status somewhere between wider autonomy and a programmed independence , " said bernard kouchner , former head of the un 's kosovo mission . a hot election topic the future of kosovo has figured prominently in election campaigning and may even influence how long it takes sunday 's winner to form a new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cedomir jovanovic says that kosovo is no longer serbian yet most of the players in serbian politics - ranging from the ultra-nationalist radical party to kostunica 's democratic party of serbia and serbian president boris tadic 's democratic party - seem to agree in principle that kosovo should not become an independent country . the most notable exception is a coalition lead by the liberal democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- . " we have to accept the reality , " said ldp president and former student leader cedomir jovanovic , " and the reality is that kosovo has been independent from belgrade since 1999 . " ldp , however , is a small player on the serbian political scene and , according to some polls , may barely win the 5 percent of votes necessary to enter the parliament . time is running out if a solution to kosovo 's status is not found in the nearest future , the tensions that have regularly surfaced in kosovo over the last seven years could mount again . the worst case was in march 2004 , when several days of anti-serb riots left 19 people dead , thousands more homeless , and dozens of serbian orthodox monasteries and churches destroyed or damaged . responsibility for kosovo 's future security will fall mostly into the hands of the 27-nation european union . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned sunday that stability in the balkans depended on how the future status of kosovo is resolved and said the eu will work to ensure peace in the serbian province .

it was the latest in series of small earthquakes over the past month caused by the swiss deep heat mining project . the geothermal project , which was launched in 1996 under the auspices of the swiss federal office of energy , involves drilling the country 's first exploratory borehole and injecting pressurized water more than 5000 meters -lrb- 16,400 feet -rrb- underground . but that has caused the earth to move in what is normally an area of geological calm .

local authorities in basel are set to meet at the end of january to debate the project , which was supposed to provide heat and energy for thousands of home in basel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 17.01.2007 germany 's gay soccer players stuck firmly in the closet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how about tough , talented and gay ?
politicians , pop stars and artists coming out of the closet hardly raise eyebrows in germany .
but it 's an entirely different ballgame on the soccer field , where being openly gay remains strictly taboo . german professional soccer has n't seen a gay player to date .
at least not officially .
that is n't because there are n't any , but because they 've decided keeping their sexuality hidden is preferable to the career-ending scorn , ridicule and even physical danger they would face if they came out of the closet . that was the bottom line of a cover story by the popular german soccer magazine rund last month which interviewed players who kept their homosexuality tightly under wraps . " soccer is still unbelievably backward when it comes to homosexuality .
gays on the pitch remain a huge taboo , " said rainer schäfer , chief editor at rund , who spent two years researching the topic and winning the trust of two gay players in the two highest german soccer leagues .
they eventually agreed to tell their stories provided they remained anonymous . creating a ' normal ' image both spoke of going to great lengths to hide their sexuality from their clubs , managers and teammates and living in constant fear of being discovered . one player , who is married , said even his wife had no idea he was gay and that he was involved in a long-term relationship with a childhood friend .
" but what am i to do ?
coming out would mean death , " he was quoted as saying in the article . the other gay player profiled said that a female friend in the know often accompanied him to club celebrations and parties to give the impression that he was straight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supermodel heidi klum added some glamour to the world cup last year clubs also sometimes step in if gay rumors persistently circulate around a player .
they usually enlist pr agencies to create a " normal " heterosexual image for the player , which includes parading hired models and kids around the players during publicity events . " constructing a fake identity and an elaborate web of lies takes a heavy toll on the players and does n't make it easier for them to focus on their game , " said schäfer , who added he was taken aback by how widespread homophobia continued to be in the soccer world . germany , in fact , is considered fairly liberal regarding gay rights .
same-sex unions are legal here and it 's not unusual to see high-profile personalities open about their sexuality .
berlin 's mayor , for example , is gay and appears at functions with his partner . macho attitudes though there are no figures on the number of gay players in germany , tatjana eggeling from the institute of cultural anthropology and european ethnology at the university of göttingen said she estimated there were about 30 in the top two leagues . that guess is based on statistics that say around 5 to 10 percent of the adult population in germany is gay or lesbian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rough and tumble soccer only for tough virile men , goes a cliche eggeling added that a combination of macho attitudes and prejudices is to blame for the enduring gay taboo in soccer . " sport is one of the most conservative fields in society .
it 's still dominated by men and 19th century values such as honor and bravery as male virtues , " said eggeling .
" soccer does n't allow you to be different . " she pointed out that being homosexual was often equated in sport with being effeminate and weak - a view that is perpetuated in soccer clubs with players calling their colleagues " pansy " or " fag " the moment they show any weakness . learning from britain ? apart from the straights-only attitude within clubs , some say homophobia in stadiums - in the form of chanting and jeering - remains a problem that has n't been taken seriously in germany by either the clubs or the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justin fashanu played for norwich , nottingham forests and hearts many point to britain as an example of a country that has taken steps to address the problem .
in 2001 , the football association - four years after the suicide of britain 's only openly gay player , justin fashanu - changed its charter , which imposed penalties for sexually discriminatory behavior .
recently two norwich city fans were sentenced to time in jail for violating those rules . but a spokesman for the dfb who declined to be named said the german association 's charter did not penalize sexually discriminatory behavior and said he did not see why it needed to . some say it 's this refusal by the authorities to even acknowledge there is a problem that makes it difficult for gay players to come out of the closet .
things are made worse by straight players often refusing to acknowledge publicly that they have gay teammates . " it would be a big help if heterosexual players would stand up and say ' i have a gay colleague on the team and he plays great soccer , that 's it , " ' said eggeling . " as things stand now , i would n't advise a single german soccer player to come out because it would be just too much of a risk for him , both for his career and personal life , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corny littmann is the only openly gay figure in the german soccer world corny littmann , president of hamburg 's st. pauli club and the only openly gay figure on germany 's soccer circuit , told german news agency dpa last year he did not expect any player to come out anytime soon . " if one did come out , there would be a media frenzy .
i do n't know how a 20- or 25-year-old would handle it , " littmann said , adding the player would be the target of abuse both on and off the pitch .
" being gay just frightens people . " " soccer is everything , even gay " so far even the handful of gay and lesbian fan clubs attached to the bundesliga has been unable to put an end to homophobic behavior in stadiums . gerd eiserbeck , a member of hertha junxx - the first gay and lesbian bundesliga fan club in germany - said that though their debut in 2001 had initially led to some " verbal confrontation " between ostensibly straight hertha bsc fans and gay fans , they were now largely accepted .
even their rainbow-colored banner reading " soccer is everything , even gay , " is tolerated in berlin 's olympia stadium , said eiserbeck . " but we still do n't travel to away games , " he said .
" that 's too risky because we do n't know how the opposing fans will react . " more discussion needed despite the odds , some believe that pushing the topic into the public consciousness and keeping it there will eventually create enough pressure on the dfb to deal with it . " remember that 's exactly what happened with racism .
the dfb eventually gave in to the campaigns and imposed harsh penalties for racist behavior , " said schäfer . " the same could happen with homophobia , hopefully .

politicians , pop stars and artists coming out of the closet hardly raise eyebrows in germany .
but it 's an entirely different ballgame on the soccer field , where being openly gay remains strictly taboo . german professional soccer has n't seen a gay player to date .
at least not officially .
that is n't because there are n't any , but because they 've decided keeping their sexuality hidden is preferable to the career-ending scorn , ridicule and even physical danger they would face if they came out of the closet . that was the bottom line of a cover story by the popular german soccer magazine rund last month which interviewed players who kept their homosexuality tightly under wraps . " soccer is still unbelievably backward when it comes to homosexuality .
gays on the pitch remain a huge taboo , " said rainer schäfer , chief editor at rund , who spent two years researching the topic and winning the trust of two gay players in the two highest german soccer leagues .
they eventually agreed to tell their stories provided they remained anonymous . creating a ' normal ' image both spoke of going to great lengths to hide their sexuality from their clubs , managers and teammates and living in constant fear of being discovered . one player , who is married , said even his wife had no idea he was gay and that he was involved in a long-term relationship with a childhood friend .
" but what am i to do ?
coming out would mean death , " he was quoted as saying in the article . the other gay player profiled said that a female friend in the know often accompanied him to club celebrations and parties to give the impression that he was straight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supermodel heidi klum added some glamour to the world cup last year clubs also sometimes step in if gay rumors persistently circulate around a player .
they usually enlist pr agencies to create a " normal " heterosexual image for the player , which includes parading hired models and kids around the players during publicity events . " constructing a fake identity and an elaborate web of lies takes a heavy toll on the players and does n't make it easier for them to focus on their game , " said schäfer , who added he was taken aback by how widespread homophobia continued to be in the soccer world . germany , in fact , is considered fairly liberal regarding gay rights .
same-sex unions are legal here and it 's not unusual to see high-profile personalities open about their sexuality .
berlin 's mayor , for example , is gay and appears at functions with his partner . macho attitudes though there are no figures on the number of gay players in germany , tatjana eggeling from the institute of cultural anthropology and european ethnology at the university of göttingen said she estimated there were about 30 in the top two leagues . that guess is based on statistics that say around 5 to 10 percent of the adult population in germany is gay or lesbian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rough and tumble soccer only for tough virile men , goes a cliche eggeling added that a combination of macho attitudes and prejudices is to blame for the enduring gay taboo in soccer . " sport is one of the most conservative fields in society .
it 's still dominated by men and 19th century values such as honor and bravery as male virtues , " said eggeling .
" soccer does n't allow you to be different . " she pointed out that being homosexual was often equated in sport with being effeminate and weak - a view that is perpetuated in soccer clubs with players calling their colleagues " pansy " or " fag " the moment they show any weakness . learning from britain ? apart from the straights-only attitude within clubs , some say homophobia in stadiums - in the form of chanting and jeering - remains a problem that has n't been taken seriously in germany by either the clubs or the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justin fashanu played for norwich , nottingham forests and hearts many point to britain as an example of a country that has taken steps to address the problem .
in 2001 , the football association - four years after the suicide of britain 's only openly gay player , justin fashanu - changed its charter , which imposed penalties for sexually discriminatory behavior .
recently two norwich city fans were sentenced to time in jail for violating those rules . but a spokesman for the dfb who declined to be named said the german association 's charter did not penalize sexually discriminatory behavior and said he did not see why it needed to . some say it 's this refusal by the authorities to even acknowledge there is a problem that makes it difficult for gay players to come out of the closet .
things are made worse by straight players often refusing to acknowledge publicly that they have gay teammates . " it would be a big help if heterosexual players would stand up and say ' i have a gay colleague on the team and he plays great soccer , that 's it , " ' said eggeling . " as things stand now , i would n't advise a single german soccer player to come out because it would be just too much of a risk for him , both for his career and personal life , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corny littmann is the only openly gay figure in the german soccer world corny littmann , president of hamburg 's st. pauli club and the only openly gay figure on germany 's soccer circuit , told german news agency dpa last year he did not expect any player to come out anytime soon . " if one did come out , there would be a media frenzy .
i do n't know how a 20- or 25-year-old would handle it , " littmann said , adding the player would be the target of abuse both on and off the pitch .
" being gay just frightens people . " " soccer is everything , even gay " so far even the handful of gay and lesbian fan clubs attached to the bundesliga has been unable to put an end to homophobic behavior in stadiums . gerd eiserbeck , a member of hertha junxx - the first gay and lesbian bundesliga fan club in germany - said that though their debut in 2001 had initially led to some " verbal confrontation " between ostensibly straight hertha bsc fans and gay fans , they were now largely accepted .
even their rainbow-colored banner reading " soccer is everything , even gay , " is tolerated in berlin 's olympia stadium , said eiserbeck . " but we still do n't travel to away games , " he said .
" that 's too risky because we do n't know how the opposing fans will react . " more discussion needed despite the odds , some believe that pushing the topic into the public consciousness and keeping it there will eventually create enough pressure on the dfb to deal with it . " remember that 's exactly what happened with racism .
the dfb eventually gave in to the campaigns and imposed harsh penalties for racist behavior , " said schäfer . " the same could happen with homophobia , hopefully .

" it is important to be as inclusive as possible with russia , although that does not necessarily mean as comprehensive as possible , " an eu diplomat said , according to afp news service . russia is a long-time ally of serbia and both believe that not enough time has been given to talks on how much autonomy kosovo should win , which started almost a year ago but were halted in october for lack of progress . kosovo albanians insist they will accept nothing short of independence , but belgrade is offering only " broad autonomy , " saying it would never accept secession . eu foreign policy chief javier solana " has been in touch with all levels in russia " including president vladimir putin , another eu official told afp , also on condition of anonymity . " we are doing as much as possible to ensure that this period , which is not going to be easy , is developing as smoothly as possible , " she said . making the deal acceptable to belgrade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian prime minister kostunica says no country would willingly give up a part of its territory reports quoting a serbian government statement said that putin had promised to veto any initiative in the un security council which belgrade rejects during a telephone call with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica . kosovo , defined by serbia 's constitution as an integral part of its territory , has been run by the united nations since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign ended a crackdown by belgrade on separatist ethnic albanians there . un envoy martti ahtisaari had been expected to make proposals on kosovo 's future status late last year , but he has pushed back publication of his recommendations until after elections in serbia on sunday . to accommodate russia , the eu has offered its support to a proposal of new talks in vienna , perhaps in march , between kosovo and serbian authorities and led by ahtisaari . " this engagement can be very positive , " the eu official said . the talks could run anywhere from two weeks to a month . irreconcilable differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the differences between serbs and kosovo albanians may be impossible to bridge according to an international crisis group expert , they would address russia 's concerns but at the same time demonstrate publicly that the parties are too far apart for their differences to be resolved soon . " this is an attempt to get around what is likely to be a significant blockage at the security council , " said kosovo-based analyst for the think tank alexander anderson . despite albanian cries for full independence and serbia 's refusal to offer anything more than autonomy , experts say that ahtisaari 's proposals will most likely involve a broad , non-specific formula that the united nations will tease out into a clearer degree of autonomy to be introduced over a reasonably long period . " i think there is no other solution than to find a status somewhere between wider autonomy and a programmed independence , " said bernard kouchner , former head of the un 's kosovo mission . a hot election topic the future of kosovo has figured prominently in election campaigning and may even influence how long it takes sunday 's winner to form a new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cedomir jovanovic says that kosovo is no longer serbian yet most of the players in serbian politics - ranging from the ultra-nationalist radical party to kostunica 's democratic party of serbia and serbian president boris tadic 's democratic party - seem to agree in principle that kosovo should not become an independent country . the most notable exception is a coalition lead by the liberal democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- . " we have to accept the reality , " said ldp president and former student leader cedomir jovanovic , " and the reality is that kosovo has been independent from belgrade since 1999 . " ldp , however , is a small player on the serbian political scene and , according to some polls , may barely win the 5 percent of votes necessary to enter the parliament . time is running out if a solution to kosovo 's status is not found in the nearest future , the tensions that have regularly surfaced in kosovo over the last seven years could mount again . the worst case was in march 2004 , when several days of anti-serb riots left 19 people dead , thousands more homeless , and dozens of serbian orthodox monasteries and churches destroyed or damaged . responsibility for kosovo 's future security will fall mostly into the hands of the 27-nation european union . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned sunday that stability in the balkans depended on how the future status of kosovo is resolved and said the eu will work to ensure peace in the serbian province .

" it is important to be as inclusive as possible with russia , although that does not necessarily mean as comprehensive as possible , " an eu diplomat said , according to afp news service . russia is a long-time ally of serbia and both believe that not enough time has been given to talks on how much autonomy kosovo should win , which started almost a year ago but were halted in october for lack of progress . kosovo albanians insist they will accept nothing short of independence , but belgrade is offering only " broad autonomy , " saying it would never accept secession . eu foreign policy chief javier solana " has been in touch with all levels in russia " including president vladimir putin , another eu official told afp , also on condition of anonymity . " we are doing as much as possible to ensure that this period , which is not going to be easy , is developing as smoothly as possible , " she said . making the deal acceptable to belgrade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian prime minister kostunica says no country would willingly give up a part of its territory reports quoting a serbian government statement said that putin had promised to veto any initiative in the un security council which belgrade rejects during a telephone call with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica . kosovo , defined by serbia 's constitution as an integral part of its territory , has been run by the united nations since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign ended a crackdown by belgrade on separatist ethnic albanians there . un envoy martti ahtisaari had been expected to make proposals on kosovo 's future status late last year , but he has pushed back publication of his recommendations until after elections in serbia on sunday . to accommodate russia , the eu has offered its support to a proposal of new talks in vienna , perhaps in march , between kosovo and serbian authorities and led by ahtisaari . " this engagement can be very positive , " the eu official said . the talks could run anywhere from two weeks to a month . irreconcilable differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the differences between serbs and kosovo albanians may be impossible to bridge according to an international crisis group expert , they would address russia 's concerns but at the same time demonstrate publicly that the parties are too far apart for their differences to be resolved soon . " this is an attempt to get around what is likely to be a significant blockage at the security council , " said kosovo-based analyst for the think tank alexander anderson . despite albanian cries for full independence and serbia 's refusal to offer anything more than autonomy , experts say that ahtisaari 's proposals will most likely involve a broad , non-specific formula that the united nations will tease out into a clearer degree of autonomy to be introduced over a reasonably long period . " i think there is no other solution than to find a status somewhere between wider autonomy and a programmed independence , " said bernard kouchner , former head of the un 's kosovo mission . a hot election topic the future of kosovo has figured prominently in election campaigning and may even influence how long it takes sunday 's winner to form a new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cedomir jovanovic says that kosovo is no longer serbian yet most of the players in serbian politics - ranging from the ultra-nationalist radical party to kostunica 's democratic party of serbia and serbian president boris tadic 's democratic party - seem to agree in principle that kosovo should not become an independent country . the most notable exception is a coalition lead by the liberal democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- . " we have to accept the reality , " said ldp president and former student leader cedomir jovanovic , " and the reality is that kosovo has been independent from belgrade since 1999 . " ldp , however , is a small player on the serbian political scene and , according to some polls , may barely win the 5 percent of votes necessary to enter the parliament . time is running out if a solution to kosovo 's status is not found in the nearest future , the tensions that have regularly surfaced in kosovo over the last seven years could mount again . the worst case was in march 2004 , when several days of anti-serb riots left 19 people dead , thousands more homeless , and dozens of serbian orthodox monasteries and churches destroyed or damaged . responsibility for kosovo 's future security will fall mostly into the hands of the 27-nation european union . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned sunday that stability in the balkans depended on how the future status of kosovo is resolved and said the eu will work to ensure peace in the serbian province .

politicians , pop stars and artists coming out of the closet hardly raise eyebrows in germany .
but it 's an entirely different ballgame on the soccer field , where being openly gay remains strictly taboo . german professional soccer has n't seen a gay player to date .
at least not officially .
that is n't because there are n't any , but because they 've decided keeping their sexuality hidden is preferable to the career-ending scorn , ridicule and even physical danger they would face if they came out of the closet . that was the bottom line of a cover story by the popular german soccer magazine rund last month which interviewed players who kept their homosexuality tightly under wraps . " soccer is still unbelievably backward when it comes to homosexuality .
gays on the pitch remain a huge taboo , " said rainer schäfer , chief editor at rund , who spent two years researching the topic and winning the trust of two gay players in the two highest german soccer leagues .
they eventually agreed to tell their stories provided they remained anonymous . creating a ' normal ' image both spoke of going to great lengths to hide their sexuality from their clubs , managers and teammates and living in constant fear of being discovered . one player , who is married , said even his wife had no idea he was gay and that he was involved in a long-term relationship with a childhood friend .
" but what am i to do ?
coming out would mean death , " he was quoted as saying in the article . the other gay player profiled said that a female friend in the know often accompanied him to club celebrations and parties to give the impression that he was straight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supermodel heidi klum added some glamour to the world cup last year clubs also sometimes step in if gay rumors persistently circulate around a player .
they usually enlist pr agencies to create a " normal " heterosexual image for the player , which includes parading hired models and kids around the players during publicity events . " constructing a fake identity and an elaborate web of lies takes a heavy toll on the players and does n't make it easier for them to focus on their game , " said schäfer , who added he was taken aback by how widespread homophobia continued to be in the soccer world . germany , in fact , is considered fairly liberal regarding gay rights .
same-sex unions are legal here and it 's not unusual to see high-profile personalities open about their sexuality .
berlin 's mayor , for example , is gay and appears at functions with his partner . macho attitudes though there are no figures on the number of gay players in germany , tatjana eggeling from the institute of cultural anthropology and european ethnology at the university of göttingen said she estimated there were about 30 in the top two leagues . that guess is based on statistics that say around 5 to 10 percent of the adult population in germany is gay or lesbian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rough and tumble soccer only for tough virile men , goes a cliche eggeling added that a combination of macho attitudes and prejudices is to blame for the enduring gay taboo in soccer . " sport is one of the most conservative fields in society .
it 's still dominated by men and 19th century values such as honor and bravery as male virtues , " said eggeling .
" soccer does n't allow you to be different . " she pointed out that being homosexual was often equated in sport with being effeminate and weak - a view that is perpetuated in soccer clubs with players calling their colleagues " pansy " or " fag " the moment they show any weakness . learning from britain ? apart from the straights-only attitude within clubs , some say homophobia in stadiums - in the form of chanting and jeering - remains a problem that has n't been taken seriously in germany by either the clubs or the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justin fashanu played for norwich , nottingham forests and hearts many point to britain as an example of a country that has taken steps to address the problem .
in 2001 , the football association - four years after the suicide of britain 's only openly gay player , justin fashanu - changed its charter , which imposed penalties for sexually discriminatory behavior .
recently two norwich city fans were sentenced to time in jail for violating those rules . but a spokesman for the dfb who declined to be named said the german association 's charter did not penalize sexually discriminatory behavior and said he did not see why it needed to . some say it 's this refusal by the authorities to even acknowledge there is a problem that makes it difficult for gay players to come out of the closet .
things are made worse by straight players often refusing to acknowledge publicly that they have gay teammates . " it would be a big help if heterosexual players would stand up and say ' i have a gay colleague on the team and he plays great soccer , that 's it , " ' said eggeling . " as things stand now , i would n't advise a single german soccer player to come out because it would be just too much of a risk for him , both for his career and personal life , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corny littmann is the only openly gay figure in the german soccer world corny littmann , president of hamburg 's st. pauli club and the only openly gay figure on germany 's soccer circuit , told german news agency dpa last year he did not expect any player to come out anytime soon . " if one did come out , there would be a media frenzy .
i do n't know how a 20- or 25-year-old would handle it , " littmann said , adding the player would be the target of abuse both on and off the pitch .
" being gay just frightens people . " " soccer is everything , even gay " so far even the handful of gay and lesbian fan clubs attached to the bundesliga has been unable to put an end to homophobic behavior in stadiums . gerd eiserbeck , a member of hertha junxx - the first gay and lesbian bundesliga fan club in germany - said that though their debut in 2001 had initially led to some " verbal confrontation " between ostensibly straight hertha bsc fans and gay fans , they were now largely accepted .
even their rainbow-colored banner reading " soccer is everything , even gay , " is tolerated in berlin 's olympia stadium , said eiserbeck . " but we still do n't travel to away games , " he said .
" that 's too risky because we do n't know how the opposing fans will react . " more discussion needed despite the odds , some believe that pushing the topic into the public consciousness and keeping it there will eventually create enough pressure on the dfb to deal with it . " remember that 's exactly what happened with racism .
the dfb eventually gave in to the campaigns and imposed harsh penalties for racist behavior , " said schäfer . " the same could happen with homophobia , hopefully .

she stressed the need for progress on an eu constitution but also the fight against religious extremism . ahead of the address , eu watchers were most curious about what the german chancellor would propose to end the stalemate over the bloc 's proposed constitution , which failed to pass national referenda in france and the netherlands last year .
but merkel began her speech by stressing diversity as a core european value , saying the eu had to be vigorous in defending its freedoms . " tolerance , " merkel said in one of the speech 's central lines , " is the soul of europe . "
among the liberties in need of protection , she cited freedom to voice opinions that upset others , freedom to believe or not to believe in religion and freedom of artistic expression . " europe , " she said , " should never have the slightest understanding for intolerance , for violence by right-or left-wing extremists or violence carried out in the name of a religion . " " tolerance , " she added , " digs its own grave , if it does not defend itself against intolerance . " such remarks could hardly have failed to remind listeners of the threat of islamist terrorism as well as last year 's controversy over danish caricatures depicting the prophet mohammed , which some muslims found offensive . " failure would be a historic mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes for more harmony among eu member states merkel promised to present a plan to end the deadlock over the eu constitution by the end of germany 's presidency this june .
but she did not specify what form a proposed solution might take , other than to say that the bloc needed " clear descriptions about the authority of the eu and of the national states . " eighteen member states have ratified the constitution , and eu experts think that germany will negotiate with the remaining nine about what would have be removed from the treaty for it to be passed , preferably without national referenda . merkel called for the issue to be resolved before the next eu parliamentary elections in 2009 , warning that failure to do so would be " a historic mistake . "
she also stressed the need for the eu to have a foreign minister . " the time for deliberation is over , " she said .
" we have to reach new decisions . " closer ties to the us and less bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting the bloc 's bloated bureaucracy will be one of merkel 's main tasks merkel said the eu needed to cooperate more with the us on the issue of climate change in the efforts to achieve a global environmental treat by the year 2012 . " access to energy and protecting the climate , " she said , " are two challenges affecting all of humanity in our age . " she also said the bloc should strength its economic ties with the us .
america , she said , was still the eu 's most important trading partner , adding " a common trans-atlantic is very much in european interests . " in addition , merkel stressed the need to get rid of bureaucracy , saying it was crucial to creating jobs - an issue very much on people 's minds here in germany . " one thing is certain , " she said , " a slow-paced , bureaucratic and quarrelling europe will not be able to cope with the tasks that have to be dealt with .

she stressed the need for progress on an eu constitution but also the fight against religious extremism . ahead of the address , eu watchers were most curious about what the german chancellor would propose to end the stalemate over the bloc 's proposed constitution , which failed to pass national referenda in france and the netherlands last year .
but merkel began her speech by stressing diversity as a core european value , saying the eu had to be vigorous in defending its freedoms . " tolerance , " merkel said in one of the speech 's central lines , " is the soul of europe . "
among the liberties in need of protection , she cited freedom to voice opinions that upset others , freedom to believe or not to believe in religion and freedom of artistic expression . " europe , " she said , " should never have the slightest understanding for intolerance , for violence by right-or left-wing extremists or violence carried out in the name of a religion . " " tolerance , " she added , " digs its own grave , if it does not defend itself against intolerance . " such remarks could hardly have failed to remind listeners of the threat of islamist terrorism as well as last year 's controversy over danish caricatures depicting the prophet mohammed , which some muslims found offensive . " failure would be a historic mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes for more harmony among eu member states merkel promised to present a plan to end the deadlock over the eu constitution by the end of germany 's presidency this june .
but she did not specify what form a proposed solution might take , other than to say that the bloc needed " clear descriptions about the authority of the eu and of the national states . " eighteen member states have ratified the constitution , and eu experts think that germany will negotiate with the remaining nine about what would have be removed from the treaty for it to be passed , preferably without national referenda . merkel called for the issue to be resolved before the next eu parliamentary elections in 2009 , warning that failure to do so would be " a historic mistake . "
she also stressed the need for the eu to have a foreign minister . " the time for deliberation is over , " she said .
" we have to reach new decisions . " closer ties to the us and less bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting the bloc 's bloated bureaucracy will be one of merkel 's main tasks merkel said the eu needed to cooperate more with the us on the issue of climate change in the efforts to achieve a global environmental treat by the year 2012 . " access to energy and protecting the climate , " she said , " are two challenges affecting all of humanity in our age . " she also said the bloc should strength its economic ties with the us .
america , she said , was still the eu 's most important trading partner , adding " a common trans-atlantic is very much in european interests . " in addition , merkel stressed the need to get rid of bureaucracy , saying it was crucial to creating jobs - an issue very much on people 's minds here in germany . " one thing is certain , " she said , " a slow-paced , bureaucratic and quarrelling europe will not be able to cope with the tasks that have to be dealt with .

but not necessarily for those who live near drilling sites , as people along the border between germany , switzerland and france are finding out . emergency services in and around the northern swiss city of basel were flooded with calls on tuesday , as tremors measuring 3.2 in the richter scale shook the region .
it was the latest in series of small earthquakes over the past month caused by the swiss deep heat mining project . the geothermal project , which was launched in 1996 under the auspices of the swiss federal office of energy , involves drilling the country 's first exploratory borehole and injecting pressurized water more than 5000 meters -lrb- 16,400 feet -rrb- underground . but that has caused the earth to move in what is normally an area of geological calm . " the first time around , i was really scared , " said catherine wuest , a shopkeeper in basel .
" it was like a rock fall and glasses were tinkling in the cupboard .
i did n't know what was happening .

" you do n't have the right to play around with the safety of our populations , " he said . geopower , the company heading the project , suspended drilling in december but the tremors continue .
local authorities in basel are set to meet at the end of january to debate the project , which was supposed to provide heat and energy for thousands of home in basel . " we 're a bit nervous of course because the experts ca n't tell us how many tremors we 're in for , " said marc keller , a spokesman for basel 's public works department . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german wind energy business picks up speed for years , wind energy was seen as a sector for unrealistic dreamers that would forever be dependent on hefty subsidies .

politicians , pop stars and artists coming out of the closet hardly raise eyebrows in germany .
but it 's an entirely different ballgame on the soccer field , where being openly gay remains strictly taboo . german professional soccer has n't seen a gay player to date .
at least not officially .
that is n't because there are n't any , but because they 've decided keeping their sexuality hidden is preferable to the career-ending scorn , ridicule and even physical danger they would face if they came out of the closet . that was the bottom line of a cover story by the popular german soccer magazine rund last month which interviewed players who kept their homosexuality tightly under wraps . " soccer is still unbelievably backward when it comes to homosexuality .
gays on the pitch remain a huge taboo , " said rainer schäfer , chief editor at rund , who spent two years researching the topic and winning the trust of two gay players in the two highest german soccer leagues .
they eventually agreed to tell their stories provided they remained anonymous . creating a ' normal ' image both spoke of going to great lengths to hide their sexuality from their clubs , managers and teammates and living in constant fear of being discovered . one player , who is married , said even his wife had no idea he was gay and that he was involved in a long-term relationship with a childhood friend .
" but what am i to do ?
coming out would mean death , " he was quoted as saying in the article . the other gay player profiled said that a female friend in the know often accompanied him to club celebrations and parties to give the impression that he was straight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supermodel heidi klum added some glamour to the world cup last year clubs also sometimes step in if gay rumors persistently circulate around a player .
they usually enlist pr agencies to create a " normal " heterosexual image for the player , which includes parading hired models and kids around the players during publicity events . " constructing a fake identity and an elaborate web of lies takes a heavy toll on the players and does n't make it easier for them to focus on their game , " said schäfer , who added he was taken aback by how widespread homophobia continued to be in the soccer world . germany , in fact , is considered fairly liberal regarding gay rights .
same-sex unions are legal here and it 's not unusual to see high-profile personalities open about their sexuality .
berlin 's mayor , for example , is gay and appears at functions with his partner . macho attitudes though there are no figures on the number of gay players in germany , tatjana eggeling from the institute of cultural anthropology and european ethnology at the university of göttingen said she estimated there were about 30 in the top two leagues . that guess is based on statistics that say around 5 to 10 percent of the adult population in germany is gay or lesbian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rough and tumble soccer only for tough virile men , goes a cliche eggeling added that a combination of macho attitudes and prejudices is to blame for the enduring gay taboo in soccer . " sport is one of the most conservative fields in society .
it 's still dominated by men and 19th century values such as honor and bravery as male virtues , " said eggeling .
" soccer does n't allow you to be different . " she pointed out that being homosexual was often equated in sport with being effeminate and weak - a view that is perpetuated in soccer clubs with players calling their colleagues " pansy " or " fag " the moment they show any weakness . learning from britain ? apart from the straights-only attitude within clubs , some say homophobia in stadiums - in the form of chanting and jeering - remains a problem that has n't been taken seriously in germany by either the clubs or the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justin fashanu played for norwich , nottingham forests and hearts many point to britain as an example of a country that has taken steps to address the problem .
in 2001 , the football association - four years after the suicide of britain 's only openly gay player , justin fashanu - changed its charter , which imposed penalties for sexually discriminatory behavior .
recently two norwich city fans were sentenced to time in jail for violating those rules . but a spokesman for the dfb who declined to be named said the german association 's charter did not penalize sexually discriminatory behavior and said he did not see why it needed to . some say it 's this refusal by the authorities to even acknowledge there is a problem that makes it difficult for gay players to come out of the closet .
things are made worse by straight players often refusing to acknowledge publicly that they have gay teammates . " it would be a big help if heterosexual players would stand up and say ' i have a gay colleague on the team and he plays great soccer , that 's it , " ' said eggeling . " as things stand now , i would n't advise a single german soccer player to come out because it would be just too much of a risk for him , both for his career and personal life , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corny littmann is the only openly gay figure in the german soccer world corny littmann , president of hamburg 's st. pauli club and the only openly gay figure on germany 's soccer circuit , told german news agency dpa last year he did not expect any player to come out anytime soon . " if one did come out , there would be a media frenzy .
i do n't know how a 20- or 25-year-old would handle it , " littmann said , adding the player would be the target of abuse both on and off the pitch .
" being gay just frightens people . " " soccer is everything , even gay " so far even the handful of gay and lesbian fan clubs attached to the bundesliga has been unable to put an end to homophobic behavior in stadiums . gerd eiserbeck , a member of hertha junxx - the first gay and lesbian bundesliga fan club in germany - said that though their debut in 2001 had initially led to some " verbal confrontation " between ostensibly straight hertha bsc fans and gay fans , they were now largely accepted .
even their rainbow-colored banner reading " soccer is everything , even gay , " is tolerated in berlin 's olympia stadium , said eiserbeck . " but we still do n't travel to away games , " he said .
" that 's too risky because we do n't know how the opposing fans will react . " more discussion needed despite the odds , some believe that pushing the topic into the public consciousness and keeping it there will eventually create enough pressure on the dfb to deal with it . " remember that 's exactly what happened with racism .
the dfb eventually gave in to the campaigns and imposed harsh penalties for racist behavior , " said schäfer . " the same could happen with homophobia , hopefully .

" it is important to be as inclusive as possible with russia , although that does not necessarily mean as comprehensive as possible , " an eu diplomat said , according to afp news service . russia is a long-time ally of serbia and both believe that not enough time has been given to talks on how much autonomy kosovo should win , which started almost a year ago but were halted in october for lack of progress . kosovo albanians insist they will accept nothing short of independence , but belgrade is offering only " broad autonomy , " saying it would never accept secession . eu foreign policy chief javier solana " has been in touch with all levels in russia " including president vladimir putin , another eu official told afp , also on condition of anonymity . " we are doing as much as possible to ensure that this period , which is not going to be easy , is developing as smoothly as possible , " she said . making the deal acceptable to belgrade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian prime minister kostunica says no country would willingly give up a part of its territory reports quoting a serbian government statement said that putin had promised to veto any initiative in the un security council which belgrade rejects during a telephone call with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica . kosovo , defined by serbia 's constitution as an integral part of its territory , has been run by the united nations since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign ended a crackdown by belgrade on separatist ethnic albanians there . un envoy martti ahtisaari had been expected to make proposals on kosovo 's future status late last year , but he has pushed back publication of his recommendations until after elections in serbia on sunday . to accommodate russia , the eu has offered its support to a proposal of new talks in vienna , perhaps in march , between kosovo and serbian authorities and led by ahtisaari . " this engagement can be very positive , " the eu official said . the talks could run anywhere from two weeks to a month . irreconcilable differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the differences between serbs and kosovo albanians may be impossible to bridge according to an international crisis group expert , they would address russia 's concerns but at the same time demonstrate publicly that the parties are too far apart for their differences to be resolved soon . " this is an attempt to get around what is likely to be a significant blockage at the security council , " said kosovo-based analyst for the think tank alexander anderson . despite albanian cries for full independence and serbia 's refusal to offer anything more than autonomy , experts say that ahtisaari 's proposals will most likely involve a broad , non-specific formula that the united nations will tease out into a clearer degree of autonomy to be introduced over a reasonably long period . " i think there is no other solution than to find a status somewhere between wider autonomy and a programmed independence , " said bernard kouchner , former head of the un 's kosovo mission . a hot election topic the future of kosovo has figured prominently in election campaigning and may even influence how long it takes sunday 's winner to form a new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cedomir jovanovic says that kosovo is no longer serbian yet most of the players in serbian politics - ranging from the ultra-nationalist radical party to kostunica 's democratic party of serbia and serbian president boris tadic 's democratic party - seem to agree in principle that kosovo should not become an independent country . the most notable exception is a coalition lead by the liberal democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- . " we have to accept the reality , " said ldp president and former student leader cedomir jovanovic , " and the reality is that kosovo has been independent from belgrade since 1999 . " ldp , however , is a small player on the serbian political scene and , according to some polls , may barely win the 5 percent of votes necessary to enter the parliament . time is running out if a solution to kosovo 's status is not found in the nearest future , the tensions that have regularly surfaced in kosovo over the last seven years could mount again . the worst case was in march 2004 , when several days of anti-serb riots left 19 people dead , thousands more homeless , and dozens of serbian orthodox monasteries and churches destroyed or damaged . responsibility for kosovo 's future security will fall mostly into the hands of the 27-nation european union . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned sunday that stability in the balkans depended on how the future status of kosovo is resolved and said the eu will work to ensure peace in the serbian province .

the two met for an initial six hours on tuesday and another one-and-a half hours on wednesday . the men declined to comment after wednesday 's meeting . " when you have six hours of conversations and you 're going to have some more ... certainly you can characterize them as useful discussions , " christopher hill told guests at an american academy event after the first round of talks . he declined to answer questions on the substance of the meeting but said he hoped the six-party talks , which collapsed in december in beijing with no discernible progress , would start again in january .
" the north koreans have to understand that they have come to a crossroads , " hill said in a speech at the american academy .
" -lrb- they -rrb- have to decide if they want nuclear weapons or if they want a place in the international community . " the berlin meetings came ahead of hill 's visits beginning friday to south korea , china and japan to continue consultations with key partners in the six-party talks on how to make progress in the next round of negotiations .
rice in berlin hill , who was also to brief us secretary of state condoleezza rice - who arrived in berlin wednesday evening - on the meetings , noted that the berlin talks were the first bilateral discussions he had held with kim outside beijing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice arrived in berlin wednesday night the two powers held landmark talks in berlin in 1999 that ultimately led to the lifting of a half-century of restrictions on trade , travel and banking against north korea after it agreed to a moratorium on missile tests .
but the crisis erupted again in 2002 . six-party negotiations involving the united states , the two koreas , japan , russia and china were suspended in late 2005 after north korea walked out in protest at us financial sanctions imposed on a macau bank accused of illicit dealings on behalf of pyongyang . the talks resumed in december last year - following the north 's oct .
9 nuclear weapons test - and ended in deadlock as pyongyang insisted the financial sanctions be lifted before it would discuss nuclear disarmament .
russia criticizes sanctions russia on wednesday called the us sanctions an obstacle to the resumption of talks and urged flexibility on both sides . " the united states should have taken some steps toward the koreans on lifting financial sanctions and discussing this question with them , " deputy foreign minister alexander losyukov , the head russian negotiator on north korea , was quoted as saying by state-run news agency ria novosti . losyukov also called on north korea to reconsider its refusal to rejoin the negotiations on account of the us sanctions .
" the link is not 100 percent justified , " he was quoted as saying . hill declined to discuss the specifics of the latest negotiations but said the sanctions over the macau bank were " a separate process from the issue of denuclearization . "

the two met for an initial six hours on tuesday and another one-and-a half hours on wednesday . the men declined to comment after wednesday 's meeting . " when you have six hours of conversations and you 're going to have some more ... certainly you can characterize them as useful discussions , " christopher hill told guests at an american academy event after the first round of talks . he declined to answer questions on the substance of the meeting but said he hoped the six-party talks , which collapsed in december in beijing with no discernible progress , would start again in january .
" the north koreans have to understand that they have come to a crossroads , " hill said in a speech at the american academy .
" -lrb- they -rrb- have to decide if they want nuclear weapons or if they want a place in the international community . " the berlin meetings came ahead of hill 's visits beginning friday to south korea , china and japan to continue consultations with key partners in the six-party talks on how to make progress in the next round of negotiations .
rice in berlin hill , who was also to brief us secretary of state condoleezza rice - who arrived in berlin wednesday evening - on the meetings , noted that the berlin talks were the first bilateral discussions he had held with kim outside beijing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice arrived in berlin wednesday night the two powers held landmark talks in berlin in 1999 that ultimately led to the lifting of a half-century of restrictions on trade , travel and banking against north korea after it agreed to a moratorium on missile tests .
but the crisis erupted again in 2002 . six-party negotiations involving the united states , the two koreas , japan , russia and china were suspended in late 2005 after north korea walked out in protest at us financial sanctions imposed on a macau bank accused of illicit dealings on behalf of pyongyang . the talks resumed in december last year - following the north 's oct .
9 nuclear weapons test - and ended in deadlock as pyongyang insisted the financial sanctions be lifted before it would discuss nuclear disarmament .
russia criticizes sanctions russia on wednesday called the us sanctions an obstacle to the resumption of talks and urged flexibility on both sides . " the united states should have taken some steps toward the koreans on lifting financial sanctions and discussing this question with them , " deputy foreign minister alexander losyukov , the head russian negotiator on north korea , was quoted as saying by state-run news agency ria novosti . losyukov also called on north korea to reconsider its refusal to rejoin the negotiations on account of the us sanctions .
" the link is not 100 percent justified , " he was quoted as saying . hill declined to discuss the specifics of the latest negotiations but said the sanctions over the macau bank were " a separate process from the issue of denuclearization . "
he said the other powers involved in the negotiations had a raft of economic and diplomatic incentives to convince pyongyang to abandon its nuclear weapons program . " we have a lot of options for dealing with it but we do n't have the option of walking away from it , " he said .

she stressed the need for progress on an eu constitution but also the fight against religious extremism . ahead of the address , eu watchers were most curious about what the german chancellor would propose to end the stalemate over the bloc 's proposed constitution , which failed to pass national referenda in france and the netherlands last year .
but merkel began her speech by stressing diversity as a core european value , saying the eu had to be vigorous in defending its freedoms . " tolerance , " merkel said in one of the speech 's central lines , " is the soul of europe . "
among the liberties in need of protection , she cited freedom to voice opinions that upset others , freedom to believe or not to believe in religion and freedom of artistic expression . " europe , " she said , " should never have the slightest understanding for intolerance , for violence by right-or left-wing extremists or violence carried out in the name of a religion . " " tolerance , " she added , " digs its own grave , if it does not defend itself against intolerance .

" eighteen member states have ratified the constitution , and eu experts think that germany will negotiate with the remaining nine about what would have be removed from the treaty for it to be passed , preferably without national referenda . merkel called for the issue to be resolved before the next eu parliamentary elections in 2009 , warning that failure to do so would be " a historic mistake . "
she also stressed the need for the eu to have a foreign minister . " the time for deliberation is over , " she said .

america , she said , was still the eu 's most important trading partner , adding " a common trans-atlantic is very much in european interests .

he could now get off with a fine and a suspended sentence . once one of the country 's most respected managers , hartz , 65 , was accused of sanctioning illegal bonuses while director of volkswagen 's human resources department .
the payments were allegedly used to finance lavish foreign trips , mainly by the head of the company 's works council , klaus volkert , and his south american mistress .
other charges relate to visits to brothels and sex parties financed with company funds . hartz , who played a key role in drafting germany 's labor and social welfare reforms under former chancellor gerhard schröder , left the company in july 2005 .
he admitted in october to " a criminal responsibility for giving preferential treatment to the former works council head . " sources close to the case said that no witnesses were expected to be called during the two-day trial in braunschweig , close to the town of wolfsburg , where volkswagen has its headquarters . hartz is said to have cooperated extensively with prosecutors . paid pleasure trips bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's biggest carmaker has some image polishing to do the vw scandal , which surfaced in june 2005 , originally centered on allegations of bribes from potential suppliers and the creation of dummy companies which were used to secure lucrative contracts abroad .
but it quickly widened to include claims that vw paid for so-called pleasure trips for work council members to win their allegiance .
this included allegations about flying around high-class prostitutes . the charges against hartz came after an 18-month investigation , which has also seen the indictment of hans-juergen uhl , a former member of the works council , who is also a member of parliament in berlin . uhl , who represents the co-governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , has been indicted on two counts of being an accessory to fraud and five counts of making false statements under oath . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus volkert volkert was arrested last year because of concerns about the suppression of evidence , but released after two months . the former works council chief is alleged to have been paid illegal bonuses worth 1.9 million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- by hartz between 1994 and 2005 .

politicians , pop stars and artists coming out of the closet hardly raise eyebrows in germany .
but it 's an entirely different ballgame on the soccer field , where being openly gay remains strictly taboo . german professional soccer has n't seen a gay player to date .
at least not officially .
that is n't because there are n't any , but because they 've decided keeping their sexuality hidden is preferable to the career-ending scorn , ridicule and even physical danger they would face if they came out of the closet . that was the bottom line of a cover story by the popular german soccer magazine rund last month which interviewed players who kept their homosexuality tightly under wraps . " soccer is still unbelievably backward when it comes to homosexuality .
gays on the pitch remain a huge taboo , " said rainer schäfer , chief editor at rund , who spent two years researching the topic and winning the trust of two gay players in the two highest german soccer leagues .
they eventually agreed to tell their stories provided they remained anonymous . creating a ' normal ' image both spoke of going to great lengths to hide their sexuality from their clubs , managers and teammates and living in constant fear of being discovered . one player , who is married , said even his wife had no idea he was gay and that he was involved in a long-term relationship with a childhood friend .
" but what am i to do ?
coming out would mean death , " he was quoted as saying in the article . the other gay player profiled said that a female friend in the know often accompanied him to club celebrations and parties to give the impression that he was straight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supermodel heidi klum added some glamour to the world cup last year clubs also sometimes step in if gay rumors persistently circulate around a player .
they usually enlist pr agencies to create a " normal " heterosexual image for the player , which includes parading hired models and kids around the players during publicity events . " constructing a fake identity and an elaborate web of lies takes a heavy toll on the players and does n't make it easier for them to focus on their game , " said schäfer , who added he was taken aback by how widespread homophobia continued to be in the soccer world . germany , in fact , is considered fairly liberal regarding gay rights .
same-sex unions are legal here and it 's not unusual to see high-profile personalities open about their sexuality .
berlin 's mayor , for example , is gay and appears at functions with his partner . macho attitudes though there are no figures on the number of gay players in germany , tatjana eggeling from the institute of cultural anthropology and european ethnology at the university of göttingen said she estimated there were about 30 in the top two leagues . that guess is based on statistics that say around 5 to 10 percent of the adult population in germany is gay or lesbian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rough and tumble soccer only for tough virile men , goes a cliche eggeling added that a combination of macho attitudes and prejudices is to blame for the enduring gay taboo in soccer . " sport is one of the most conservative fields in society .
it 's still dominated by men and 19th century values such as honor and bravery as male virtues , " said eggeling .
" soccer does n't allow you to be different . " she pointed out that being homosexual was often equated in sport with being effeminate and weak - a view that is perpetuated in soccer clubs with players calling their colleagues " pansy " or " fag " the moment they show any weakness . learning from britain ? apart from the straights-only attitude within clubs , some say homophobia in stadiums - in the form of chanting and jeering - remains a problem that has n't been taken seriously in germany by either the clubs or the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justin fashanu played for norwich , nottingham forests and hearts many point to britain as an example of a country that has taken steps to address the problem .
in 2001 , the football association - four years after the suicide of britain 's only openly gay player , justin fashanu - changed its charter , which imposed penalties for sexually discriminatory behavior .
recently two norwich city fans were sentenced to time in jail for violating those rules . but a spokesman for the dfb who declined to be named said the german association 's charter did not penalize sexually discriminatory behavior and said he did not see why it needed to . some say it 's this refusal by the authorities to even acknowledge there is a problem that makes it difficult for gay players to come out of the closet .

politicians , pop stars and artists coming out of the closet hardly raise eyebrows in germany .
but it 's an entirely different ballgame on the soccer field , where being openly gay remains strictly taboo . german professional soccer has n't seen a gay player to date .
at least not officially .
that is n't because there are n't any , but because they 've decided keeping their sexuality hidden is preferable to the career-ending scorn , ridicule and even physical danger they would face if they came out of the closet . that was the bottom line of a cover story by the popular german soccer magazine rund last month which interviewed players who kept their homosexuality tightly under wraps . " soccer is still unbelievably backward when it comes to homosexuality .
gays on the pitch remain a huge taboo , " said rainer schäfer , chief editor at rund , who spent two years researching the topic and winning the trust of two gay players in the two highest german soccer leagues .
they eventually agreed to tell their stories provided they remained anonymous . creating a ' normal ' image both spoke of going to great lengths to hide their sexuality from their clubs , managers and teammates and living in constant fear of being discovered . one player , who is married , said even his wife had no idea he was gay and that he was involved in a long-term relationship with a childhood friend .
" but what am i to do ?
coming out would mean death , " he was quoted as saying in the article . the other gay player profiled said that a female friend in the know often accompanied him to club celebrations and parties to give the impression that he was straight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supermodel heidi klum added some glamour to the world cup last year clubs also sometimes step in if gay rumors persistently circulate around a player .
they usually enlist pr agencies to create a " normal " heterosexual image for the player , which includes parading hired models and kids around the players during publicity events . " constructing a fake identity and an elaborate web of lies takes a heavy toll on the players and does n't make it easier for them to focus on their game , " said schäfer , who added he was taken aback by how widespread homophobia continued to be in the soccer world . germany , in fact , is considered fairly liberal regarding gay rights .
same-sex unions are legal here and it 's not unusual to see high-profile personalities open about their sexuality .
berlin 's mayor , for example , is gay and appears at functions with his partner . macho attitudes though there are no figures on the number of gay players in germany , tatjana eggeling from the institute of cultural anthropology and european ethnology at the university of göttingen said she estimated there were about 30 in the top two leagues . that guess is based on statistics that say around 5 to 10 percent of the adult population in germany is gay or lesbian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rough and tumble soccer only for tough virile men , goes a cliche eggeling added that a combination of macho attitudes and prejudices is to blame for the enduring gay taboo in soccer . " sport is one of the most conservative fields in society .
it 's still dominated by men and 19th century values such as honor and bravery as male virtues , " said eggeling .
" soccer does n't allow you to be different . " she pointed out that being homosexual was often equated in sport with being effeminate and weak - a view that is perpetuated in soccer clubs with players calling their colleagues " pansy " or " fag " the moment they show any weakness . learning from britain ? apart from the straights-only attitude within clubs , some say homophobia in stadiums - in the form of chanting and jeering - remains a problem that has n't been taken seriously in germany by either the clubs or the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justin fashanu played for norwich , nottingham forests and hearts many point to britain as an example of a country that has taken steps to address the problem .
in 2001 , the football association - four years after the suicide of britain 's only openly gay player , justin fashanu - changed its charter , which imposed penalties for sexually discriminatory behavior .
recently two norwich city fans were sentenced to time in jail for violating those rules . but a spokesman for the dfb who declined to be named said the german association 's charter did not penalize sexually discriminatory behavior and said he did not see why it needed to . some say it 's this refusal by the authorities to even acknowledge there is a problem that makes it difficult for gay players to come out of the closet .
things are made worse by straight players often refusing to acknowledge publicly that they have gay teammates . " it would be a big help if heterosexual players would stand up and say ' i have a gay colleague on the team and he plays great soccer , that 's it , " ' said eggeling .

she stressed the need for progress on an eu constitution but also the fight against religious extremism . ahead of the address , eu watchers were most curious about what the german chancellor would propose to end the stalemate over the bloc 's proposed constitution , which failed to pass national referenda in france and the netherlands last year .
but merkel began her speech by stressing diversity as a core european value , saying the eu had to be vigorous in defending its freedoms . " tolerance , " merkel said in one of the speech 's central lines , " is the soul of europe . "
among the liberties in need of protection , she cited freedom to voice opinions that upset others , freedom to believe or not to believe in religion and freedom of artistic expression . " europe , " she said , " should never have the slightest understanding for intolerance , for violence by right-or left-wing extremists or violence carried out in the name of a religion . " " tolerance , " she added , " digs its own grave , if it does not defend itself against intolerance .

" failure would be a historic mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes for more harmony among eu member states merkel promised to present a plan to end the deadlock over the eu constitution by the end of germany 's presidency this june .
but she did not specify what form a proposed solution might take , other than to say that the bloc needed " clear descriptions about the authority of the eu and of the national states . " eighteen member states have ratified the constitution , and eu experts think that germany will negotiate with the remaining nine about what would have be removed from the treaty for it to be passed , preferably without national referenda . merkel called for the issue to be resolved before the next eu parliamentary elections in 2009 , warning that failure to do so would be " a historic mistake . "
she also stressed the need for the eu to have a foreign minister . " the time for deliberation is over , " she said .
" we have to reach new decisions . " closer ties to the us and less bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting the bloc 's bloated bureaucracy will be one of merkel 's main tasks merkel said the eu needed to cooperate more with the us on the issue of climate change in the efforts to achieve a global environmental treat by the year 2012 . " access to energy and protecting the climate , " she said , " are two challenges affecting all of humanity in our age . " she also said the bloc should strength its economic ties with the us .
america , she said , was still the eu 's most important trading partner , adding " a common trans-atlantic is very much in european interests . " in addition , merkel stressed the need to get rid of bureaucracy , saying it was crucial to creating jobs - an issue very much on people 's minds here in germany .

" she pointed out that being homosexual was often equated in sport with being effeminate and weak - a view that is perpetuated in soccer clubs with players calling their colleagues " pansy " or " fag " the moment they show any weakness . learning from britain ? apart from the straights-only attitude within clubs , some say homophobia in stadiums - in the form of chanting and jeering - remains a problem that has n't been taken seriously in germany by either the clubs or the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justin fashanu played for norwich , nottingham forests and hearts many point to britain as an example of a country that has taken steps to address the problem .
in 2001 , the football association - four years after the suicide of britain 's only openly gay player , justin fashanu - changed its charter , which imposed penalties for sexually discriminatory behavior .
recently two norwich city fans were sentenced to time in jail for violating those rules . but a spokesman for the dfb who declined to be named said the german association 's charter did not penalize sexually discriminatory behavior and said he did not see why it needed to . some say it 's this refusal by the authorities to even acknowledge there is a problem that makes it difficult for gay players to come out of the closet .
things are made worse by straight players often refusing to acknowledge publicly that they have gay teammates . " it would be a big help if heterosexual players would stand up and say ' i have a gay colleague on the team and he plays great soccer , that 's it , " ' said eggeling . " as things stand now , i would n't advise a single german soccer player to come out because it would be just too much of a risk for him , both for his career and personal life , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corny littmann is the only openly gay figure in the german soccer world corny littmann , president of hamburg 's st. pauli club and the only openly gay figure on germany 's soccer circuit , told german news agency dpa last year he did not expect any player to come out anytime soon . " if one did come out , there would be a media frenzy .
i do n't know how a 20- or 25-year-old would handle it , " littmann said , adding the player would be the target of abuse both on and off the pitch .
" being gay just frightens people . " " soccer is everything , even gay " so far even the handful of gay and lesbian fan clubs attached to the bundesliga has been unable to put an end to homophobic behavior in stadiums . gerd eiserbeck , a member of hertha junxx - the first gay and lesbian bundesliga fan club in germany - said that though their debut in 2001 had initially led to some " verbal confrontation " between ostensibly straight hertha bsc fans and gay fans , they were now largely accepted .
even their rainbow-colored banner reading " soccer is everything , even gay , " is tolerated in berlin 's olympia stadium , said eiserbeck . " but we still do n't travel to away games , " he said .
" that 's too risky because we do n't know how the opposing fans will react . " more discussion needed despite the odds , some believe that pushing the topic into the public consciousness and keeping it there will eventually create enough pressure on the dfb to deal with it . " remember that 's exactly what happened with racism .
the dfb eventually gave in to the campaigns and imposed harsh penalties for racist behavior , " said schäfer . " the same could happen with homophobia , hopefully .

she stressed the need for progress on an eu constitution but also the fight against religious extremism . ahead of the address , eu watchers were most curious about what the german chancellor would propose to end the stalemate over the bloc 's proposed constitution , which failed to pass national referenda in france and the netherlands last year .
but merkel began her speech by stressing diversity as a core european value , saying the eu had to be vigorous in defending its freedoms . " tolerance , " merkel said in one of the speech 's central lines , " is the soul of europe . "
among the liberties in need of protection , she cited freedom to voice opinions that upset others , freedom to believe or not to believe in religion and freedom of artistic expression . " europe , " she said , " should never have the slightest understanding for intolerance , for violence by right-or left-wing extremists or violence carried out in the name of a religion . " " tolerance , " she added , " digs its own grave , if it does not defend itself against intolerance . " such remarks could hardly have failed to remind listeners of the threat of islamist terrorism as well as last year 's controversy over danish caricatures depicting the prophet mohammed , which some muslims found offensive . " failure would be a historic mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes for more harmony among eu member states merkel promised to present a plan to end the deadlock over the eu constitution by the end of germany 's presidency this june .
but she did not specify what form a proposed solution might take , other than to say that the bloc needed " clear descriptions about the authority of the eu and of the national states . " eighteen member states have ratified the constitution , and eu experts think that germany will negotiate with the remaining nine about what would have be removed from the treaty for it to be passed , preferably without national referenda . merkel called for the issue to be resolved before the next eu parliamentary elections in 2009 , warning that failure to do so would be " a historic mistake . "
she also stressed the need for the eu to have a foreign minister . " the time for deliberation is over , " she said .
" we have to reach new decisions . " closer ties to the us and less bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting the bloc 's bloated bureaucracy will be one of merkel 's main tasks merkel said the eu needed to cooperate more with the us on the issue of climate change in the efforts to achieve a global environmental treat by the year 2012 . " access to energy and protecting the climate , " she said , " are two challenges affecting all of humanity in our age . " she also said the bloc should strength its economic ties with the us .
america , she said , was still the eu 's most important trading partner , adding " a common trans-atlantic is very much in european interests . " in addition , merkel stressed the need to get rid of bureaucracy , saying it was crucial to creating jobs - an issue very much on people 's minds here in germany . " one thing is certain , " she said , " a slow-paced , bureaucratic and quarrelling europe will not be able to cope with the tasks that have to be dealt with .

it was the latest in series of small earthquakes over the past month caused by the swiss deep heat mining project . the geothermal project , which was launched in 1996 under the auspices of the swiss federal office of energy , involves drilling the country 's first exploratory borehole and injecting pressurized water more than 5000 meters -lrb- 16,400 feet -rrb- underground . but that has caused the earth to move in what is normally an area of geological calm .

local authorities in basel are set to meet at the end of january to debate the project , which was supposed to provide heat and energy for thousands of home in basel .

" it is important to be as inclusive as possible with russia , although that does not necessarily mean as comprehensive as possible , " an eu diplomat said , according to afp news service . russia is a long-time ally of serbia and both believe that not enough time has been given to talks on how much autonomy kosovo should win , which started almost a year ago but were halted in october for lack of progress . kosovo albanians insist they will accept nothing short of independence , but belgrade is offering only " broad autonomy , " saying it would never accept secession . eu foreign policy chief javier solana " has been in touch with all levels in russia " including president vladimir putin , another eu official told afp , also on condition of anonymity . " we are doing as much as possible to ensure that this period , which is not going to be easy , is developing as smoothly as possible , " she said . making the deal acceptable to belgrade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian prime minister kostunica says no country would willingly give up a part of its territory reports quoting a serbian government statement said that putin had promised to veto any initiative in the un security council which belgrade rejects during a telephone call with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica . kosovo , defined by serbia 's constitution as an integral part of its territory , has been run by the united nations since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign ended a crackdown by belgrade on separatist ethnic albanians there . un envoy martti ahtisaari had been expected to make proposals on kosovo 's future status late last year , but he has pushed back publication of his recommendations until after elections in serbia on sunday . to accommodate russia , the eu has offered its support to a proposal of new talks in vienna , perhaps in march , between kosovo and serbian authorities and led by ahtisaari .

he could now get off with a fine and a suspended sentence . once one of the country 's most respected managers , hartz , 65 , was accused of sanctioning illegal bonuses while director of volkswagen 's human resources department .
the payments were allegedly used to finance lavish foreign trips , mainly by the head of the company 's works council , klaus volkert , and his south american mistress .
other charges relate to visits to brothels and sex parties financed with company funds . hartz , who played a key role in drafting germany 's labor and social welfare reforms under former chancellor gerhard schröder , left the company in july 2005 .
he admitted in october to " a criminal responsibility for giving preferential treatment to the former works council head .

this included allegations about flying around high-class prostitutes . the charges against hartz came after an 18-month investigation , which has also seen the indictment of hans-juergen uhl , a former member of the works council , who is also a member of parliament in berlin . uhl , who represents the co-governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , has been indicted on two counts of being an accessory to fraud and five counts of making false statements under oath . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus volkert volkert was arrested last year because of concerns about the suppression of evidence , but released after two months . the former works council chief is alleged to have been paid illegal bonuses worth 1.9 million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- by hartz between 1994 and 2005 .

he could now get off with a fine and a suspended sentence . once one of the country 's most respected managers , hartz , 65 , was accused of sanctioning illegal bonuses while director of volkswagen 's human resources department .
the payments were allegedly used to finance lavish foreign trips , mainly by the head of the company 's works council , klaus volkert , and his south american mistress .
other charges relate to visits to brothels and sex parties financed with company funds . hartz , who played a key role in drafting germany 's labor and social welfare reforms under former chancellor gerhard schröder , left the company in july 2005 .
he admitted in october to " a criminal responsibility for giving preferential treatment to the former works council head .

this included allegations about flying around high-class prostitutes . the charges against hartz came after an 18-month investigation , which has also seen the indictment of hans-juergen uhl , a former member of the works council , who is also a member of parliament in berlin . uhl , who represents the co-governing social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , has been indicted on two counts of being an accessory to fraud and five counts of making false statements under oath . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus volkert volkert was arrested last year because of concerns about the suppression of evidence , but released after two months . the former works council chief is alleged to have been paid illegal bonuses worth 1.9 million euros -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- by hartz between 1994 and 2005 .

she stressed the need for progress on an eu constitution but also the fight against religious extremism . ahead of the address , eu watchers were most curious about what the german chancellor would propose to end the stalemate over the bloc 's proposed constitution , which failed to pass national referenda in france and the netherlands last year .
but merkel began her speech by stressing diversity as a core european value , saying the eu had to be vigorous in defending its freedoms . " tolerance , " merkel said in one of the speech 's central lines , " is the soul of europe . "
among the liberties in need of protection , she cited freedom to voice opinions that upset others , freedom to believe or not to believe in religion and freedom of artistic expression . " europe , " she said , " should never have the slightest understanding for intolerance , for violence by right-or left-wing extremists or violence carried out in the name of a religion . " " tolerance , " she added , " digs its own grave , if it does not defend itself against intolerance . " such remarks could hardly have failed to remind listeners of the threat of islamist terrorism as well as last year 's controversy over danish caricatures depicting the prophet mohammed , which some muslims found offensive . " failure would be a historic mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes for more harmony among eu member states merkel promised to present a plan to end the deadlock over the eu constitution by the end of germany 's presidency this june .
but she did not specify what form a proposed solution might take , other than to say that the bloc needed " clear descriptions about the authority of the eu and of the national states . " eighteen member states have ratified the constitution , and eu experts think that germany will negotiate with the remaining nine about what would have be removed from the treaty for it to be passed , preferably without national referenda . merkel called for the issue to be resolved before the next eu parliamentary elections in 2009 , warning that failure to do so would be " a historic mistake . "
she also stressed the need for the eu to have a foreign minister . " the time for deliberation is over , " she said .
" we have to reach new decisions . " closer ties to the us and less bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting the bloc 's bloated bureaucracy will be one of merkel 's main tasks merkel said the eu needed to cooperate more with the us on the issue of climate change in the efforts to achieve a global environmental treat by the year 2012 . " access to energy and protecting the climate , " she said , " are two challenges affecting all of humanity in our age . " she also said the bloc should strength its economic ties with the us .
america , she said , was still the eu 's most important trading partner , adding " a common trans-atlantic is very much in european interests . " in addition , merkel stressed the need to get rid of bureaucracy , saying it was crucial to creating jobs - an issue very much on people 's minds here in germany . " one thing is certain , " she said , " a slow-paced , bureaucratic and quarrelling europe will not be able to cope with the tasks that have to be dealt with .

politicians , pop stars and artists coming out of the closet hardly raise eyebrows in germany .
but it 's an entirely different ballgame on the soccer field , where being openly gay remains strictly taboo . german professional soccer has n't seen a gay player to date .
at least not officially .
that is n't because there are n't any , but because they 've decided keeping their sexuality hidden is preferable to the career-ending scorn , ridicule and even physical danger they would face if they came out of the closet . that was the bottom line of a cover story by the popular german soccer magazine rund last month which interviewed players who kept their homosexuality tightly under wraps . " soccer is still unbelievably backward when it comes to homosexuality .
gays on the pitch remain a huge taboo , " said rainer schäfer , chief editor at rund , who spent two years researching the topic and winning the trust of two gay players in the two highest german soccer leagues .
they eventually agreed to tell their stories provided they remained anonymous . creating a ' normal ' image both spoke of going to great lengths to hide their sexuality from their clubs , managers and teammates and living in constant fear of being discovered . one player , who is married , said even his wife had no idea he was gay and that he was involved in a long-term relationship with a childhood friend .
" but what am i to do ?
coming out would mean death , " he was quoted as saying in the article . the other gay player profiled said that a female friend in the know often accompanied him to club celebrations and parties to give the impression that he was straight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german supermodel heidi klum added some glamour to the world cup last year clubs also sometimes step in if gay rumors persistently circulate around a player .
they usually enlist pr agencies to create a " normal " heterosexual image for the player , which includes parading hired models and kids around the players during publicity events . " constructing a fake identity and an elaborate web of lies takes a heavy toll on the players and does n't make it easier for them to focus on their game , " said schäfer , who added he was taken aback by how widespread homophobia continued to be in the soccer world . germany , in fact , is considered fairly liberal regarding gay rights .
same-sex unions are legal here and it 's not unusual to see high-profile personalities open about their sexuality .
berlin 's mayor , for example , is gay and appears at functions with his partner . macho attitudes though there are no figures on the number of gay players in germany , tatjana eggeling from the institute of cultural anthropology and european ethnology at the university of göttingen said she estimated there were about 30 in the top two leagues . that guess is based on statistics that say around 5 to 10 percent of the adult population in germany is gay or lesbian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rough and tumble soccer only for tough virile men , goes a cliche eggeling added that a combination of macho attitudes and prejudices is to blame for the enduring gay taboo in soccer . " sport is one of the most conservative fields in society .
it 's still dominated by men and 19th century values such as honor and bravery as male virtues , " said eggeling .
" soccer does n't allow you to be different . " she pointed out that being homosexual was often equated in sport with being effeminate and weak - a view that is perpetuated in soccer clubs with players calling their colleagues " pansy " or " fag " the moment they show any weakness . learning from britain ? apart from the straights-only attitude within clubs , some say homophobia in stadiums - in the form of chanting and jeering - remains a problem that has n't been taken seriously in germany by either the clubs or the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justin fashanu played for norwich , nottingham forests and hearts many point to britain as an example of a country that has taken steps to address the problem .
in 2001 , the football association - four years after the suicide of britain 's only openly gay player , justin fashanu - changed its charter , which imposed penalties for sexually discriminatory behavior .
recently two norwich city fans were sentenced to time in jail for violating those rules . but a spokesman for the dfb who declined to be named said the german association 's charter did not penalize sexually discriminatory behavior and said he did not see why it needed to . some say it 's this refusal by the authorities to even acknowledge there is a problem that makes it difficult for gay players to come out of the closet .
things are made worse by straight players often refusing to acknowledge publicly that they have gay teammates . " it would be a big help if heterosexual players would stand up and say ' i have a gay colleague on the team and he plays great soccer , that 's it , " ' said eggeling . " as things stand now , i would n't advise a single german soccer player to come out because it would be just too much of a risk for him , both for his career and personal life , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corny littmann is the only openly gay figure in the german soccer world corny littmann , president of hamburg 's st. pauli club and the only openly gay figure on germany 's soccer circuit , told german news agency dpa last year he did not expect any player to come out anytime soon . " if one did come out , there would be a media frenzy .
i do n't know how a 20- or 25-year-old would handle it , " littmann said , adding the player would be the target of abuse both on and off the pitch .
" being gay just frightens people . " " soccer is everything , even gay " so far even the handful of gay and lesbian fan clubs attached to the bundesliga has been unable to put an end to homophobic behavior in stadiums . gerd eiserbeck , a member of hertha junxx - the first gay and lesbian bundesliga fan club in germany - said that though their debut in 2001 had initially led to some " verbal confrontation " between ostensibly straight hertha bsc fans and gay fans , they were now largely accepted .
even their rainbow-colored banner reading " soccer is everything , even gay , " is tolerated in berlin 's olympia stadium , said eiserbeck . " but we still do n't travel to away games , " he said .
" that 's too risky because we do n't know how the opposing fans will react . " more discussion needed despite the odds , some believe that pushing the topic into the public consciousness and keeping it there will eventually create enough pressure on the dfb to deal with it . " remember that 's exactly what happened with racism .

but not necessarily for those who live near drilling sites , as people along the border between germany , switzerland and france are finding out . emergency services in and around the northern swiss city of basel were flooded with calls on tuesday , as tremors measuring 3.2 in the richter scale shook the region .
it was the latest in series of small earthquakes over the past month caused by the swiss deep heat mining project . the geothermal project , which was launched in 1996 under the auspices of the swiss federal office of energy , involves drilling the country 's first exploratory borehole and injecting pressurized water more than 5000 meters -lrb- 16,400 feet -rrb- underground . but that has caused the earth to move in what is normally an area of geological calm . " the first time around , i was really scared , " said catherine wuest , a shopkeeper in basel .
" it was like a rock fall and glasses were tinkling in the cupboard .
i did n't know what was happening .

" you do n't have the right to play around with the safety of our populations , " he said . geopower , the company heading the project , suspended drilling in december but the tremors continue .
local authorities in basel are set to meet at the end of january to debate the project , which was supposed to provide heat and energy for thousands of home in basel . " we 're a bit nervous of course because the experts ca n't tell us how many tremors we 're in for , " said marc keller , a spokesman for basel 's public works department . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german wind energy business picks up speed for years , wind energy was seen as a sector for unrealistic dreamers that would forever be dependent on hefty subsidies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.01.2007 eu may accept extra kosovo status talks after serbian elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " serbia-kosovo " reads this pro-serbian sign wary of a un security council veto from russia , the eu appears ready to allow more time for talks on the future status of kosovo after serbia elects its new parliament on sunday . " it is important to be as inclusive as possible with russia , although that does not necessarily mean as comprehensive as possible , " an eu diplomat said , according to afp news service . russia is a long-time ally of serbia and both believe that not enough time has been given to talks on how much autonomy kosovo should win , which started almost a year ago but were halted in october for lack of progress . kosovo albanians insist they will accept nothing short of independence , but belgrade is offering only " broad autonomy , " saying it would never accept secession . eu foreign policy chief javier solana " has been in touch with all levels in russia " including president vladimir putin , another eu official told afp , also on condition of anonymity . " we are doing as much as possible to ensure that this period , which is not going to be easy , is developing as smoothly as possible , " she said . making the deal acceptable to belgrade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian prime minister kostunica says no country would willingly give up a part of its territory reports quoting a serbian government statement said that putin had promised to veto any initiative in the un security council which belgrade rejects during a telephone call with serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica . kosovo , defined by serbia 's constitution as an integral part of its territory , has been run by the united nations since 1999 , when a nato bombing campaign ended a crackdown by belgrade on separatist ethnic albanians there . un envoy martti ahtisaari had been expected to make proposals on kosovo 's future status late last year , but he has pushed back publication of his recommendations until after elections in serbia on sunday . to accommodate russia , the eu has offered its support to a proposal of new talks in vienna , perhaps in march , between kosovo and serbian authorities and led by ahtisaari . " this engagement can be very positive , " the eu official said . the talks could run anywhere from two weeks to a month . irreconcilable differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the differences between serbs and kosovo albanians may be impossible to bridge according to an international crisis group expert , they would address russia 's concerns but at the same time demonstrate publicly that the parties are too far apart for their differences to be resolved soon . " this is an attempt to get around what is likely to be a significant blockage at the security council , " said kosovo-based analyst for the think tank alexander anderson . despite albanian cries for full independence and serbia 's refusal to offer anything more than autonomy , experts say that ahtisaari 's proposals will most likely involve a broad , non-specific formula that the united nations will tease out into a clearer degree of autonomy to be introduced over a reasonably long period . " i think there is no other solution than to find a status somewhere between wider autonomy and a programmed independence , " said bernard kouchner , former head of the un 's kosovo mission . a hot election topic the future of kosovo has figured prominently in election campaigning and may even influence how long it takes sunday 's winner to form a new government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cedomir jovanovic says that kosovo is no longer serbian yet most of the players in serbian politics - ranging from the ultra-nationalist radical party to kostunica 's democratic party of serbia and serbian president boris tadic 's democratic party - seem to agree in principle that kosovo should not become an independent country . the most notable exception is a coalition lead by the liberal democratic party -lrb- ldp -rrb- . " we have to accept the reality , " said ldp president and former student leader cedomir jovanovic , " and the reality is that kosovo has been independent from belgrade since 1999 . " ldp , however , is a small player on the serbian political scene and , according to some polls , may barely win the 5 percent of votes necessary to enter the parliament . time is running out if a solution to kosovo 's status is not found in the nearest future , the tensions that have regularly surfaced in kosovo over the last seven years could mount again . the worst case was in march 2004 , when several days of anti-serb riots left 19 people dead , thousands more homeless , and dozens of serbian orthodox monasteries and churches destroyed or damaged . responsibility for kosovo 's future security will fall mostly into the hands of the 27-nation european union . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier warned sunday that stability in the balkans depended on how the future status of kosovo is resolved and said the eu will work to ensure peace in the serbian province .

politicians , pop stars and artists coming out of the closet hardly raise eyebrows in germany .
but it 's an entirely different ballgame on the soccer field , where being openly gay remains strictly taboo . german professional soccer has n't seen a gay player to date .
at least not officially .
that is n't because there are n't any , but because they 've decided keeping their sexuality hidden is preferable to the career-ending scorn , ridicule and even physical danger they would face if they came out of the closet . that was the bottom line of a cover story by the popular german soccer magazine rund last month which interviewed players who kept their homosexuality tightly under wraps . " soccer is still unbelievably backward when it comes to homosexuality .
gays on the pitch remain a huge taboo , " said rainer schäfer , chief editor at rund , who spent two years researching the topic and winning the trust of two gay players in the two highest german soccer leagues .
they eventually agreed to tell their stories provided they remained anonymous . creating a ' normal ' image both spoke of going to great lengths to hide their sexuality from their clubs , managers and teammates and living in constant fear of being discovered . one player , who is married , said even his wife had no idea he was gay and that he was involved in a long-term relationship with a childhood friend .

" constructing a fake identity and an elaborate web of lies takes a heavy toll on the players and does n't make it easier for them to focus on their game , " said schäfer , who added he was taken aback by how widespread homophobia continued to be in the soccer world . germany , in fact , is considered fairly liberal regarding gay rights .
same-sex unions are legal here and it 's not unusual to see high-profile personalities open about their sexuality .
berlin 's mayor , for example , is gay and appears at functions with his partner . macho attitudes though there are no figures on the number of gay players in germany , tatjana eggeling from the institute of cultural anthropology and european ethnology at the university of göttingen said she estimated there were about 30 in the top two leagues . that guess is based on statistics that say around 5 to 10 percent of the adult population in germany is gay or lesbian . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rough and tumble soccer only for tough virile men , goes a cliche eggeling added that a combination of macho attitudes and prejudices is to blame for the enduring gay taboo in soccer .

" she pointed out that being homosexual was often equated in sport with being effeminate and weak - a view that is perpetuated in soccer clubs with players calling their colleagues " pansy " or " fag " the moment they show any weakness . learning from britain ? apart from the straights-only attitude within clubs , some say homophobia in stadiums - in the form of chanting and jeering - remains a problem that has n't been taken seriously in germany by either the clubs or the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justin fashanu played for norwich , nottingham forests and hearts many point to britain as an example of a country that has taken steps to address the problem .
in 2001 , the football association - four years after the suicide of britain 's only openly gay player , justin fashanu - changed its charter , which imposed penalties for sexually discriminatory behavior .
recently two norwich city fans were sentenced to time in jail for violating those rules . but a spokesman for the dfb who declined to be named said the german association 's charter did not penalize sexually discriminatory behavior and said he did not see why it needed to . some say it 's this refusal by the authorities to even acknowledge there is a problem that makes it difficult for gay players to come out of the closet .
things are made worse by straight players often refusing to acknowledge publicly that they have gay teammates . " it would be a big help if heterosexual players would stand up and say ' i have a gay colleague on the team and he plays great soccer , that 's it , " ' said eggeling . " as things stand now , i would n't advise a single german soccer player to come out because it would be just too much of a risk for him , both for his career and personal life , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corny littmann is the only openly gay figure in the german soccer world corny littmann , president of hamburg 's st. pauli club and the only openly gay figure on germany 's soccer circuit , told german news agency dpa last year he did not expect any player to come out anytime soon . " if one did come out , there would be a media frenzy .
i do n't know how a 20- or 25-year-old would handle it , " littmann said , adding the player would be the target of abuse both on and off the pitch .
" being gay just frightens people . " " soccer is everything , even gay " so far even the handful of gay and lesbian fan clubs attached to the bundesliga has been unable to put an end to homophobic behavior in stadiums . gerd eiserbeck , a member of hertha junxx - the first gay and lesbian bundesliga fan club in germany - said that though their debut in 2001 had initially led to some " verbal confrontation " between ostensibly straight hertha bsc fans and gay fans , they were now largely accepted .
even their rainbow-colored banner reading " soccer is everything , even gay , " is tolerated in berlin 's olympia stadium , said eiserbeck . " but we still do n't travel to away games , " he said .
" that 's too risky because we do n't know how the opposing fans will react . " more discussion needed despite the odds , some believe that pushing the topic into the public consciousness and keeping it there will eventually create enough pressure on the dfb to deal with it . " remember that 's exactly what happened with racism .
the dfb eventually gave in to the campaigns and imposed harsh penalties for racist behavior , " said schäfer . " the same could happen with homophobia , hopefully .

but not necessarily for those who live near drilling sites , as people along the border between germany , switzerland and france are finding out . emergency services in and around the northern swiss city of basel were flooded with calls on tuesday , as tremors measuring 3.2 in the richter scale shook the region .
it was the latest in series of small earthquakes over the past month caused by the swiss deep heat mining project . the geothermal project , which was launched in 1996 under the auspices of the swiss federal office of energy , involves drilling the country 's first exploratory borehole and injecting pressurized water more than 5000 meters -lrb- 16,400 feet -rrb- underground . but that has caused the earth to move in what is normally an area of geological calm . " the first time around , i was really scared , " said catherine wuest , a shopkeeper in basel .

" you do n't have the right to play around with the safety of our populations , " he said . geopower , the company heading the project , suspended drilling in december but the tremors continue .
local authorities in basel are set to meet at the end of january to debate the project , which was supposed to provide heat and energy for thousands of home in basel .

she stressed the need for progress on an eu constitution but also the fight against religious extremism . ahead of the address , eu watchers were most curious about what the german chancellor would propose to end the stalemate over the bloc 's proposed constitution , which failed to pass national referenda in france and the netherlands last year .
but merkel began her speech by stressing diversity as a core european value , saying the eu had to be vigorous in defending its freedoms . " tolerance , " merkel said in one of the speech 's central lines , " is the soul of europe . "
among the liberties in need of protection , she cited freedom to voice opinions that upset others , freedom to believe or not to believe in religion and freedom of artistic expression . " europe , " she said , " should never have the slightest understanding for intolerance , for violence by right-or left-wing extremists or violence carried out in the name of a religion . " " tolerance , " she added , " digs its own grave , if it does not defend itself against intolerance . " such remarks could hardly have failed to remind listeners of the threat of islamist terrorism as well as last year 's controversy over danish caricatures depicting the prophet mohammed , which some muslims found offensive . " failure would be a historic mistake " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes for more harmony among eu member states merkel promised to present a plan to end the deadlock over the eu constitution by the end of germany 's presidency this june .
but she did not specify what form a proposed solution might take , other than to say that the bloc needed " clear descriptions about the authority of the eu and of the national states . " eighteen member states have ratified the constitution , and eu experts think that germany will negotiate with the remaining nine about what would have be removed from the treaty for it to be passed , preferably without national referenda . merkel called for the issue to be resolved before the next eu parliamentary elections in 2009 , warning that failure to do so would be " a historic mistake . "
she also stressed the need for the eu to have a foreign minister . " the time for deliberation is over , " she said .
" we have to reach new decisions . " closer ties to the us and less bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting the bloc 's bloated bureaucracy will be one of merkel 's main tasks merkel said the eu needed to cooperate more with the us on the issue of climate change in the efforts to achieve a global environmental treat by the year 2012 . " access to energy and protecting the climate , " she said , " are two challenges affecting all of humanity in our age . " she also said the bloc should strength its economic ties with the us .
america , she said , was still the eu 's most important trading partner , adding " a common trans-atlantic is very much in european interests . " in addition , merkel stressed the need to get rid of bureaucracy , saying it was crucial to creating jobs - an issue very much on people 's minds here in germany . " one thing is certain , " she said , " a slow-paced , bureaucratic and quarrelling europe will not be able to cope with the tasks that have to be dealt with .

the procedure would potentially allow women who have had their wombs damaged or removed to develop a pregnancy and give birth .
the plan is use a womb from a woman who has died .
a womb transplant has been tried once before , in saudi arabia in 2000 , but then the womb came from a live donor , and was rejected after three months . "
if a pregnant uterus rejects you have got a serious medical problem " dr sherman silber infertility expert ethics of non-vital transplants if the new york team are successful , it could bring new hope of becoming a mother to millions of women worldwide , many of whom have had their wombs removed due to illnesses such as cancer .
the new york surgeons have been running trials over the last six months which they say have confirmed that it is possible to remove the wombs of deceased donors in the same way as hearts , kidneys and livers are taken for transplant .
the next step would be to place a donated uterus into a recipient through an incision below the navel .
caesarean section the recipient 's own embryo - which would have been harvested and frozen prior to the treatment - would be transferred into the transplanted womb allowing the pregnancy to develop .
after birth by caesarean section the uterus would be removed to minimise the risk of tissue rejection .
dr giuseppe del priore , who is leading the transplant project , said : " transplant medicine has improved sufficiently to allow us to consider non-vital transplants .
" that is why we are talking about face , hands , and other things as well . "
some in the medical community here are warning that the procedure would be extremely dangerous .
dr sherman silber , an infertility expert from st louis , said : " at any time during the nine months of pregnancy it could very easily reject , and if a pregnant uterus rejects you have got a serious medical problem . "
but the surgeons directly involved believe the risks can be minimised and that many infertile women will enthusiastically pursue the opportunity to give birth to their own child .
hundreds of women have inquired about the procedure at the downtown hospital , and 40 to 50 are currently being screened .
however , a transplant is not expected " any time in the near future " .

the procedure would potentially allow women who have had their wombs damaged or removed to develop a pregnancy and give birth .
the plan is use a womb from a woman who has died .
a womb transplant has been tried once before , in saudi arabia in 2000 , but then the womb came from a live donor , and was rejected after three months .
if a pregnant uterus rejects you have got a serious medical problem dr sherman silber infertility expert ethics of non-vital transplants if the new york team are successful , it could bring new hope of becoming a mother to millions of women worldwide , many of whom have had their wombs removed due to illnesses such as cancer .
the new york surgeons have been running trials over the last six months which they say have confirmed that it is possible to remove the wombs of deceased donors in the same way as hearts , kidneys and livers are taken for transplant .
the next step would be to place a donated uterus into a recipient through an incision below the navel .
caesarean section the recipient 's own embryo - which would have been harvested and frozen prior to the treatment - would be transferred into the transplanted womb allowing the pregnancy to develop .
after birth by caesarean section the uterus would be removed to minimise the risk of tissue rejection .
dr giuseppe del priore , who is leading the transplant project , said : " transplant medicine has improved sufficiently to allow us to consider non-vital transplants .
" that is why we are talking about face , hands , and other things as well . "
some in the medical community here are warning that the procedure would be extremely dangerous .
dr sherman silber , an infertility expert from st louis , said : " at any time during the nine months of pregnancy it could very easily reject , and if a pregnant uterus rejects you have got a serious medical problem . "
but the surgeons directly involved believe the risks can be minimised and that many infertile women will enthusiastically pursue the opportunity to give birth to their own child .
hundreds of women have inquired about the procedure at the downtown hospital , and 40 to 50 are currently being screened .

recruits from all three services - the army , navy and raf - will be trained at the centre together , rather than separately as they are now .
john chisholm , editor of naval power international , says the move is indicative of the increasing emphasis on " tri-service " operations in the battlefield .
the " purple " approach - so-called because it is the colour you get if you mix army green with the light blue of the raf and the dark blue of the navy - involves members from all three forces working closely together .
" if you take a royal navy aircraft carrier then you may have on board army , navy and raf aircrew operating three different types of aircraft , " says mr chisholm .
" within that context ... it may be a good thing to bring people together at the beginning .
" that may be the advantage of -lsb- the academy -rsb- .
they will get to know each other and will be able to operate better together and understand each other 's problems . "
mr chisholm says there are many examples of purple operations around the world today .
" the obvious place it happens is on any navy task group , " he says .
" basra is a good example now .
a lot of the helicopters in basra are navy helicopters - but they are shuttling around guys who are in the army .
" in afghanistan , the vehicles that are there are from the royal marines - they are now training army people on these vehicles . "
presently , most of the armed forces training takes place at more than 20 different bases scattered across the uk - most of them addressing dealing with the needs of just one service .
mr chisholm believes many of these bases , including the main navy training centre at hms collingwood in hampshire , will decline in importance or be closed after the academy is built .
rivalry he anticipates that specialist training will remain , while " skills training " common to all forces - like helicopter maintenance or fire fighting - would be moved to the new training centre .
" what you would want at that sort of academy is what you can train army , air force and navy people in the same way .
" they are going to be operating side-by-side within naval task forces and will have to work together then , " he says . "
what worries me about it is it 's just going to be a desire to save money and the benefits are not going to be realised - but i would hope they are " john chisholm editor , naval power international " there 's a lot of rivalry between units .
you can have detrimental rivalry and some of this will hopefully go if training takes place together at this level . "
according to the ministry of defence website , other areas that could be covered by the new academy include intelligence , languages , communications and computing .
but mr chisholm says there is another major factor in the decision to create the academy - money .
" like any other attempts at reform in the military , attempts to save money are at the bottom of it .
" i 'm still a bit doubtful as to what it will achieve .
if they put it all together you 're going to lose identity in terms of the three services , " he adds .

a central academy may help with " purple " operations mr chisholm says there are many examples of purple operations around the world today .

the man , a british national , was the third to disappear while under a control order , which imposes a type of house arrest on terror suspects .
the individual absconded earlier this month , home secretary john reid said .
tory homeland security spokesman patrick mercer said those who abscond have to be regarded as " dangerous " .
' radicalised ' the orders were brought in for cases where there was not enough evidence to bring suspects to trial .
mr mercer said : " the home office coming up and saying , you know , it 's not so bad , this guy , whoever he is , he 's not much of a threat .
" but surely we were told he was radicalised and had prospects of going overseas to carry out jihad .
there must now be a wholesale review of their effectiveness as part of the long-promised overhaul of anti-terror laws nick clegg lib dems what are control orders ?
" you ca n't have a bloke on a control order and when he absconds say well , he was n't that dangerous really . "
mr reid said there were 18 control orders currently in force .
two men - a british citizen and an iraqi - who absconded at the end of last year are still at large , the statement confirmed .
in the latest case , the suspect absconded shortly after being served with a control order .
mr reid said : " the control order was designed to address the risk posed by an individual who had recently been radicalised and wanted to travel abroad for terrorism-related purposes .
" obligations included a requirement to report daily to a police station , to surrender travel documents and to reside at a specified address .
" the individual is not believed to represent a direct threat to the public in the uk at this time . "
mr reid said public safety was the " top priority " for the police and government .
review due he said police were trying to track down the suspect and " an anonymity order is in place " .
after consulting the police , the government is not seeking to overturn the order , added mr reid .
a home office spokesman said : " control orders are essential where it is not possible to prosecute individuals for terrorism-related activity and , in the case of foreign nationals , where they can not be removed from the uk .
" however , we have always made clear that control orders were introduced as a next best alternative for dealing with suspected terrorists .
" we have sought stronger controls to deal with suspected terrorists who can not be prosecuted , but have been prevented by parliament and the courts . "
liberal democrat home affairs spokesman nick clegg said a " wholesale review " was needed .

the man , a british national , was the third to disappear while under a control order , which imposes a type of house arrest on terror suspects .
the individual absconded earlier this month , home secretary john reid said .
tory homeland security spokesman patrick mercer said those who abscond have to be regarded as " dangerous " .
' radicalised ' the orders were brought in for cases where there was not enough evidence to bring suspects to trial .
mr mercer said : " the home office coming up and saying , you know , it 's not so bad , this guy , whoever he is , he 's not much of a threat .
" but surely we were told he was radicalised and had prospects of going overseas to carry out jihad .

" you ca n't have a bloke on a control order and when he absconds say well , he was n't that dangerous really . "
mr reid said there were 18 control orders currently in force .
two men - a british citizen and an iraqi - who absconded at the end of last year are still at large , the statement confirmed .
in the latest case , the suspect absconded shortly after being served with a control order .
mr reid said : " the control order was designed to address the risk posed by an individual who had recently been radicalised and wanted to travel abroad for terrorism-related purposes .
" obligations included a requirement to report daily to a police station , to surrender travel documents and to reside at a specified address .
" the individual is not believed to represent a direct threat to the public in the uk at this time . "
mr reid said public safety was the " top priority " for the police and government .
review due he said police were trying to track down the suspect and " an anonymity order is in place " .
after consulting the police , the government is not seeking to overturn the order , added mr reid .
a home office spokesman said : " control orders are essential where it is not possible to prosecute individuals for terrorism-related activity and , in the case of foreign nationals , where they can not be removed from the uk .
" however , we have always made clear that control orders were introduced as a next best alternative for dealing with suspected terrorists .

the man , a british national , was the third to disappear while under a control order , which imposes a type of house arrest on terror suspects .
the individual absconded earlier this month , home secretary john reid said .
tory homeland security spokesman patrick mercer said those who abscond have to be regarded as " dangerous " .
' radicalised ' the orders were brought in for cases where there was not enough evidence to bring suspects to trial .
mr mercer said : " the home office coming up and saying , you know , it 's not so bad , this guy , whoever he is , he 's not much of a threat .
" but surely we were told he was radicalised and had prospects of going overseas to carry out jihad .
there must now be a wholesale review of their effectiveness as part of the long-promised overhaul of anti-terror laws nick clegg lib dems what are control orders ?
" you ca n't have a bloke on a control order and when he absconds say well , he was n't that dangerous really . "
mr reid said there were 18 control orders currently in force .
two men - a british citizen and an iraqi - who absconded at the end of last year are still at large , the statement confirmed .
in the latest case , the suspect absconded shortly after being served with a control order .
mr reid said : " the control order was designed to address the risk posed by an individual who had recently been radicalised and wanted to travel abroad for terrorism-related purposes .
" obligations included a requirement to report daily to a police station , to surrender travel documents and to reside at a specified address .
" the individual is not believed to represent a direct threat to the public in the uk at this time . "
mr reid said public safety was the " top priority " for the police and government .
review due he said police were trying to track down the suspect and " an anonymity order is in place " .
after consulting the police , the government is not seeking to overturn the order , added mr reid .
a home office spokesman said : " control orders are essential where it is not possible to prosecute individuals for terrorism-related activity and , in the case of foreign nationals , where they can not be removed from the uk .
" however , we have always made clear that control orders were introduced as a next best alternative for dealing with suspected terrorists .
" we have sought stronger controls to deal with suspected terrorists who can not be prosecuted , but have been prevented by parliament and the courts . "
liberal democrat home affairs spokesman nick clegg said a " wholesale review " was needed .
" control orders were the centrepiece of the government 's anti-terrorist strategy , " he said .

abu sulaiman , also known as jainal antal sali , was fatally wounded in a clash with soldiers on the southern island of jolo , the army 's chief said .
sulaiman had a $ 5m bounty placed on his head by the us , in part for the 2001 abduction of a group of tourists on the island of palawan .
the kidnapping resulted in the deaths of two americans and several others .
sulaiman is also believed to have been involved in the bombing of a passenger ferry in the central philippines in 2004 , which killed at least 100 people .
military offensive philippines military chief gen hermogenes esperon said sulaiman had been killed on tuesday during a fierce gun battle between troops and up to 60 abu sayyaf fighters .
who are the abu sayyaf ?
" we have resolved that this group and their major commanders must be finished off , that this notorious group should see its end , " he said , according to the ap news agency .
gen esperon then put a cross through sulaiman 's photo on a wanted poster .
abu sayyaf is thought to have links with both al-qaeda and the regional militant group jemaah islamiah , and has been blamed for a number of kidnappings and bombings in the region .
late last month , the military said the head of the group , khaddafy janjalani , might have been killed in september , but this has yet to be confirmed .
like sulaiman , khaddafy janjalani - the younger brother of abu sayyaf founder abdurajak abubakar janjalani - is also on a us wanted list .
philippine troops backed by the us began an offensive on jolo in august last year , in an attempt to capture mr janjalani and indonesian terrorism suspects dulmatin and umar patek , who are thought to be in the region .

abu sulaiman , also known as jainal antal sali , was fatally wounded in a clash with soldiers on the southern island of jolo , the army 's chief said .
sulaiman had a $ 5m bounty placed on his head by the us , in part for the 2001 abduction of a group of tourists on the island of palawan .
the kidnapping resulted in the deaths of two americans and several others .
sulaiman is also believed to have been involved in the bombing of a passenger ferry in the central philippines in 2004 , which killed at least 100 people .
military offensive philippines military chief gen hermogenes esperon said sulaiman had been killed on tuesday during a fierce gun battle between troops and up to 60 abu sayyaf fighters .
who are the abu sayyaf ?
" we have resolved that this group and their major commanders must be finished off , that this notorious group should see its end , " he said , according to the ap news agency .
gen esperon then put a cross through sulaiman 's photo on a wanted poster .
abu sayyaf is thought to have links with both al-qaeda and the regional militant group jemaah islamiah , and has been blamed for a number of kidnappings and bombings in the region .
late last month , the military said the head of the group , khaddafy janjalani , might have been killed in september , but this has yet to be confirmed .
like sulaiman , khaddafy janjalani - the younger brother of abu sayyaf founder abdurajak abubakar janjalani - is also on a us wanted list .
philippine troops backed by the us began an offensive on jolo in august last year , in an attempt to capture mr janjalani and indonesian terrorism suspects dulmatin and umar patek , who are thought to be in the region .

2003 el61 is a large , dense , rugby-ball-shaped hunk of rock with a fast rotation rate .
professor mike brown has calculated that the object could be due a close encounter with the planet neptune .
if so , neptune 's gravity could catapult it into the inner solar system as a short-period comet .
" if you came back in two million years , el61 could well be a comet , " said professor brown , from the california institute of technology -lrb- caltech -rrb- in pasadena .
" when it becomes a comet , it will be the brightest we will ever see . "
cosmic oddball 2003 el61 is a large object ; it is as big as pluto along its longest dimension .
it is one of the largest of a swarm of icy objects that inhabit a region of the outer solar system known as the kuiper belt .
but it is extremely unusual : spinning on its axis every four hours , it has developed an elongated shape .
2003 el61 is apparently composed of rock with just a thin veneer of water-ice covering its surface .
other kuiper belt objects -lrb- kbos -rrb- contain much more water-ice .
professor brown 's computer simulations show that the object is on a very unstable orbit and set for a close encounter with neptune .
the eighth planet 's gravitational force could either sling the icy rock ball into the inner solar system as a comet , out into the distant oort cloud region , or even into interstellar space .
orbits of kuiper belt objects tend to be very stable , but the region is thought to be a reservoir for short-period comets .
occasionally , some of these objects must get tossed inward to become the fizzing lumps of ice and dust that criss-cross our cosmic neighbourhood .
shedding surface mike brown and his colleagues have come up with a scenario to explain 2003 el61 's physical characteristics and behaviour .
about 4.5 billion years ago , the object that became 2003 el61 was a ball , half composed of ice and half of rock - like pluto - and about the same size as pluto .
some time early in its history , it was smacked , edge on , by another large kbo .
this broke off much of 2003 el61 's icy mantle , which coalesced to form several satellites .
as expected , the satellites seem to be composed of very pure water-ice .
professor brown suggested that some of 2003 el61 's mantle may already have made it into the inner solar system as cometary material .
the oblique impact also caused 2003 el61 to spin rapidly .
this rapid rotation elongated 2003 el61 into the rugby ball shape we see today .
" it 's a bit like the story of mercury , " professor brown explained .
" mercury got hit by a large object early in the solar system .
it left mostly a big iron core , with a little bit of rock on the outside .
this is mostly a rock core with a little bit of ice on the outside . "
mike brown outlined details of his work during a plenary lecture at the recent american astronomical society meeting in seattle .

minogue stopped a gig at the city 's men arena after an hour on saturday , telling fans she had a cold .
the 39-year-old has denied ignoring doctors ' orders in returning to the stage , adding she is " overjoyed " to be fit enough to come back .
the concert has now been rescheduled for tuesday 23 january .
shows on monday and tuesday were then called off after doctors diagnosed her with a respiratory infection .
those concerts have also been rescheduled for sunday 21 january and monday 22 january .
' terrible flu ' minogue said : " i was hoping to feel better as the day progressed , unfortunately the opposite was true .
i 'm sorry too for all those inconvenienced by the postponements . "
" nearly all of my crew were hit by this terrible flu during the course of this tour and despite my best efforts i too succumbed last week , " she added .
the singer was forced to postpone the original showgirl world tour after she was diagnosed with breast cancer in may 2005 .
following her recovery she launched the uk leg of her showgirl homecoming tour on new year 's eve .
she performed seven nights at wembley arena in london before embarking on the manchester leg of the tour .
her current stage show is less energetic than previous concerts and has a built-in interval because she is not yet fully fit .
minogue 's record company , parlophone , has said she is working on material which could be released in 2007 .
