bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer-generated image of a typical 19th century jewish street in a polish town " over the past 900 years , our histories have been entangled , " polish president lech told dignitaries and onlookers standing in front of the imposing black marble warsaw ghetto uprising memorial , commemorating the 1943 doomed rebellion by members of the jewish fighting organization -lrb- zob -rrb- .
" there have been good times and bad .
but the history of the polish jews is a part of the history of my country , my nation .
it is a history that deserves being commemorated , " he said .
the land-mark museum is appropriately located in warsaw , " the greatest jewish city in europe " prior to world war ii , kaczynski said .
the warsaw ghetto before the war , poland 's jewish minority numbered some 3.5 million and accounted for roughly 10 per cent of the country 's pre- war population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish life in poland was almost completely obliterated by nazis the ground-breaking ceremonies were conducted in an district of warsaw that was at the heart of jewish life prior to the war .
tragically , it was enclosed inside the infamous wartime jewish ghetto created by nazi germany as part of its systematic genocide against european jews .
the nazi german ghettos and death camps claimed the vast majority of poland 's jews .
the number accounts for half of the six million europeans of jewish ancestry killed by nazi dictator adolf hitler 's third reich .
europe was home to some 11 million jews prior to the holocaust .
biblical proportions designed by finnish architectural duo rainer mahlamäki and ilmari lahdelma , the museum 's entrance promises to be of biblical proportions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new museum will be facing the warsaw ghetto memorial a symbolically ruptured facade will open up to monumental undulating walls alluding to the old testament 's miraculous parting of the red sea through which the prophet moses led the jews to escape captivity in egypt to a new life in the promised land .
it is a labor of love for project director jerzy halberstadt and head of the warsaw-based jewish historical institute and holocaust survivor marian turski .
holocaust and jewish history expert israel gutman will supervise the team preparing expositions .
" this will be a museum about life that will benefit dialogue and the future , " halberstadt said , adding that the institution aimed to attract a half million visitors a year .
financed by by the polish government , the city of warsaw and the european union , the project is slated to cost around $ 65 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- , according to news agency ap .
measuring a total of 18,000 square meters -lrb- 59,000 square feet -rrb- , the museum will be one of the largest jewish museums in the world - along with yad vashem in jerusalem and the holocaust memorial in washington dc . dw staff with agency reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german politicians disagree over whether germany should focus on attracting foreign workers or on improving the skills of the domestic workforce . the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released a study earlier this week which showed germany had brought in 13,000 fewer legal immigrants in 2005 compared with a year earlier .
other studies have shown that highly skilled german workers are also increasingly attracted to high salaries abroad , which contributes to germany 's brain drain .
in 2005 , the united states , britain and italy had large increases in the number of legal migrants , according to the oecd 's annual international migration outlook report .
the decrease in immigration is bad for the german economy , which needs to attract highly skilled workers to stay competitive , said germany 's education minister annette schavan .
" germany needs to make it clear that we have a very high interest in foreign talent , " schavan said in a recent article in germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
schavan of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said she is n't advocating uncontrolled immigration .
rather , she wants germany to become more attractive for highly qualified , skilled workers .
focus on domestic workforce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's annette schavan while german employers agreed skilled foreign workers are needed , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has criticized the idea .
german workers should get better training and qualifications before looking to foreign workers .
the spd and cdu make up the ruling coalition in germany 's government .
spd general secretary hubertus heil said employing skilled foreign workers is at times necessary .
but employers should focus on educating and training german workers .
abandoning german workers in favor of a foreign workforce " would be fatal for the german economy , " heil said .
schavan said she agreed and believed the current left-right coalition made up of the cdu and spd has already taken steps to help german workers .
" even when everyone in germany is well trained and educated , beyond that you still need qualified specialists from elsewhere , " she said during a television interview wednesday morning .
lowering barriers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a brain drain is underway a new law requires specialized workers from non-european union countries to earn at least 85,000 euros -lrb- $ 114,400 -rrb- in order to get german work and living permits .
cdu politicians have suggested lowering that requirement to 60,000 or 40,000 euros .
small businesses and start-ups simply ca n't pay such a high salary , even for highly-qualified employees , said maria böhmer of the cdu , who is in charge of migration issues in the government .

" we laid the ground for a common future for the european union and overcame the impasse , " she said in her final address to the european parliament before germany 's presidency of the eu ends on saturday . " at the end of the day we did not disappoint people 's expectations and we avoided a division , " she said .
" europe can once again look forward to a period of strength and confidence . " merkel told the deputies that she had anticipated difficult negotiations at the summit in brussels , which saw poland threaten to block the treaty in a dispute over voting rights . if the talks had failed it would not have meant the end of europe as we know it , she said , but it would have had major consequences which would have been difficult to predict . merkel said failure could have led to a two-speed europe , with those in favor of reform pressing ahead at the expense of those who were reluctant to change . new eu treaty the treaty , a key priority of the german presidency , meant the eu was able to preserve elements of the european constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in a referendums held in 2005 . it allows for decisions to be taken by majority rather than a unanimous vote and removes the threat of national vetoes .
there are also provisions for an eu president and more powers to the eu 's foreign policy chief , giving the bloc a bigger say in the world . bildunterschrift : a few high-ranking merkel fans she said the post of a high representative for foreign affairs was necessary because it would enable europe to speak with one voice as it grows more assertive on the world stage . " this is a european political quantum leap , " she said to applause from deputies . the new treaty has to be endorsed by an inter-government conference before it can be ratified and put in place in time for european parliament elections in mid-2009 . the chancellor said she hoped these talks could get underway next month when portugal takes over the rotating eu presidency from germany . licking their wounds while calling the german presidency of the eu a resounding “ success ” , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier did acknowledge that relationships between some in the eu bloc did take a few hits in the past few weeks , notably germany and poland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier speaking in berlin on wednesday speaking at a news conference in berlin steinmeier said that he hoped the “ rough ” exchanges last weekend would be soon forgotten . “ things got quite abrasive and in the long run european politics can not endure that , ” he said . steinmeier went on to criticize the polish magazine wprost for featuring a photo montage of a topless angela merkel breastfeeding the kaczynski brothers , poland 's prime minister and president . " germany wanted to be a mother for poland but she turned out to be a false mother , " said editor-in-chief stanislaw janecki . the magazine cover is just the last of a long line of recent spats between the eu neighbors but steinmeier expressed hope that such disagreements would not continue . " we want to develop good relations and i am sure that , with some distance , we will succeed , ” said steinmeier . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics are warning of a bureaucratic monster . the head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- kurt beck said he wants to make it easier for employees to take a stake in german companies . according to an spd plan , employees could buy shares in a so-called " germany fund , " whose assets participating companies could access for capital .
the companies would then direct their dividends , interest and repayments back to employees who paid into the fund . beck said the spd model minimized the risk of market fluctuations or company bankruptcies since the fund would be widely spread . " if the german fund owns shares for example in 1,000 companies , it wo n't collapse if two go bankrupt , " beck said in an interview with the latest issue of the weekly newsmagazine s tern . three-way deal the germany fund would be a three-way deal between employer , employee and fund .
it would be promoted by government subsidies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business is booming for many german companies married couples with an annual gross income of up to 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 53,800 -rrb- and singles with income of up to 20,000 euros would be able to invest up to 400 euros per year in the fund .
according to beck 's concept , the government would subsidize this with a further 20 percent , or 80 euros . in addition , companies could give their employees shares in the fund worth a maximum of 240 euros per year tax-free .
a federal guarantee would protect the funds from insolvency . beck said the spd wanted to push through the plan in the second half of this legislative period .
he said he would present his concept to chancellor angela merkel at a cabinet meeting in august . cdu has its own plan both the spd and its center-right coalition partner , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , have been working on concepts for employee shareholding for some time .
both want a model that allows employees to profit if their company is doing well - without risks that are too high . the cdu will be presenting its model for employee investment on friday .
the party 's general secretary ronald pofalla said that beck 's proposal went in the direction of the cdu 's . " we want more employee participation in earnings and capital , " pofalla said , adding that it was also a way to make companies more productive and competitive . fund could become a bureaucratic monster there has , however , been criticism from the private sector .
the head of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt , said beck 's proposal went in the wrong direction .
it was contrary to the actual character of capital participation , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundt is skeptical of the fund 's potential " it 's more than questionable how the benefits of equity participation are supposed to work when a national , bureaucratic fund is connecting the employees involved and their companies , " hundt said . klaus zimmermann , head of the reputable german institute for economic research diw , called the concept " nothing more than a state-run , subsidized and government secured investment for an equity fund . "
he told the daily neue osnabrücker zeitung that it was problematic to create new subsidies for such a concept . according to stern , the powerful labor unions dgb and ig metall were involved in developing the spd concept .
up to now , unions have been very skeptical about developing capital investments by employees due to fluctuating stock prices and the risk of insolvency . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the proposal criticizes german car makers for producing fast autos which pollute . chris davies has proposed putting the brakes on speedy sports cars which pollute the environment .
the british european parliamentarian and member of the liberal democrats wants all cars produced in the eu to have a top speed of 162 kilometers per hour -lrb- 100 mph -rrb- that by 2013 . " at a time when europe has concerns over its energy security it is sheer madness to allow gas-guzzling cars to be built which are allowed to travel at a dangerous speed which is totally forbidden by law , " davies said tuesday . the speed on most european highways is 130 km / h .
germany is an exception , as many stretches of the autobahn do not have any speed limits .
" driving a car -lrb- faster than -rrb- that is against the law in every country but germany , " davies said , according to reuters .
" it 's nonsense .
i believe it needs to be countered . " driving the speed limit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most european countries have speed limits the german government has consistently refused to consider a comprehensive speed limit on its freeways .
the german automobile industry is strong and driving fast in a german-made porsche or bmw is considered a sacred right by some drivers . " we do not support this direction , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said of the proposal . germany backs other measures to improve road safety and cut emissions including new traffic management technology , congestion avoidance , road tolls and more driver education .
" these are modern approaches , " tiefensee said , adding that drivers who spend less time snarled in traffic need less fuel . cutting co2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants greener cars the liberal democrats ' plan as it was presented to the european parliament also calls for cutting carbon dioxide emissions to 120 grams per kilometer by 2015 and 95 grams per kilometer by 2020 .
davies said cars could meet higher standards of energy efficiency using existing technology .
currently , cars in the european market emit 162 grams per kilometer . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the proposal criticizes german car makers for producing fast autos which pollute . chris davies has proposed putting the brakes on speedy sports cars which pollute the environment .
the british european parliamentarian and member of the liberal democrats wants all cars produced in the eu to have a top speed of 162 kilometers per hour -lrb- 100 mph -rrb- that by 2013 . " at a time when europe has concerns over its energy security it is sheer madness to allow gas-guzzling cars to be built which are allowed to travel at a dangerous speed which is totally forbidden by law , " davies said tuesday . the speed on most european highways is 130 km / h .
germany is an exception , as many stretches of the autobahn do not have any speed limits .
" driving a car -lrb- faster than -rrb- that is against the law in every country but germany , " davies said , according to reuters .
" it 's nonsense .
i believe it needs to be countered . " driving the speed limit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most european countries have speed limits the german government has consistently refused to consider a comprehensive speed limit on its freeways .
the german automobile industry is strong and driving fast in a german-made porsche or bmw is considered a sacred right by some drivers . " we do not support this direction , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said of the proposal . germany backs other measures to improve road safety and cut emissions including new traffic management technology , congestion avoidance , road tolls and more driver education .
" these are modern approaches , " tiefensee said , adding that drivers who spend less time snarled in traffic need less fuel . cutting co2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants greener cars the liberal democrats ' plan as it was presented to the european parliament also calls for cutting carbon dioxide emissions to 120 grams per kilometer by 2015 and 95 grams per kilometer by 2020 .
davies said cars could meet higher standards of energy efficiency using existing technology .
currently , cars in the european market emit 162 grams per kilometer . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his departure marks the end of an era .
tony blair had nearly let us forget that great britain was a conservative stronghold for nearly two decades .
the iron lady and the pale john major were hardly history when the young , dynamic new labour leader conquered the middle by forging a " third way " between the traditional conservative and left ideals in 1997 .
he gave labour , the workers ' and unions ' party , a new image and made it a viable choice for middle-class voters by pulling the party away from the left .
the youngest prime minister since 1812 , the kids in 10 downing street had pop stars as political allies .
the era of " cool britannia " had begun .
ten years under tony blair modernized great britain .
the economy has boomed over the long-term .
unemployment has sunk .
the northern ireland conflict , which had gone on for decades , was settled .
northern ireland , scotland and wales have their own parliamentary bodies .
billions have been invested in margaret thatcher 's run-down health system and britain 's debts .
but not everything is rosy in the land of new labour .
there are still long waiting lists in the health care system .
not every privatization can be seen as a success .
and despite - or because of blair 's economic reforms - the gap between great britain 's rich and poor has not shrunk .
but those are not the reasons why blair and his party were punished at recent parliamentary elections in scotland and wales as well as on the municipal level .
blair 's government based itself on an efficient pr machine that mastered the art of the spin , and distrust among the population grew larger and larger until it culminated with the debacle of the never-found weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
despite massive public opposition , blair led the country into a war whose central premises emerged as false .
in exchange for his support of the increasingly isolated us president george w. bush , blair reaped ridicule and the nicknames " poodle " and " lap dog . "
tony blair never recovered from that .
then there are the accusations of nepotism - blair 's one-time consultant and spin doctor peter mandelson became a commissioner in brussels - and the allegations his party accepted donations in exchange for honors , which may have led to seats in the upper house of parliament .
the clean-cut image of britain 's once favorite son has long been tarnished .
the skirmish surrounding the recent eu summit , blair 's last international appearance as prime minister , also showed that blair could not keep his promise to increase great britain 's integration in europe .
while he himself enjoys , and has had success , being a staunch european on the eu stage , the tendency toward euro-skepticism in the british media and general public has grown in recent years .
only 40 percent of britons still support membership in the eu , according to a recent poll .
in his final days , blair was a placeholder while his successor gained in significance as the one pulling the strings - sometimes behind the scenes and sometimes very publicly .
now blair is leaving the political stage - at least in his role as britain 's prime minister - after a farewell that has taken too long .
it is high time for him to go .
and the british electorate seems to be thanking him for his departure .
for the first time in months , the labour party is ahead in the polls and blair 's successor , gordon brown , once written off as uncharismatic , is coming in well ahead of his conservative rival , the young , dynamic david cameron , who resembles the young blair .
the blair era is over .
" cool britannia " is ready for a change .
first with a new labour leader .
whether blair 's party will be able to stay in power after the next elections remains to be seen .
blair 's spot in history , however , is secure .
but only time will tell if the damage the iraq war did to his image will be qualified by his undeniable successes .

his departure marks the end of an era .
tony blair had nearly let us forget that great britain was a conservative stronghold for nearly two decades .
the iron lady and the pale john major were hardly history when the young , dynamic new labour leader conquered the middle by forging a " third way " between the traditional conservative and left ideals in 1997 .
he gave labour , the workers ' and unions ' party , a new image and made it a viable choice for middle-class voters by pulling the party away from the left .
the youngest prime minister since 1812 , the kids in 10 downing street had pop stars as political allies .
the era of " cool britannia " had begun .
ten years under tony blair modernized great britain .
the economy has boomed over the long-term .
unemployment has sunk .
the northern ireland conflict , which had gone on for decades , was settled .
northern ireland , scotland and wales have their own parliamentary bodies .
billions have been invested in margaret thatcher 's run-down health system and britain 's debts .
but not everything is rosy in the land of new labour .
there are still long waiting lists in the health care system .
not every privatization can be seen as a success .
and despite - or because of blair 's economic reforms - the gap between great britain 's rich and poor has not shrunk .
but those are not the reasons why blair and his party were punished at recent parliamentary elections in scotland and wales as well as on the municipal level .
blair 's government based itself on an efficient pr machine that mastered the art of the spin , and distrust among the population grew larger and larger until it culminated with the debacle of the never-found weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
despite massive public opposition , blair led the country into a war whose central premises emerged as false .
in exchange for his support of the increasingly isolated us president george w. bush , blair reaped ridicule and the nicknames " poodle " and " lap dog . "
tony blair never recovered from that .
then there are the accusations of nepotism - blair 's one-time consultant and spin doctor peter mandelson became a commissioner in brussels - and the allegations his party accepted donations in exchange for honors , which may have led to seats in the upper house of parliament .
the clean-cut image of britain 's once favorite son has long been tarnished .

some readers think so readers shared their views on this week 's top news stories , from the post-summit state of german-polish relations to germany 's call for the extradition of 13 cia agents and tom cruise 's foiled plans to film in germany . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
repairing german-polish relations after the eu summit i find the opinions of the german press about the summit and poland and great britain unfair and biased .
no one discussed the merit of the proposals .
each country in the eu should have the right to express their opinions and the press should show different aspects of the issue and not to be just a propaganda tool .
unfortunately , i found most of the german press like that even before the summit .
the biased opinions hurt the relations between the countries and personally hurt the friends of germany in poland and in uk .
this is where the values of eu should start . - leszek wojtowicz , poland to be politically correct , we must pretend to be shocked at the wprost cover of chancellor merkel breast-feeding the twins .
but really , this cover does n't put chancellor merkel in a bad light at all .
she is the nurturer and the power figure .
it is the two weird twins who are the babies , completely powerless and dependent .
the chancellor is blithely sailing on , in full confidence and with a great body , to new opportunities to display her new-found powers .
actually , it is a very funny cover , because of the weirdness and fecklessness of the twins .
as i see it , chancellor merkel is presented positively and even with affection , but the twins receive a potent message of disdain from within their own country . - wiley horne , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a two-speed europe on its way ?
i wish to put forth four measures which i believe would do the trick in mending german-polish relations : 1 .
buy up all the low-quality polish meat that russia refuses to allow into the country ; 2 .
force russia to lay the new pipeline through polish territory so that the kaczynski twins can steal the gas en route to germany ; 3 .
applaud and endorse the ban on gay rights in poland ; 4 .
applaud and endorse the professional ban in poland . - luis oliveira , portugal on one side are the countries that want more integration and on the other side the countries that want a minimum of integration .

repairing german-polish relations after the eu summit i find the opinions of the german press about the summit and poland and great britain unfair and biased .
no one discussed the merit of the proposals .
each country in the eu should have the right to express their opinions and the press should show different aspects of the issue and not to be just a propaganda tool .
unfortunately , i found most of the german press like that even before the summit .
the biased opinions hurt the relations between the countries and personally hurt the friends of germany in poland and in uk .
this is where the values of eu should start . - leszek wojtowicz , poland to be politically correct , we must pretend to be shocked at the wprost cover of chancellor merkel breast-feeding the twins .
but really , this cover does n't put chancellor merkel in a bad light at all .
she is the nurturer and the power figure .
it is the two weird twins who are the babies , completely powerless and dependent .
the chancellor is blithely sailing on , in full confidence and with a great body , to new opportunities to display her new-found powers .
actually , it is a very funny cover , because of the weirdness and fecklessness of the twins .

they are calling for more political responsibility to ensure that they can continue to fulfill their educational task . the dachau concentration camp memorial site near munich receives over 800,000 visitors per year .
internationally , it is among the best-known sites commemorating the memory of the millions who perished in the holocaust in europe . but faced with an acute cash crunch , memorial centers strewn across germany , dachau included , are increasingly struggling to carry out their primary task : educating future generations about the horrors of the holocaust and the valuable lessons they hold for humanity . barbara distel , director of the dachau memorial site said its education department can not meet all requests for tours or other educational offers . " the situation in dachau is unsatisfactory , " distel said .
the center only has one full-time educator . other major sites report of similar problems .
the foundation managing the memorials at sachsenhausen , ravensbrück and brandenburg in eastern germany said funding was only enough to cover operating costs .
buchenwald , also in eastern germany , has had to work with a capped budget since 1998 , despite the increase in costs . " our back is to the wall , " said rikola-gunnar lüttgenau , deputy director of the buchenwald memorial foundation .
he said the center did not have the means to revise existing permanent exhibitions or conduct youth projects , for example .
the latter could only be financed through external sources , such as other foundations . charging entrance fees for concentration camps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops who liberated dachau were horrified by what they found the president of the international dachau committee , pieter dietz de loos last month sparked a debate on whether memorial sites should introduce entrance fees to alleviate these financial problems .
the committee was founded by former prisoners following world war two and played a decisive role in setting up the memorial site at dachau .
it does not , however , contribute to the site 's funding . " the committee will be broke in five years , " said dietz de loos , a dutch attorney and son of a dachau prisoner , at the camp 's liberation ceremony in may . but the proposal to charge entry fees for concentration camps has sparked unease among many . " i can not imagine that visitors to dachau will have to pay an entrance fee , " said distel . according to the central council of jews in germany , those sites where history occurred had to be accessible to everyone . " it is only through these concrete places that visitors can thoroughly experience for themselves the presence of historical events , " the council 's vice-president salomon korn told jewish weekly jüdische allgemeine .
" such a visual link of history and an authentic place serves to reinforce and deepen remembrance . " entrance fees would only undermine this , korn said . private investors holding back american philanthropist ronald lauder set up and finances a project to preserve europe 's most notorious concentration camp , auschwitz , in present day poland . but some point out that in germany , private investors remain reluctant to do the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn says historical sites need to be maintained korn said german companies were " elegantly refraining " from contributing to financing , despite " a moral obligation and responsibility " to maintain these memorial sites . buchenwald 's lüttgenau said this was due to industry concerns that any backing could be misunderstood . " private companies fear that support for our educational work would be equal to an admission of guilt , " lüttgenau said . sites are germany 's responsibility distel said the government carried the responsibility for the memorial sites in germany .
the bavarian state government 's ministry of culture finances dachau , for example .
according to a spokesman , it provides the memorial site with some 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- annually for personnel and material costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other camp is more associated with the horrors of the holocaust than auschwitz " i consider it to be germany 's political and cultural task to ensure that these sites are equipped in a way that they can adequately work , " distel said . this view was shared by korn .
he said it was not the memorial sites ' obligation , but rather that of those politically responsible to ensure that the memory of these camps stayed alive . " the federal and state governments are obliged to ensure that everyone has access to these sites , which represent the darkest part of german history , " korn said . thomas lutz of the topography of terror foundation said , though , that it was not clear whether the political support necessary was present . " the only chance now is to make it publicly clear that there is a significant gap between the demands on the memorial sites and their ability to fulfill these , " said lutz , who heads the foundation 's department for memorial sites . german government has yet to provide a solution for now , dachau and the other sites are trying to work as effectively as possible .
lüttgenau said the buchenwald site had exhausted all savings measures .
but it was n't enough to address the needs of its half a million visitors per year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many youth groups visit former concentration camps , such as sachsenhausen " we can not attend to the growing demand for educational services , such as accompanying groups through the site , " lüttgenau said .
it has had to turn down 30 to 40 percent of such inquiries . " considering the need for more educational youth work in eastern germany , this is a dramatic situation , " lüttgenau said .
" the interest is there and we ca n't fulfill it . " the german government has said it is working on a new concept for financing the concentration camp memorial sites in germany .
but it has yet to present a model . " we are caught between a rock and a hard place right now , " lüttgenau said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are calling for more political responsibility to ensure that they can continue to fulfill their educational task . the dachau concentration camp memorial site near munich receives over 800,000 visitors per year .
internationally , it is among the best-known sites commemorating the memory of the millions who perished in the holocaust in europe . but faced with an acute cash crunch , memorial centers strewn across germany , dachau included , are increasingly struggling to carry out their primary task : educating future generations about the horrors of the holocaust and the valuable lessons they hold for humanity . barbara distel , director of the dachau memorial site said its education department can not meet all requests for tours or other educational offers . " the situation in dachau is unsatisfactory , " distel said .
the center only has one full-time educator . other major sites report of similar problems .
the foundation managing the memorials at sachsenhausen , ravensbrück and brandenburg in eastern germany said funding was only enough to cover operating costs .
buchenwald , also in eastern germany , has had to work with a capped budget since 1998 , despite the increase in costs . " our back is to the wall , " said rikola-gunnar lüttgenau , deputy director of the buchenwald memorial foundation .
he said the center did not have the means to revise existing permanent exhibitions or conduct youth projects , for example .
the latter could only be financed through external sources , such as other foundations . charging entrance fees for concentration camps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops who liberated dachau were horrified by what they found the president of the international dachau committee , pieter dietz de loos last month sparked a debate on whether memorial sites should introduce entrance fees to alleviate these financial problems .
the committee was founded by former prisoners following world war two and played a decisive role in setting up the memorial site at dachau .
it does not , however , contribute to the site 's funding . " the committee will be broke in five years , " said dietz de loos , a dutch attorney and son of a dachau prisoner , at the camp 's liberation ceremony in may . but the proposal to charge entry fees for concentration camps has sparked unease among many . " i can not imagine that visitors to dachau will have to pay an entrance fee , " said distel . according to the central council of jews in germany , those sites where history occurred had to be accessible to everyone . " it is only through these concrete places that visitors can thoroughly experience for themselves the presence of historical events , " the council 's vice-president salomon korn told jewish weekly jüdische allgemeine .
" such a visual link of history and an authentic place serves to reinforce and deepen remembrance . " entrance fees would only undermine this , korn said . private investors holding back american philanthropist ronald lauder set up and finances a project to preserve europe 's most notorious concentration camp , auschwitz , in present day poland . but some point out that in germany , private investors remain reluctant to do the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn says historical sites need to be maintained korn said german companies were " elegantly refraining " from contributing to financing , despite " a moral obligation and responsibility " to maintain these memorial sites . buchenwald 's lüttgenau said this was due to industry concerns that any backing could be misunderstood . " private companies fear that support for our educational work would be equal to an admission of guilt , " lüttgenau said . sites are germany 's responsibility distel said the government carried the responsibility for the memorial sites in germany .
the bavarian state government 's ministry of culture finances dachau , for example .
according to a spokesman , it provides the memorial site with some 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- annually for personnel and material costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other camp is more associated with the horrors of the holocaust than auschwitz " i consider it to be germany 's political and cultural task to ensure that these sites are equipped in a way that they can adequately work , " distel said . this view was shared by korn .
he said it was not the memorial sites ' obligation , but rather that of those politically responsible to ensure that the memory of these camps stayed alive . " the federal and state governments are obliged to ensure that everyone has access to these sites , which represent the darkest part of german history , " korn said . thomas lutz of the topography of terror foundation said , though , that it was not clear whether the political support necessary was present . " the only chance now is to make it publicly clear that there is a significant gap between the demands on the memorial sites and their ability to fulfill these , " said lutz , who heads the foundation 's department for memorial sites . german government has yet to provide a solution for now , dachau and the other sites are trying to work as effectively as possible .
lüttgenau said the buchenwald site had exhausted all savings measures .
but it was n't enough to address the needs of its half a million visitors per year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many youth groups visit former concentration camps , such as sachsenhausen " we can not attend to the growing demand for educational services , such as accompanying groups through the site , " lüttgenau said .
it has had to turn down 30 to 40 percent of such inquiries . " considering the need for more educational youth work in eastern germany , this is a dramatic situation , " lüttgenau said .
" the interest is there and we ca n't fulfill it . " the german government has said it is working on a new concept for financing the concentration camp memorial sites in germany .
but it has yet to present a model . " we are caught between a rock and a hard place right now , " lüttgenau said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

repairing german-polish relations after the eu summit i find the opinions of the german press about the summit and poland and great britain unfair and biased .
no one discussed the merit of the proposals .
each country in the eu should have the right to express their opinions and the press should show different aspects of the issue and not to be just a propaganda tool .
unfortunately , i found most of the german press like that even before the summit .
the biased opinions hurt the relations between the countries and personally hurt the friends of germany in poland and in uk .
this is where the values of eu should start . - leszek wojtowicz , poland to be politically correct , we must pretend to be shocked at the wprost cover of chancellor merkel breast-feeding the twins .
but really , this cover does n't put chancellor merkel in a bad light at all .
she is the nurturer and the power figure .
it is the two weird twins who are the babies , completely powerless and dependent .
the chancellor is blithely sailing on , in full confidence and with a great body , to new opportunities to display her new-found powers .
actually , it is a very funny cover , because of the weirdness and fecklessness of the twins .
as i see it , chancellor merkel is presented positively and even with affection , but the twins receive a potent message of disdain from within their own country . - wiley horne , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a two-speed europe on its way ?
i wish to put forth four measures which i believe would do the trick in mending german-polish relations : 1 .
buy up all the low-quality polish meat that russia refuses to allow into the country ; 2 .
force russia to lay the new pipeline through polish territory so that the kaczynski twins can steal the gas en route to germany ; 3 .

applaud and endorse the professional ban in poland . - luis oliveira , portugal on one side are the countries that want more integration and on the other side the countries that want a minimum of integration .
a block with one speed on one side and split countries on the other side - that is the answer and i think romano prodi hinted that something like that might happen . - gustavo araujo , uruguay i suspect that poland is a country still trying to get used to the idea that , for the first time in over two centuries -lrb- except for the 20 years between the two world wars -rrb- , it is truly free to determine its own destiny .
moreover , many in poland still feel a deep sense of hurt and pain over all the tragedies of the last century .
the best that germany can do is to be as sympathetic to the current mood in poland as possible and not do anything to aggravate the relationship any further .
i believe that german democratic institutions and germany 's self-concept are strong enough to digest this current " chill " in german-polish relations and to prove that , in the end , poland can rely on german friendship even at tense moments such as now . - gary k. taylor , honduras germany calls for extradition of cia agents the agents did a great job when they followed leads dealing with terrorist threats .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the future of the internet is now germans hesitant to look for love online wikipedia founder : " great ideas come from different places " the internet and everyday life : the constant revolution " the synapses of a collective brain are growing " internet -pipe- 27.06.2007 the future is now großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will computer programs replace the human need for face-to-face contact ?
the world wide web as an interactive , collaborative platform for data exchange - best known as web 2.0 - has become , in industrialized countries , at least , a part of everyday life . the internet revolution is showing no signs of fatigue .
millions of people are writing wikipedia articles , reviewing books at amazon , evaluating articles they bought at ebay , publishing their holiday photos on flickr and presenting themselves on facebook .
wherever they are , they are part of a larger network that knows no national or cultural borders .
" the internet has become a platform , " said technology publisher and web 2.0 guru tim o 'reilly .
millions of networked personal computers are providing access to " the one global , electronic brain that we 're creating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon is not just an online retailer : it draws its customers to participate in product evaluation this collective brain is processing vast amounts of information at an increasing speed .
companies are already using data freely available on the internet to look for and contact their potential customers .
jeff hammerbacher of the social networking site , facebook , asserts that his company does not sell its users ' data , but it negotiates with advertisers what additional analysis can be performed on the very private details that often appear on the site .
web search giants yahoo and google , while claiming to be very protective of their user data , also point out that they follow the law in the countries in which they operate and are obliged to cooperate with law enforcement agencies , when asked to do so .
data collection with no limits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " let 's see who 'll be late for class today " in theory , at least , the possibilities for data collection and aggregation on the web are limitless .
data mining expert and former chief scientist at amazon , andreas weigend , said that if gps signals from cellular phones were available to everybody , his students could , for instance , figure out that he was 15 minutes late for his morning lecture , if they saw his cell phone emitting its signals 10 miles -lrb- 16 kilometers -rrb- away from campus .
if , however , he 'd make it to the lecture hall on time anyway , the police could , as tim o 'reilly points out , also conclude that he must have exceeded the speed limit on the road .
a speeding ticket could easily follow .
social network platforms such as facebook and myspace - in which users set up their own pages , profiles and links to other users with similar interests - ca n't say anything on their own about the actual relationships between two people : would they really get along ?
can they trust each other ?
o 'reilly , however , believes that software applications will soon be able to make decisions in the social realm that were previously reserved for humans only .
if an application can make the decision , which would normally require a face-to-face contact , then it can also decide if it should give out somebody 's phone number to a third party .
additional value through global data collection the development of new technologies goes hand in hand with the transformation of society .
five years ago , people would think twice before writing something intimate on a postcard , well-aware that anybody could read it .
nowadays , personal web logs - or blogs - are filled with publicly accessible , personal information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is one of the driving forces of the internet economy young people , especially , find nothing extraordinary about this .
while benefiting from the added value of global data collection , they are ready to contribute their part .
web researchers agree that digital devices will continue to play an increasingly prominent part in everybody 's life .
in china , says andreas weigend , one million cell new phones are sold every day .
farmers in the country may not have a computer , but they do have cell phones .
" and the government sends them , for example , information about health care on their cell phones , " weigend said .
soon , other devices for accessing information will come into play as well .
smart radios and other wireless devices , for instance , will avoid transmission bottlenecks by reconfiguring themselves to use frequencies that they sense are clear .
one laptop per child -lrb- olpc -rrb- - a non-profit organization chaired by mit media lab founder nicolas negroponte - is developing a $ 100 -lrb- 75 euros -rrb- portable computer for children in developing nations as part of a mission to bridge the digital divide between industrialized and lesser developed countries .
" we 'll be surprised " the silicon valley , for its part , has definitely recovered from the 2001 crash .
new startups are launching - although everybody is somewhat more cautious than in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oplc aims to bring computers to the underprivildged it is , however , getting crowded on the internet market .
the big players are already swallowing the smaller ones : google now owns the video-sharing platform youtube , whereas yahoo purchased the photo-sharing site flickr .
this , according to tim o 'reilly , is to be expected in the development of a new technology .
the more participants a network has , the more valuable it becomes .
and those who were there first , profit the most .
what is certain , at this point , is that there is no way back .
it 's hard , however , to make any predictions about future technological developments .

the world wide web as an interactive , collaborative platform for data exchange - best known as web 2.0 - has become , in industrialized countries , at least , a part of everyday life . the internet revolution is showing no signs of fatigue .
millions of people are writing wikipedia articles , reviewing books at amazon , evaluating articles they bought at ebay , publishing their holiday photos on flickr and presenting themselves on facebook .
wherever they are , they are part of a larger network that knows no national or cultural borders .
" the internet has become a platform , " said technology publisher and web 2.0 guru tim o 'reilly .

some readers think so readers shared their views on this week 's top news stories , from the post-summit state of german-polish relations to germany 's call for the extradition of 13 cia agents and tom cruise 's foiled plans to film in germany . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
repairing german-polish relations after the eu summit i find the opinions of the german press about the summit and poland and great britain unfair and biased .
no one discussed the merit of the proposals .
each country in the eu should have the right to express their opinions and the press should show different aspects of the issue and not to be just a propaganda tool .
unfortunately , i found most of the german press like that even before the summit .
the biased opinions hurt the relations between the countries and personally hurt the friends of germany in poland and in uk .
this is where the values of eu should start . - leszek wojtowicz , poland to be politically correct , we must pretend to be shocked at the wprost cover of chancellor merkel breast-feeding the twins .
but really , this cover does n't put chancellor merkel in a bad light at all .
she is the nurturer and the power figure .
it is the two weird twins who are the babies , completely powerless and dependent .
the chancellor is blithely sailing on , in full confidence and with a great body , to new opportunities to display her new-found powers .
actually , it is a very funny cover , because of the weirdness and fecklessness of the twins .
as i see it , chancellor merkel is presented positively and even with affection , but the twins receive a potent message of disdain from within their own country . - wiley horne , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a two-speed europe on its way ?
i wish to put forth four measures which i believe would do the trick in mending german-polish relations : 1 .
buy up all the low-quality polish meat that russia refuses to allow into the country ; 2 .
force russia to lay the new pipeline through polish territory so that the kaczynski twins can steal the gas en route to germany ; 3 .
applaud and endorse the ban on gay rights in poland ; 4 .
applaud and endorse the professional ban in poland . - luis oliveira , portugal on one side are the countries that want more integration and on the other side the countries that want a minimum of integration .
a block with one speed on one side and split countries on the other side - that is the answer and i think romano prodi hinted that something like that might happen . - gustavo araujo , uruguay i suspect that poland is a country still trying to get used to the idea that , for the first time in over two centuries -lrb- except for the 20 years between the two world wars -rrb- , it is truly free to determine its own destiny .
moreover , many in poland still feel a deep sense of hurt and pain over all the tragedies of the last century .
the best that germany can do is to be as sympathetic to the current mood in poland as possible and not do anything to aggravate the relationship any further .
i believe that german democratic institutions and germany 's self-concept are strong enough to digest this current " chill " in german-polish relations and to prove that , in the end , poland can rely on german friendship even at tense moments such as now . - gary k. taylor , honduras germany calls for extradition of cia agents the agents did a great job when they followed leads dealing with terrorist threats .
why is it okay for osama bin-laden and his group to kidnap journalists and kill them ?
but when the cia follows leads and does what it takes to gets results , the world questions it .
it 's strange the world never is willing to do what it takes to get the job done .
the world always expects the us to fix the problems . - loche , us i praise those men .
they were doing their duty to defend their country .
those who call the us allies should be ashamed of their act . - rafael fermoselle , cuba no , they should not be extradited .
they were doing the jobs that they were ordered to do .
the munich prosecutors are playing to the left for their own personal notoriety . - john coo per , us tom cruise banned from filming in german defense ministry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's the wrong guy for the job , said some too many times we find ourselves complaining about issues that have little or no bearing on content .
i believe the von stauffenberg family should receive assurances that the content is accurate and presented accordingly .
i personally do not believe in the methods or teachings of the church of scientology , but tom cruise is a very good actor and it is my belief that he would do an outstanding job of representing colonel von stauffenberg . - joseph , us two reasons tom cruise should not play von stauffenberg : 1 .
he is too short , 2 .
he is not german .
i wonder if he will fake a german accent or speak like a guy from new jersey . - david worsham , us in the us ' first amendment to the bill of rights , a person 's religion is protected .
do the germans protect religion in their laws as well ?
i am not a scientologist , but i do sympathize with cruise .
in 1940 , if cruise had been a jew , i 'm sure he would not have been able to make a film in germany either .
as harsh as that statement is , it gets to the root of this issue and why the world is so interested in it . - bryan moody , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in many ways , he says , it is already here . web 2.0 is a term coined by o ’ reilly in 2003 to refer to the second generation of web applications .
based on collaboration and sharing among users , they include sites like facebook and wikipedia .
o ’ reilly lives and works in the small town of sebastopol , about a two-hour drive north of san francisco .
christina bergmann traveled there to talk to him about his work . mr. o ’ reilly , what exactly is web 2.0 ? web 2.0 is about applications that use the network as a platform .
the first of step is to build applications that learn from their users so that the more people use them , the better they get .
web 2.0 is based on the collective intelligence of the users . that means that a lot of users have to be involved .
does web 2.0 represent a more democratic form of the internet ? i think that the next technology markets will be open and democratic .
there 's a lot of excitement around .
the hurdles we 're facing are n't all that big , and everyone can take part .
over time the power of small groups of users will decrease .
i think this is the phase the internet is in now . so we are now in the middle of web 2.0 .
what comes next – web 3.0 ? the term web 2.0 gives the impression that a web 3.0 is coming .
but i 'm not sure that the next technology boom will be attached to the world wide web .
we still think primarily about interacting with a computer as typing on a keyboard and looking at a screen .
but increasingly computers are fading into the background . there are lots of different ways in which computing interfaces are changing .
first of all there is the use of handheld devices or cell phones as a platform . think about how cameras are increasingly being equipped with gps .
now , when you take a photograph , the location of that photograph will automatically be a part of the data uploaded to a web 2.0 application like flickr .
all of a sudden the global brain is learning something that we did not actually explicitly tell it . that means that something will be created by this community ? yes , but people wo n't know they 're doing it .
we 're heading in the direction of artificial intelligence .
of course there is still a person telling the program what to do .
we 're putting more and more information into the global network , and people are writing programs that create even more connections .
it is as though the synapses of a collective brain are growing .
i think we should expect some surprises . but if people are n't aware of what is happening to their data , doesn ’ t that create a conflict with their right to privacy ? i think a lot of concerns about privacy will come up in the further development of web 2.0 .
but i think it 's really important to understand that people are willing to trade privacy for perceived benefit .
i also think that the net gets a bit of a bad rap with regards to privacy .
when you use a credit card , for example , you 're revealing all kinds of very private information about yourself .
people do n't make a big fuss about that . are we looking at two societies – one that has access to the internet and one that remains locked out ? with time i think that more people will have access to these technologies .
the internet will become more present – that means it will be accessible via telephone but also from different devices . we think there are a billion computers out there .
but really there is only one .
that is what web 2.0 is about – getting stitched together .
and what we think of as a computer today – a stand-alone device – is just an access point to the global electronic brain that we 're building . christina bergmann interviewed tim o 'reilly -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in many ways , he says , it is already here . web 2.0 is a term coined by o ’ reilly in 2003 to refer to the second generation of web applications .
based on collaboration and sharing among users , they include sites like facebook and wikipedia .
o ’ reilly lives and works in the small town of sebastopol , about a two-hour drive north of san francisco .
christina bergmann traveled there to talk to him about his work . mr. o ’ reilly , what exactly is web 2.0 ? web 2.0 is about applications that use the network as a platform .
the first of step is to build applications that learn from their users so that the more people use them , the better they get .
web 2.0 is based on the collective intelligence of the users . that means that a lot of users have to be involved .
does web 2.0 represent a more democratic form of the internet ? i think that the next technology markets will be open and democratic .
there 's a lot of excitement around .
the hurdles we 're facing are n't all that big , and everyone can take part .
over time the power of small groups of users will decrease .
i think this is the phase the internet is in now . so we are now in the middle of web 2.0 .
what comes next – web 3.0 ? the term web 2.0 gives the impression that a web 3.0 is coming .
but i 'm not sure that the next technology boom will be attached to the world wide web .
we still think primarily about interacting with a computer as typing on a keyboard and looking at a screen .
but increasingly computers are fading into the background . there are lots of different ways in which computing interfaces are changing .
first of all there is the use of handheld devices or cell phones as a platform . think about how cameras are increasingly being equipped with gps .
now , when you take a photograph , the location of that photograph will automatically be a part of the data uploaded to a web 2.0 application like flickr .
all of a sudden the global brain is learning something that we did not actually explicitly tell it . that means that something will be created by this community ? yes , but people wo n't know they 're doing it .
we 're heading in the direction of artificial intelligence .
of course there is still a person telling the program what to do .
we 're putting more and more information into the global network , and people are writing programs that create even more connections .
it is as though the synapses of a collective brain are growing .
i think we should expect some surprises . but if people are n't aware of what is happening to their data , doesn ’ t that create a conflict with their right to privacy ? i think a lot of concerns about privacy will come up in the further development of web 2.0 .
but i think it 's really important to understand that people are willing to trade privacy for perceived benefit .
i also think that the net gets a bit of a bad rap with regards to privacy .
when you use a credit card , for example , you 're revealing all kinds of very private information about yourself .
people do n't make a big fuss about that . are we looking at two societies – one that has access to the internet and one that remains locked out ? with time i think that more people will have access to these technologies .
the internet will become more present – that means it will be accessible via telephone but also from different devices . we think there are a billion computers out there .
but really there is only one .
that is what web 2.0 is about – getting stitched together .
and what we think of as a computer today – a stand-alone device – is just an access point to the global electronic brain that we 're building . christina bergmann interviewed tim o 'reilly -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with a new structure and a modified legal form , the company wants to steer a different course .
but there are no plans to merge porsche with volkswagen . shareholders at porsche have approved a new structure for the luxury german sports car maker .
chief executive wendelin wiedeking told an extraordinary general meeting on tuesday in stuttgart that porsche would be converted into a holding company . under the new holding , porsche 's operational business will run as a separate full subsidiary .
independently to this , the holding company will manage porsche 's interests in volkswagen -lrb- vw -rrb- .
porsche raised its stake in vw earlier this year from 27.3 percent to 30.8 percent . wiedeking told the meeting that it was important for the shareholders to be committed to this new course .

german politicians disagree over whether germany should focus on attracting foreign workers or on improving the skills of the domestic workforce . the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released a study earlier this week which showed germany had brought in 13,000 fewer legal immigrants in 2005 compared with a year earlier .
other studies have shown that highly skilled german workers are also increasingly attracted to high salaries abroad , which contributes to germany 's brain drain .
in 2005 , the united states , britain and italy had large increases in the number of legal migrants , according to the oecd 's annual international migration outlook report .
the decrease in immigration is bad for the german economy , which needs to attract highly skilled workers to stay competitive , said germany 's education minister annette schavan .
" germany needs to make it clear that we have a very high interest in foreign talent , " schavan said in a recent article in germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
schavan of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said she is n't advocating uncontrolled immigration .
rather , she wants germany to become more attractive for highly qualified , skilled workers .

the spd and cdu make up the ruling coalition in germany 's government .
spd general secretary hubertus heil said employing skilled foreign workers is at times necessary .
but employers should focus on educating and training german workers .
abandoning german workers in favor of a foreign workforce " would be fatal for the german economy , " heil said .
schavan said she agreed and believed the current left-right coalition made up of the cdu and spd has already taken steps to help german workers .
" even when everyone in germany is well trained and educated , beyond that you still need qualified specialists from elsewhere , " she said during a television interview wednesday morning .

cdu politicians have suggested lowering that requirement to 60,000 or 40,000 euros .

the officer verbally attacked a director of a museum devoted to the stasi 's dark historical legacy . the ruling , which was handed down on tuesday , found that former stasi officer wolfgang schmidt had gone beyond the bounds of free speech in criticizing museum director hubertus knabe . in an open letter in march 2006 , schmidt characterized knabe as someone who " could be described as an inciter of the people . "
the concept of incitement has extremely negative connotations in germany since it is often associated with racist agitation under the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubertus knabe knabe runs a former stasi prison in the hohenschönhausen district of berlin that has been turned into a museum and a memorial for the victims of the east german secret police . the court ruled that schmidt , the speaker of an organization representing self-proclaimed stasi " insiders , " had knowingly spread a falsehood , fining him 2,100 euros -lrb- $ 2,800 -rrb- . continuing controversy knabe welcomed the ruling .

in many ways , he says , it is already here . web 2.0 is a term coined by o ’ reilly in 2003 to refer to the second generation of web applications .
based on collaboration and sharing among users , they include sites like facebook and wikipedia .
o ’ reilly lives and works in the small town of sebastopol , about a two-hour drive north of san francisco .
christina bergmann traveled there to talk to him about his work . mr. o ’ reilly , what exactly is web 2.0 ? web 2.0 is about applications that use the network as a platform .
the first of step is to build applications that learn from their users so that the more people use them , the better they get .
web 2.0 is based on the collective intelligence of the users . that means that a lot of users have to be involved .
does web 2.0 represent a more democratic form of the internet ? i think that the next technology markets will be open and democratic .
there 's a lot of excitement around .
the hurdles we 're facing are n't all that big , and everyone can take part .
over time the power of small groups of users will decrease .
i think this is the phase the internet is in now . so we are now in the middle of web 2.0 .
what comes next – web 3.0 ? the term web 2.0 gives the impression that a web 3.0 is coming .
but i 'm not sure that the next technology boom will be attached to the world wide web .
we still think primarily about interacting with a computer as typing on a keyboard and looking at a screen .
but increasingly computers are fading into the background . there are lots of different ways in which computing interfaces are changing .
first of all there is the use of handheld devices or cell phones as a platform . think about how cameras are increasingly being equipped with gps .
now , when you take a photograph , the location of that photograph will automatically be a part of the data uploaded to a web 2.0 application like flickr .
all of a sudden the global brain is learning something that we did not actually explicitly tell it . that means that something will be created by this community ? yes , but people wo n't know they 're doing it .
we 're heading in the direction of artificial intelligence .
of course there is still a person telling the program what to do .
we 're putting more and more information into the global network , and people are writing programs that create even more connections .
it is as though the synapses of a collective brain are growing .
i think we should expect some surprises . but if people are n't aware of what is happening to their data , doesn ’ t that create a conflict with their right to privacy ? i think a lot of concerns about privacy will come up in the further development of web 2.0 .
but i think it 's really important to understand that people are willing to trade privacy for perceived benefit .
i also think that the net gets a bit of a bad rap with regards to privacy .
when you use a credit card , for example , you 're revealing all kinds of very private information about yourself .
people do n't make a big fuss about that . are we looking at two societies – one that has access to the internet and one that remains locked out ? with time i think that more people will have access to these technologies .
the internet will become more present – that means it will be accessible via telephone but also from different devices . we think there are a billion computers out there .
but really there is only one .
that is what web 2.0 is about – getting stitched together .
and what we think of as a computer today – a stand-alone device – is just an access point to the global electronic brain that we 're building . christina bergmann interviewed tim o 'reilly -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are calling for more political responsibility to ensure that they can continue to fulfill their educational task . the dachau concentration camp memorial site near munich receives over 800,000 visitors per year .
internationally , it is among the best-known sites commemorating the memory of the millions who perished in the holocaust in europe . but faced with an acute cash crunch , memorial centers strewn across germany , dachau included , are increasingly struggling to carry out their primary task : educating future generations about the horrors of the holocaust and the valuable lessons they hold for humanity . barbara distel , director of the dachau memorial site said its education department can not meet all requests for tours or other educational offers . " the situation in dachau is unsatisfactory , " distel said .
the center only has one full-time educator . other major sites report of similar problems .
the foundation managing the memorials at sachsenhausen , ravensbrück and brandenburg in eastern germany said funding was only enough to cover operating costs .
buchenwald , also in eastern germany , has had to work with a capped budget since 1998 , despite the increase in costs . " our back is to the wall , " said rikola-gunnar lüttgenau , deputy director of the buchenwald memorial foundation .
he said the center did not have the means to revise existing permanent exhibitions or conduct youth projects , for example .
the latter could only be financed through external sources , such as other foundations . charging entrance fees for concentration camps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops who liberated dachau were horrified by what they found the president of the international dachau committee , pieter dietz de loos last month sparked a debate on whether memorial sites should introduce entrance fees to alleviate these financial problems .
the committee was founded by former prisoners following world war two and played a decisive role in setting up the memorial site at dachau .
it does not , however , contribute to the site 's funding . " the committee will be broke in five years , " said dietz de loos , a dutch attorney and son of a dachau prisoner , at the camp 's liberation ceremony in may . but the proposal to charge entry fees for concentration camps has sparked unease among many . " i can not imagine that visitors to dachau will have to pay an entrance fee , " said distel . according to the central council of jews in germany , those sites where history occurred had to be accessible to everyone . " it is only through these concrete places that visitors can thoroughly experience for themselves the presence of historical events , " the council 's vice-president salomon korn told jewish weekly jüdische allgemeine .
" such a visual link of history and an authentic place serves to reinforce and deepen remembrance . " entrance fees would only undermine this , korn said . private investors holding back american philanthropist ronald lauder set up and finances a project to preserve europe 's most notorious concentration camp , auschwitz , in present day poland . but some point out that in germany , private investors remain reluctant to do the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn says historical sites need to be maintained korn said german companies were " elegantly refraining " from contributing to financing , despite " a moral obligation and responsibility " to maintain these memorial sites . buchenwald 's lüttgenau said this was due to industry concerns that any backing could be misunderstood . " private companies fear that support for our educational work would be equal to an admission of guilt , " lüttgenau said . sites are germany 's responsibility distel said the government carried the responsibility for the memorial sites in germany .
the bavarian state government 's ministry of culture finances dachau , for example .
according to a spokesman , it provides the memorial site with some 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- annually for personnel and material costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other camp is more associated with the horrors of the holocaust than auschwitz " i consider it to be germany 's political and cultural task to ensure that these sites are equipped in a way that they can adequately work , " distel said . this view was shared by korn .
he said it was not the memorial sites ' obligation , but rather that of those politically responsible to ensure that the memory of these camps stayed alive . " the federal and state governments are obliged to ensure that everyone has access to these sites , which represent the darkest part of german history , " korn said . thomas lutz of the topography of terror foundation said , though , that it was not clear whether the political support necessary was present . " the only chance now is to make it publicly clear that there is a significant gap between the demands on the memorial sites and their ability to fulfill these , " said lutz , who heads the foundation 's department for memorial sites . german government has yet to provide a solution for now , dachau and the other sites are trying to work as effectively as possible .
lüttgenau said the buchenwald site had exhausted all savings measures .
but it was n't enough to address the needs of its half a million visitors per year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many youth groups visit former concentration camps , such as sachsenhausen " we can not attend to the growing demand for educational services , such as accompanying groups through the site , " lüttgenau said .
it has had to turn down 30 to 40 percent of such inquiries . " considering the need for more educational youth work in eastern germany , this is a dramatic situation , " lüttgenau said .
" the interest is there and we ca n't fulfill it . " the german government has said it is working on a new concept for financing the concentration camp memorial sites in germany .
but it has yet to present a model . " we are caught between a rock and a hard place right now , " lüttgenau said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer-generated image of a typical 19th century jewish street in a polish town " over the past 900 years , our histories have been entangled , " polish president lech told dignitaries and onlookers standing in front of the imposing black marble warsaw ghetto uprising memorial , commemorating the 1943 doomed rebellion by members of the jewish fighting organization -lrb- zob -rrb- .
" there have been good times and bad .
but the history of the polish jews is a part of the history of my country , my nation .
it is a history that deserves being commemorated , " he said .
the land-mark museum is appropriately located in warsaw , " the greatest jewish city in europe " prior to world war ii , kaczynski said .
the warsaw ghetto before the war , poland 's jewish minority numbered some 3.5 million and accounted for roughly 10 per cent of the country 's pre- war population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish life in poland was almost completely obliterated by nazis the ground-breaking ceremonies were conducted in an district of warsaw that was at the heart of jewish life prior to the war .
tragically , it was enclosed inside the infamous wartime jewish ghetto created by nazi germany as part of its systematic genocide against european jews .
the nazi german ghettos and death camps claimed the vast majority of poland 's jews .
the number accounts for half of the six million europeans of jewish ancestry killed by nazi dictator adolf hitler 's third reich .
europe was home to some 11 million jews prior to the holocaust .
biblical proportions designed by finnish architectural duo rainer mahlamäki and ilmari lahdelma , the museum 's entrance promises to be of biblical proportions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new museum will be facing the warsaw ghetto memorial a symbolically ruptured facade will open up to monumental undulating walls alluding to the old testament 's miraculous parting of the red sea through which the prophet moses led the jews to escape captivity in egypt to a new life in the promised land .
it is a labor of love for project director jerzy halberstadt and head of the warsaw-based jewish historical institute and holocaust survivor marian turski .
holocaust and jewish history expert israel gutman will supervise the team preparing expositions .
" this will be a museum about life that will benefit dialogue and the future , " halberstadt said , adding that the institution aimed to attract a half million visitors a year .
financed by by the polish government , the city of warsaw and the european union , the project is slated to cost around $ 65 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- , according to news agency ap .
measuring a total of 18,000 square meters -lrb- 59,000 square feet -rrb- , the museum will be one of the largest jewish museums in the world - along with yad vashem in jerusalem and the holocaust memorial in washington dc . dw staff with agency reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we laid the ground for a common future for the european union and overcame the impasse , " she said in her final address to the european parliament before germany 's presidency of the eu ends on saturday . " at the end of the day we did not disappoint people 's expectations and we avoided a division , " she said .
" europe can once again look forward to a period of strength and confidence . " merkel told the deputies that she had anticipated difficult negotiations at the summit in brussels , which saw poland threaten to block the treaty in a dispute over voting rights . if the talks had failed it would not have meant the end of europe as we know it , she said , but it would have had major consequences which would have been difficult to predict . merkel said failure could have led to a two-speed europe , with those in favor of reform pressing ahead at the expense of those who were reluctant to change . new eu treaty the treaty , a key priority of the german presidency , meant the eu was able to preserve elements of the european constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in a referendums held in 2005 . it allows for decisions to be taken by majority rather than a unanimous vote and removes the threat of national vetoes .

" this is a european political quantum leap , " she said to applause from deputies . the new treaty has to be endorsed by an inter-government conference before it can be ratified and put in place in time for european parliament elections in mid-2009 . the chancellor said she hoped these talks could get underway next month when portugal takes over the rotating eu presidency from germany . licking their wounds while calling the german presidency of the eu a resounding “ success ” , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier did acknowledge that relationships between some in the eu bloc did take a few hits in the past few weeks , notably germany and poland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier speaking in berlin on wednesday speaking at a news conference in berlin steinmeier said that he hoped the “ rough ” exchanges last weekend would be soon forgotten . “ things got quite abrasive and in the long run european politics can not endure that , ” he said . steinmeier went on to criticize the polish magazine wprost for featuring a photo montage of a topless angela merkel breastfeeding the kaczynski brothers , poland 's prime minister and president . " germany wanted to be a mother for poland but she turned out to be a false mother , " said editor-in-chief stanislaw janecki . the magazine cover is just the last of a long line of recent spats between the eu neighbors but steinmeier expressed hope that such disagreements would not continue .

" there have been good times and bad .
but the history of the polish jews is a part of the history of my country , my nation .
it is a history that deserves being commemorated , " he said .
the land-mark museum is appropriately located in warsaw , " the greatest jewish city in europe " prior to world war ii , kaczynski said .

it is a labor of love for project director jerzy halberstadt and head of the warsaw-based jewish historical institute and holocaust survivor marian turski .
holocaust and jewish history expert israel gutman will supervise the team preparing expositions .
" this will be a museum about life that will benefit dialogue and the future , " halberstadt said , adding that the institution aimed to attract a half million visitors a year .
financed by by the polish government , the city of warsaw and the european union , the project is slated to cost around $ 65 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- , according to news agency ap .

the officer verbally attacked a director of a museum devoted to the stasi 's dark historical legacy . the ruling , which was handed down on tuesday , found that former stasi officer wolfgang schmidt had gone beyond the bounds of free speech in criticizing museum director hubertus knabe . in an open letter in march 2006 , schmidt characterized knabe as someone who " could be described as an inciter of the people . "
the concept of incitement has extremely negative connotations in germany since it is often associated with racist agitation under the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubertus knabe knabe runs a former stasi prison in the hohenschönhausen district of berlin that has been turned into a museum and a memorial for the victims of the east german secret police . the court ruled that schmidt , the speaker of an organization representing self-proclaimed stasi " insiders , " had knowingly spread a falsehood , fining him 2,100 euros -lrb- $ 2,800 -rrb- . continuing controversy knabe welcomed the ruling . " for the first time , a berlin court has set limits upon the activities of former stasi officers and their organizations , " he said . "
i hope the ruling makes it more difficulty to drag stasi victims and their memorials through the mud . " bildunterschrift : it will take years for researchers to sort through the stasi 's copious files the court case was but the latest incident in an ongoing debate about what role former stasi operatives should play in germany 's coming-to-terms with the eastern part of the country 's communist past . former stasi employees have been occasionally enlisted in efforts to shed light on that organization 's activities .

once rivals for the leadership of the labour party , brown reportedly agreed in the mid-nineties to put his own ambitions to become prime minister on hold and support blair , who was elected in 1997 . in return , blair purportedly agreed to step down at some point while still in office and clear the way for brown . new partner for britain 's allies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and his wife sarah are the new residents of 10 downing street european and other world leaders were expected to begin congratulating brown personally and in public statements . in a tribute to blair published in a british newspaper on wednesday , us president george bush praised brown , writing that the then prime minister designate " was n't the image of the dour scotsman at all .

" we laid the ground for a common future for the european union and overcame the impasse , " she said in her final address to the european parliament before germany 's presidency of the eu ends on saturday . " at the end of the day we did not disappoint people 's expectations and we avoided a division , " she said .
" europe can once again look forward to a period of strength and confidence . " merkel told the deputies that she had anticipated difficult negotiations at the summit in brussels , which saw poland threaten to block the treaty in a dispute over voting rights . if the talks had failed it would not have meant the end of europe as we know it , she said , but it would have had major consequences which would have been difficult to predict . merkel said failure could have led to a two-speed europe , with those in favor of reform pressing ahead at the expense of those who were reluctant to change . new eu treaty the treaty , a key priority of the german presidency , meant the eu was able to preserve elements of the european constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in a referendums held in 2005 . it allows for decisions to be taken by majority rather than a unanimous vote and removes the threat of national vetoes .
there are also provisions for an eu president and more powers to the eu 's foreign policy chief , giving the bloc a bigger say in the world . bildunterschrift : a few high-ranking merkel fans she said the post of a high representative for foreign affairs was necessary because it would enable europe to speak with one voice as it grows more assertive on the world stage . " this is a european political quantum leap , " she said to applause from deputies . the new treaty has to be endorsed by an inter-government conference before it can be ratified and put in place in time for european parliament elections in mid-2009 . the chancellor said she hoped these talks could get underway next month when portugal takes over the rotating eu presidency from germany . licking their wounds while calling the german presidency of the eu a resounding “ success ” , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier did acknowledge that relationships between some in the eu bloc did take a few hits in the past few weeks , notably germany and poland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier speaking in berlin on wednesday speaking at a news conference in berlin steinmeier said that he hoped the “ rough ” exchanges last weekend would be soon forgotten . “ things got quite abrasive and in the long run european politics can not endure that , ” he said . steinmeier went on to criticize the polish magazine wprost for featuring a photo montage of a topless angela merkel breastfeeding the kaczynski brothers , poland 's prime minister and president . " germany wanted to be a mother for poland but she turned out to be a false mother , " said editor-in-chief stanislaw janecki . the magazine cover is just the last of a long line of recent spats between the eu neighbors but steinmeier expressed hope that such disagreements would not continue .

it is a labor of love for project director jerzy halberstadt and head of the warsaw-based jewish historical institute and holocaust survivor marian turski .
holocaust and jewish history expert israel gutman will supervise the team preparing expositions .
" this will be a museum about life that will benefit dialogue and the future , " halberstadt said , adding that the institution aimed to attract a half million visitors a year .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer-generated image of a typical 19th century jewish street in a polish town " over the past 900 years , our histories have been entangled , " polish president lech told dignitaries and onlookers standing in front of the imposing black marble warsaw ghetto uprising memorial , commemorating the 1943 doomed rebellion by members of the jewish fighting organization -lrb- zob -rrb- .
" there have been good times and bad .
but the history of the polish jews is a part of the history of my country , my nation .
it is a history that deserves being commemorated , " he said .
the land-mark museum is appropriately located in warsaw , " the greatest jewish city in europe " prior to world war ii , kaczynski said .
the warsaw ghetto before the war , poland 's jewish minority numbered some 3.5 million and accounted for roughly 10 per cent of the country 's pre- war population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish life in poland was almost completely obliterated by nazis the ground-breaking ceremonies were conducted in an district of warsaw that was at the heart of jewish life prior to the war .
tragically , it was enclosed inside the infamous wartime jewish ghetto created by nazi germany as part of its systematic genocide against european jews .
the nazi german ghettos and death camps claimed the vast majority of poland 's jews .
the number accounts for half of the six million europeans of jewish ancestry killed by nazi dictator adolf hitler 's third reich .
europe was home to some 11 million jews prior to the holocaust .
biblical proportions designed by finnish architectural duo rainer mahlamäki and ilmari lahdelma , the museum 's entrance promises to be of biblical proportions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new museum will be facing the warsaw ghetto memorial a symbolically ruptured facade will open up to monumental undulating walls alluding to the old testament 's miraculous parting of the red sea through which the prophet moses led the jews to escape captivity in egypt to a new life in the promised land .
it is a labor of love for project director jerzy halberstadt and head of the warsaw-based jewish historical institute and holocaust survivor marian turski .
holocaust and jewish history expert israel gutman will supervise the team preparing expositions .
" this will be a museum about life that will benefit dialogue and the future , " halberstadt said , adding that the institution aimed to attract a half million visitors a year .
financed by by the polish government , the city of warsaw and the european union , the project is slated to cost around $ 65 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- , according to news agency ap .
measuring a total of 18,000 square meters -lrb- 59,000 square feet -rrb- , the museum will be one of the largest jewish museums in the world - along with yad vashem in jerusalem and the holocaust memorial in washington dc . dw staff with agency reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the future of the internet is now germans hesitant to look for love online wikipedia founder : " great ideas come from different places " the internet and everyday life : the constant revolution " the synapses of a collective brain are growing " internet -pipe- 27.06.2007 the future is now großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will computer programs replace the human need for face-to-face contact ?
the world wide web as an interactive , collaborative platform for data exchange - best known as web 2.0 - has become , in industrialized countries , at least , a part of everyday life . the internet revolution is showing no signs of fatigue .
millions of people are writing wikipedia articles , reviewing books at amazon , evaluating articles they bought at ebay , publishing their holiday photos on flickr and presenting themselves on facebook .
wherever they are , they are part of a larger network that knows no national or cultural borders .
" the internet has become a platform , " said technology publisher and web 2.0 guru tim o 'reilly .
millions of networked personal computers are providing access to " the one global , electronic brain that we 're creating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon is not just an online retailer : it draws its customers to participate in product evaluation this collective brain is processing vast amounts of information at an increasing speed .
companies are already using data freely available on the internet to look for and contact their potential customers .
jeff hammerbacher of the social networking site , facebook , asserts that his company does not sell its users ' data , but it negotiates with advertisers what additional analysis can be performed on the very private details that often appear on the site .
web search giants yahoo and google , while claiming to be very protective of their user data , also point out that they follow the law in the countries in which they operate and are obliged to cooperate with law enforcement agencies , when asked to do so .
data collection with no limits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " let 's see who 'll be late for class today " in theory , at least , the possibilities for data collection and aggregation on the web are limitless .
data mining expert and former chief scientist at amazon , andreas weigend , said that if gps signals from cellular phones were available to everybody , his students could , for instance , figure out that he was 15 minutes late for his morning lecture , if they saw his cell phone emitting its signals 10 miles -lrb- 16 kilometers -rrb- away from campus .
if , however , he 'd make it to the lecture hall on time anyway , the police could , as tim o 'reilly points out , also conclude that he must have exceeded the speed limit on the road .
a speeding ticket could easily follow .
social network platforms such as facebook and myspace - in which users set up their own pages , profiles and links to other users with similar interests - ca n't say anything on their own about the actual relationships between two people : would they really get along ?
can they trust each other ?
o 'reilly , however , believes that software applications will soon be able to make decisions in the social realm that were previously reserved for humans only .
if an application can make the decision , which would normally require a face-to-face contact , then it can also decide if it should give out somebody 's phone number to a third party .
additional value through global data collection the development of new technologies goes hand in hand with the transformation of society .
five years ago , people would think twice before writing something intimate on a postcard , well-aware that anybody could read it .
nowadays , personal web logs - or blogs - are filled with publicly accessible , personal information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is one of the driving forces of the internet economy young people , especially , find nothing extraordinary about this .
while benefiting from the added value of global data collection , they are ready to contribute their part .
web researchers agree that digital devices will continue to play an increasingly prominent part in everybody 's life .
in china , says andreas weigend , one million cell new phones are sold every day .
farmers in the country may not have a computer , but they do have cell phones .
" and the government sends them , for example , information about health care on their cell phones , " weigend said .
soon , other devices for accessing information will come into play as well .
smart radios and other wireless devices , for instance , will avoid transmission bottlenecks by reconfiguring themselves to use frequencies that they sense are clear .
one laptop per child -lrb- olpc -rrb- - a non-profit organization chaired by mit media lab founder nicolas negroponte - is developing a $ 100 -lrb- 75 euros -rrb- portable computer for children in developing nations as part of a mission to bridge the digital divide between industrialized and lesser developed countries .
" we 'll be surprised " the silicon valley , for its part , has definitely recovered from the 2001 crash .
new startups are launching - although everybody is somewhat more cautious than in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oplc aims to bring computers to the underprivildged it is , however , getting crowded on the internet market .
the big players are already swallowing the smaller ones : google now owns the video-sharing platform youtube , whereas yahoo purchased the photo-sharing site flickr .
this , according to tim o 'reilly , is to be expected in the development of a new technology .
the more participants a network has , the more valuable it becomes .
and those who were there first , profit the most .
what is certain , at this point , is that there is no way back .
it 's hard , however , to make any predictions about future technological developments .
o 'reilly sums it up the best when he says : " i think we can expect to be surprised . " christina bergmann -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the world wide web as an interactive , collaborative platform for data exchange - best known as web 2.0 - has become , in industrialized countries , at least , a part of everyday life . the internet revolution is showing no signs of fatigue .
millions of people are writing wikipedia articles , reviewing books at amazon , evaluating articles they bought at ebay , publishing their holiday photos on flickr and presenting themselves on facebook .
wherever they are , they are part of a larger network that knows no national or cultural borders .
" the internet has become a platform , " said technology publisher and web 2.0 guru tim o 'reilly .
millions of networked personal computers are providing access to " the one global , electronic brain that we 're creating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon is not just an online retailer : it draws its customers to participate in product evaluation this collective brain is processing vast amounts of information at an increasing speed .
companies are already using data freely available on the internet to look for and contact their potential customers .
jeff hammerbacher of the social networking site , facebook , asserts that his company does not sell its users ' data , but it negotiates with advertisers what additional analysis can be performed on the very private details that often appear on the site .
web search giants yahoo and google , while claiming to be very protective of their user data , also point out that they follow the law in the countries in which they operate and are obliged to cooperate with law enforcement agencies , when asked to do so .
data collection with no limits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " let 's see who 'll be late for class today " in theory , at least , the possibilities for data collection and aggregation on the web are limitless .
data mining expert and former chief scientist at amazon , andreas weigend , said that if gps signals from cellular phones were available to everybody , his students could , for instance , figure out that he was 15 minutes late for his morning lecture , if they saw his cell phone emitting its signals 10 miles -lrb- 16 kilometers -rrb- away from campus .
if , however , he 'd make it to the lecture hall on time anyway , the police could , as tim o 'reilly points out , also conclude that he must have exceeded the speed limit on the road .
a speeding ticket could easily follow .
social network platforms such as facebook and myspace - in which users set up their own pages , profiles and links to other users with similar interests - ca n't say anything on their own about the actual relationships between two people : would they really get along ?
can they trust each other ?
o 'reilly , however , believes that software applications will soon be able to make decisions in the social realm that were previously reserved for humans only .
if an application can make the decision , which would normally require a face-to-face contact , then it can also decide if it should give out somebody 's phone number to a third party .
additional value through global data collection the development of new technologies goes hand in hand with the transformation of society .
five years ago , people would think twice before writing something intimate on a postcard , well-aware that anybody could read it .
nowadays , personal web logs - or blogs - are filled with publicly accessible , personal information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is one of the driving forces of the internet economy young people , especially , find nothing extraordinary about this .
while benefiting from the added value of global data collection , they are ready to contribute their part .
web researchers agree that digital devices will continue to play an increasingly prominent part in everybody 's life .
in china , says andreas weigend , one million cell new phones are sold every day .
farmers in the country may not have a computer , but they do have cell phones .
" and the government sends them , for example , information about health care on their cell phones , " weigend said .
soon , other devices for accessing information will come into play as well .
smart radios and other wireless devices , for instance , will avoid transmission bottlenecks by reconfiguring themselves to use frequencies that they sense are clear .
one laptop per child -lrb- olpc -rrb- - a non-profit organization chaired by mit media lab founder nicolas negroponte - is developing a $ 100 -lrb- 75 euros -rrb- portable computer for children in developing nations as part of a mission to bridge the digital divide between industrialized and lesser developed countries .
" we 'll be surprised " the silicon valley , for its part , has definitely recovered from the 2001 crash .
new startups are launching - although everybody is somewhat more cautious than in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oplc aims to bring computers to the underprivildged it is , however , getting crowded on the internet market .
the big players are already swallowing the smaller ones : google now owns the video-sharing platform youtube , whereas yahoo purchased the photo-sharing site flickr .
this , according to tim o 'reilly , is to be expected in the development of a new technology .
the more participants a network has , the more valuable it becomes .
and those who were there first , profit the most .
what is certain , at this point , is that there is no way back .
it 's hard , however , to make any predictions about future technological developments .

in many ways , he says , it is already here . web 2.0 is a term coined by o ’ reilly in 2003 to refer to the second generation of web applications .
based on collaboration and sharing among users , they include sites like facebook and wikipedia .
o ’ reilly lives and works in the small town of sebastopol , about a two-hour drive north of san francisco .
christina bergmann traveled there to talk to him about his work . mr. o ’ reilly , what exactly is web 2.0 ? web 2.0 is about applications that use the network as a platform .
the first of step is to build applications that learn from their users so that the more people use them , the better they get .
web 2.0 is based on the collective intelligence of the users . that means that a lot of users have to be involved .
does web 2.0 represent a more democratic form of the internet ? i think that the next technology markets will be open and democratic .
there 's a lot of excitement around .
the hurdles we 're facing are n't all that big , and everyone can take part .
over time the power of small groups of users will decrease .
i think this is the phase the internet is in now . so we are now in the middle of web 2.0 .
what comes next – web 3.0 ? the term web 2.0 gives the impression that a web 3.0 is coming .
but i 'm not sure that the next technology boom will be attached to the world wide web .
we still think primarily about interacting with a computer as typing on a keyboard and looking at a screen .
but increasingly computers are fading into the background . there are lots of different ways in which computing interfaces are changing .
first of all there is the use of handheld devices or cell phones as a platform . think about how cameras are increasingly being equipped with gps .
now , when you take a photograph , the location of that photograph will automatically be a part of the data uploaded to a web 2.0 application like flickr .
all of a sudden the global brain is learning something that we did not actually explicitly tell it . that means that something will be created by this community ? yes , but people wo n't know they 're doing it .
we 're heading in the direction of artificial intelligence .
of course there is still a person telling the program what to do .
we 're putting more and more information into the global network , and people are writing programs that create even more connections .
it is as though the synapses of a collective brain are growing .
i think we should expect some surprises . but if people are n't aware of what is happening to their data , doesn ’ t that create a conflict with their right to privacy ? i think a lot of concerns about privacy will come up in the further development of web 2.0 .
but i think it 's really important to understand that people are willing to trade privacy for perceived benefit .
i also think that the net gets a bit of a bad rap with regards to privacy .
when you use a credit card , for example , you 're revealing all kinds of very private information about yourself .
people do n't make a big fuss about that . are we looking at two societies – one that has access to the internet and one that remains locked out ? with time i think that more people will have access to these technologies .
the internet will become more present – that means it will be accessible via telephone but also from different devices . we think there are a billion computers out there .
but really there is only one .
that is what web 2.0 is about – getting stitched together .
and what we think of as a computer today – a stand-alone device – is just an access point to the global electronic brain that we 're building . christina bergmann interviewed tim o 'reilly -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some readers think so readers shared their views on this week 's top news stories , from the post-summit state of german-polish relations to germany 's call for the extradition of 13 cia agents and tom cruise 's foiled plans to film in germany . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
repairing german-polish relations after the eu summit i find the opinions of the german press about the summit and poland and great britain unfair and biased .
no one discussed the merit of the proposals .
each country in the eu should have the right to express their opinions and the press should show different aspects of the issue and not to be just a propaganda tool .
unfortunately , i found most of the german press like that even before the summit .
the biased opinions hurt the relations between the countries and personally hurt the friends of germany in poland and in uk .
this is where the values of eu should start . - leszek wojtowicz , poland to be politically correct , we must pretend to be shocked at the wprost cover of chancellor merkel breast-feeding the twins .
but really , this cover does n't put chancellor merkel in a bad light at all .
she is the nurturer and the power figure .
it is the two weird twins who are the babies , completely powerless and dependent .
the chancellor is blithely sailing on , in full confidence and with a great body , to new opportunities to display her new-found powers .
actually , it is a very funny cover , because of the weirdness and fecklessness of the twins .
as i see it , chancellor merkel is presented positively and even with affection , but the twins receive a potent message of disdain from within their own country . - wiley horne , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a two-speed europe on its way ?
i wish to put forth four measures which i believe would do the trick in mending german-polish relations : 1 .
buy up all the low-quality polish meat that russia refuses to allow into the country ; 2 .
force russia to lay the new pipeline through polish territory so that the kaczynski twins can steal the gas en route to germany ; 3 .
applaud and endorse the ban on gay rights in poland ; 4 .
applaud and endorse the professional ban in poland . - luis oliveira , portugal on one side are the countries that want more integration and on the other side the countries that want a minimum of integration .
a block with one speed on one side and split countries on the other side - that is the answer and i think romano prodi hinted that something like that might happen . - gustavo araujo , uruguay i suspect that poland is a country still trying to get used to the idea that , for the first time in over two centuries -lrb- except for the 20 years between the two world wars -rrb- , it is truly free to determine its own destiny .
moreover , many in poland still feel a deep sense of hurt and pain over all the tragedies of the last century .
the best that germany can do is to be as sympathetic to the current mood in poland as possible and not do anything to aggravate the relationship any further .
i believe that german democratic institutions and germany 's self-concept are strong enough to digest this current " chill " in german-polish relations and to prove that , in the end , poland can rely on german friendship even at tense moments such as now . - gary k. taylor , honduras germany calls for extradition of cia agents the agents did a great job when they followed leads dealing with terrorist threats .
why is it okay for osama bin-laden and his group to kidnap journalists and kill them ?
but when the cia follows leads and does what it takes to gets results , the world questions it .
it 's strange the world never is willing to do what it takes to get the job done .
the world always expects the us to fix the problems . - loche , us i praise those men .
they were doing their duty to defend their country .
those who call the us allies should be ashamed of their act . - rafael fermoselle , cuba no , they should not be extradited .
they were doing the jobs that they were ordered to do .

i believe the von stauffenberg family should receive assurances that the content is accurate and presented accordingly .
i personally do not believe in the methods or teachings of the church of scientology , but tom cruise is a very good actor and it is my belief that he would do an outstanding job of representing colonel von stauffenberg . - joseph , us two reasons tom cruise should not play von stauffenberg : 1 .
he is too short , 2 .
he is not german .
i wonder if he will fake a german accent or speak like a guy from new jersey . - david worsham , us in the us ' first amendment to the bill of rights , a person 's religion is protected .
do the germans protect religion in their laws as well ?
i am not a scientologist , but i do sympathize with cruise .
in 1940 , if cruise had been a jew , i 'm sure he would not have been able to make a film in germany either .

repairing german-polish relations after the eu summit i find the opinions of the german press about the summit and poland and great britain unfair and biased .
no one discussed the merit of the proposals .
each country in the eu should have the right to express their opinions and the press should show different aspects of the issue and not to be just a propaganda tool .
unfortunately , i found most of the german press like that even before the summit .
the biased opinions hurt the relations between the countries and personally hurt the friends of germany in poland and in uk .
this is where the values of eu should start . - leszek wojtowicz , poland to be politically correct , we must pretend to be shocked at the wprost cover of chancellor merkel breast-feeding the twins .
but really , this cover does n't put chancellor merkel in a bad light at all .
she is the nurturer and the power figure .
it is the two weird twins who are the babies , completely powerless and dependent .
the chancellor is blithely sailing on , in full confidence and with a great body , to new opportunities to display her new-found powers .
actually , it is a very funny cover , because of the weirdness and fecklessness of the twins .
as i see it , chancellor merkel is presented positively and even with affection , but the twins receive a potent message of disdain from within their own country . - wiley horne , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a two-speed europe on its way ?
i wish to put forth four measures which i believe would do the trick in mending german-polish relations : 1 .
buy up all the low-quality polish meat that russia refuses to allow into the country ; 2 .
force russia to lay the new pipeline through polish territory so that the kaczynski twins can steal the gas en route to germany ; 3 .
applaud and endorse the ban on gay rights in poland ; 4 .
applaud and endorse the professional ban in poland . - luis oliveira , portugal on one side are the countries that want more integration and on the other side the countries that want a minimum of integration .
a block with one speed on one side and split countries on the other side - that is the answer and i think romano prodi hinted that something like that might happen . - gustavo araujo , uruguay i suspect that poland is a country still trying to get used to the idea that , for the first time in over two centuries -lrb- except for the 20 years between the two world wars -rrb- , it is truly free to determine its own destiny .
moreover , many in poland still feel a deep sense of hurt and pain over all the tragedies of the last century .
the best that germany can do is to be as sympathetic to the current mood in poland as possible and not do anything to aggravate the relationship any further .
i believe that german democratic institutions and germany 's self-concept are strong enough to digest this current " chill " in german-polish relations and to prove that , in the end , poland can rely on german friendship even at tense moments such as now . - gary k. taylor , honduras germany calls for extradition of cia agents the agents did a great job when they followed leads dealing with terrorist threats .
why is it okay for osama bin-laden and his group to kidnap journalists and kill them ?
but when the cia follows leads and does what it takes to gets results , the world questions it .

i personally do not believe in the methods or teachings of the church of scientology , but tom cruise is a very good actor and it is my belief that he would do an outstanding job of representing colonel von stauffenberg . - joseph , us two reasons tom cruise should not play von stauffenberg : 1 .

the proposal criticizes german car makers for producing fast autos which pollute . chris davies has proposed putting the brakes on speedy sports cars which pollute the environment .
the british european parliamentarian and member of the liberal democrats wants all cars produced in the eu to have a top speed of 162 kilometers per hour -lrb- 100 mph -rrb- that by 2013 . " at a time when europe has concerns over its energy security it is sheer madness to allow gas-guzzling cars to be built which are allowed to travel at a dangerous speed which is totally forbidden by law , " davies said tuesday . the speed on most european highways is 130 km / h .
germany is an exception , as many stretches of the autobahn do not have any speed limits .
" driving a car -lrb- faster than -rrb- that is against the law in every country but germany , " davies said , according to reuters .
" it 's nonsense .
i believe it needs to be countered . " driving the speed limit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most european countries have speed limits the german government has consistently refused to consider a comprehensive speed limit on its freeways .
the german automobile industry is strong and driving fast in a german-made porsche or bmw is considered a sacred right by some drivers . " we do not support this direction , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said of the proposal . germany backs other measures to improve road safety and cut emissions including new traffic management technology , congestion avoidance , road tolls and more driver education .
" these are modern approaches , " tiefensee said , adding that drivers who spend less time snarled in traffic need less fuel . cutting co2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants greener cars the liberal democrats ' plan as it was presented to the european parliament also calls for cutting carbon dioxide emissions to 120 grams per kilometer by 2015 and 95 grams per kilometer by 2020 .
davies said cars could meet higher standards of energy efficiency using existing technology .

" we laid the ground for a common future for the european union and overcame the impasse , " she said in her final address to the european parliament before germany 's presidency of the eu ends on saturday . " at the end of the day we did not disappoint people 's expectations and we avoided a division , " she said .
" europe can once again look forward to a period of strength and confidence . " merkel told the deputies that she had anticipated difficult negotiations at the summit in brussels , which saw poland threaten to block the treaty in a dispute over voting rights . if the talks had failed it would not have meant the end of europe as we know it , she said , but it would have had major consequences which would have been difficult to predict . merkel said failure could have led to a two-speed europe , with those in favor of reform pressing ahead at the expense of those who were reluctant to change . new eu treaty the treaty , a key priority of the german presidency , meant the eu was able to preserve elements of the european constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in a referendums held in 2005 . it allows for decisions to be taken by majority rather than a unanimous vote and removes the threat of national vetoes .
there are also provisions for an eu president and more powers to the eu 's foreign policy chief , giving the bloc a bigger say in the world . bildunterschrift : a few high-ranking merkel fans she said the post of a high representative for foreign affairs was necessary because it would enable europe to speak with one voice as it grows more assertive on the world stage . " this is a european political quantum leap , " she said to applause from deputies . the new treaty has to be endorsed by an inter-government conference before it can be ratified and put in place in time for european parliament elections in mid-2009 . the chancellor said she hoped these talks could get underway next month when portugal takes over the rotating eu presidency from germany . licking their wounds while calling the german presidency of the eu a resounding “ success ” , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier did acknowledge that relationships between some in the eu bloc did take a few hits in the past few weeks , notably germany and poland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier speaking in berlin on wednesday speaking at a news conference in berlin steinmeier said that he hoped the “ rough ” exchanges last weekend would be soon forgotten . “ things got quite abrasive and in the long run european politics can not endure that , ” he said . steinmeier went on to criticize the polish magazine wprost for featuring a photo montage of a topless angela merkel breastfeeding the kaczynski brothers , poland 's prime minister and president . " germany wanted to be a mother for poland but she turned out to be a false mother , " said editor-in-chief stanislaw janecki . the magazine cover is just the last of a long line of recent spats between the eu neighbors but steinmeier expressed hope that such disagreements would not continue .

the proposal criticizes german car makers for producing fast autos which pollute . chris davies has proposed putting the brakes on speedy sports cars which pollute the environment .
the british european parliamentarian and member of the liberal democrats wants all cars produced in the eu to have a top speed of 162 kilometers per hour -lrb- 100 mph -rrb- that by 2013 . " at a time when europe has concerns over its energy security it is sheer madness to allow gas-guzzling cars to be built which are allowed to travel at a dangerous speed which is totally forbidden by law , " davies said tuesday . the speed on most european highways is 130 km / h .
germany is an exception , as many stretches of the autobahn do not have any speed limits .
" driving a car -lrb- faster than -rrb- that is against the law in every country but germany , " davies said , according to reuters .
" it 's nonsense .
i believe it needs to be countered . " driving the speed limit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most european countries have speed limits the german government has consistently refused to consider a comprehensive speed limit on its freeways .
the german automobile industry is strong and driving fast in a german-made porsche or bmw is considered a sacred right by some drivers . " we do not support this direction , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said of the proposal . germany backs other measures to improve road safety and cut emissions including new traffic management technology , congestion avoidance , road tolls and more driver education .
" these are modern approaches , " tiefensee said , adding that drivers who spend less time snarled in traffic need less fuel . cutting co2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants greener cars the liberal democrats ' plan as it was presented to the european parliament also calls for cutting carbon dioxide emissions to 120 grams per kilometer by 2015 and 95 grams per kilometer by 2020 .

german politicians disagree over whether germany should focus on attracting foreign workers or on improving the skills of the domestic workforce . the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released a study earlier this week which showed germany had brought in 13,000 fewer legal immigrants in 2005 compared with a year earlier .
other studies have shown that highly skilled german workers are also increasingly attracted to high salaries abroad , which contributes to germany 's brain drain .
in 2005 , the united states , britain and italy had large increases in the number of legal migrants , according to the oecd 's annual international migration outlook report .
the decrease in immigration is bad for the german economy , which needs to attract highly skilled workers to stay competitive , said germany 's education minister annette schavan .
" germany needs to make it clear that we have a very high interest in foreign talent , " schavan said in a recent article in germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
schavan of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said she is n't advocating uncontrolled immigration .
rather , she wants germany to become more attractive for highly qualified , skilled workers .
focus on domestic workforce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's annette schavan while german employers agreed skilled foreign workers are needed , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has criticized the idea .
german workers should get better training and qualifications before looking to foreign workers .
the spd and cdu make up the ruling coalition in germany 's government .
spd general secretary hubertus heil said employing skilled foreign workers is at times necessary .
but employers should focus on educating and training german workers .
abandoning german workers in favor of a foreign workforce " would be fatal for the german economy , " heil said .
schavan said she agreed and believed the current left-right coalition made up of the cdu and spd has already taken steps to help german workers .
" even when everyone in germany is well trained and educated , beyond that you still need qualified specialists from elsewhere , " she said during a television interview wednesday morning .
lowering barriers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a brain drain is underway a new law requires specialized workers from non-european union countries to earn at least 85,000 euros -lrb- $ 114,400 -rrb- in order to get german work and living permits .
cdu politicians have suggested lowering that requirement to 60,000 or 40,000 euros .
small businesses and start-ups simply ca n't pay such a high salary , even for highly-qualified employees , said maria böhmer of the cdu , who is in charge of migration issues in the government .
" when this barrier is not lowered , the best minds will leave for other countries and germany will empty out , " böhmer said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german politicians disagree over whether germany should focus on attracting foreign workers or on improving the skills of the domestic workforce . the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released a study earlier this week which showed germany had brought in 13,000 fewer legal immigrants in 2005 compared with a year earlier .
other studies have shown that highly skilled german workers are also increasingly attracted to high salaries abroad , which contributes to germany 's brain drain .
in 2005 , the united states , britain and italy had large increases in the number of legal migrants , according to the oecd 's annual international migration outlook report .
the decrease in immigration is bad for the german economy , which needs to attract highly skilled workers to stay competitive , said germany 's education minister annette schavan .
" germany needs to make it clear that we have a very high interest in foreign talent , " schavan said in a recent article in germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
schavan of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said she is n't advocating uncontrolled immigration .
rather , she wants germany to become more attractive for highly qualified , skilled workers .
focus on domestic workforce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's annette schavan while german employers agreed skilled foreign workers are needed , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has criticized the idea .
german workers should get better training and qualifications before looking to foreign workers .
the spd and cdu make up the ruling coalition in germany 's government .
spd general secretary hubertus heil said employing skilled foreign workers is at times necessary .
but employers should focus on educating and training german workers .
abandoning german workers in favor of a foreign workforce " would be fatal for the german economy , " heil said .
schavan said she agreed and believed the current left-right coalition made up of the cdu and spd has already taken steps to help german workers .
" even when everyone in germany is well trained and educated , beyond that you still need qualified specialists from elsewhere , " she said during a television interview wednesday morning .
lowering barriers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a brain drain is underway a new law requires specialized workers from non-european union countries to earn at least 85,000 euros -lrb- $ 114,400 -rrb- in order to get german work and living permits .
cdu politicians have suggested lowering that requirement to 60,000 or 40,000 euros .
small businesses and start-ups simply ca n't pay such a high salary , even for highly-qualified employees , said maria böhmer of the cdu , who is in charge of migration issues in the government .

his departure marks the end of an era .
tony blair had nearly let us forget that great britain was a conservative stronghold for nearly two decades .
the iron lady and the pale john major were hardly history when the young , dynamic new labour leader conquered the middle by forging a " third way " between the traditional conservative and left ideals in 1997 .
he gave labour , the workers ' and unions ' party , a new image and made it a viable choice for middle-class voters by pulling the party away from the left .
the youngest prime minister since 1812 , the kids in 10 downing street had pop stars as political allies .
the era of " cool britannia " had begun .
ten years under tony blair modernized great britain .
the economy has boomed over the long-term .
unemployment has sunk .
the northern ireland conflict , which had gone on for decades , was settled .
northern ireland , scotland and wales have their own parliamentary bodies .
billions have been invested in margaret thatcher 's run-down health system and britain 's debts .
but not everything is rosy in the land of new labour .
there are still long waiting lists in the health care system .
not every privatization can be seen as a success .
and despite - or because of blair 's economic reforms - the gap between great britain 's rich and poor has not shrunk .
but those are not the reasons why blair and his party were punished at recent parliamentary elections in scotland and wales as well as on the municipal level .
blair 's government based itself on an efficient pr machine that mastered the art of the spin , and distrust among the population grew larger and larger until it culminated with the debacle of the never-found weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
despite massive public opposition , blair led the country into a war whose central premises emerged as false .
in exchange for his support of the increasingly isolated us president george w. bush , blair reaped ridicule and the nicknames " poodle " and " lap dog . "
tony blair never recovered from that .
then there are the accusations of nepotism - blair 's one-time consultant and spin doctor peter mandelson became a commissioner in brussels - and the allegations his party accepted donations in exchange for honors , which may have led to seats in the upper house of parliament .
the clean-cut image of britain 's once favorite son has long been tarnished .
the skirmish surrounding the recent eu summit , blair 's last international appearance as prime minister , also showed that blair could not keep his promise to increase great britain 's integration in europe .
while he himself enjoys , and has had success , being a staunch european on the eu stage , the tendency toward euro-skepticism in the british media and general public has grown in recent years .
only 40 percent of britons still support membership in the eu , according to a recent poll .
in his final days , blair was a placeholder while his successor gained in significance as the one pulling the strings - sometimes behind the scenes and sometimes very publicly .
now blair is leaving the political stage - at least in his role as britain 's prime minister - after a farewell that has taken too long .
it is high time for him to go .
and the british electorate seems to be thanking him for his departure .
for the first time in months , the labour party is ahead in the polls and blair 's successor , gordon brown , once written off as uncharismatic , is coming in well ahead of his conservative rival , the young , dynamic david cameron , who resembles the young blair .
the blair era is over .
" cool britannia " is ready for a change .
first with a new labour leader .
whether blair 's party will be able to stay in power after the next elections remains to be seen .
blair 's spot in history , however , is secure .
but only time will tell if the damage the iraq war did to his image will be qualified by his undeniable successes .

" we laid the ground for a common future for the european union and overcame the impasse , " she said in her final address to the european parliament before germany 's presidency of the eu ends on saturday . " at the end of the day we did not disappoint people 's expectations and we avoided a division , " she said .
" europe can once again look forward to a period of strength and confidence . " merkel told the deputies that she had anticipated difficult negotiations at the summit in brussels , which saw poland threaten to block the treaty in a dispute over voting rights . if the talks had failed it would not have meant the end of europe as we know it , she said , but it would have had major consequences which would have been difficult to predict . merkel said failure could have led to a two-speed europe , with those in favor of reform pressing ahead at the expense of those who were reluctant to change . new eu treaty the treaty , a key priority of the german presidency , meant the eu was able to preserve elements of the european constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in a referendums held in 2005 . it allows for decisions to be taken by majority rather than a unanimous vote and removes the threat of national vetoes .
there are also provisions for an eu president and more powers to the eu 's foreign policy chief , giving the bloc a bigger say in the world . bildunterschrift : a few high-ranking merkel fans she said the post of a high representative for foreign affairs was necessary because it would enable europe to speak with one voice as it grows more assertive on the world stage . " this is a european political quantum leap , " she said to applause from deputies . the new treaty has to be endorsed by an inter-government conference before it can be ratified and put in place in time for european parliament elections in mid-2009 . the chancellor said she hoped these talks could get underway next month when portugal takes over the rotating eu presidency from germany . licking their wounds while calling the german presidency of the eu a resounding “ success ” , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier did acknowledge that relationships between some in the eu bloc did take a few hits in the past few weeks , notably germany and poland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier speaking in berlin on wednesday speaking at a news conference in berlin steinmeier said that he hoped the “ rough ” exchanges last weekend would be soon forgotten . “ things got quite abrasive and in the long run european politics can not endure that , ” he said . steinmeier went on to criticize the polish magazine wprost for featuring a photo montage of a topless angela merkel breastfeeding the kaczynski brothers , poland 's prime minister and president . " germany wanted to be a mother for poland but she turned out to be a false mother , " said editor-in-chief stanislaw janecki . the magazine cover is just the last of a long line of recent spats between the eu neighbors but steinmeier expressed hope that such disagreements would not continue .

his departure marks the end of an era .
tony blair had nearly let us forget that great britain was a conservative stronghold for nearly two decades .
the iron lady and the pale john major were hardly history when the young , dynamic new labour leader conquered the middle by forging a " third way " between the traditional conservative and left ideals in 1997 .
he gave labour , the workers ' and unions ' party , a new image and made it a viable choice for middle-class voters by pulling the party away from the left .
the youngest prime minister since 1812 , the kids in 10 downing street had pop stars as political allies .
the era of " cool britannia " had begun .
ten years under tony blair modernized great britain .
the economy has boomed over the long-term .
unemployment has sunk .
the northern ireland conflict , which had gone on for decades , was settled .
northern ireland , scotland and wales have their own parliamentary bodies .
billions have been invested in margaret thatcher 's run-down health system and britain 's debts .
but not everything is rosy in the land of new labour .
there are still long waiting lists in the health care system .
not every privatization can be seen as a success .
and despite - or because of blair 's economic reforms - the gap between great britain 's rich and poor has not shrunk .
but those are not the reasons why blair and his party were punished at recent parliamentary elections in scotland and wales as well as on the municipal level .
blair 's government based itself on an efficient pr machine that mastered the art of the spin , and distrust among the population grew larger and larger until it culminated with the debacle of the never-found weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
despite massive public opposition , blair led the country into a war whose central premises emerged as false .
in exchange for his support of the increasingly isolated us president george w. bush , blair reaped ridicule and the nicknames " poodle " and " lap dog . "
tony blair never recovered from that .
then there are the accusations of nepotism - blair 's one-time consultant and spin doctor peter mandelson became a commissioner in brussels - and the allegations his party accepted donations in exchange for honors , which may have led to seats in the upper house of parliament .
the clean-cut image of britain 's once favorite son has long been tarnished .
the skirmish surrounding the recent eu summit , blair 's last international appearance as prime minister , also showed that blair could not keep his promise to increase great britain 's integration in europe .
while he himself enjoys , and has had success , being a staunch european on the eu stage , the tendency toward euro-skepticism in the british media and general public has grown in recent years .
only 40 percent of britons still support membership in the eu , according to a recent poll .
in his final days , blair was a placeholder while his successor gained in significance as the one pulling the strings - sometimes behind the scenes and sometimes very publicly .
now blair is leaving the political stage - at least in his role as britain 's prime minister - after a farewell that has taken too long .
it is high time for him to go .
and the british electorate seems to be thanking him for his departure .
for the first time in months , the labour party is ahead in the polls and blair 's successor , gordon brown , once written off as uncharismatic , is coming in well ahead of his conservative rival , the young , dynamic david cameron , who resembles the young blair .
the blair era is over .
" cool britannia " is ready for a change .
first with a new labour leader .
whether blair 's party will be able to stay in power after the next elections remains to be seen .
blair 's spot in history , however , is secure .
but only time will tell if the damage the iraq war did to his image will be qualified by his undeniable successes .

german politicians disagree over whether germany should focus on attracting foreign workers or on improving the skills of the domestic workforce . the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released a study earlier this week which showed germany had brought in 13,000 fewer legal immigrants in 2005 compared with a year earlier .
other studies have shown that highly skilled german workers are also increasingly attracted to high salaries abroad , which contributes to germany 's brain drain .
in 2005 , the united states , britain and italy had large increases in the number of legal migrants , according to the oecd 's annual international migration outlook report .
the decrease in immigration is bad for the german economy , which needs to attract highly skilled workers to stay competitive , said germany 's education minister annette schavan .
" germany needs to make it clear that we have a very high interest in foreign talent , " schavan said in a recent article in germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
schavan of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said she is n't advocating uncontrolled immigration .
rather , she wants germany to become more attractive for highly qualified , skilled workers .
focus on domestic workforce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's annette schavan while german employers agreed skilled foreign workers are needed , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has criticized the idea .
german workers should get better training and qualifications before looking to foreign workers .
the spd and cdu make up the ruling coalition in germany 's government .
spd general secretary hubertus heil said employing skilled foreign workers is at times necessary .
but employers should focus on educating and training german workers .
abandoning german workers in favor of a foreign workforce " would be fatal for the german economy , " heil said .
schavan said she agreed and believed the current left-right coalition made up of the cdu and spd has already taken steps to help german workers .
" even when everyone in germany is well trained and educated , beyond that you still need qualified specialists from elsewhere , " she said during a television interview wednesday morning .
lowering barriers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a brain drain is underway a new law requires specialized workers from non-european union countries to earn at least 85,000 euros -lrb- $ 114,400 -rrb- in order to get german work and living permits .
cdu politicians have suggested lowering that requirement to 60,000 or 40,000 euros .
small businesses and start-ups simply ca n't pay such a high salary , even for highly-qualified employees , said maria böhmer of the cdu , who is in charge of migration issues in the government .

the proposal criticizes german car makers for producing fast autos which pollute . chris davies has proposed putting the brakes on speedy sports cars which pollute the environment .
the british european parliamentarian and member of the liberal democrats wants all cars produced in the eu to have a top speed of 162 kilometers per hour -lrb- 100 mph -rrb- that by 2013 . " at a time when europe has concerns over its energy security it is sheer madness to allow gas-guzzling cars to be built which are allowed to travel at a dangerous speed which is totally forbidden by law , " davies said tuesday . the speed on most european highways is 130 km / h .
germany is an exception , as many stretches of the autobahn do not have any speed limits .
" driving a car -lrb- faster than -rrb- that is against the law in every country but germany , " davies said , according to reuters .
" it 's nonsense .
i believe it needs to be countered . " driving the speed limit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most european countries have speed limits the german government has consistently refused to consider a comprehensive speed limit on its freeways .
the german automobile industry is strong and driving fast in a german-made porsche or bmw is considered a sacred right by some drivers . " we do not support this direction , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said of the proposal . germany backs other measures to improve road safety and cut emissions including new traffic management technology , congestion avoidance , road tolls and more driver education .
" these are modern approaches , " tiefensee said , adding that drivers who spend less time snarled in traffic need less fuel . cutting co2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants greener cars the liberal democrats ' plan as it was presented to the european parliament also calls for cutting carbon dioxide emissions to 120 grams per kilometer by 2015 and 95 grams per kilometer by 2020 .
davies said cars could meet higher standards of energy efficiency using existing technology .

world leaders will have to get used to a new face - and style - in 10 downing street . in a brief statement to reporters just before moving into his new home , brown said he taken note of the british people 's desire for change , promising " a new government with new priorities . "
he also said he wanted to create better opportunities for all britons . brown 's remarks came after queen elizabeth ii , in accordance with british custom , invited him to form a government . earlier in the day , tony blair fielded one last session of questions in parliament and said farewell to the staff at 10 downing street before heading to buckingham palace to tender his resignation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair bid an emotional , and lengthy , farewell in recent weeks the 56-year-old brown is expected to announce his cabinet and the rest of his government on thursday . taking center stage despite serving as chancellor of the exchequer for more than ten years under blair , brown remains a somewhat enigmatic figure for many britons .
and some question whether the scotsman will ever completely emerge from his telegenic predecessor 's shadow . brown may have promised change , but few people expect him , in the short term , to make any major domestic-policy reversals - especially as britain enjoyed an extended period of economic growth under the blair government .
but there has been some speculation that brown may be somewhat more liberal on spending as prime minister than he was as chancellor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and brown did n't always see eye-eo-eye more interesting , perhaps , is the course brown will take regarding foreign policy and , in particular , the iraq war .
although brown has said he still supports the us-led campaign in iraq , some observers expect him to take a somewhat more skeptical approach toward washington than blair . brown 's appointment ends one 's britain 's most uneasy , if longest-lasting marriages of political convenience .
once rivals for the leadership of the labour party , brown reportedly agreed in the mid-nineties to put his own ambitions to become prime minister on hold and support blair , who was elected in 1997 . in return , blair purportedly agreed to step down at some point while still in office and clear the way for brown . new partner for britain 's allies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and his wife sarah are the new residents of 10 downing street european and other world leaders were expected to begin congratulating brown personally and in public statements . in a tribute to blair published in a british newspaper on wednesday , us president george bush praised brown , writing that the then prime minister designate " was n't the image of the dour scotsman at all . " but bush was more effusive in lauding blair . " i 've heard he 's been called ' bush 's poodle , " ' bush wrote .
" he 's bigger than that .
we 're working together to achieve global peace in the face of enormous danger .
this kind of thing is just silly ridicule . " blair becomes envoy former prime minister blair was wednesday named special envoy of the diplomatic quartet pushing for middle east peace and tasked with spearheading efforts to create a palestinian state . " following discussions among the principals , today the quartet dealing with the middle east is announcing the appointment of tony blair as the quartet representative , " un spokeswoman michele montas announced . blair 's new role on the world stage was announced shortly after he stepped down after a decade in power . the post of quartet representative had been vacant since former world bank chairman john wolfensohn left in frustration in may 2006 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we laid the ground for a common future for the european union and overcame the impasse , " she said in her final address to the european parliament before germany 's presidency of the eu ends on saturday . " at the end of the day we did not disappoint people 's expectations and we avoided a division , " she said .
" europe can once again look forward to a period of strength and confidence . " merkel told the deputies that she had anticipated difficult negotiations at the summit in brussels , which saw poland threaten to block the treaty in a dispute over voting rights . if the talks had failed it would not have meant the end of europe as we know it , she said , but it would have had major consequences which would have been difficult to predict . merkel said failure could have led to a two-speed europe , with those in favor of reform pressing ahead at the expense of those who were reluctant to change . new eu treaty the treaty , a key priority of the german presidency , meant the eu was able to preserve elements of the european constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in a referendums held in 2005 . it allows for decisions to be taken by majority rather than a unanimous vote and removes the threat of national vetoes .
there are also provisions for an eu president and more powers to the eu 's foreign policy chief , giving the bloc a bigger say in the world . bildunterschrift : a few high-ranking merkel fans she said the post of a high representative for foreign affairs was necessary because it would enable europe to speak with one voice as it grows more assertive on the world stage . " this is a european political quantum leap , " she said to applause from deputies . the new treaty has to be endorsed by an inter-government conference before it can be ratified and put in place in time for european parliament elections in mid-2009 . the chancellor said she hoped these talks could get underway next month when portugal takes over the rotating eu presidency from germany . licking their wounds while calling the german presidency of the eu a resounding “ success ” , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier did acknowledge that relationships between some in the eu bloc did take a few hits in the past few weeks , notably germany and poland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier speaking in berlin on wednesday speaking at a news conference in berlin steinmeier said that he hoped the “ rough ” exchanges last weekend would be soon forgotten . “ things got quite abrasive and in the long run european politics can not endure that , ” he said . steinmeier went on to criticize the polish magazine wprost for featuring a photo montage of a topless angela merkel breastfeeding the kaczynski brothers , poland 's prime minister and president . " germany wanted to be a mother for poland but she turned out to be a false mother , " said editor-in-chief stanislaw janecki . the magazine cover is just the last of a long line of recent spats between the eu neighbors but steinmeier expressed hope that such disagreements would not continue .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer-generated image of a typical 19th century jewish street in a polish town " over the past 900 years , our histories have been entangled , " polish president lech told dignitaries and onlookers standing in front of the imposing black marble warsaw ghetto uprising memorial , commemorating the 1943 doomed rebellion by members of the jewish fighting organization -lrb- zob -rrb- .
" there have been good times and bad .
but the history of the polish jews is a part of the history of my country , my nation .
it is a history that deserves being commemorated , " he said .
the land-mark museum is appropriately located in warsaw , " the greatest jewish city in europe " prior to world war ii , kaczynski said .
the warsaw ghetto before the war , poland 's jewish minority numbered some 3.5 million and accounted for roughly 10 per cent of the country 's pre- war population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish life in poland was almost completely obliterated by nazis the ground-breaking ceremonies were conducted in an district of warsaw that was at the heart of jewish life prior to the war .
tragically , it was enclosed inside the infamous wartime jewish ghetto created by nazi germany as part of its systematic genocide against european jews .
the nazi german ghettos and death camps claimed the vast majority of poland 's jews .
the number accounts for half of the six million europeans of jewish ancestry killed by nazi dictator adolf hitler 's third reich .
europe was home to some 11 million jews prior to the holocaust .
biblical proportions designed by finnish architectural duo rainer mahlamäki and ilmari lahdelma , the museum 's entrance promises to be of biblical proportions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new museum will be facing the warsaw ghetto memorial a symbolically ruptured facade will open up to monumental undulating walls alluding to the old testament 's miraculous parting of the red sea through which the prophet moses led the jews to escape captivity in egypt to a new life in the promised land .
it is a labor of love for project director jerzy halberstadt and head of the warsaw-based jewish historical institute and holocaust survivor marian turski .
holocaust and jewish history expert israel gutman will supervise the team preparing expositions .
" this will be a museum about life that will benefit dialogue and the future , " halberstadt said , adding that the institution aimed to attract a half million visitors a year .
financed by by the polish government , the city of warsaw and the european union , the project is slated to cost around $ 65 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- , according to news agency ap .
measuring a total of 18,000 square meters -lrb- 59,000 square feet -rrb- , the museum will be one of the largest jewish museums in the world - along with yad vashem in jerusalem and the holocaust memorial in washington dc . dw staff with agency reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are calling for more political responsibility to ensure that they can continue to fulfill their educational task . the dachau concentration camp memorial site near munich receives over 800,000 visitors per year .
internationally , it is among the best-known sites commemorating the memory of the millions who perished in the holocaust in europe . but faced with an acute cash crunch , memorial centers strewn across germany , dachau included , are increasingly struggling to carry out their primary task : educating future generations about the horrors of the holocaust and the valuable lessons they hold for humanity . barbara distel , director of the dachau memorial site said its education department can not meet all requests for tours or other educational offers . " the situation in dachau is unsatisfactory , " distel said .
the center only has one full-time educator . other major sites report of similar problems .
the foundation managing the memorials at sachsenhausen , ravensbrück and brandenburg in eastern germany said funding was only enough to cover operating costs .
buchenwald , also in eastern germany , has had to work with a capped budget since 1998 , despite the increase in costs . " our back is to the wall , " said rikola-gunnar lüttgenau , deputy director of the buchenwald memorial foundation .
he said the center did not have the means to revise existing permanent exhibitions or conduct youth projects , for example .
the latter could only be financed through external sources , such as other foundations . charging entrance fees for concentration camps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops who liberated dachau were horrified by what they found the president of the international dachau committee , pieter dietz de loos last month sparked a debate on whether memorial sites should introduce entrance fees to alleviate these financial problems .
the committee was founded by former prisoners following world war two and played a decisive role in setting up the memorial site at dachau .
it does not , however , contribute to the site 's funding . " the committee will be broke in five years , " said dietz de loos , a dutch attorney and son of a dachau prisoner , at the camp 's liberation ceremony in may . but the proposal to charge entry fees for concentration camps has sparked unease among many . " i can not imagine that visitors to dachau will have to pay an entrance fee , " said distel . according to the central council of jews in germany , those sites where history occurred had to be accessible to everyone . " it is only through these concrete places that visitors can thoroughly experience for themselves the presence of historical events , " the council 's vice-president salomon korn told jewish weekly jüdische allgemeine .
" such a visual link of history and an authentic place serves to reinforce and deepen remembrance . " entrance fees would only undermine this , korn said . private investors holding back american philanthropist ronald lauder set up and finances a project to preserve europe 's most notorious concentration camp , auschwitz , in present day poland . but some point out that in germany , private investors remain reluctant to do the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn says historical sites need to be maintained korn said german companies were " elegantly refraining " from contributing to financing , despite " a moral obligation and responsibility " to maintain these memorial sites . buchenwald 's lüttgenau said this was due to industry concerns that any backing could be misunderstood . " private companies fear that support for our educational work would be equal to an admission of guilt , " lüttgenau said . sites are germany 's responsibility distel said the government carried the responsibility for the memorial sites in germany .
the bavarian state government 's ministry of culture finances dachau , for example .
according to a spokesman , it provides the memorial site with some 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- annually for personnel and material costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other camp is more associated with the horrors of the holocaust than auschwitz " i consider it to be germany 's political and cultural task to ensure that these sites are equipped in a way that they can adequately work , " distel said . this view was shared by korn .
he said it was not the memorial sites ' obligation , but rather that of those politically responsible to ensure that the memory of these camps stayed alive . " the federal and state governments are obliged to ensure that everyone has access to these sites , which represent the darkest part of german history , " korn said . thomas lutz of the topography of terror foundation said , though , that it was not clear whether the political support necessary was present . " the only chance now is to make it publicly clear that there is a significant gap between the demands on the memorial sites and their ability to fulfill these , " said lutz , who heads the foundation 's department for memorial sites . german government has yet to provide a solution for now , dachau and the other sites are trying to work as effectively as possible .
lüttgenau said the buchenwald site had exhausted all savings measures .
but it was n't enough to address the needs of its half a million visitors per year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many youth groups visit former concentration camps , such as sachsenhausen " we can not attend to the growing demand for educational services , such as accompanying groups through the site , " lüttgenau said .
it has had to turn down 30 to 40 percent of such inquiries . " considering the need for more educational youth work in eastern germany , this is a dramatic situation , " lüttgenau said .
" the interest is there and we ca n't fulfill it . " the german government has said it is working on a new concept for financing the concentration camp memorial sites in germany .
but it has yet to present a model . " we are caught between a rock and a hard place right now , " lüttgenau said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the future of the internet is now germans hesitant to look for love online wikipedia founder : " great ideas come from different places " the internet and everyday life : the constant revolution " the synapses of a collective brain are growing " internet -pipe- 27.06.2007 the future is now großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will computer programs replace the human need for face-to-face contact ?
the world wide web as an interactive , collaborative platform for data exchange - best known as web 2.0 - has become , in industrialized countries , at least , a part of everyday life . the internet revolution is showing no signs of fatigue .
millions of people are writing wikipedia articles , reviewing books at amazon , evaluating articles they bought at ebay , publishing their holiday photos on flickr and presenting themselves on facebook .
wherever they are , they are part of a larger network that knows no national or cultural borders .
" the internet has become a platform , " said technology publisher and web 2.0 guru tim o 'reilly .
millions of networked personal computers are providing access to " the one global , electronic brain that we 're creating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon is not just an online retailer : it draws its customers to participate in product evaluation this collective brain is processing vast amounts of information at an increasing speed .
companies are already using data freely available on the internet to look for and contact their potential customers .
jeff hammerbacher of the social networking site , facebook , asserts that his company does not sell its users ' data , but it negotiates with advertisers what additional analysis can be performed on the very private details that often appear on the site .
web search giants yahoo and google , while claiming to be very protective of their user data , also point out that they follow the law in the countries in which they operate and are obliged to cooperate with law enforcement agencies , when asked to do so .
data collection with no limits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " let 's see who 'll be late for class today " in theory , at least , the possibilities for data collection and aggregation on the web are limitless .
data mining expert and former chief scientist at amazon , andreas weigend , said that if gps signals from cellular phones were available to everybody , his students could , for instance , figure out that he was 15 minutes late for his morning lecture , if they saw his cell phone emitting its signals 10 miles -lrb- 16 kilometers -rrb- away from campus .
if , however , he 'd make it to the lecture hall on time anyway , the police could , as tim o 'reilly points out , also conclude that he must have exceeded the speed limit on the road .
a speeding ticket could easily follow .
social network platforms such as facebook and myspace - in which users set up their own pages , profiles and links to other users with similar interests - ca n't say anything on their own about the actual relationships between two people : would they really get along ?
can they trust each other ?
o 'reilly , however , believes that software applications will soon be able to make decisions in the social realm that were previously reserved for humans only .
if an application can make the decision , which would normally require a face-to-face contact , then it can also decide if it should give out somebody 's phone number to a third party .
additional value through global data collection the development of new technologies goes hand in hand with the transformation of society .
five years ago , people would think twice before writing something intimate on a postcard , well-aware that anybody could read it .
nowadays , personal web logs - or blogs - are filled with publicly accessible , personal information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is one of the driving forces of the internet economy young people , especially , find nothing extraordinary about this .
while benefiting from the added value of global data collection , they are ready to contribute their part .
web researchers agree that digital devices will continue to play an increasingly prominent part in everybody 's life .
in china , says andreas weigend , one million cell new phones are sold every day .
farmers in the country may not have a computer , but they do have cell phones .
" and the government sends them , for example , information about health care on their cell phones , " weigend said .
soon , other devices for accessing information will come into play as well .
smart radios and other wireless devices , for instance , will avoid transmission bottlenecks by reconfiguring themselves to use frequencies that they sense are clear .
one laptop per child -lrb- olpc -rrb- - a non-profit organization chaired by mit media lab founder nicolas negroponte - is developing a $ 100 -lrb- 75 euros -rrb- portable computer for children in developing nations as part of a mission to bridge the digital divide between industrialized and lesser developed countries .
" we 'll be surprised " the silicon valley , for its part , has definitely recovered from the 2001 crash .
new startups are launching - although everybody is somewhat more cautious than in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oplc aims to bring computers to the underprivildged it is , however , getting crowded on the internet market .
the big players are already swallowing the smaller ones : google now owns the video-sharing platform youtube , whereas yahoo purchased the photo-sharing site flickr .
this , according to tim o 'reilly , is to be expected in the development of a new technology .
the more participants a network has , the more valuable it becomes .
and those who were there first , profit the most .
what is certain , at this point , is that there is no way back .
it 's hard , however , to make any predictions about future technological developments .

world leaders will have to get used to a new face - and style - in 10 downing street . in a brief statement to reporters just before moving into his new home , brown said he taken note of the british people 's desire for change , promising " a new government with new priorities . "
he also said he wanted to create better opportunities for all britons . brown 's remarks came after queen elizabeth ii , in accordance with british custom , invited him to form a government . earlier in the day , tony blair fielded one last session of questions in parliament and said farewell to the staff at 10 downing street before heading to buckingham palace to tender his resignation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair bid an emotional , and lengthy , farewell in recent weeks the 56-year-old brown is expected to announce his cabinet and the rest of his government on thursday . taking center stage despite serving as chancellor of the exchequer for more than ten years under blair , brown remains a somewhat enigmatic figure for many britons .
and some question whether the scotsman will ever completely emerge from his telegenic predecessor 's shadow . brown may have promised change , but few people expect him , in the short term , to make any major domestic-policy reversals - especially as britain enjoyed an extended period of economic growth under the blair government .
but there has been some speculation that brown may be somewhat more liberal on spending as prime minister than he was as chancellor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and brown did n't always see eye-eo-eye more interesting , perhaps , is the course brown will take regarding foreign policy and , in particular , the iraq war .
although brown has said he still supports the us-led campaign in iraq , some observers expect him to take a somewhat more skeptical approach toward washington than blair . brown 's appointment ends one 's britain 's most uneasy , if longest-lasting marriages of political convenience .
once rivals for the leadership of the labour party , brown reportedly agreed in the mid-nineties to put his own ambitions to become prime minister on hold and support blair , who was elected in 1997 . in return , blair purportedly agreed to step down at some point while still in office and clear the way for brown . new partner for britain 's allies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and his wife sarah are the new residents of 10 downing street european and other world leaders were expected to begin congratulating brown personally and in public statements . in a tribute to blair published in a british newspaper on wednesday , us president george bush praised brown , writing that the then prime minister designate " was n't the image of the dour scotsman at all . " but bush was more effusive in lauding blair . " i 've heard he 's been called ' bush 's poodle , " ' bush wrote .
" he 's bigger than that .
we 're working together to achieve global peace in the face of enormous danger .
this kind of thing is just silly ridicule . " blair becomes envoy former prime minister blair was wednesday named special envoy of the diplomatic quartet pushing for middle east peace and tasked with spearheading efforts to create a palestinian state . " following discussions among the principals , today the quartet dealing with the middle east is announcing the appointment of tony blair as the quartet representative , " un spokeswoman michele montas announced . blair 's new role on the world stage was announced shortly after he stepped down after a decade in power . the post of quartet representative had been vacant since former world bank chairman john wolfensohn left in frustration in may 2006 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his departure marks the end of an era .
tony blair had nearly let us forget that great britain was a conservative stronghold for nearly two decades .
the iron lady and the pale john major were hardly history when the young , dynamic new labour leader conquered the middle by forging a " third way " between the traditional conservative and left ideals in 1997 .
he gave labour , the workers ' and unions ' party , a new image and made it a viable choice for middle-class voters by pulling the party away from the left .
the youngest prime minister since 1812 , the kids in 10 downing street had pop stars as political allies .
the era of " cool britannia " had begun .
ten years under tony blair modernized great britain .
the economy has boomed over the long-term .
unemployment has sunk .
the northern ireland conflict , which had gone on for decades , was settled .
northern ireland , scotland and wales have their own parliamentary bodies .
billions have been invested in margaret thatcher 's run-down health system and britain 's debts .
but not everything is rosy in the land of new labour .
there are still long waiting lists in the health care system .
not every privatization can be seen as a success .
and despite - or because of blair 's economic reforms - the gap between great britain 's rich and poor has not shrunk .
but those are not the reasons why blair and his party were punished at recent parliamentary elections in scotland and wales as well as on the municipal level .
blair 's government based itself on an efficient pr machine that mastered the art of the spin , and distrust among the population grew larger and larger until it culminated with the debacle of the never-found weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
despite massive public opposition , blair led the country into a war whose central premises emerged as false .
in exchange for his support of the increasingly isolated us president george w. bush , blair reaped ridicule and the nicknames " poodle " and " lap dog . "
tony blair never recovered from that .
then there are the accusations of nepotism - blair 's one-time consultant and spin doctor peter mandelson became a commissioner in brussels - and the allegations his party accepted donations in exchange for honors , which may have led to seats in the upper house of parliament .
the clean-cut image of britain 's once favorite son has long been tarnished .
the skirmish surrounding the recent eu summit , blair 's last international appearance as prime minister , also showed that blair could not keep his promise to increase great britain 's integration in europe .
while he himself enjoys , and has had success , being a staunch european on the eu stage , the tendency toward euro-skepticism in the british media and general public has grown in recent years .
only 40 percent of britons still support membership in the eu , according to a recent poll .
in his final days , blair was a placeholder while his successor gained in significance as the one pulling the strings - sometimes behind the scenes and sometimes very publicly .
now blair is leaving the political stage - at least in his role as britain 's prime minister - after a farewell that has taken too long .
it is high time for him to go .
and the british electorate seems to be thanking him for his departure .
for the first time in months , the labour party is ahead in the polls and blair 's successor , gordon brown , once written off as uncharismatic , is coming in well ahead of his conservative rival , the young , dynamic david cameron , who resembles the young blair .
the blair era is over .
" cool britannia " is ready for a change .
first with a new labour leader .
whether blair 's party will be able to stay in power after the next elections remains to be seen .
blair 's spot in history , however , is secure .
but only time will tell if the damage the iraq war did to his image will be qualified by his undeniable successes .

they are calling for more political responsibility to ensure that they can continue to fulfill their educational task . the dachau concentration camp memorial site near munich receives over 800,000 visitors per year .
internationally , it is among the best-known sites commemorating the memory of the millions who perished in the holocaust in europe . but faced with an acute cash crunch , memorial centers strewn across germany , dachau included , are increasingly struggling to carry out their primary task : educating future generations about the horrors of the holocaust and the valuable lessons they hold for humanity . barbara distel , director of the dachau memorial site said its education department can not meet all requests for tours or other educational offers . " the situation in dachau is unsatisfactory , " distel said .
the center only has one full-time educator . other major sites report of similar problems .
the foundation managing the memorials at sachsenhausen , ravensbrück and brandenburg in eastern germany said funding was only enough to cover operating costs .
buchenwald , also in eastern germany , has had to work with a capped budget since 1998 , despite the increase in costs . " our back is to the wall , " said rikola-gunnar lüttgenau , deputy director of the buchenwald memorial foundation .
he said the center did not have the means to revise existing permanent exhibitions or conduct youth projects , for example .
the latter could only be financed through external sources , such as other foundations . charging entrance fees for concentration camps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops who liberated dachau were horrified by what they found the president of the international dachau committee , pieter dietz de loos last month sparked a debate on whether memorial sites should introduce entrance fees to alleviate these financial problems .
the committee was founded by former prisoners following world war two and played a decisive role in setting up the memorial site at dachau .
it does not , however , contribute to the site 's funding . " the committee will be broke in five years , " said dietz de loos , a dutch attorney and son of a dachau prisoner , at the camp 's liberation ceremony in may . but the proposal to charge entry fees for concentration camps has sparked unease among many . " i can not imagine that visitors to dachau will have to pay an entrance fee , " said distel . according to the central council of jews in germany , those sites where history occurred had to be accessible to everyone . " it is only through these concrete places that visitors can thoroughly experience for themselves the presence of historical events , " the council 's vice-president salomon korn told jewish weekly jüdische allgemeine .
" such a visual link of history and an authentic place serves to reinforce and deepen remembrance . " entrance fees would only undermine this , korn said . private investors holding back american philanthropist ronald lauder set up and finances a project to preserve europe 's most notorious concentration camp , auschwitz , in present day poland . but some point out that in germany , private investors remain reluctant to do the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn says historical sites need to be maintained korn said german companies were " elegantly refraining " from contributing to financing , despite " a moral obligation and responsibility " to maintain these memorial sites . buchenwald 's lüttgenau said this was due to industry concerns that any backing could be misunderstood . " private companies fear that support for our educational work would be equal to an admission of guilt , " lüttgenau said . sites are germany 's responsibility distel said the government carried the responsibility for the memorial sites in germany .
the bavarian state government 's ministry of culture finances dachau , for example .
according to a spokesman , it provides the memorial site with some 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- annually for personnel and material costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other camp is more associated with the horrors of the holocaust than auschwitz " i consider it to be germany 's political and cultural task to ensure that these sites are equipped in a way that they can adequately work , " distel said . this view was shared by korn .
he said it was not the memorial sites ' obligation , but rather that of those politically responsible to ensure that the memory of these camps stayed alive . " the federal and state governments are obliged to ensure that everyone has access to these sites , which represent the darkest part of german history , " korn said . thomas lutz of the topography of terror foundation said , though , that it was not clear whether the political support necessary was present . " the only chance now is to make it publicly clear that there is a significant gap between the demands on the memorial sites and their ability to fulfill these , " said lutz , who heads the foundation 's department for memorial sites . german government has yet to provide a solution for now , dachau and the other sites are trying to work as effectively as possible .
lüttgenau said the buchenwald site had exhausted all savings measures .
but it was n't enough to address the needs of its half a million visitors per year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many youth groups visit former concentration camps , such as sachsenhausen " we can not attend to the growing demand for educational services , such as accompanying groups through the site , " lüttgenau said .
it has had to turn down 30 to 40 percent of such inquiries . " considering the need for more educational youth work in eastern germany , this is a dramatic situation , " lüttgenau said .
" the interest is there and we ca n't fulfill it . " the german government has said it is working on a new concept for financing the concentration camp memorial sites in germany .
but it has yet to present a model . " we are caught between a rock and a hard place right now , " lüttgenau said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are calling for more political responsibility to ensure that they can continue to fulfill their educational task . the dachau concentration camp memorial site near munich receives over 800,000 visitors per year .
internationally , it is among the best-known sites commemorating the memory of the millions who perished in the holocaust in europe . but faced with an acute cash crunch , memorial centers strewn across germany , dachau included , are increasingly struggling to carry out their primary task : educating future generations about the horrors of the holocaust and the valuable lessons they hold for humanity . barbara distel , director of the dachau memorial site said its education department can not meet all requests for tours or other educational offers . " the situation in dachau is unsatisfactory , " distel said .
the center only has one full-time educator . other major sites report of similar problems .
the foundation managing the memorials at sachsenhausen , ravensbrück and brandenburg in eastern germany said funding was only enough to cover operating costs .
buchenwald , also in eastern germany , has had to work with a capped budget since 1998 , despite the increase in costs . " our back is to the wall , " said rikola-gunnar lüttgenau , deputy director of the buchenwald memorial foundation .
he said the center did not have the means to revise existing permanent exhibitions or conduct youth projects , for example .
the latter could only be financed through external sources , such as other foundations . charging entrance fees for concentration camps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops who liberated dachau were horrified by what they found the president of the international dachau committee , pieter dietz de loos last month sparked a debate on whether memorial sites should introduce entrance fees to alleviate these financial problems .
the committee was founded by former prisoners following world war two and played a decisive role in setting up the memorial site at dachau .
it does not , however , contribute to the site 's funding . " the committee will be broke in five years , " said dietz de loos , a dutch attorney and son of a dachau prisoner , at the camp 's liberation ceremony in may . but the proposal to charge entry fees for concentration camps has sparked unease among many . " i can not imagine that visitors to dachau will have to pay an entrance fee , " said distel . according to the central council of jews in germany , those sites where history occurred had to be accessible to everyone . " it is only through these concrete places that visitors can thoroughly experience for themselves the presence of historical events , " the council 's vice-president salomon korn told jewish weekly jüdische allgemeine .
" such a visual link of history and an authentic place serves to reinforce and deepen remembrance . " entrance fees would only undermine this , korn said . private investors holding back american philanthropist ronald lauder set up and finances a project to preserve europe 's most notorious concentration camp , auschwitz , in present day poland . but some point out that in germany , private investors remain reluctant to do the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn says historical sites need to be maintained korn said german companies were " elegantly refraining " from contributing to financing , despite " a moral obligation and responsibility " to maintain these memorial sites . buchenwald 's lüttgenau said this was due to industry concerns that any backing could be misunderstood .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 27.06.2007 spd unveils employee shareholding plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck says employees should join the ride and take a stake in the companies they work for the social democrats have put forward the idea of a " germany fund " to give employees better options for investing in german companies .
but critics are warning of a bureaucratic monster . the head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- kurt beck said he wants to make it easier for employees to take a stake in german companies . according to an spd plan , employees could buy shares in a so-called " germany fund , " whose assets participating companies could access for capital .
the companies would then direct their dividends , interest and repayments back to employees who paid into the fund . beck said the spd model minimized the risk of market fluctuations or company bankruptcies since the fund would be widely spread . " if the german fund owns shares for example in 1,000 companies , it wo n't collapse if two go bankrupt , " beck said in an interview with the latest issue of the weekly newsmagazine s tern . three-way deal the germany fund would be a three-way deal between employer , employee and fund .
it would be promoted by government subsidies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business is booming for many german companies married couples with an annual gross income of up to 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 53,800 -rrb- and singles with income of up to 20,000 euros would be able to invest up to 400 euros per year in the fund .
according to beck 's concept , the government would subsidize this with a further 20 percent , or 80 euros . in addition , companies could give their employees shares in the fund worth a maximum of 240 euros per year tax-free .
a federal guarantee would protect the funds from insolvency . beck said the spd wanted to push through the plan in the second half of this legislative period .
he said he would present his concept to chancellor angela merkel at a cabinet meeting in august . cdu has its own plan both the spd and its center-right coalition partner , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , have been working on concepts for employee shareholding for some time .
both want a model that allows employees to profit if their company is doing well - without risks that are too high . the cdu will be presenting its model for employee investment on friday .
the party 's general secretary ronald pofalla said that beck 's proposal went in the direction of the cdu 's . " we want more employee participation in earnings and capital , " pofalla said , adding that it was also a way to make companies more productive and competitive . fund could become a bureaucratic monster there has , however , been criticism from the private sector .
the head of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt , said beck 's proposal went in the wrong direction .
it was contrary to the actual character of capital participation , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundt is skeptical of the fund 's potential " it 's more than questionable how the benefits of equity participation are supposed to work when a national , bureaucratic fund is connecting the employees involved and their companies , " hundt said . klaus zimmermann , head of the reputable german institute for economic research diw , called the concept " nothing more than a state-run , subsidized and government secured investment for an equity fund . "
he told the daily neue osnabrücker zeitung that it was problematic to create new subsidies for such a concept . according to stern , the powerful labor unions dgb and ig metall were involved in developing the spd concept .
up to now , unions have been very skeptical about developing capital investments by employees due to fluctuating stock prices and the risk of insolvency . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the officer verbally attacked a director of a museum devoted to the stasi 's dark historical legacy . the ruling , which was handed down on tuesday , found that former stasi officer wolfgang schmidt had gone beyond the bounds of free speech in criticizing museum director hubertus knabe . in an open letter in march 2006 , schmidt characterized knabe as someone who " could be described as an inciter of the people . "
the concept of incitement has extremely negative connotations in germany since it is often associated with racist agitation under the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubertus knabe knabe runs a former stasi prison in the hohenschönhausen district of berlin that has been turned into a museum and a memorial for the victims of the east german secret police . the court ruled that schmidt , the speaker of an organization representing self-proclaimed stasi " insiders , " had knowingly spread a falsehood , fining him 2,100 euros -lrb- $ 2,800 -rrb- . continuing controversy knabe welcomed the ruling . " for the first time , a berlin court has set limits upon the activities of former stasi officers and their organizations , " he said . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer-generated image of a typical 19th century jewish street in a polish town " over the past 900 years , our histories have been entangled , " polish president lech told dignitaries and onlookers standing in front of the imposing black marble warsaw ghetto uprising memorial , commemorating the 1943 doomed rebellion by members of the jewish fighting organization -lrb- zob -rrb- .
" there have been good times and bad .
but the history of the polish jews is a part of the history of my country , my nation .
it is a history that deserves being commemorated , " he said .
the land-mark museum is appropriately located in warsaw , " the greatest jewish city in europe " prior to world war ii , kaczynski said .
the warsaw ghetto before the war , poland 's jewish minority numbered some 3.5 million and accounted for roughly 10 per cent of the country 's pre- war population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish life in poland was almost completely obliterated by nazis the ground-breaking ceremonies were conducted in an district of warsaw that was at the heart of jewish life prior to the war .
tragically , it was enclosed inside the infamous wartime jewish ghetto created by nazi germany as part of its systematic genocide against european jews .
the nazi german ghettos and death camps claimed the vast majority of poland 's jews .
the number accounts for half of the six million europeans of jewish ancestry killed by nazi dictator adolf hitler 's third reich .
europe was home to some 11 million jews prior to the holocaust .
biblical proportions designed by finnish architectural duo rainer mahlamäki and ilmari lahdelma , the museum 's entrance promises to be of biblical proportions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new museum will be facing the warsaw ghetto memorial a symbolically ruptured facade will open up to monumental undulating walls alluding to the old testament 's miraculous parting of the red sea through which the prophet moses led the jews to escape captivity in egypt to a new life in the promised land .
it is a labor of love for project director jerzy halberstadt and head of the warsaw-based jewish historical institute and holocaust survivor marian turski .
holocaust and jewish history expert israel gutman will supervise the team preparing expositions .
" this will be a museum about life that will benefit dialogue and the future , " halberstadt said , adding that the institution aimed to attract a half million visitors a year .
financed by by the polish government , the city of warsaw and the european union , the project is slated to cost around $ 65 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- , according to news agency ap .
measuring a total of 18,000 square meters -lrb- 59,000 square feet -rrb- , the museum will be one of the largest jewish museums in the world - along with yad vashem in jerusalem and the holocaust memorial in washington dc . dw staff with agency reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with a new structure and a modified legal form , the company wants to steer a different course .
but there are no plans to merge porsche with volkswagen . shareholders at porsche have approved a new structure for the luxury german sports car maker .
chief executive wendelin wiedeking told an extraordinary general meeting on tuesday in stuttgart that porsche would be converted into a holding company . under the new holding , porsche 's operational business will run as a separate full subsidiary .
independently to this , the holding company will manage porsche 's interests in volkswagen -lrb- vw -rrb- .
porsche raised its stake in vw earlier this year from 27.3 percent to 30.8 percent . wiedeking told the meeting that it was important for the shareholders to be committed to this new course .
the some 1,500-strong audience , however , did not directly vote on the changes .
due to porsche 's structure , only shareholders with voting power have a say in the matter .
these are the families porsche and piech . investors also agreed to change the corporate designation to a societas europaea , a company registration recognized across the european union . no marriage planned between porsche and vw wiedeking told the shareholders that there were no plans to merge porsche and vw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw and porsche will operate side-by-side , but independently of one another " not only will there not be ' a marriage made in heaven , ' but no , we 're not even going to have a marriage here on earth , " he said , in reference to the phrase used by former daimler ceo jürgen schrempp before the merger of daimler and chrysler . according to wiedeking , no decision had been made to increase the stake in vw further . " but of course we 're continuing to watch the market to see what 's possible , " he said . wiedeking said , though , that he was still not satisfied with the progress of the restructuring at europe 's biggest carmaker . " the volkswagen group 's cost structures are not right yet and there are still too many blank spots on vw 's world map , when it comes to profitability in individual markets , " the ceo said . new profit record expected porsche said it expected to set a new profit record for the business year ending july 31 . " considering the 10 months of the year so far , it is not difficult to predict that our annual earnings at the end of this business year , will be significantly - and i mean , significantly - better than the 2.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.8 billion -rrb- in the previous year , " wiedeking said . this was due to gains tied to porsche 's stake in vw and to solid car sales . for the upcoming 2007/2008 fiscal year , wiedeking said porsche expected further momentum from the new 911 turbo cabriolet scheduled to make its worldwide debut on sept .

german politicians disagree over whether germany should focus on attracting foreign workers or on improving the skills of the domestic workforce . the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released a study earlier this week which showed germany had brought in 13,000 fewer legal immigrants in 2005 compared with a year earlier .
other studies have shown that highly skilled german workers are also increasingly attracted to high salaries abroad , which contributes to germany 's brain drain .
in 2005 , the united states , britain and italy had large increases in the number of legal migrants , according to the oecd 's annual international migration outlook report .
the decrease in immigration is bad for the german economy , which needs to attract highly skilled workers to stay competitive , said germany 's education minister annette schavan .
" germany needs to make it clear that we have a very high interest in foreign talent , " schavan said in a recent article in germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
schavan of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said she is n't advocating uncontrolled immigration .
rather , she wants germany to become more attractive for highly qualified , skilled workers .
focus on domestic workforce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's annette schavan while german employers agreed skilled foreign workers are needed , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has criticized the idea .
german workers should get better training and qualifications before looking to foreign workers .
the spd and cdu make up the ruling coalition in germany 's government .
spd general secretary hubertus heil said employing skilled foreign workers is at times necessary .
but employers should focus on educating and training german workers .
abandoning german workers in favor of a foreign workforce " would be fatal for the german economy , " heil said .
schavan said she agreed and believed the current left-right coalition made up of the cdu and spd has already taken steps to help german workers .
" even when everyone in germany is well trained and educated , beyond that you still need qualified specialists from elsewhere , " she said during a television interview wednesday morning .

cdu politicians have suggested lowering that requirement to 60,000 or 40,000 euros .
small businesses and start-ups simply ca n't pay such a high salary , even for highly-qualified employees , said maria böhmer of the cdu , who is in charge of migration issues in the government .

other studies have shown that highly skilled german workers are also increasingly attracted to high salaries abroad , which contributes to germany 's brain drain .
in 2005 , the united states , britain and italy had large increases in the number of legal migrants , according to the oecd 's annual international migration outlook report .
the decrease in immigration is bad for the german economy , which needs to attract highly skilled workers to stay competitive , said germany 's education minister annette schavan .
" germany needs to make it clear that we have a very high interest in foreign talent , " schavan said in a recent article in germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
schavan of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said she is n't advocating uncontrolled immigration .
rather , she wants germany to become more attractive for highly qualified , skilled workers .
focus on domestic workforce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's annette schavan while german employers agreed skilled foreign workers are needed , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has criticized the idea .
german workers should get better training and qualifications before looking to foreign workers .
the spd and cdu make up the ruling coalition in germany 's government .
spd general secretary hubertus heil said employing skilled foreign workers is at times necessary .
but employers should focus on educating and training german workers .
abandoning german workers in favor of a foreign workforce " would be fatal for the german economy , " heil said .
schavan said she agreed and believed the current left-right coalition made up of the cdu and spd has already taken steps to help german workers .
" even when everyone in germany is well trained and educated , beyond that you still need qualified specialists from elsewhere , " she said during a television interview wednesday morning .
lowering barriers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a brain drain is underway a new law requires specialized workers from non-european union countries to earn at least 85,000 euros -lrb- $ 114,400 -rrb- in order to get german work and living permits .
cdu politicians have suggested lowering that requirement to 60,000 or 40,000 euros .
small businesses and start-ups simply ca n't pay such a high salary , even for highly-qualified employees , said maria böhmer of the cdu , who is in charge of migration issues in the government .
" when this barrier is not lowered , the best minds will leave for other countries and germany will empty out , " böhmer said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer-generated image of a typical 19th century jewish street in a polish town " over the past 900 years , our histories have been entangled , " polish president lech told dignitaries and onlookers standing in front of the imposing black marble warsaw ghetto uprising memorial , commemorating the 1943 doomed rebellion by members of the jewish fighting organization -lrb- zob -rrb- .
" there have been good times and bad .
but the history of the polish jews is a part of the history of my country , my nation .
it is a history that deserves being commemorated , " he said .
the land-mark museum is appropriately located in warsaw , " the greatest jewish city in europe " prior to world war ii , kaczynski said .
the warsaw ghetto before the war , poland 's jewish minority numbered some 3.5 million and accounted for roughly 10 per cent of the country 's pre- war population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish life in poland was almost completely obliterated by nazis the ground-breaking ceremonies were conducted in an district of warsaw that was at the heart of jewish life prior to the war .
tragically , it was enclosed inside the infamous wartime jewish ghetto created by nazi germany as part of its systematic genocide against european jews .
the nazi german ghettos and death camps claimed the vast majority of poland 's jews .
the number accounts for half of the six million europeans of jewish ancestry killed by nazi dictator adolf hitler 's third reich .
europe was home to some 11 million jews prior to the holocaust .
biblical proportions designed by finnish architectural duo rainer mahlamäki and ilmari lahdelma , the museum 's entrance promises to be of biblical proportions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new museum will be facing the warsaw ghetto memorial a symbolically ruptured facade will open up to monumental undulating walls alluding to the old testament 's miraculous parting of the red sea through which the prophet moses led the jews to escape captivity in egypt to a new life in the promised land .
it is a labor of love for project director jerzy halberstadt and head of the warsaw-based jewish historical institute and holocaust survivor marian turski .
holocaust and jewish history expert israel gutman will supervise the team preparing expositions .
" this will be a museum about life that will benefit dialogue and the future , " halberstadt said , adding that the institution aimed to attract a half million visitors a year .
financed by by the polish government , the city of warsaw and the european union , the project is slated to cost around $ 65 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- , according to news agency ap .
measuring a total of 18,000 square meters -lrb- 59,000 square feet -rrb- , the museum will be one of the largest jewish museums in the world - along with yad vashem in jerusalem and the holocaust memorial in washington dc . dw staff with agency reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

world leaders will have to get used to a new face - and style - in 10 downing street . in a brief statement to reporters just before moving into his new home , brown said he taken note of the british people 's desire for change , promising " a new government with new priorities . "
he also said he wanted to create better opportunities for all britons . brown 's remarks came after queen elizabeth ii , in accordance with british custom , invited him to form a government . earlier in the day , tony blair fielded one last session of questions in parliament and said farewell to the staff at 10 downing street before heading to buckingham palace to tender his resignation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair bid an emotional , and lengthy , farewell in recent weeks the 56-year-old brown is expected to announce his cabinet and the rest of his government on thursday . taking center stage despite serving as chancellor of the exchequer for more than ten years under blair , brown remains a somewhat enigmatic figure for many britons .
and some question whether the scotsman will ever completely emerge from his telegenic predecessor 's shadow . brown may have promised change , but few people expect him , in the short term , to make any major domestic-policy reversals - especially as britain enjoyed an extended period of economic growth under the blair government .
but there has been some speculation that brown may be somewhat more liberal on spending as prime minister than he was as chancellor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and brown did n't always see eye-eo-eye more interesting , perhaps , is the course brown will take regarding foreign policy and , in particular , the iraq war .
although brown has said he still supports the us-led campaign in iraq , some observers expect him to take a somewhat more skeptical approach toward washington than blair . brown 's appointment ends one 's britain 's most uneasy , if longest-lasting marriages of political convenience .
once rivals for the leadership of the labour party , brown reportedly agreed in the mid-nineties to put his own ambitions to become prime minister on hold and support blair , who was elected in 1997 . in return , blair purportedly agreed to step down at some point while still in office and clear the way for brown . new partner for britain 's allies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and his wife sarah are the new residents of 10 downing street european and other world leaders were expected to begin congratulating brown personally and in public statements . in a tribute to blair published in a british newspaper on wednesday , us president george bush praised brown , writing that the then prime minister designate " was n't the image of the dour scotsman at all . " but bush was more effusive in lauding blair . " i 've heard he 's been called ' bush 's poodle , " ' bush wrote .
" he 's bigger than that .
we 're working together to achieve global peace in the face of enormous danger .
this kind of thing is just silly ridicule . " blair becomes envoy former prime minister blair was wednesday named special envoy of the diplomatic quartet pushing for middle east peace and tasked with spearheading efforts to create a palestinian state . " following discussions among the principals , today the quartet dealing with the middle east is announcing the appointment of tony blair as the quartet representative , " un spokeswoman michele montas announced . blair 's new role on the world stage was announced shortly after he stepped down after a decade in power . the post of quartet representative had been vacant since former world bank chairman john wolfensohn left in frustration in may 2006 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.06.2007 after 10-year wait , brown finally gets top job großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown no longer has to play second fiddle to blair labour party leader and former chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown has taken over from tony blair as british prime minister .
world leaders will have to get used to a new face - and style - in 10 downing street . in a brief statement to reporters just before moving into his new home , brown said he taken note of the british people 's desire for change , promising " a new government with new priorities . "
he also said he wanted to create better opportunities for all britons . brown 's remarks came after queen elizabeth ii , in accordance with british custom , invited him to form a government . earlier in the day , tony blair fielded one last session of questions in parliament and said farewell to the staff at 10 downing street before heading to buckingham palace to tender his resignation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair bid an emotional , and lengthy , farewell in recent weeks the 56-year-old brown is expected to announce his cabinet and the rest of his government on thursday . taking center stage despite serving as chancellor of the exchequer for more than ten years under blair , brown remains a somewhat enigmatic figure for many britons .
and some question whether the scotsman will ever completely emerge from his telegenic predecessor 's shadow . brown may have promised change , but few people expect him , in the short term , to make any major domestic-policy reversals - especially as britain enjoyed an extended period of economic growth under the blair government .

world leaders will have to get used to a new face - and style - in 10 downing street . in a brief statement to reporters just before moving into his new home , brown said he taken note of the british people 's desire for change , promising " a new government with new priorities . "
he also said he wanted to create better opportunities for all britons . brown 's remarks came after queen elizabeth ii , in accordance with british custom , invited him to form a government . earlier in the day , tony blair fielded one last session of questions in parliament and said farewell to the staff at 10 downing street before heading to buckingham palace to tender his resignation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair bid an emotional , and lengthy , farewell in recent weeks the 56-year-old brown is expected to announce his cabinet and the rest of his government on thursday . taking center stage despite serving as chancellor of the exchequer for more than ten years under blair , brown remains a somewhat enigmatic figure for many britons .
and some question whether the scotsman will ever completely emerge from his telegenic predecessor 's shadow . brown may have promised change , but few people expect him , in the short term , to make any major domestic-policy reversals - especially as britain enjoyed an extended period of economic growth under the blair government .
but there has been some speculation that brown may be somewhat more liberal on spending as prime minister than he was as chancellor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and brown did n't always see eye-eo-eye more interesting , perhaps , is the course brown will take regarding foreign policy and , in particular , the iraq war .

the proposal criticizes german car makers for producing fast autos which pollute . chris davies has proposed putting the brakes on speedy sports cars which pollute the environment .
the british european parliamentarian and member of the liberal democrats wants all cars produced in the eu to have a top speed of 162 kilometers per hour -lrb- 100 mph -rrb- that by 2013 . " at a time when europe has concerns over its energy security it is sheer madness to allow gas-guzzling cars to be built which are allowed to travel at a dangerous speed which is totally forbidden by law , " davies said tuesday . the speed on most european highways is 130 km / h .
germany is an exception , as many stretches of the autobahn do not have any speed limits .
" driving a car -lrb- faster than -rrb- that is against the law in every country but germany , " davies said , according to reuters .
" it 's nonsense .
i believe it needs to be countered . " driving the speed limit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most european countries have speed limits the german government has consistently refused to consider a comprehensive speed limit on its freeways .
the german automobile industry is strong and driving fast in a german-made porsche or bmw is considered a sacred right by some drivers . " we do not support this direction , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said of the proposal . germany backs other measures to improve road safety and cut emissions including new traffic management technology , congestion avoidance , road tolls and more driver education .
" these are modern approaches , " tiefensee said , adding that drivers who spend less time snarled in traffic need less fuel . cutting co2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants greener cars the liberal democrats ' plan as it was presented to the european parliament also calls for cutting carbon dioxide emissions to 120 grams per kilometer by 2015 and 95 grams per kilometer by 2020 .
davies said cars could meet higher standards of energy efficiency using existing technology .
currently , cars in the european market emit 162 grams per kilometer . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

repairing german-polish relations after the eu summit i find the opinions of the german press about the summit and poland and great britain unfair and biased .
no one discussed the merit of the proposals .
each country in the eu should have the right to express their opinions and the press should show different aspects of the issue and not to be just a propaganda tool .
unfortunately , i found most of the german press like that even before the summit .
the biased opinions hurt the relations between the countries and personally hurt the friends of germany in poland and in uk .
this is where the values of eu should start . - leszek wojtowicz , poland to be politically correct , we must pretend to be shocked at the wprost cover of chancellor merkel breast-feeding the twins .
but really , this cover does n't put chancellor merkel in a bad light at all .
she is the nurturer and the power figure .
it is the two weird twins who are the babies , completely powerless and dependent .
the chancellor is blithely sailing on , in full confidence and with a great body , to new opportunities to display her new-found powers .
actually , it is a very funny cover , because of the weirdness and fecklessness of the twins .
as i see it , chancellor merkel is presented positively and even with affection , but the twins receive a potent message of disdain from within their own country . - wiley horne , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a two-speed europe on its way ?
i wish to put forth four measures which i believe would do the trick in mending german-polish relations : 1 .

a block with one speed on one side and split countries on the other side - that is the answer and i think romano prodi hinted that something like that might happen . - gustavo araujo , uruguay i suspect that poland is a country still trying to get used to the idea that , for the first time in over two centuries -lrb- except for the 20 years between the two world wars -rrb- , it is truly free to determine its own destiny .
moreover , many in poland still feel a deep sense of hurt and pain over all the tragedies of the last century .
the best that germany can do is to be as sympathetic to the current mood in poland as possible and not do anything to aggravate the relationship any further .
i believe that german democratic institutions and germany 's self-concept are strong enough to digest this current " chill " in german-polish relations and to prove that , in the end , poland can rely on german friendship even at tense moments such as now . - gary k. taylor , honduras germany calls for extradition of cia agents the agents did a great job when they followed leads dealing with terrorist threats .

repairing german-polish relations after the eu summit i find the opinions of the german press about the summit and poland and great britain unfair and biased .
no one discussed the merit of the proposals .
each country in the eu should have the right to express their opinions and the press should show different aspects of the issue and not to be just a propaganda tool .
unfortunately , i found most of the german press like that even before the summit .
the biased opinions hurt the relations between the countries and personally hurt the friends of germany in poland and in uk .
this is where the values of eu should start . - leszek wojtowicz , poland to be politically correct , we must pretend to be shocked at the wprost cover of chancellor merkel breast-feeding the twins .
but really , this cover does n't put chancellor merkel in a bad light at all .
she is the nurturer and the power figure .
it is the two weird twins who are the babies , completely powerless and dependent .
the chancellor is blithely sailing on , in full confidence and with a great body , to new opportunities to display her new-found powers .
actually , it is a very funny cover , because of the weirdness and fecklessness of the twins .
as i see it , chancellor merkel is presented positively and even with affection , but the twins receive a potent message of disdain from within their own country . - wiley horne , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a two-speed europe on its way ?
i wish to put forth four measures which i believe would do the trick in mending german-polish relations : 1 .
buy up all the low-quality polish meat that russia refuses to allow into the country ; 2 .
force russia to lay the new pipeline through polish territory so that the kaczynski twins can steal the gas en route to germany ; 3 .

germany is an exception , as many stretches of the autobahn do not have any speed limits .

" we do not support this direction , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said of the proposal . germany backs other measures to improve road safety and cut emissions including new traffic management technology , congestion avoidance , road tolls and more driver education .
" these are modern approaches , " tiefensee said , adding that drivers who spend less time snarled in traffic need less fuel . cutting co2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants greener cars the liberal democrats ' plan as it was presented to the european parliament also calls for cutting carbon dioxide emissions to 120 grams per kilometer by 2015 and 95 grams per kilometer by 2020 .

the officer verbally attacked a director of a museum devoted to the stasi 's dark historical legacy . the ruling , which was handed down on tuesday , found that former stasi officer wolfgang schmidt had gone beyond the bounds of free speech in criticizing museum director hubertus knabe . in an open letter in march 2006 , schmidt characterized knabe as someone who " could be described as an inciter of the people . "
the concept of incitement has extremely negative connotations in germany since it is often associated with racist agitation under the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubertus knabe knabe runs a former stasi prison in the hohenschönhausen district of berlin that has been turned into a museum and a memorial for the victims of the east german secret police . the court ruled that schmidt , the speaker of an organization representing self-proclaimed stasi " insiders , " had knowingly spread a falsehood , fining him 2,100 euros -lrb- $ 2,800 -rrb- . continuing controversy knabe welcomed the ruling . " for the first time , a berlin court has set limits upon the activities of former stasi officers and their organizations , " he said . "
i hope the ruling makes it more difficulty to drag stasi victims and their memorials through the mud . " bildunterschrift : it will take years for researchers to sort through the stasi 's copious files the court case was but the latest incident in an ongoing debate about what role former stasi operatives should play in germany 's coming-to-terms with the eastern part of the country 's communist past . former stasi employees have been occasionally enlisted in efforts to shed light on that organization 's activities .

the world wide web as an interactive , collaborative platform for data exchange - best known as web 2.0 - has become , in industrialized countries , at least , a part of everyday life . the internet revolution is showing no signs of fatigue .
millions of people are writing wikipedia articles , reviewing books at amazon , evaluating articles they bought at ebay , publishing their holiday photos on flickr and presenting themselves on facebook .
wherever they are , they are part of a larger network that knows no national or cultural borders .
" the internet has become a platform , " said technology publisher and web 2.0 guru tim o 'reilly .
millions of networked personal computers are providing access to " the one global , electronic brain that we 're creating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon is not just an online retailer : it draws its customers to participate in product evaluation this collective brain is processing vast amounts of information at an increasing speed .

if , however , he 'd make it to the lecture hall on time anyway , the police could , as tim o 'reilly points out , also conclude that he must have exceeded the speed limit on the road .

farmers in the country may not have a computer , but they do have cell phones .
" and the government sends them , for example , information about health care on their cell phones , " weigend said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the future of the internet is now germans hesitant to look for love online wikipedia founder : " great ideas come from different places " the internet and everyday life : the constant revolution " the synapses of a collective brain are growing " internet -pipe- 27.06.2007 the future is now großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will computer programs replace the human need for face-to-face contact ?
the world wide web as an interactive , collaborative platform for data exchange - best known as web 2.0 - has become , in industrialized countries , at least , a part of everyday life . the internet revolution is showing no signs of fatigue .
millions of people are writing wikipedia articles , reviewing books at amazon , evaluating articles they bought at ebay , publishing their holiday photos on flickr and presenting themselves on facebook .
wherever they are , they are part of a larger network that knows no national or cultural borders .
" the internet has become a platform , " said technology publisher and web 2.0 guru tim o 'reilly .
millions of networked personal computers are providing access to " the one global , electronic brain that we 're creating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon is not just an online retailer : it draws its customers to participate in product evaluation this collective brain is processing vast amounts of information at an increasing speed .
companies are already using data freely available on the internet to look for and contact their potential customers .
jeff hammerbacher of the social networking site , facebook , asserts that his company does not sell its users ' data , but it negotiates with advertisers what additional analysis can be performed on the very private details that often appear on the site .
web search giants yahoo and google , while claiming to be very protective of their user data , also point out that they follow the law in the countries in which they operate and are obliged to cooperate with law enforcement agencies , when asked to do so .
data collection with no limits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " let 's see who 'll be late for class today " in theory , at least , the possibilities for data collection and aggregation on the web are limitless .
data mining expert and former chief scientist at amazon , andreas weigend , said that if gps signals from cellular phones were available to everybody , his students could , for instance , figure out that he was 15 minutes late for his morning lecture , if they saw his cell phone emitting its signals 10 miles -lrb- 16 kilometers -rrb- away from campus .
if , however , he 'd make it to the lecture hall on time anyway , the police could , as tim o 'reilly points out , also conclude that he must have exceeded the speed limit on the road .
a speeding ticket could easily follow .
social network platforms such as facebook and myspace - in which users set up their own pages , profiles and links to other users with similar interests - ca n't say anything on their own about the actual relationships between two people : would they really get along ?
can they trust each other ?
o 'reilly , however , believes that software applications will soon be able to make decisions in the social realm that were previously reserved for humans only .
if an application can make the decision , which would normally require a face-to-face contact , then it can also decide if it should give out somebody 's phone number to a third party .
additional value through global data collection the development of new technologies goes hand in hand with the transformation of society .
five years ago , people would think twice before writing something intimate on a postcard , well-aware that anybody could read it .
nowadays , personal web logs - or blogs - are filled with publicly accessible , personal information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is one of the driving forces of the internet economy young people , especially , find nothing extraordinary about this .
while benefiting from the added value of global data collection , they are ready to contribute their part .

with a new structure and a modified legal form , the company wants to steer a different course .
but there are no plans to merge porsche with volkswagen . shareholders at porsche have approved a new structure for the luxury german sports car maker .
chief executive wendelin wiedeking told an extraordinary general meeting on tuesday in stuttgart that porsche would be converted into a holding company . under the new holding , porsche 's operational business will run as a separate full subsidiary .
independently to this , the holding company will manage porsche 's interests in volkswagen -lrb- vw -rrb- .
porsche raised its stake in vw earlier this year from 27.3 percent to 30.8 percent . wiedeking told the meeting that it was important for the shareholders to be committed to this new course .
the some 1,500-strong audience , however , did not directly vote on the changes .
due to porsche 's structure , only shareholders with voting power have a say in the matter .
these are the families porsche and piech . investors also agreed to change the corporate designation to a societas europaea , a company registration recognized across the european union . no marriage planned between porsche and vw wiedeking told the shareholders that there were no plans to merge porsche and vw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw and porsche will operate side-by-side , but independently of one another " not only will there not be ' a marriage made in heaven , ' but no , we 're not even going to have a marriage here on earth , " he said , in reference to the phrase used by former daimler ceo jürgen schrempp before the merger of daimler and chrysler . according to wiedeking , no decision had been made to increase the stake in vw further . " but of course we 're continuing to watch the market to see what 's possible , " he said . wiedeking said , though , that he was still not satisfied with the progress of the restructuring at europe 's biggest carmaker . " the volkswagen group 's cost structures are not right yet and there are still too many blank spots on vw 's world map , when it comes to profitability in individual markets , " the ceo said . new profit record expected porsche said it expected to set a new profit record for the business year ending july 31 . " considering the 10 months of the year so far , it is not difficult to predict that our annual earnings at the end of this business year , will be significantly - and i mean , significantly - better than the 2.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.8 billion -rrb- in the previous year , " wiedeking said . this was due to gains tied to porsche 's stake in vw and to solid car sales . for the upcoming 2007/2008 fiscal year , wiedeking said porsche expected further momentum from the new 911 turbo cabriolet scheduled to make its worldwide debut on sept .

the concept of incitement has extremely negative connotations in germany since it is often associated with racist agitation under the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubertus knabe knabe runs a former stasi prison in the hohenschönhausen district of berlin that has been turned into a museum and a memorial for the victims of the east german secret police . the court ruled that schmidt , the speaker of an organization representing self-proclaimed stasi " insiders , " had knowingly spread a falsehood , fining him 2,100 euros -lrb- $ 2,800 -rrb- . continuing controversy knabe welcomed the ruling . " for the first time , a berlin court has set limits upon the activities of former stasi officers and their organizations , " he said . "

they are calling for more political responsibility to ensure that they can continue to fulfill their educational task . the dachau concentration camp memorial site near munich receives over 800,000 visitors per year .
internationally , it is among the best-known sites commemorating the memory of the millions who perished in the holocaust in europe . but faced with an acute cash crunch , memorial centers strewn across germany , dachau included , are increasingly struggling to carry out their primary task : educating future generations about the horrors of the holocaust and the valuable lessons they hold for humanity . barbara distel , director of the dachau memorial site said its education department can not meet all requests for tours or other educational offers . " the situation in dachau is unsatisfactory , " distel said .
the center only has one full-time educator . other major sites report of similar problems .
the foundation managing the memorials at sachsenhausen , ravensbrück and brandenburg in eastern germany said funding was only enough to cover operating costs .
buchenwald , also in eastern germany , has had to work with a capped budget since 1998 , despite the increase in costs . " our back is to the wall , " said rikola-gunnar lüttgenau , deputy director of the buchenwald memorial foundation .
he said the center did not have the means to revise existing permanent exhibitions or conduct youth projects , for example .
the latter could only be financed through external sources , such as other foundations . charging entrance fees for concentration camps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops who liberated dachau were horrified by what they found the president of the international dachau committee , pieter dietz de loos last month sparked a debate on whether memorial sites should introduce entrance fees to alleviate these financial problems .
the committee was founded by former prisoners following world war two and played a decisive role in setting up the memorial site at dachau .
it does not , however , contribute to the site 's funding . " the committee will be broke in five years , " said dietz de loos , a dutch attorney and son of a dachau prisoner , at the camp 's liberation ceremony in may . but the proposal to charge entry fees for concentration camps has sparked unease among many . " i can not imagine that visitors to dachau will have to pay an entrance fee , " said distel . according to the central council of jews in germany , those sites where history occurred had to be accessible to everyone . " it is only through these concrete places that visitors can thoroughly experience for themselves the presence of historical events , " the council 's vice-president salomon korn told jewish weekly jüdische allgemeine .
" such a visual link of history and an authentic place serves to reinforce and deepen remembrance . " entrance fees would only undermine this , korn said . private investors holding back american philanthropist ronald lauder set up and finances a project to preserve europe 's most notorious concentration camp , auschwitz , in present day poland . but some point out that in germany , private investors remain reluctant to do the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn says historical sites need to be maintained korn said german companies were " elegantly refraining " from contributing to financing , despite " a moral obligation and responsibility " to maintain these memorial sites . buchenwald 's lüttgenau said this was due to industry concerns that any backing could be misunderstood . " private companies fear that support for our educational work would be equal to an admission of guilt , " lüttgenau said . sites are germany 's responsibility distel said the government carried the responsibility for the memorial sites in germany .
the bavarian state government 's ministry of culture finances dachau , for example .
according to a spokesman , it provides the memorial site with some 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- annually for personnel and material costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other camp is more associated with the horrors of the holocaust than auschwitz " i consider it to be germany 's political and cultural task to ensure that these sites are equipped in a way that they can adequately work , " distel said . this view was shared by korn .
he said it was not the memorial sites ' obligation , but rather that of those politically responsible to ensure that the memory of these camps stayed alive . " the federal and state governments are obliged to ensure that everyone has access to these sites , which represent the darkest part of german history , " korn said . thomas lutz of the topography of terror foundation said , though , that it was not clear whether the political support necessary was present . " the only chance now is to make it publicly clear that there is a significant gap between the demands on the memorial sites and their ability to fulfill these , " said lutz , who heads the foundation 's department for memorial sites . german government has yet to provide a solution for now , dachau and the other sites are trying to work as effectively as possible .

with a new structure and a modified legal form , the company wants to steer a different course .
but there are no plans to merge porsche with volkswagen . shareholders at porsche have approved a new structure for the luxury german sports car maker .
chief executive wendelin wiedeking told an extraordinary general meeting on tuesday in stuttgart that porsche would be converted into a holding company . under the new holding , porsche 's operational business will run as a separate full subsidiary .
independently to this , the holding company will manage porsche 's interests in volkswagen -lrb- vw -rrb- .
porsche raised its stake in vw earlier this year from 27.3 percent to 30.8 percent . wiedeking told the meeting that it was important for the shareholders to be committed to this new course .
the some 1,500-strong audience , however , did not directly vote on the changes .
due to porsche 's structure , only shareholders with voting power have a say in the matter .
these are the families porsche and piech . investors also agreed to change the corporate designation to a societas europaea , a company registration recognized across the european union . no marriage planned between porsche and vw wiedeking told the shareholders that there were no plans to merge porsche and vw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw and porsche will operate side-by-side , but independently of one another " not only will there not be ' a marriage made in heaven , ' but no , we 're not even going to have a marriage here on earth , " he said , in reference to the phrase used by former daimler ceo jürgen schrempp before the merger of daimler and chrysler . according to wiedeking , no decision had been made to increase the stake in vw further . " but of course we 're continuing to watch the market to see what 's possible , " he said . wiedeking said , though , that he was still not satisfied with the progress of the restructuring at europe 's biggest carmaker . " the volkswagen group 's cost structures are not right yet and there are still too many blank spots on vw 's world map , when it comes to profitability in individual markets , " the ceo said . new profit record expected porsche said it expected to set a new profit record for the business year ending july 31 . " considering the 10 months of the year so far , it is not difficult to predict that our annual earnings at the end of this business year , will be significantly - and i mean , significantly - better than the 2.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.8 billion -rrb- in the previous year , " wiedeking said . this was due to gains tied to porsche 's stake in vw and to solid car sales . for the upcoming 2007/2008 fiscal year , wiedeking said porsche expected further momentum from the new 911 turbo cabriolet scheduled to make its worldwide debut on sept .

they are calling for more political responsibility to ensure that they can continue to fulfill their educational task . the dachau concentration camp memorial site near munich receives over 800,000 visitors per year .
internationally , it is among the best-known sites commemorating the memory of the millions who perished in the holocaust in europe . but faced with an acute cash crunch , memorial centers strewn across germany , dachau included , are increasingly struggling to carry out their primary task : educating future generations about the horrors of the holocaust and the valuable lessons they hold for humanity . barbara distel , director of the dachau memorial site said its education department can not meet all requests for tours or other educational offers . " the situation in dachau is unsatisfactory , " distel said .
the center only has one full-time educator . other major sites report of similar problems .
the foundation managing the memorials at sachsenhausen , ravensbrück and brandenburg in eastern germany said funding was only enough to cover operating costs .
buchenwald , also in eastern germany , has had to work with a capped budget since 1998 , despite the increase in costs . " our back is to the wall , " said rikola-gunnar lüttgenau , deputy director of the buchenwald memorial foundation .
he said the center did not have the means to revise existing permanent exhibitions or conduct youth projects , for example .
the latter could only be financed through external sources , such as other foundations . charging entrance fees for concentration camps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops who liberated dachau were horrified by what they found the president of the international dachau committee , pieter dietz de loos last month sparked a debate on whether memorial sites should introduce entrance fees to alleviate these financial problems .
the committee was founded by former prisoners following world war two and played a decisive role in setting up the memorial site at dachau .
it does not , however , contribute to the site 's funding . " the committee will be broke in five years , " said dietz de loos , a dutch attorney and son of a dachau prisoner , at the camp 's liberation ceremony in may . but the proposal to charge entry fees for concentration camps has sparked unease among many . " i can not imagine that visitors to dachau will have to pay an entrance fee , " said distel . according to the central council of jews in germany , those sites where history occurred had to be accessible to everyone . " it is only through these concrete places that visitors can thoroughly experience for themselves the presence of historical events , " the council 's vice-president salomon korn told jewish weekly jüdische allgemeine .
" such a visual link of history and an authentic place serves to reinforce and deepen remembrance . " entrance fees would only undermine this , korn said . private investors holding back american philanthropist ronald lauder set up and finances a project to preserve europe 's most notorious concentration camp , auschwitz , in present day poland . but some point out that in germany , private investors remain reluctant to do the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn says historical sites need to be maintained korn said german companies were " elegantly refraining " from contributing to financing , despite " a moral obligation and responsibility " to maintain these memorial sites . buchenwald 's lüttgenau said this was due to industry concerns that any backing could be misunderstood . " private companies fear that support for our educational work would be equal to an admission of guilt , " lüttgenau said . sites are germany 's responsibility distel said the government carried the responsibility for the memorial sites in germany .
the bavarian state government 's ministry of culture finances dachau , for example .
according to a spokesman , it provides the memorial site with some 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- annually for personnel and material costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other camp is more associated with the horrors of the holocaust than auschwitz " i consider it to be germany 's political and cultural task to ensure that these sites are equipped in a way that they can adequately work , " distel said . this view was shared by korn .
he said it was not the memorial sites ' obligation , but rather that of those politically responsible to ensure that the memory of these camps stayed alive . " the federal and state governments are obliged to ensure that everyone has access to these sites , which represent the darkest part of german history , " korn said . thomas lutz of the topography of terror foundation said , though , that it was not clear whether the political support necessary was present . " the only chance now is to make it publicly clear that there is a significant gap between the demands on the memorial sites and their ability to fulfill these , " said lutz , who heads the foundation 's department for memorial sites . german government has yet to provide a solution for now , dachau and the other sites are trying to work as effectively as possible .
lüttgenau said the buchenwald site had exhausted all savings measures .
but it was n't enough to address the needs of its half a million visitors per year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many youth groups visit former concentration camps , such as sachsenhausen " we can not attend to the growing demand for educational services , such as accompanying groups through the site , " lüttgenau said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.06.2007 opinion : the rise and fall of tony blair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only time will tell if prime minister tony blair will go down in history for leading britain into a war it did n't want or for the successes and fresh ideas he brought britons , according to dw 's irene quaile-kersken . was he really in office for 10 years ?
his departure marks the end of an era .
tony blair had nearly let us forget that great britain was a conservative stronghold for nearly two decades .
the iron lady and the pale john major were hardly history when the young , dynamic new labour leader conquered the middle by forging a " third way " between the traditional conservative and left ideals in 1997 .
he gave labour , the workers ' and unions ' party , a new image and made it a viable choice for middle-class voters by pulling the party away from the left .
the youngest prime minister since 1812 , the kids in 10 downing street had pop stars as political allies .
the era of " cool britannia " had begun .
ten years under tony blair modernized great britain .
the economy has boomed over the long-term .
unemployment has sunk .
the northern ireland conflict , which had gone on for decades , was settled .
northern ireland , scotland and wales have their own parliamentary bodies .
billions have been invested in margaret thatcher 's run-down health system and britain 's debts .
but not everything is rosy in the land of new labour .
there are still long waiting lists in the health care system .
not every privatization can be seen as a success .
and despite - or because of blair 's economic reforms - the gap between great britain 's rich and poor has not shrunk .
but those are not the reasons why blair and his party were punished at recent parliamentary elections in scotland and wales as well as on the municipal level .
blair 's government based itself on an efficient pr machine that mastered the art of the spin , and distrust among the population grew larger and larger until it culminated with the debacle of the never-found weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
despite massive public opposition , blair led the country into a war whose central premises emerged as false .
in exchange for his support of the increasingly isolated us president george w. bush , blair reaped ridicule and the nicknames " poodle " and " lap dog . "
tony blair never recovered from that .
then there are the accusations of nepotism - blair 's one-time consultant and spin doctor peter mandelson became a commissioner in brussels - and the allegations his party accepted donations in exchange for honors , which may have led to seats in the upper house of parliament .
the clean-cut image of britain 's once favorite son has long been tarnished .
the skirmish surrounding the recent eu summit , blair 's last international appearance as prime minister , also showed that blair could not keep his promise to increase great britain 's integration in europe .
while he himself enjoys , and has had success , being a staunch european on the eu stage , the tendency toward euro-skepticism in the british media and general public has grown in recent years .
only 40 percent of britons still support membership in the eu , according to a recent poll .
in his final days , blair was a placeholder while his successor gained in significance as the one pulling the strings - sometimes behind the scenes and sometimes very publicly .
now blair is leaving the political stage - at least in his role as britain 's prime minister - after a farewell that has taken too long .
it is high time for him to go .
and the british electorate seems to be thanking him for his departure .
for the first time in months , the labour party is ahead in the polls and blair 's successor , gordon brown , once written off as uncharismatic , is coming in well ahead of his conservative rival , the young , dynamic david cameron , who resembles the young blair .
the blair era is over .
" cool britannia " is ready for a change .
first with a new labour leader .
whether blair 's party will be able to stay in power after the next elections remains to be seen .
blair 's spot in history , however , is secure .
but only time will tell if the damage the iraq war did to his image will be qualified by his undeniable successes .

with a new structure and a modified legal form , the company wants to steer a different course .
but there are no plans to merge porsche with volkswagen . shareholders at porsche have approved a new structure for the luxury german sports car maker .
chief executive wendelin wiedeking told an extraordinary general meeting on tuesday in stuttgart that porsche would be converted into a holding company . under the new holding , porsche 's operational business will run as a separate full subsidiary .
independently to this , the holding company will manage porsche 's interests in volkswagen -lrb- vw -rrb- .
porsche raised its stake in vw earlier this year from 27.3 percent to 30.8 percent . wiedeking told the meeting that it was important for the shareholders to be committed to this new course .
the some 1,500-strong audience , however , did not directly vote on the changes .
due to porsche 's structure , only shareholders with voting power have a say in the matter .
these are the families porsche and piech . investors also agreed to change the corporate designation to a societas europaea , a company registration recognized across the european union . no marriage planned between porsche and vw wiedeking told the shareholders that there were no plans to merge porsche and vw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw and porsche will operate side-by-side , but independently of one another " not only will there not be ' a marriage made in heaven , ' but no , we 're not even going to have a marriage here on earth , " he said , in reference to the phrase used by former daimler ceo jürgen schrempp before the merger of daimler and chrysler . according to wiedeking , no decision had been made to increase the stake in vw further . " but of course we 're continuing to watch the market to see what 's possible , " he said . wiedeking said , though , that he was still not satisfied with the progress of the restructuring at europe 's biggest carmaker . " the volkswagen group 's cost structures are not right yet and there are still too many blank spots on vw 's world map , when it comes to profitability in individual markets , " the ceo said . new profit record expected porsche said it expected to set a new profit record for the business year ending july 31 . " considering the 10 months of the year so far , it is not difficult to predict that our annual earnings at the end of this business year , will be significantly - and i mean , significantly - better than the 2.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.8 billion -rrb- in the previous year , " wiedeking said . this was due to gains tied to porsche 's stake in vw and to solid car sales . for the upcoming 2007/2008 fiscal year , wiedeking said porsche expected further momentum from the new 911 turbo cabriolet scheduled to make its worldwide debut on sept .

his departure marks the end of an era .
tony blair had nearly let us forget that great britain was a conservative stronghold for nearly two decades .
the iron lady and the pale john major were hardly history when the young , dynamic new labour leader conquered the middle by forging a " third way " between the traditional conservative and left ideals in 1997 .
he gave labour , the workers ' and unions ' party , a new image and made it a viable choice for middle-class voters by pulling the party away from the left .
the youngest prime minister since 1812 , the kids in 10 downing street had pop stars as political allies .
the era of " cool britannia " had begun .
ten years under tony blair modernized great britain .
the economy has boomed over the long-term .
unemployment has sunk .
the northern ireland conflict , which had gone on for decades , was settled .
northern ireland , scotland and wales have their own parliamentary bodies .
billions have been invested in margaret thatcher 's run-down health system and britain 's debts .
but not everything is rosy in the land of new labour .
there are still long waiting lists in the health care system .
not every privatization can be seen as a success .
and despite - or because of blair 's economic reforms - the gap between great britain 's rich and poor has not shrunk .
but those are not the reasons why blair and his party were punished at recent parliamentary elections in scotland and wales as well as on the municipal level .
blair 's government based itself on an efficient pr machine that mastered the art of the spin , and distrust among the population grew larger and larger until it culminated with the debacle of the never-found weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
despite massive public opposition , blair led the country into a war whose central premises emerged as false .
in exchange for his support of the increasingly isolated us president george w. bush , blair reaped ridicule and the nicknames " poodle " and " lap dog . "
tony blair never recovered from that .
then there are the accusations of nepotism - blair 's one-time consultant and spin doctor peter mandelson became a commissioner in brussels - and the allegations his party accepted donations in exchange for honors , which may have led to seats in the upper house of parliament .
the clean-cut image of britain 's once favorite son has long been tarnished .
the skirmish surrounding the recent eu summit , blair 's last international appearance as prime minister , also showed that blair could not keep his promise to increase great britain 's integration in europe .
while he himself enjoys , and has had success , being a staunch european on the eu stage , the tendency toward euro-skepticism in the british media and general public has grown in recent years .
only 40 percent of britons still support membership in the eu , according to a recent poll .
in his final days , blair was a placeholder while his successor gained in significance as the one pulling the strings - sometimes behind the scenes and sometimes very publicly .
now blair is leaving the political stage - at least in his role as britain 's prime minister - after a farewell that has taken too long .
it is high time for him to go .
and the british electorate seems to be thanking him for his departure .
for the first time in months , the labour party is ahead in the polls and blair 's successor , gordon brown , once written off as uncharismatic , is coming in well ahead of his conservative rival , the young , dynamic david cameron , who resembles the young blair .
the blair era is over .
" cool britannia " is ready for a change .
first with a new labour leader .
whether blair 's party will be able to stay in power after the next elections remains to be seen .
blair 's spot in history , however , is secure .
but only time will tell if the damage the iraq war did to his image will be qualified by his undeniable successes .

his departure marks the end of an era .
tony blair had nearly let us forget that great britain was a conservative stronghold for nearly two decades .
the iron lady and the pale john major were hardly history when the young , dynamic new labour leader conquered the middle by forging a " third way " between the traditional conservative and left ideals in 1997 .
he gave labour , the workers ' and unions ' party , a new image and made it a viable choice for middle-class voters by pulling the party away from the left .
the youngest prime minister since 1812 , the kids in 10 downing street had pop stars as political allies .
the era of " cool britannia " had begun .
ten years under tony blair modernized great britain .
the economy has boomed over the long-term .
unemployment has sunk .
the northern ireland conflict , which had gone on for decades , was settled .
northern ireland , scotland and wales have their own parliamentary bodies .
billions have been invested in margaret thatcher 's run-down health system and britain 's debts .
but not everything is rosy in the land of new labour .
there are still long waiting lists in the health care system .
not every privatization can be seen as a success .
and despite - or because of blair 's economic reforms - the gap between great britain 's rich and poor has not shrunk .
but those are not the reasons why blair and his party were punished at recent parliamentary elections in scotland and wales as well as on the municipal level .
blair 's government based itself on an efficient pr machine that mastered the art of the spin , and distrust among the population grew larger and larger until it culminated with the debacle of the never-found weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
despite massive public opposition , blair led the country into a war whose central premises emerged as false .
in exchange for his support of the increasingly isolated us president george w. bush , blair reaped ridicule and the nicknames " poodle " and " lap dog . "
tony blair never recovered from that .
then there are the accusations of nepotism - blair 's one-time consultant and spin doctor peter mandelson became a commissioner in brussels - and the allegations his party accepted donations in exchange for honors , which may have led to seats in the upper house of parliament .
the clean-cut image of britain 's once favorite son has long been tarnished .
the skirmish surrounding the recent eu summit , blair 's last international appearance as prime minister , also showed that blair could not keep his promise to increase great britain 's integration in europe .
while he himself enjoys , and has had success , being a staunch european on the eu stage , the tendency toward euro-skepticism in the british media and general public has grown in recent years .
only 40 percent of britons still support membership in the eu , according to a recent poll .
in his final days , blair was a placeholder while his successor gained in significance as the one pulling the strings - sometimes behind the scenes and sometimes very publicly .
now blair is leaving the political stage - at least in his role as britain 's prime minister - after a farewell that has taken too long .
it is high time for him to go .
and the british electorate seems to be thanking him for his departure .
for the first time in months , the labour party is ahead in the polls and blair 's successor , gordon brown , once written off as uncharismatic , is coming in well ahead of his conservative rival , the young , dynamic david cameron , who resembles the young blair .
the blair era is over .
" cool britannia " is ready for a change .
first with a new labour leader .
whether blair 's party will be able to stay in power after the next elections remains to be seen .
blair 's spot in history , however , is secure .
but only time will tell if the damage the iraq war did to his image will be qualified by his undeniable successes .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer-generated image of a typical 19th century jewish street in a polish town " over the past 900 years , our histories have been entangled , " polish president lech told dignitaries and onlookers standing in front of the imposing black marble warsaw ghetto uprising memorial , commemorating the 1943 doomed rebellion by members of the jewish fighting organization -lrb- zob -rrb- .
" there have been good times and bad .
but the history of the polish jews is a part of the history of my country , my nation .
it is a history that deserves being commemorated , " he said .
the land-mark museum is appropriately located in warsaw , " the greatest jewish city in europe " prior to world war ii , kaczynski said .
the warsaw ghetto before the war , poland 's jewish minority numbered some 3.5 million and accounted for roughly 10 per cent of the country 's pre- war population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish life in poland was almost completely obliterated by nazis the ground-breaking ceremonies were conducted in an district of warsaw that was at the heart of jewish life prior to the war .
tragically , it was enclosed inside the infamous wartime jewish ghetto created by nazi germany as part of its systematic genocide against european jews .
the nazi german ghettos and death camps claimed the vast majority of poland 's jews .
the number accounts for half of the six million europeans of jewish ancestry killed by nazi dictator adolf hitler 's third reich .
europe was home to some 11 million jews prior to the holocaust .
biblical proportions designed by finnish architectural duo rainer mahlamäki and ilmari lahdelma , the museum 's entrance promises to be of biblical proportions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new museum will be facing the warsaw ghetto memorial a symbolically ruptured facade will open up to monumental undulating walls alluding to the old testament 's miraculous parting of the red sea through which the prophet moses led the jews to escape captivity in egypt to a new life in the promised land .
it is a labor of love for project director jerzy halberstadt and head of the warsaw-based jewish historical institute and holocaust survivor marian turski .
holocaust and jewish history expert israel gutman will supervise the team preparing expositions .
" this will be a museum about life that will benefit dialogue and the future , " halberstadt said , adding that the institution aimed to attract a half million visitors a year .
financed by by the polish government , the city of warsaw and the european union , the project is slated to cost around $ 65 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- , according to news agency ap .
measuring a total of 18,000 square meters -lrb- 59,000 square feet -rrb- , the museum will be one of the largest jewish museums in the world - along with yad vashem in jerusalem and the holocaust memorial in washington dc . dw staff with agency reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics are warning of a bureaucratic monster . the head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- kurt beck said he wants to make it easier for employees to take a stake in german companies . according to an spd plan , employees could buy shares in a so-called " germany fund , " whose assets participating companies could access for capital .
the companies would then direct their dividends , interest and repayments back to employees who paid into the fund . beck said the spd model minimized the risk of market fluctuations or company bankruptcies since the fund would be widely spread . " if the german fund owns shares for example in 1,000 companies , it wo n't collapse if two go bankrupt , " beck said in an interview with the latest issue of the weekly newsmagazine s tern . three-way deal the germany fund would be a three-way deal between employer , employee and fund .
it would be promoted by government subsidies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business is booming for many german companies married couples with an annual gross income of up to 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 53,800 -rrb- and singles with income of up to 20,000 euros would be able to invest up to 400 euros per year in the fund .
according to beck 's concept , the government would subsidize this with a further 20 percent , or 80 euros . in addition , companies could give their employees shares in the fund worth a maximum of 240 euros per year tax-free .
a federal guarantee would protect the funds from insolvency . beck said the spd wanted to push through the plan in the second half of this legislative period .
he said he would present his concept to chancellor angela merkel at a cabinet meeting in august . cdu has its own plan both the spd and its center-right coalition partner , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , have been working on concepts for employee shareholding for some time .
both want a model that allows employees to profit if their company is doing well - without risks that are too high . the cdu will be presenting its model for employee investment on friday .
the party 's general secretary ronald pofalla said that beck 's proposal went in the direction of the cdu 's . " we want more employee participation in earnings and capital , " pofalla said , adding that it was also a way to make companies more productive and competitive . fund could become a bureaucratic monster there has , however , been criticism from the private sector .
the head of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt , said beck 's proposal went in the wrong direction .
it was contrary to the actual character of capital participation , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundt is skeptical of the fund 's potential " it 's more than questionable how the benefits of equity participation are supposed to work when a national , bureaucratic fund is connecting the employees involved and their companies , " hundt said . klaus zimmermann , head of the reputable german institute for economic research diw , called the concept " nothing more than a state-run , subsidized and government secured investment for an equity fund . "
he told the daily neue osnabrücker zeitung that it was problematic to create new subsidies for such a concept . according to stern , the powerful labor unions dgb and ig metall were involved in developing the spd concept .

but critics are warning of a bureaucratic monster . the head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- kurt beck said he wants to make it easier for employees to take a stake in german companies . according to an spd plan , employees could buy shares in a so-called " germany fund , " whose assets participating companies could access for capital .
the companies would then direct their dividends , interest and repayments back to employees who paid into the fund . beck said the spd model minimized the risk of market fluctuations or company bankruptcies since the fund would be widely spread . " if the german fund owns shares for example in 1,000 companies , it wo n't collapse if two go bankrupt , " beck said in an interview with the latest issue of the weekly newsmagazine s tern . three-way deal the germany fund would be a three-way deal between employer , employee and fund .
it would be promoted by government subsidies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business is booming for many german companies married couples with an annual gross income of up to 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 53,800 -rrb- and singles with income of up to 20,000 euros would be able to invest up to 400 euros per year in the fund .
according to beck 's concept , the government would subsidize this with a further 20 percent , or 80 euros . in addition , companies could give their employees shares in the fund worth a maximum of 240 euros per year tax-free .
a federal guarantee would protect the funds from insolvency . beck said the spd wanted to push through the plan in the second half of this legislative period .
he said he would present his concept to chancellor angela merkel at a cabinet meeting in august . cdu has its own plan both the spd and its center-right coalition partner , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , have been working on concepts for employee shareholding for some time .
both want a model that allows employees to profit if their company is doing well - without risks that are too high . the cdu will be presenting its model for employee investment on friday .
the party 's general secretary ronald pofalla said that beck 's proposal went in the direction of the cdu 's . " we want more employee participation in earnings and capital , " pofalla said , adding that it was also a way to make companies more productive and competitive . fund could become a bureaucratic monster there has , however , been criticism from the private sector .
the head of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt , said beck 's proposal went in the wrong direction .
it was contrary to the actual character of capital participation , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundt is skeptical of the fund 's potential " it 's more than questionable how the benefits of equity participation are supposed to work when a national , bureaucratic fund is connecting the employees involved and their companies , " hundt said . klaus zimmermann , head of the reputable german institute for economic research diw , called the concept " nothing more than a state-run , subsidized and government secured investment for an equity fund . "
he told the daily neue osnabrücker zeitung that it was problematic to create new subsidies for such a concept . according to stern , the powerful labor unions dgb and ig metall were involved in developing the spd concept .

" we want to ensure germany can benefit from a healthy , competitive and fully functioning market and encourage both competition and investment in broadband markets , " she added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the future of the internet is now germans hesitant to look for love online wikipedia founder : " great ideas come from different places " the internet and everyday life : the constant revolution the future is now internet -pipe- 27.06.2007 " the synapses of a collective brain are growing " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim o 'reilly of o 'reilly & associates poses in his office in sebastopol , calif according to tim o ’ reilly , the founder of o ’ reilly media and a major proponent of the web 2.0 movement , the concept of artificial intelligence will become a reality .
in many ways , he says , it is already here . web 2.0 is a term coined by o ’ reilly in 2003 to refer to the second generation of web applications .
based on collaboration and sharing among users , they include sites like facebook and wikipedia .
o ’ reilly lives and works in the small town of sebastopol , about a two-hour drive north of san francisco .
christina bergmann traveled there to talk to him about his work . mr. o ’ reilly , what exactly is web 2.0 ? web 2.0 is about applications that use the network as a platform .
the first of step is to build applications that learn from their users so that the more people use them , the better they get .
web 2.0 is based on the collective intelligence of the users . that means that a lot of users have to be involved .
does web 2.0 represent a more democratic form of the internet ? i think that the next technology markets will be open and democratic .
there 's a lot of excitement around .
the hurdles we 're facing are n't all that big , and everyone can take part .
over time the power of small groups of users will decrease .
i think this is the phase the internet is in now . so we are now in the middle of web 2.0 .
what comes next – web 3.0 ? the term web 2.0 gives the impression that a web 3.0 is coming .
but i 'm not sure that the next technology boom will be attached to the world wide web .
we still think primarily about interacting with a computer as typing on a keyboard and looking at a screen .
but increasingly computers are fading into the background . there are lots of different ways in which computing interfaces are changing .
first of all there is the use of handheld devices or cell phones as a platform . think about how cameras are increasingly being equipped with gps .
now , when you take a photograph , the location of that photograph will automatically be a part of the data uploaded to a web 2.0 application like flickr .
all of a sudden the global brain is learning something that we did not actually explicitly tell it . that means that something will be created by this community ? yes , but people wo n't know they 're doing it .
we 're heading in the direction of artificial intelligence .
of course there is still a person telling the program what to do .
we 're putting more and more information into the global network , and people are writing programs that create even more connections .
it is as though the synapses of a collective brain are growing .
i think we should expect some surprises . but if people are n't aware of what is happening to their data , doesn ’ t that create a conflict with their right to privacy ? i think a lot of concerns about privacy will come up in the further development of web 2.0 .
but i think it 's really important to understand that people are willing to trade privacy for perceived benefit .
i also think that the net gets a bit of a bad rap with regards to privacy .
when you use a credit card , for example , you 're revealing all kinds of very private information about yourself .
people do n't make a big fuss about that . are we looking at two societies – one that has access to the internet and one that remains locked out ? with time i think that more people will have access to these technologies .
the internet will become more present – that means it will be accessible via telephone but also from different devices . we think there are a billion computers out there .
but really there is only one .
that is what web 2.0 is about – getting stitched together .
and what we think of as a computer today – a stand-alone device – is just an access point to the global electronic brain that we 're building . christina bergmann interviewed tim o 'reilly -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we laid the ground for a common future for the european union and overcame the impasse , " she said in her final address to the european parliament before germany 's presidency of the eu ends on saturday . " at the end of the day we did not disappoint people 's expectations and we avoided a division , " she said .
" europe can once again look forward to a period of strength and confidence . " merkel told the deputies that she had anticipated difficult negotiations at the summit in brussels , which saw poland threaten to block the treaty in a dispute over voting rights . if the talks had failed it would not have meant the end of europe as we know it , she said , but it would have had major consequences which would have been difficult to predict . merkel said failure could have led to a two-speed europe , with those in favor of reform pressing ahead at the expense of those who were reluctant to change . new eu treaty the treaty , a key priority of the german presidency , meant the eu was able to preserve elements of the european constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in a referendums held in 2005 . it allows for decisions to be taken by majority rather than a unanimous vote and removes the threat of national vetoes .
there are also provisions for an eu president and more powers to the eu 's foreign policy chief , giving the bloc a bigger say in the world . bildunterschrift : a few high-ranking merkel fans she said the post of a high representative for foreign affairs was necessary because it would enable europe to speak with one voice as it grows more assertive on the world stage . " this is a european political quantum leap , " she said to applause from deputies . the new treaty has to be endorsed by an inter-government conference before it can be ratified and put in place in time for european parliament elections in mid-2009 . the chancellor said she hoped these talks could get underway next month when portugal takes over the rotating eu presidency from germany . licking their wounds while calling the german presidency of the eu a resounding “ success ” , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier did acknowledge that relationships between some in the eu bloc did take a few hits in the past few weeks , notably germany and poland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier speaking in berlin on wednesday speaking at a news conference in berlin steinmeier said that he hoped the “ rough ” exchanges last weekend would be soon forgotten . “ things got quite abrasive and in the long run european politics can not endure that , ” he said . steinmeier went on to criticize the polish magazine wprost for featuring a photo montage of a topless angela merkel breastfeeding the kaczynski brothers , poland 's prime minister and president . " germany wanted to be a mother for poland but she turned out to be a false mother , " said editor-in-chief stanislaw janecki . the magazine cover is just the last of a long line of recent spats between the eu neighbors but steinmeier expressed hope that such disagreements would not continue .

with a new structure and a modified legal form , the company wants to steer a different course .
but there are no plans to merge porsche with volkswagen . shareholders at porsche have approved a new structure for the luxury german sports car maker .
chief executive wendelin wiedeking told an extraordinary general meeting on tuesday in stuttgart that porsche would be converted into a holding company . under the new holding , porsche 's operational business will run as a separate full subsidiary .
independently to this , the holding company will manage porsche 's interests in volkswagen -lrb- vw -rrb- .
porsche raised its stake in vw earlier this year from 27.3 percent to 30.8 percent . wiedeking told the meeting that it was important for the shareholders to be committed to this new course .
the some 1,500-strong audience , however , did not directly vote on the changes .
due to porsche 's structure , only shareholders with voting power have a say in the matter .
these are the families porsche and piech . investors also agreed to change the corporate designation to a societas europaea , a company registration recognized across the european union . no marriage planned between porsche and vw wiedeking told the shareholders that there were no plans to merge porsche and vw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw and porsche will operate side-by-side , but independently of one another " not only will there not be ' a marriage made in heaven , ' but no , we 're not even going to have a marriage here on earth , " he said , in reference to the phrase used by former daimler ceo jürgen schrempp before the merger of daimler and chrysler . according to wiedeking , no decision had been made to increase the stake in vw further . " but of course we 're continuing to watch the market to see what 's possible , " he said . wiedeking said , though , that he was still not satisfied with the progress of the restructuring at europe 's biggest carmaker . " the volkswagen group 's cost structures are not right yet and there are still too many blank spots on vw 's world map , when it comes to profitability in individual markets , " the ceo said . new profit record expected porsche said it expected to set a new profit record for the business year ending july 31 . " considering the 10 months of the year so far , it is not difficult to predict that our annual earnings at the end of this business year , will be significantly - and i mean , significantly - better than the 2.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.8 billion -rrb- in the previous year , " wiedeking said . this was due to gains tied to porsche 's stake in vw and to solid car sales . for the upcoming 2007/2008 fiscal year , wiedeking said porsche expected further momentum from the new 911 turbo cabriolet scheduled to make its worldwide debut on sept .

german politicians disagree over whether germany should focus on attracting foreign workers or on improving the skills of the domestic workforce . the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released a study earlier this week which showed germany had brought in 13,000 fewer legal immigrants in 2005 compared with a year earlier .
other studies have shown that highly skilled german workers are also increasingly attracted to high salaries abroad , which contributes to germany 's brain drain .
in 2005 , the united states , britain and italy had large increases in the number of legal migrants , according to the oecd 's annual international migration outlook report .
the decrease in immigration is bad for the german economy , which needs to attract highly skilled workers to stay competitive , said germany 's education minister annette schavan .
" germany needs to make it clear that we have a very high interest in foreign talent , " schavan said in a recent article in germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .

abandoning german workers in favor of a foreign workforce " would be fatal for the german economy , " heil said .
schavan said she agreed and believed the current left-right coalition made up of the cdu and spd has already taken steps to help german workers .

german politicians disagree over whether germany should focus on attracting foreign workers or on improving the skills of the domestic workforce . the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released a study earlier this week which showed germany had brought in 13,000 fewer legal immigrants in 2005 compared with a year earlier .
other studies have shown that highly skilled german workers are also increasingly attracted to high salaries abroad , which contributes to germany 's brain drain .
in 2005 , the united states , britain and italy had large increases in the number of legal migrants , according to the oecd 's annual international migration outlook report .
the decrease in immigration is bad for the german economy , which needs to attract highly skilled workers to stay competitive , said germany 's education minister annette schavan .
" germany needs to make it clear that we have a very high interest in foreign talent , " schavan said in a recent article in germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
schavan of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said she is n't advocating uncontrolled immigration .
rather , she wants germany to become more attractive for highly qualified , skilled workers .
focus on domestic workforce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's annette schavan while german employers agreed skilled foreign workers are needed , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has criticized the idea .
german workers should get better training and qualifications before looking to foreign workers .
the spd and cdu make up the ruling coalition in germany 's government .
spd general secretary hubertus heil said employing skilled foreign workers is at times necessary .
but employers should focus on educating and training german workers .
abandoning german workers in favor of a foreign workforce " would be fatal for the german economy , " heil said .
schavan said she agreed and believed the current left-right coalition made up of the cdu and spd has already taken steps to help german workers .
" even when everyone in germany is well trained and educated , beyond that you still need qualified specialists from elsewhere , " she said during a television interview wednesday morning .
lowering barriers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a brain drain is underway a new law requires specialized workers from non-european union countries to earn at least 85,000 euros -lrb- $ 114,400 -rrb- in order to get german work and living permits .
cdu politicians have suggested lowering that requirement to 60,000 or 40,000 euros .
small businesses and start-ups simply ca n't pay such a high salary , even for highly-qualified employees , said maria böhmer of the cdu , who is in charge of migration issues in the government .
" when this barrier is not lowered , the best minds will leave for other countries and germany will empty out , " böhmer said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the world wide web as an interactive , collaborative platform for data exchange - best known as web 2.0 - has become , in industrialized countries , at least , a part of everyday life . the internet revolution is showing no signs of fatigue .
millions of people are writing wikipedia articles , reviewing books at amazon , evaluating articles they bought at ebay , publishing their holiday photos on flickr and presenting themselves on facebook .
wherever they are , they are part of a larger network that knows no national or cultural borders .
" the internet has become a platform , " said technology publisher and web 2.0 guru tim o 'reilly .
millions of networked personal computers are providing access to " the one global , electronic brain that we 're creating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon is not just an online retailer : it draws its customers to participate in product evaluation this collective brain is processing vast amounts of information at an increasing speed .
companies are already using data freely available on the internet to look for and contact their potential customers .
jeff hammerbacher of the social networking site , facebook , asserts that his company does not sell its users ' data , but it negotiates with advertisers what additional analysis can be performed on the very private details that often appear on the site .
web search giants yahoo and google , while claiming to be very protective of their user data , also point out that they follow the law in the countries in which they operate and are obliged to cooperate with law enforcement agencies , when asked to do so .
data collection with no limits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " let 's see who 'll be late for class today " in theory , at least , the possibilities for data collection and aggregation on the web are limitless .
data mining expert and former chief scientist at amazon , andreas weigend , said that if gps signals from cellular phones were available to everybody , his students could , for instance , figure out that he was 15 minutes late for his morning lecture , if they saw his cell phone emitting its signals 10 miles -lrb- 16 kilometers -rrb- away from campus .
if , however , he 'd make it to the lecture hall on time anyway , the police could , as tim o 'reilly points out , also conclude that he must have exceeded the speed limit on the road .
a speeding ticket could easily follow .
social network platforms such as facebook and myspace - in which users set up their own pages , profiles and links to other users with similar interests - ca n't say anything on their own about the actual relationships between two people : would they really get along ?
can they trust each other ?
o 'reilly , however , believes that software applications will soon be able to make decisions in the social realm that were previously reserved for humans only .
if an application can make the decision , which would normally require a face-to-face contact , then it can also decide if it should give out somebody 's phone number to a third party .
additional value through global data collection the development of new technologies goes hand in hand with the transformation of society .
five years ago , people would think twice before writing something intimate on a postcard , well-aware that anybody could read it .
nowadays , personal web logs - or blogs - are filled with publicly accessible , personal information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is one of the driving forces of the internet economy young people , especially , find nothing extraordinary about this .
while benefiting from the added value of global data collection , they are ready to contribute their part .
web researchers agree that digital devices will continue to play an increasingly prominent part in everybody 's life .
in china , says andreas weigend , one million cell new phones are sold every day .
farmers in the country may not have a computer , but they do have cell phones .
" and the government sends them , for example , information about health care on their cell phones , " weigend said .
soon , other devices for accessing information will come into play as well .
smart radios and other wireless devices , for instance , will avoid transmission bottlenecks by reconfiguring themselves to use frequencies that they sense are clear .
one laptop per child -lrb- olpc -rrb- - a non-profit organization chaired by mit media lab founder nicolas negroponte - is developing a $ 100 -lrb- 75 euros -rrb- portable computer for children in developing nations as part of a mission to bridge the digital divide between industrialized and lesser developed countries .
" we 'll be surprised " the silicon valley , for its part , has definitely recovered from the 2001 crash .
new startups are launching - although everybody is somewhat more cautious than in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oplc aims to bring computers to the underprivildged it is , however , getting crowded on the internet market .
the big players are already swallowing the smaller ones : google now owns the video-sharing platform youtube , whereas yahoo purchased the photo-sharing site flickr .
this , according to tim o 'reilly , is to be expected in the development of a new technology .
the more participants a network has , the more valuable it becomes .
and those who were there first , profit the most .
what is certain , at this point , is that there is no way back .
it 's hard , however , to make any predictions about future technological developments .
o 'reilly sums it up the best when he says : " i think we can expect to be surprised . " christina bergmann -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in many ways , he says , it is already here . web 2.0 is a term coined by o ’ reilly in 2003 to refer to the second generation of web applications .
based on collaboration and sharing among users , they include sites like facebook and wikipedia .
o ’ reilly lives and works in the small town of sebastopol , about a two-hour drive north of san francisco .
christina bergmann traveled there to talk to him about his work . mr. o ’ reilly , what exactly is web 2.0 ? web 2.0 is about applications that use the network as a platform .
the first of step is to build applications that learn from their users so that the more people use them , the better they get .
web 2.0 is based on the collective intelligence of the users . that means that a lot of users have to be involved .
does web 2.0 represent a more democratic form of the internet ? i think that the next technology markets will be open and democratic .
there 's a lot of excitement around .
the hurdles we 're facing are n't all that big , and everyone can take part .
over time the power of small groups of users will decrease .
i think this is the phase the internet is in now . so we are now in the middle of web 2.0 .
what comes next – web 3.0 ? the term web 2.0 gives the impression that a web 3.0 is coming .
but i 'm not sure that the next technology boom will be attached to the world wide web .
we still think primarily about interacting with a computer as typing on a keyboard and looking at a screen .
but increasingly computers are fading into the background . there are lots of different ways in which computing interfaces are changing .
first of all there is the use of handheld devices or cell phones as a platform . think about how cameras are increasingly being equipped with gps .

all of a sudden the global brain is learning something that we did not actually explicitly tell it . that means that something will be created by this community ? yes , but people wo n't know they 're doing it .
we 're heading in the direction of artificial intelligence .
of course there is still a person telling the program what to do .
we 're putting more and more information into the global network , and people are writing programs that create even more connections .
it is as though the synapses of a collective brain are growing .
i think we should expect some surprises . but if people are n't aware of what is happening to their data , doesn ’ t that create a conflict with their right to privacy ? i think a lot of concerns about privacy will come up in the further development of web 2.0 .
but i think it 's really important to understand that people are willing to trade privacy for perceived benefit .
i also think that the net gets a bit of a bad rap with regards to privacy .
when you use a credit card , for example , you 're revealing all kinds of very private information about yourself .
people do n't make a big fuss about that . are we looking at two societies – one that has access to the internet and one that remains locked out ? with time i think that more people will have access to these technologies .
the internet will become more present – that means it will be accessible via telephone but also from different devices . we think there are a billion computers out there .

in many ways , he says , it is already here . web 2.0 is a term coined by o ’ reilly in 2003 to refer to the second generation of web applications .
based on collaboration and sharing among users , they include sites like facebook and wikipedia .
o ’ reilly lives and works in the small town of sebastopol , about a two-hour drive north of san francisco .
christina bergmann traveled there to talk to him about his work . mr. o ’ reilly , what exactly is web 2.0 ? web 2.0 is about applications that use the network as a platform .
the first of step is to build applications that learn from their users so that the more people use them , the better they get .
web 2.0 is based on the collective intelligence of the users . that means that a lot of users have to be involved .
does web 2.0 represent a more democratic form of the internet ? i think that the next technology markets will be open and democratic .
there 's a lot of excitement around .
the hurdles we 're facing are n't all that big , and everyone can take part .
over time the power of small groups of users will decrease .
i think this is the phase the internet is in now . so we are now in the middle of web 2.0 .
what comes next – web 3.0 ? the term web 2.0 gives the impression that a web 3.0 is coming .
but i 'm not sure that the next technology boom will be attached to the world wide web .
we still think primarily about interacting with a computer as typing on a keyboard and looking at a screen .
but increasingly computers are fading into the background . there are lots of different ways in which computing interfaces are changing .
first of all there is the use of handheld devices or cell phones as a platform . think about how cameras are increasingly being equipped with gps .
now , when you take a photograph , the location of that photograph will automatically be a part of the data uploaded to a web 2.0 application like flickr .
all of a sudden the global brain is learning something that we did not actually explicitly tell it . that means that something will be created by this community ? yes , but people wo n't know they 're doing it .
we 're heading in the direction of artificial intelligence .
of course there is still a person telling the program what to do .
we 're putting more and more information into the global network , and people are writing programs that create even more connections .
it is as though the synapses of a collective brain are growing .
i think we should expect some surprises . but if people are n't aware of what is happening to their data , doesn ’ t that create a conflict with their right to privacy ? i think a lot of concerns about privacy will come up in the further development of web 2.0 .
but i think it 's really important to understand that people are willing to trade privacy for perceived benefit .
i also think that the net gets a bit of a bad rap with regards to privacy .
when you use a credit card , for example , you 're revealing all kinds of very private information about yourself .
people do n't make a big fuss about that . are we looking at two societies – one that has access to the internet and one that remains locked out ? with time i think that more people will have access to these technologies .
the internet will become more present – that means it will be accessible via telephone but also from different devices . we think there are a billion computers out there .
but really there is only one .
that is what web 2.0 is about – getting stitched together .
and what we think of as a computer today – a stand-alone device – is just an access point to the global electronic brain that we 're building . christina bergmann interviewed tim o 'reilly -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some readers think so readers shared their views on this week 's top news stories , from the post-summit state of german-polish relations to germany 's call for the extradition of 13 cia agents and tom cruise 's foiled plans to film in germany . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
repairing german-polish relations after the eu summit i find the opinions of the german press about the summit and poland and great britain unfair and biased .
no one discussed the merit of the proposals .
each country in the eu should have the right to express their opinions and the press should show different aspects of the issue and not to be just a propaganda tool .
unfortunately , i found most of the german press like that even before the summit .
the biased opinions hurt the relations between the countries and personally hurt the friends of germany in poland and in uk .
this is where the values of eu should start . - leszek wojtowicz , poland to be politically correct , we must pretend to be shocked at the wprost cover of chancellor merkel breast-feeding the twins .
but really , this cover does n't put chancellor merkel in a bad light at all .
she is the nurturer and the power figure .
it is the two weird twins who are the babies , completely powerless and dependent .
the chancellor is blithely sailing on , in full confidence and with a great body , to new opportunities to display her new-found powers .
actually , it is a very funny cover , because of the weirdness and fecklessness of the twins .
as i see it , chancellor merkel is presented positively and even with affection , but the twins receive a potent message of disdain from within their own country . - wiley horne , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a two-speed europe on its way ?
i wish to put forth four measures which i believe would do the trick in mending german-polish relations : 1 .
buy up all the low-quality polish meat that russia refuses to allow into the country ; 2 .
force russia to lay the new pipeline through polish territory so that the kaczynski twins can steal the gas en route to germany ; 3 .
applaud and endorse the ban on gay rights in poland ; 4 .
applaud and endorse the professional ban in poland . - luis oliveira , portugal on one side are the countries that want more integration and on the other side the countries that want a minimum of integration .
a block with one speed on one side and split countries on the other side - that is the answer and i think romano prodi hinted that something like that might happen . - gustavo araujo , uruguay i suspect that poland is a country still trying to get used to the idea that , for the first time in over two centuries -lrb- except for the 20 years between the two world wars -rrb- , it is truly free to determine its own destiny .
moreover , many in poland still feel a deep sense of hurt and pain over all the tragedies of the last century .
the best that germany can do is to be as sympathetic to the current mood in poland as possible and not do anything to aggravate the relationship any further .
i believe that german democratic institutions and germany 's self-concept are strong enough to digest this current " chill " in german-polish relations and to prove that , in the end , poland can rely on german friendship even at tense moments such as now . - gary k. taylor , honduras germany calls for extradition of cia agents the agents did a great job when they followed leads dealing with terrorist threats .
why is it okay for osama bin-laden and his group to kidnap journalists and kill them ?
but when the cia follows leads and does what it takes to gets results , the world questions it .
it 's strange the world never is willing to do what it takes to get the job done .
the world always expects the us to fix the problems . - loche , us i praise those men .
they were doing their duty to defend their country .
those who call the us allies should be ashamed of their act . - rafael fermoselle , cuba no , they should not be extradited .
they were doing the jobs that they were ordered to do .
the munich prosecutors are playing to the left for their own personal notoriety . - john coo per , us tom cruise banned from filming in german defense ministry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's the wrong guy for the job , said some too many times we find ourselves complaining about issues that have little or no bearing on content .
i believe the von stauffenberg family should receive assurances that the content is accurate and presented accordingly .
i personally do not believe in the methods or teachings of the church of scientology , but tom cruise is a very good actor and it is my belief that he would do an outstanding job of representing colonel von stauffenberg . - joseph , us two reasons tom cruise should not play von stauffenberg : 1 .
he is too short , 2 .
he is not german .
i wonder if he will fake a german accent or speak like a guy from new jersey . - david worsham , us in the us ' first amendment to the bill of rights , a person 's religion is protected .
do the germans protect religion in their laws as well ?
i am not a scientologist , but i do sympathize with cruise .
in 1940 , if cruise had been a jew , i 'm sure he would not have been able to make a film in germany either .
as harsh as that statement is , it gets to the root of this issue and why the world is so interested in it . - bryan moody , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his departure marks the end of an era .
tony blair had nearly let us forget that great britain was a conservative stronghold for nearly two decades .
the iron lady and the pale john major were hardly history when the young , dynamic new labour leader conquered the middle by forging a " third way " between the traditional conservative and left ideals in 1997 .
he gave labour , the workers ' and unions ' party , a new image and made it a viable choice for middle-class voters by pulling the party away from the left .
the youngest prime minister since 1812 , the kids in 10 downing street had pop stars as political allies .
the era of " cool britannia " had begun .
ten years under tony blair modernized great britain .
the economy has boomed over the long-term .
unemployment has sunk .
the northern ireland conflict , which had gone on for decades , was settled .
northern ireland , scotland and wales have their own parliamentary bodies .
billions have been invested in margaret thatcher 's run-down health system and britain 's debts .
but not everything is rosy in the land of new labour .
there are still long waiting lists in the health care system .
not every privatization can be seen as a success .
and despite - or because of blair 's economic reforms - the gap between great britain 's rich and poor has not shrunk .
but those are not the reasons why blair and his party were punished at recent parliamentary elections in scotland and wales as well as on the municipal level .
blair 's government based itself on an efficient pr machine that mastered the art of the spin , and distrust among the population grew larger and larger until it culminated with the debacle of the never-found weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
despite massive public opposition , blair led the country into a war whose central premises emerged as false .
in exchange for his support of the increasingly isolated us president george w. bush , blair reaped ridicule and the nicknames " poodle " and " lap dog . "
tony blair never recovered from that .
then there are the accusations of nepotism - blair 's one-time consultant and spin doctor peter mandelson became a commissioner in brussels - and the allegations his party accepted donations in exchange for honors , which may have led to seats in the upper house of parliament .
the clean-cut image of britain 's once favorite son has long been tarnished .
the skirmish surrounding the recent eu summit , blair 's last international appearance as prime minister , also showed that blair could not keep his promise to increase great britain 's integration in europe .
while he himself enjoys , and has had success , being a staunch european on the eu stage , the tendency toward euro-skepticism in the british media and general public has grown in recent years .
only 40 percent of britons still support membership in the eu , according to a recent poll .
in his final days , blair was a placeholder while his successor gained in significance as the one pulling the strings - sometimes behind the scenes and sometimes very publicly .
now blair is leaving the political stage - at least in his role as britain 's prime minister - after a farewell that has taken too long .
it is high time for him to go .
and the british electorate seems to be thanking him for his departure .
for the first time in months , the labour party is ahead in the polls and blair 's successor , gordon brown , once written off as uncharismatic , is coming in well ahead of his conservative rival , the young , dynamic david cameron , who resembles the young blair .
the blair era is over .
" cool britannia " is ready for a change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 27.06.2007 porsche introduces new structure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo wiedeking is steering porsche in a new direction porsche has heralded a new era at the german luxury automaker .
with a new structure and a modified legal form , the company wants to steer a different course .
but there are no plans to merge porsche with volkswagen . shareholders at porsche have approved a new structure for the luxury german sports car maker .
chief executive wendelin wiedeking told an extraordinary general meeting on tuesday in stuttgart that porsche would be converted into a holding company . under the new holding , porsche 's operational business will run as a separate full subsidiary .
independently to this , the holding company will manage porsche 's interests in volkswagen -lrb- vw -rrb- .
porsche raised its stake in vw earlier this year from 27.3 percent to 30.8 percent . wiedeking told the meeting that it was important for the shareholders to be committed to this new course .
the some 1,500-strong audience , however , did not directly vote on the changes .
due to porsche 's structure , only shareholders with voting power have a say in the matter .
these are the families porsche and piech . investors also agreed to change the corporate designation to a societas europaea , a company registration recognized across the european union . no marriage planned between porsche and vw wiedeking told the shareholders that there were no plans to merge porsche and vw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw and porsche will operate side-by-side , but independently of one another " not only will there not be ' a marriage made in heaven , ' but no , we 're not even going to have a marriage here on earth , " he said , in reference to the phrase used by former daimler ceo jürgen schrempp before the merger of daimler and chrysler . according to wiedeking , no decision had been made to increase the stake in vw further . " but of course we 're continuing to watch the market to see what 's possible , " he said . wiedeking said , though , that he was still not satisfied with the progress of the restructuring at europe 's biggest carmaker .

they are calling for more political responsibility to ensure that they can continue to fulfill their educational task . the dachau concentration camp memorial site near munich receives over 800,000 visitors per year .
internationally , it is among the best-known sites commemorating the memory of the millions who perished in the holocaust in europe . but faced with an acute cash crunch , memorial centers strewn across germany , dachau included , are increasingly struggling to carry out their primary task : educating future generations about the horrors of the holocaust and the valuable lessons they hold for humanity . barbara distel , director of the dachau memorial site said its education department can not meet all requests for tours or other educational offers . " the situation in dachau is unsatisfactory , " distel said .
the center only has one full-time educator . other major sites report of similar problems .
the foundation managing the memorials at sachsenhausen , ravensbrück and brandenburg in eastern germany said funding was only enough to cover operating costs .
buchenwald , also in eastern germany , has had to work with a capped budget since 1998 , despite the increase in costs . " our back is to the wall , " said rikola-gunnar lüttgenau , deputy director of the buchenwald memorial foundation .
he said the center did not have the means to revise existing permanent exhibitions or conduct youth projects , for example .
the latter could only be financed through external sources , such as other foundations . charging entrance fees for concentration camps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops who liberated dachau were horrified by what they found the president of the international dachau committee , pieter dietz de loos last month sparked a debate on whether memorial sites should introduce entrance fees to alleviate these financial problems .
the committee was founded by former prisoners following world war two and played a decisive role in setting up the memorial site at dachau .
it does not , however , contribute to the site 's funding . " the committee will be broke in five years , " said dietz de loos , a dutch attorney and son of a dachau prisoner , at the camp 's liberation ceremony in may . but the proposal to charge entry fees for concentration camps has sparked unease among many . " i can not imagine that visitors to dachau will have to pay an entrance fee , " said distel . according to the central council of jews in germany , those sites where history occurred had to be accessible to everyone . " it is only through these concrete places that visitors can thoroughly experience for themselves the presence of historical events , " the council 's vice-president salomon korn told jewish weekly jüdische allgemeine .
" such a visual link of history and an authentic place serves to reinforce and deepen remembrance . " entrance fees would only undermine this , korn said . private investors holding back american philanthropist ronald lauder set up and finances a project to preserve europe 's most notorious concentration camp , auschwitz , in present day poland . but some point out that in germany , private investors remain reluctant to do the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn says historical sites need to be maintained korn said german companies were " elegantly refraining " from contributing to financing , despite " a moral obligation and responsibility " to maintain these memorial sites . buchenwald 's lüttgenau said this was due to industry concerns that any backing could be misunderstood . " private companies fear that support for our educational work would be equal to an admission of guilt , " lüttgenau said . sites are germany 's responsibility distel said the government carried the responsibility for the memorial sites in germany .
the bavarian state government 's ministry of culture finances dachau , for example .
according to a spokesman , it provides the memorial site with some 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- annually for personnel and material costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other camp is more associated with the horrors of the holocaust than auschwitz " i consider it to be germany 's political and cultural task to ensure that these sites are equipped in a way that they can adequately work , " distel said . this view was shared by korn .
he said it was not the memorial sites ' obligation , but rather that of those politically responsible to ensure that the memory of these camps stayed alive . " the federal and state governments are obliged to ensure that everyone has access to these sites , which represent the darkest part of german history , " korn said . thomas lutz of the topography of terror foundation said , though , that it was not clear whether the political support necessary was present . " the only chance now is to make it publicly clear that there is a significant gap between the demands on the memorial sites and their ability to fulfill these , " said lutz , who heads the foundation 's department for memorial sites . german government has yet to provide a solution for now , dachau and the other sites are trying to work as effectively as possible .
lüttgenau said the buchenwald site had exhausted all savings measures .
but it was n't enough to address the needs of its half a million visitors per year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many youth groups visit former concentration camps , such as sachsenhausen " we can not attend to the growing demand for educational services , such as accompanying groups through the site , " lüttgenau said .
it has had to turn down 30 to 40 percent of such inquiries . " considering the need for more educational youth work in eastern germany , this is a dramatic situation , " lüttgenau said .
" the interest is there and we ca n't fulfill it . " the german government has said it is working on a new concept for financing the concentration camp memorial sites in germany .
but it has yet to present a model . " we are caught between a rock and a hard place right now , " lüttgenau said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the commission has repeatedly warned germany that its new telecom law violates eu telecom rules , but without success , " said eu telecom commissioner viviane reding . " we want to ensure germany can benefit from a healthy , competitive and fully functioning market and encourage both competition and investment in broadband markets , " she added .

the first of step is to build applications that learn from their users so that the more people use them , the better they get .
web 2.0 is based on the collective intelligence of the users . that means that a lot of users have to be involved .
does web 2.0 represent a more democratic form of the internet ? i think that the next technology markets will be open and democratic .
there 's a lot of excitement around .
the hurdles we 're facing are n't all that big , and everyone can take part .
over time the power of small groups of users will decrease .
i think this is the phase the internet is in now . so we are now in the middle of web 2.0 .
what comes next – web 3.0 ? the term web 2.0 gives the impression that a web 3.0 is coming .
but i 'm not sure that the next technology boom will be attached to the world wide web .
we still think primarily about interacting with a computer as typing on a keyboard and looking at a screen .
but increasingly computers are fading into the background . there are lots of different ways in which computing interfaces are changing .
first of all there is the use of handheld devices or cell phones as a platform . think about how cameras are increasingly being equipped with gps .
now , when you take a photograph , the location of that photograph will automatically be a part of the data uploaded to a web 2.0 application like flickr .
all of a sudden the global brain is learning something that we did not actually explicitly tell it . that means that something will be created by this community ? yes , but people wo n't know they 're doing it .
we 're heading in the direction of artificial intelligence .
of course there is still a person telling the program what to do .
we 're putting more and more information into the global network , and people are writing programs that create even more connections .
it is as though the synapses of a collective brain are growing .
i think we should expect some surprises . but if people are n't aware of what is happening to their data , doesn ’ t that create a conflict with their right to privacy ? i think a lot of concerns about privacy will come up in the further development of web 2.0 .
but i think it 's really important to understand that people are willing to trade privacy for perceived benefit .
i also think that the net gets a bit of a bad rap with regards to privacy .
when you use a credit card , for example , you 're revealing all kinds of very private information about yourself .
people do n't make a big fuss about that . are we looking at two societies – one that has access to the internet and one that remains locked out ? with time i think that more people will have access to these technologies .
the internet will become more present – that means it will be accessible via telephone but also from different devices . we think there are a billion computers out there .
but really there is only one .
that is what web 2.0 is about – getting stitched together .

in many ways , he says , it is already here . web 2.0 is a term coined by o ’ reilly in 2003 to refer to the second generation of web applications .
based on collaboration and sharing among users , they include sites like facebook and wikipedia .
o ’ reilly lives and works in the small town of sebastopol , about a two-hour drive north of san francisco .
christina bergmann traveled there to talk to him about his work . mr. o ’ reilly , what exactly is web 2.0 ? web 2.0 is about applications that use the network as a platform .
the first of step is to build applications that learn from their users so that the more people use them , the better they get .
web 2.0 is based on the collective intelligence of the users . that means that a lot of users have to be involved .
does web 2.0 represent a more democratic form of the internet ? i think that the next technology markets will be open and democratic .
there 's a lot of excitement around .
the hurdles we 're facing are n't all that big , and everyone can take part .
over time the power of small groups of users will decrease .
i think this is the phase the internet is in now . so we are now in the middle of web 2.0 .
what comes next – web 3.0 ? the term web 2.0 gives the impression that a web 3.0 is coming .
but i 'm not sure that the next technology boom will be attached to the world wide web .
we still think primarily about interacting with a computer as typing on a keyboard and looking at a screen .
but increasingly computers are fading into the background . there are lots of different ways in which computing interfaces are changing .
first of all there is the use of handheld devices or cell phones as a platform . think about how cameras are increasingly being equipped with gps .
now , when you take a photograph , the location of that photograph will automatically be a part of the data uploaded to a web 2.0 application like flickr .
all of a sudden the global brain is learning something that we did not actually explicitly tell it . that means that something will be created by this community ? yes , but people wo n't know they 're doing it .
we 're heading in the direction of artificial intelligence .
of course there is still a person telling the program what to do .
we 're putting more and more information into the global network , and people are writing programs that create even more connections .
it is as though the synapses of a collective brain are growing .
i think we should expect some surprises . but if people are n't aware of what is happening to their data , doesn ’ t that create a conflict with their right to privacy ? i think a lot of concerns about privacy will come up in the further development of web 2.0 .
but i think it 's really important to understand that people are willing to trade privacy for perceived benefit .
i also think that the net gets a bit of a bad rap with regards to privacy .
when you use a credit card , for example , you 're revealing all kinds of very private information about yourself .
people do n't make a big fuss about that . are we looking at two societies – one that has access to the internet and one that remains locked out ? with time i think that more people will have access to these technologies .
the internet will become more present – that means it will be accessible via telephone but also from different devices . we think there are a billion computers out there .
but really there is only one .

world leaders will have to get used to a new face - and style - in 10 downing street . in a brief statement to reporters just before moving into his new home , brown said he taken note of the british people 's desire for change , promising " a new government with new priorities . "
he also said he wanted to create better opportunities for all britons . brown 's remarks came after queen elizabeth ii , in accordance with british custom , invited him to form a government . earlier in the day , tony blair fielded one last session of questions in parliament and said farewell to the staff at 10 downing street before heading to buckingham palace to tender his resignation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair bid an emotional , and lengthy , farewell in recent weeks the 56-year-old brown is expected to announce his cabinet and the rest of his government on thursday . taking center stage despite serving as chancellor of the exchequer for more than ten years under blair , brown remains a somewhat enigmatic figure for many britons .
and some question whether the scotsman will ever completely emerge from his telegenic predecessor 's shadow . brown may have promised change , but few people expect him , in the short term , to make any major domestic-policy reversals - especially as britain enjoyed an extended period of economic growth under the blair government .
but there has been some speculation that brown may be somewhat more liberal on spending as prime minister than he was as chancellor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and brown did n't always see eye-eo-eye more interesting , perhaps , is the course brown will take regarding foreign policy and , in particular , the iraq war .
although brown has said he still supports the us-led campaign in iraq , some observers expect him to take a somewhat more skeptical approach toward washington than blair . brown 's appointment ends one 's britain 's most uneasy , if longest-lasting marriages of political convenience .
once rivals for the leadership of the labour party , brown reportedly agreed in the mid-nineties to put his own ambitions to become prime minister on hold and support blair , who was elected in 1997 . in return , blair purportedly agreed to step down at some point while still in office and clear the way for brown . new partner for britain 's allies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and his wife sarah are the new residents of 10 downing street european and other world leaders were expected to begin congratulating brown personally and in public statements . in a tribute to blair published in a british newspaper on wednesday , us president george bush praised brown , writing that the then prime minister designate " was n't the image of the dour scotsman at all . " but bush was more effusive in lauding blair . " i 've heard he 's been called ' bush 's poodle , " ' bush wrote .

the world wide web as an interactive , collaborative platform for data exchange - best known as web 2.0 - has become , in industrialized countries , at least , a part of everyday life . the internet revolution is showing no signs of fatigue .
millions of people are writing wikipedia articles , reviewing books at amazon , evaluating articles they bought at ebay , publishing their holiday photos on flickr and presenting themselves on facebook .
wherever they are , they are part of a larger network that knows no national or cultural borders .
" the internet has become a platform , " said technology publisher and web 2.0 guru tim o 'reilly .
millions of networked personal computers are providing access to " the one global , electronic brain that we 're creating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon is not just an online retailer : it draws its customers to participate in product evaluation this collective brain is processing vast amounts of information at an increasing speed .
companies are already using data freely available on the internet to look for and contact their potential customers .
jeff hammerbacher of the social networking site , facebook , asserts that his company does not sell its users ' data , but it negotiates with advertisers what additional analysis can be performed on the very private details that often appear on the site .
web search giants yahoo and google , while claiming to be very protective of their user data , also point out that they follow the law in the countries in which they operate and are obliged to cooperate with law enforcement agencies , when asked to do so .
data collection with no limits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " let 's see who 'll be late for class today " in theory , at least , the possibilities for data collection and aggregation on the web are limitless .
data mining expert and former chief scientist at amazon , andreas weigend , said that if gps signals from cellular phones were available to everybody , his students could , for instance , figure out that he was 15 minutes late for his morning lecture , if they saw his cell phone emitting its signals 10 miles -lrb- 16 kilometers -rrb- away from campus .
if , however , he 'd make it to the lecture hall on time anyway , the police could , as tim o 'reilly points out , also conclude that he must have exceeded the speed limit on the road .
a speeding ticket could easily follow .
social network platforms such as facebook and myspace - in which users set up their own pages , profiles and links to other users with similar interests - ca n't say anything on their own about the actual relationships between two people : would they really get along ?
can they trust each other ?
o 'reilly , however , believes that software applications will soon be able to make decisions in the social realm that were previously reserved for humans only .
if an application can make the decision , which would normally require a face-to-face contact , then it can also decide if it should give out somebody 's phone number to a third party .
additional value through global data collection the development of new technologies goes hand in hand with the transformation of society .
five years ago , people would think twice before writing something intimate on a postcard , well-aware that anybody could read it .
nowadays , personal web logs - or blogs - are filled with publicly accessible , personal information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is one of the driving forces of the internet economy young people , especially , find nothing extraordinary about this .
while benefiting from the added value of global data collection , they are ready to contribute their part .
web researchers agree that digital devices will continue to play an increasingly prominent part in everybody 's life .
in china , says andreas weigend , one million cell new phones are sold every day .
farmers in the country may not have a computer , but they do have cell phones .
" and the government sends them , for example , information about health care on their cell phones , " weigend said .
soon , other devices for accessing information will come into play as well .
smart radios and other wireless devices , for instance , will avoid transmission bottlenecks by reconfiguring themselves to use frequencies that they sense are clear .
one laptop per child -lrb- olpc -rrb- - a non-profit organization chaired by mit media lab founder nicolas negroponte - is developing a $ 100 -lrb- 75 euros -rrb- portable computer for children in developing nations as part of a mission to bridge the digital divide between industrialized and lesser developed countries .
" we 'll be surprised " the silicon valley , for its part , has definitely recovered from the 2001 crash .
new startups are launching - although everybody is somewhat more cautious than in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oplc aims to bring computers to the underprivildged it is , however , getting crowded on the internet market .
the big players are already swallowing the smaller ones : google now owns the video-sharing platform youtube , whereas yahoo purchased the photo-sharing site flickr .
this , according to tim o 'reilly , is to be expected in the development of a new technology .
the more participants a network has , the more valuable it becomes .
and those who were there first , profit the most .
what is certain , at this point , is that there is no way back .
it 's hard , however , to make any predictions about future technological developments .

repairing german-polish relations after the eu summit i find the opinions of the german press about the summit and poland and great britain unfair and biased .
no one discussed the merit of the proposals .
each country in the eu should have the right to express their opinions and the press should show different aspects of the issue and not to be just a propaganda tool .
unfortunately , i found most of the german press like that even before the summit .
the biased opinions hurt the relations between the countries and personally hurt the friends of germany in poland and in uk .
this is where the values of eu should start . - leszek wojtowicz , poland to be politically correct , we must pretend to be shocked at the wprost cover of chancellor merkel breast-feeding the twins .
but really , this cover does n't put chancellor merkel in a bad light at all .
she is the nurturer and the power figure .
it is the two weird twins who are the babies , completely powerless and dependent .
the chancellor is blithely sailing on , in full confidence and with a great body , to new opportunities to display her new-found powers .
actually , it is a very funny cover , because of the weirdness and fecklessness of the twins .
as i see it , chancellor merkel is presented positively and even with affection , but the twins receive a potent message of disdain from within their own country . - wiley horne , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a two-speed europe on its way ?
i wish to put forth four measures which i believe would do the trick in mending german-polish relations : 1 .
buy up all the low-quality polish meat that russia refuses to allow into the country ; 2 .
force russia to lay the new pipeline through polish territory so that the kaczynski twins can steal the gas en route to germany ; 3 .
applaud and endorse the ban on gay rights in poland ; 4 .
applaud and endorse the professional ban in poland . - luis oliveira , portugal on one side are the countries that want more integration and on the other side the countries that want a minimum of integration .
a block with one speed on one side and split countries on the other side - that is the answer and i think romano prodi hinted that something like that might happen . - gustavo araujo , uruguay i suspect that poland is a country still trying to get used to the idea that , for the first time in over two centuries -lrb- except for the 20 years between the two world wars -rrb- , it is truly free to determine its own destiny .
moreover , many in poland still feel a deep sense of hurt and pain over all the tragedies of the last century .
the best that germany can do is to be as sympathetic to the current mood in poland as possible and not do anything to aggravate the relationship any further .
i believe that german democratic institutions and germany 's self-concept are strong enough to digest this current " chill " in german-polish relations and to prove that , in the end , poland can rely on german friendship even at tense moments such as now . - gary k. taylor , honduras germany calls for extradition of cia agents the agents did a great job when they followed leads dealing with terrorist threats .
why is it okay for osama bin-laden and his group to kidnap journalists and kill them ?
but when the cia follows leads and does what it takes to gets results , the world questions it .
it 's strange the world never is willing to do what it takes to get the job done .

i believe the von stauffenberg family should receive assurances that the content is accurate and presented accordingly .
i personally do not believe in the methods or teachings of the church of scientology , but tom cruise is a very good actor and it is my belief that he would do an outstanding job of representing colonel von stauffenberg . - joseph , us two reasons tom cruise should not play von stauffenberg : 1 .
he is too short , 2 .
he is not german .
i wonder if he will fake a german accent or speak like a guy from new jersey . - david worsham , us in the us ' first amendment to the bill of rights , a person 's religion is protected .
do the germans protect religion in their laws as well ?
i am not a scientologist , but i do sympathize with cruise .

some readers think so readers shared their views on this week 's top news stories , from the post-summit state of german-polish relations to germany 's call for the extradition of 13 cia agents and tom cruise 's foiled plans to film in germany . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .

repairing german-polish relations after the eu summit i find the opinions of the german press about the summit and poland and great britain unfair and biased .
no one discussed the merit of the proposals .
each country in the eu should have the right to express their opinions and the press should show different aspects of the issue and not to be just a propaganda tool .
unfortunately , i found most of the german press like that even before the summit .
the biased opinions hurt the relations between the countries and personally hurt the friends of germany in poland and in uk .
this is where the values of eu should start . - leszek wojtowicz , poland to be politically correct , we must pretend to be shocked at the wprost cover of chancellor merkel breast-feeding the twins .
but really , this cover does n't put chancellor merkel in a bad light at all .
she is the nurturer and the power figure .
it is the two weird twins who are the babies , completely powerless and dependent .
the chancellor is blithely sailing on , in full confidence and with a great body , to new opportunities to display her new-found powers .
actually , it is a very funny cover , because of the weirdness and fecklessness of the twins .
as i see it , chancellor merkel is presented positively and even with affection , but the twins receive a potent message of disdain from within their own country . - wiley horne , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a two-speed europe on its way ?
i wish to put forth four measures which i believe would do the trick in mending german-polish relations : 1 .
buy up all the low-quality polish meat that russia refuses to allow into the country ; 2 .
force russia to lay the new pipeline through polish territory so that the kaczynski twins can steal the gas en route to germany ; 3 .
applaud and endorse the ban on gay rights in poland ; 4 .
applaud and endorse the professional ban in poland . - luis oliveira , portugal on one side are the countries that want more integration and on the other side the countries that want a minimum of integration .
a block with one speed on one side and split countries on the other side - that is the answer and i think romano prodi hinted that something like that might happen . - gustavo araujo , uruguay i suspect that poland is a country still trying to get used to the idea that , for the first time in over two centuries -lrb- except for the 20 years between the two world wars -rrb- , it is truly free to determine its own destiny .
moreover , many in poland still feel a deep sense of hurt and pain over all the tragedies of the last century .
the best that germany can do is to be as sympathetic to the current mood in poland as possible and not do anything to aggravate the relationship any further .
i believe that german democratic institutions and germany 's self-concept are strong enough to digest this current " chill " in german-polish relations and to prove that , in the end , poland can rely on german friendship even at tense moments such as now . - gary k. taylor , honduras germany calls for extradition of cia agents the agents did a great job when they followed leads dealing with terrorist threats .
why is it okay for osama bin-laden and his group to kidnap journalists and kill them ?
but when the cia follows leads and does what it takes to gets results , the world questions it .
it 's strange the world never is willing to do what it takes to get the job done .
the world always expects the us to fix the problems . - loche , us i praise those men .
they were doing their duty to defend their country .
those who call the us allies should be ashamed of their act . - rafael fermoselle , cuba no , they should not be extradited .
they were doing the jobs that they were ordered to do .

world leaders will have to get used to a new face - and style - in 10 downing street . in a brief statement to reporters just before moving into his new home , brown said he taken note of the british people 's desire for change , promising " a new government with new priorities . "

he also said he wanted to create better opportunities for all britons . brown 's remarks came after queen elizabeth ii , in accordance with british custom , invited him to form a government . earlier in the day , tony blair fielded one last session of questions in parliament and said farewell to the staff at 10 downing street before heading to buckingham palace to tender his resignation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair bid an emotional , and lengthy , farewell in recent weeks the 56-year-old brown is expected to announce his cabinet and the rest of his government on thursday . taking center stage despite serving as chancellor of the exchequer for more than ten years under blair , brown remains a somewhat enigmatic figure for many britons .

once rivals for the leadership of the labour party , brown reportedly agreed in the mid-nineties to put his own ambitions to become prime minister on hold and support blair , who was elected in 1997 . in return , blair purportedly agreed to step down at some point while still in office and clear the way for brown . new partner for britain 's allies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and his wife sarah are the new residents of 10 downing street european and other world leaders were expected to begin congratulating brown personally and in public statements . in a tribute to blair published in a british newspaper on wednesday , us president george bush praised brown , writing that the then prime minister designate " was n't the image of the dour scotsman at all .

" we laid the ground for a common future for the european union and overcame the impasse , " she said in her final address to the european parliament before germany 's presidency of the eu ends on saturday . " at the end of the day we did not disappoint people 's expectations and we avoided a division , " she said .
" europe can once again look forward to a period of strength and confidence . " merkel told the deputies that she had anticipated difficult negotiations at the summit in brussels , which saw poland threaten to block the treaty in a dispute over voting rights . if the talks had failed it would not have meant the end of europe as we know it , she said , but it would have had major consequences which would have been difficult to predict . merkel said failure could have led to a two-speed europe , with those in favor of reform pressing ahead at the expense of those who were reluctant to change . new eu treaty the treaty , a key priority of the german presidency , meant the eu was able to preserve elements of the european constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in a referendums held in 2005 . it allows for decisions to be taken by majority rather than a unanimous vote and removes the threat of national vetoes .
there are also provisions for an eu president and more powers to the eu 's foreign policy chief , giving the bloc a bigger say in the world . bildunterschrift : a few high-ranking merkel fans she said the post of a high representative for foreign affairs was necessary because it would enable europe to speak with one voice as it grows more assertive on the world stage . " this is a european political quantum leap , " she said to applause from deputies . the new treaty has to be endorsed by an inter-government conference before it can be ratified and put in place in time for european parliament elections in mid-2009 . the chancellor said she hoped these talks could get underway next month when portugal takes over the rotating eu presidency from germany . licking their wounds while calling the german presidency of the eu a resounding “ success ” , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier did acknowledge that relationships between some in the eu bloc did take a few hits in the past few weeks , notably germany and poland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier speaking in berlin on wednesday speaking at a news conference in berlin steinmeier said that he hoped the “ rough ” exchanges last weekend would be soon forgotten . “ things got quite abrasive and in the long run european politics can not endure that , ” he said . steinmeier went on to criticize the polish magazine wprost for featuring a photo montage of a topless angela merkel breastfeeding the kaczynski brothers , poland 's prime minister and president . " germany wanted to be a mother for poland but she turned out to be a false mother , " said editor-in-chief stanislaw janecki . the magazine cover is just the last of a long line of recent spats between the eu neighbors but steinmeier expressed hope that such disagreements would not continue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 27.06.2007 spd unveils employee shareholding plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck says employees should join the ride and take a stake in the companies they work for the social democrats have put forward the idea of a " germany fund " to give employees better options for investing in german companies .
but critics are warning of a bureaucratic monster . the head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- kurt beck said he wants to make it easier for employees to take a stake in german companies . according to an spd plan , employees could buy shares in a so-called " germany fund , " whose assets participating companies could access for capital .
the companies would then direct their dividends , interest and repayments back to employees who paid into the fund . beck said the spd model minimized the risk of market fluctuations or company bankruptcies since the fund would be widely spread . " if the german fund owns shares for example in 1,000 companies , it wo n't collapse if two go bankrupt , " beck said in an interview with the latest issue of the weekly newsmagazine s tern . three-way deal the germany fund would be a three-way deal between employer , employee and fund .
it would be promoted by government subsidies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business is booming for many german companies married couples with an annual gross income of up to 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 53,800 -rrb- and singles with income of up to 20,000 euros would be able to invest up to 400 euros per year in the fund .
according to beck 's concept , the government would subsidize this with a further 20 percent , or 80 euros . in addition , companies could give their employees shares in the fund worth a maximum of 240 euros per year tax-free .
a federal guarantee would protect the funds from insolvency . beck said the spd wanted to push through the plan in the second half of this legislative period .
he said he would present his concept to chancellor angela merkel at a cabinet meeting in august . cdu has its own plan both the spd and its center-right coalition partner , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , have been working on concepts for employee shareholding for some time .
both want a model that allows employees to profit if their company is doing well - without risks that are too high . the cdu will be presenting its model for employee investment on friday .
the party 's general secretary ronald pofalla said that beck 's proposal went in the direction of the cdu 's . " we want more employee participation in earnings and capital , " pofalla said , adding that it was also a way to make companies more productive and competitive . fund could become a bureaucratic monster there has , however , been criticism from the private sector .
the head of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt , said beck 's proposal went in the wrong direction .
it was contrary to the actual character of capital participation , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundt is skeptical of the fund 's potential " it 's more than questionable how the benefits of equity participation are supposed to work when a national , bureaucratic fund is connecting the employees involved and their companies , " hundt said . klaus zimmermann , head of the reputable german institute for economic research diw , called the concept " nothing more than a state-run , subsidized and government secured investment for an equity fund . "
he told the daily neue osnabrücker zeitung that it was problematic to create new subsidies for such a concept . according to stern , the powerful labor unions dgb and ig metall were involved in developing the spd concept .
up to now , unions have been very skeptical about developing capital investments by employees due to fluctuating stock prices and the risk of insolvency . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he told the daily neue osnabrücker zeitung that it was problematic to create new subsidies for such a concept . according to stern , the powerful labor unions dgb and ig metall were involved in developing the spd concept .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer-generated image of a typical 19th century jewish street in a polish town " over the past 900 years , our histories have been entangled , " polish president lech told dignitaries and onlookers standing in front of the imposing black marble warsaw ghetto uprising memorial , commemorating the 1943 doomed rebellion by members of the jewish fighting organization -lrb- zob -rrb- .
" there have been good times and bad .
but the history of the polish jews is a part of the history of my country , my nation .
it is a history that deserves being commemorated , " he said .
the land-mark museum is appropriately located in warsaw , " the greatest jewish city in europe " prior to world war ii , kaczynski said .
the warsaw ghetto before the war , poland 's jewish minority numbered some 3.5 million and accounted for roughly 10 per cent of the country 's pre- war population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish life in poland was almost completely obliterated by nazis the ground-breaking ceremonies were conducted in an district of warsaw that was at the heart of jewish life prior to the war .
tragically , it was enclosed inside the infamous wartime jewish ghetto created by nazi germany as part of its systematic genocide against european jews .
the nazi german ghettos and death camps claimed the vast majority of poland 's jews .
the number accounts for half of the six million europeans of jewish ancestry killed by nazi dictator adolf hitler 's third reich .
europe was home to some 11 million jews prior to the holocaust .
biblical proportions designed by finnish architectural duo rainer mahlamäki and ilmari lahdelma , the museum 's entrance promises to be of biblical proportions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new museum will be facing the warsaw ghetto memorial a symbolically ruptured facade will open up to monumental undulating walls alluding to the old testament 's miraculous parting of the red sea through which the prophet moses led the jews to escape captivity in egypt to a new life in the promised land .
it is a labor of love for project director jerzy halberstadt and head of the warsaw-based jewish historical institute and holocaust survivor marian turski .
holocaust and jewish history expert israel gutman will supervise the team preparing expositions .
" this will be a museum about life that will benefit dialogue and the future , " halberstadt said , adding that the institution aimed to attract a half million visitors a year .
financed by by the polish government , the city of warsaw and the european union , the project is slated to cost around $ 65 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- , according to news agency ap .
measuring a total of 18,000 square meters -lrb- 59,000 square feet -rrb- , the museum will be one of the largest jewish museums in the world - along with yad vashem in jerusalem and the holocaust memorial in washington dc . dw staff with agency reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics are warning of a bureaucratic monster . the head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- kurt beck said he wants to make it easier for employees to take a stake in german companies . according to an spd plan , employees could buy shares in a so-called " germany fund , " whose assets participating companies could access for capital .
the companies would then direct their dividends , interest and repayments back to employees who paid into the fund . beck said the spd model minimized the risk of market fluctuations or company bankruptcies since the fund would be widely spread . " if the german fund owns shares for example in 1,000 companies , it wo n't collapse if two go bankrupt , " beck said in an interview with the latest issue of the weekly newsmagazine s tern . three-way deal the germany fund would be a three-way deal between employer , employee and fund .
it would be promoted by government subsidies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business is booming for many german companies married couples with an annual gross income of up to 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 53,800 -rrb- and singles with income of up to 20,000 euros would be able to invest up to 400 euros per year in the fund .
according to beck 's concept , the government would subsidize this with a further 20 percent , or 80 euros . in addition , companies could give their employees shares in the fund worth a maximum of 240 euros per year tax-free .
a federal guarantee would protect the funds from insolvency . beck said the spd wanted to push through the plan in the second half of this legislative period .

but critics are warning of a bureaucratic monster . the head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- kurt beck said he wants to make it easier for employees to take a stake in german companies . according to an spd plan , employees could buy shares in a so-called " germany fund , " whose assets participating companies could access for capital .
the companies would then direct their dividends , interest and repayments back to employees who paid into the fund . beck said the spd model minimized the risk of market fluctuations or company bankruptcies since the fund would be widely spread . " if the german fund owns shares for example in 1,000 companies , it wo n't collapse if two go bankrupt , " beck said in an interview with the latest issue of the weekly newsmagazine s tern . three-way deal the germany fund would be a three-way deal between employer , employee and fund .
it would be promoted by government subsidies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business is booming for many german companies married couples with an annual gross income of up to 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 53,800 -rrb- and singles with income of up to 20,000 euros would be able to invest up to 400 euros per year in the fund .
according to beck 's concept , the government would subsidize this with a further 20 percent , or 80 euros . in addition , companies could give their employees shares in the fund worth a maximum of 240 euros per year tax-free .
a federal guarantee would protect the funds from insolvency . beck said the spd wanted to push through the plan in the second half of this legislative period .
he said he would present his concept to chancellor angela merkel at a cabinet meeting in august . cdu has its own plan both the spd and its center-right coalition partner , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , have been working on concepts for employee shareholding for some time .
both want a model that allows employees to profit if their company is doing well - without risks that are too high . the cdu will be presenting its model for employee investment on friday .
the party 's general secretary ronald pofalla said that beck 's proposal went in the direction of the cdu 's . " we want more employee participation in earnings and capital , " pofalla said , adding that it was also a way to make companies more productive and competitive . fund could become a bureaucratic monster there has , however , been criticism from the private sector .
the head of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt , said beck 's proposal went in the wrong direction .
it was contrary to the actual character of capital participation , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundt is skeptical of the fund 's potential " it 's more than questionable how the benefits of equity participation are supposed to work when a national , bureaucratic fund is connecting the employees involved and their companies , " hundt said . klaus zimmermann , head of the reputable german institute for economic research diw , called the concept " nothing more than a state-run , subsidized and government secured investment for an equity fund . "
he told the daily neue osnabrücker zeitung that it was problematic to create new subsidies for such a concept . according to stern , the powerful labor unions dgb and ig metall were involved in developing the spd concept .
up to now , unions have been very skeptical about developing capital investments by employees due to fluctuating stock prices and the risk of insolvency . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his departure marks the end of an era .
tony blair had nearly let us forget that great britain was a conservative stronghold for nearly two decades .
the iron lady and the pale john major were hardly history when the young , dynamic new labour leader conquered the middle by forging a " third way " between the traditional conservative and left ideals in 1997 .
he gave labour , the workers ' and unions ' party , a new image and made it a viable choice for middle-class voters by pulling the party away from the left .
the youngest prime minister since 1812 , the kids in 10 downing street had pop stars as political allies .
the era of " cool britannia " had begun .

billions have been invested in margaret thatcher 's run-down health system and britain 's debts .
but not everything is rosy in the land of new labour .
there are still long waiting lists in the health care system .
not every privatization can be seen as a success .
and despite - or because of blair 's economic reforms - the gap between great britain 's rich and poor has not shrunk .
but those are not the reasons why blair and his party were punished at recent parliamentary elections in scotland and wales as well as on the municipal level .
blair 's government based itself on an efficient pr machine that mastered the art of the spin , and distrust among the population grew larger and larger until it culminated with the debacle of the never-found weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
despite massive public opposition , blair led the country into a war whose central premises emerged as false .
in exchange for his support of the increasingly isolated us president george w. bush , blair reaped ridicule and the nicknames " poodle " and " lap dog . "
tony blair never recovered from that .
then there are the accusations of nepotism - blair 's one-time consultant and spin doctor peter mandelson became a commissioner in brussels - and the allegations his party accepted donations in exchange for honors , which may have led to seats in the upper house of parliament .
the clean-cut image of britain 's once favorite son has long been tarnished .
the skirmish surrounding the recent eu summit , blair 's last international appearance as prime minister , also showed that blair could not keep his promise to increase great britain 's integration in europe .
while he himself enjoys , and has had success , being a staunch european on the eu stage , the tendency toward euro-skepticism in the british media and general public has grown in recent years .
only 40 percent of britons still support membership in the eu , according to a recent poll .
in his final days , blair was a placeholder while his successor gained in significance as the one pulling the strings - sometimes behind the scenes and sometimes very publicly .
now blair is leaving the political stage - at least in his role as britain 's prime minister - after a farewell that has taken too long .
it is high time for him to go .
and the british electorate seems to be thanking him for his departure .
for the first time in months , the labour party is ahead in the polls and blair 's successor , gordon brown , once written off as uncharismatic , is coming in well ahead of his conservative rival , the young , dynamic david cameron , who resembles the young blair .

whether blair 's party will be able to stay in power after the next elections remains to be seen .

german politicians disagree over whether germany should focus on attracting foreign workers or on improving the skills of the domestic workforce . the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released a study earlier this week which showed germany had brought in 13,000 fewer legal immigrants in 2005 compared with a year earlier .
other studies have shown that highly skilled german workers are also increasingly attracted to high salaries abroad , which contributes to germany 's brain drain .
in 2005 , the united states , britain and italy had large increases in the number of legal migrants , according to the oecd 's annual international migration outlook report .
the decrease in immigration is bad for the german economy , which needs to attract highly skilled workers to stay competitive , said germany 's education minister annette schavan .
" germany needs to make it clear that we have a very high interest in foreign talent , " schavan said in a recent article in germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
schavan of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said she is n't advocating uncontrolled immigration .
rather , she wants germany to become more attractive for highly qualified , skilled workers .
focus on domestic workforce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's annette schavan while german employers agreed skilled foreign workers are needed , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has criticized the idea .
german workers should get better training and qualifications before looking to foreign workers .
the spd and cdu make up the ruling coalition in germany 's government .
spd general secretary hubertus heil said employing skilled foreign workers is at times necessary .
but employers should focus on educating and training german workers .
abandoning german workers in favor of a foreign workforce " would be fatal for the german economy , " heil said .
schavan said she agreed and believed the current left-right coalition made up of the cdu and spd has already taken steps to help german workers .
" even when everyone in germany is well trained and educated , beyond that you still need qualified specialists from elsewhere , " she said during a television interview wednesday morning .
lowering barriers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a brain drain is underway a new law requires specialized workers from non-european union countries to earn at least 85,000 euros -lrb- $ 114,400 -rrb- in order to get german work and living permits .
cdu politicians have suggested lowering that requirement to 60,000 or 40,000 euros .
small businesses and start-ups simply ca n't pay such a high salary , even for highly-qualified employees , said maria böhmer of the cdu , who is in charge of migration issues in the government .
" when this barrier is not lowered , the best minds will leave for other countries and germany will empty out , " böhmer said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german politicians disagree over whether germany should focus on attracting foreign workers or on improving the skills of the domestic workforce . the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released a study earlier this week which showed germany had brought in 13,000 fewer legal immigrants in 2005 compared with a year earlier .
other studies have shown that highly skilled german workers are also increasingly attracted to high salaries abroad , which contributes to germany 's brain drain .
in 2005 , the united states , britain and italy had large increases in the number of legal migrants , according to the oecd 's annual international migration outlook report .
the decrease in immigration is bad for the german economy , which needs to attract highly skilled workers to stay competitive , said germany 's education minister annette schavan .
" germany needs to make it clear that we have a very high interest in foreign talent , " schavan said in a recent article in germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
schavan of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said she is n't advocating uncontrolled immigration .
rather , she wants germany to become more attractive for highly qualified , skilled workers .
focus on domestic workforce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's annette schavan while german employers agreed skilled foreign workers are needed , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has criticized the idea .
german workers should get better training and qualifications before looking to foreign workers .
the spd and cdu make up the ruling coalition in germany 's government .
spd general secretary hubertus heil said employing skilled foreign workers is at times necessary .
but employers should focus on educating and training german workers .
abandoning german workers in favor of a foreign workforce " would be fatal for the german economy , " heil said .
schavan said she agreed and believed the current left-right coalition made up of the cdu and spd has already taken steps to help german workers .
" even when everyone in germany is well trained and educated , beyond that you still need qualified specialists from elsewhere , " she said during a television interview wednesday morning .
lowering barriers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a brain drain is underway a new law requires specialized workers from non-european union countries to earn at least 85,000 euros -lrb- $ 114,400 -rrb- in order to get german work and living permits .
cdu politicians have suggested lowering that requirement to 60,000 or 40,000 euros .
small businesses and start-ups simply ca n't pay such a high salary , even for highly-qualified employees , said maria böhmer of the cdu , who is in charge of migration issues in the government .
" when this barrier is not lowered , the best minds will leave for other countries and germany will empty out , " böhmer said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de oecd : immigration numbers in germany slipped in 2005 immigration into countries belonging to the oecd climbed in 2005 while asylum requests slid , according to a report published by the group .
the number of legal immigrants to germany , though , fell .
-lrb- 25.06.2007 -rrb- human rights groups slam eu migration policies europe 's mediterranean countries bear an unfair share of the refugee burden from africa , overwhelming their capacity to cope .
amnesty and others support an eu wide migration policy guided by humanitarian principles .
-lrb- 18.06.2007 -rrb- german parliament passes immigration reform germany 's bundestag approved a reform of the country 's immigration law .
the change implements 11 eu guidelines and affects areas such as spousal immigration , integration and residency regulations .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer-generated image of a typical 19th century jewish street in a polish town " over the past 900 years , our histories have been entangled , " polish president lech told dignitaries and onlookers standing in front of the imposing black marble warsaw ghetto uprising memorial , commemorating the 1943 doomed rebellion by members of the jewish fighting organization -lrb- zob -rrb- .
" there have been good times and bad .
but the history of the polish jews is a part of the history of my country , my nation .
it is a history that deserves being commemorated , " he said .
the land-mark museum is appropriately located in warsaw , " the greatest jewish city in europe " prior to world war ii , kaczynski said .
the warsaw ghetto before the war , poland 's jewish minority numbered some 3.5 million and accounted for roughly 10 per cent of the country 's pre- war population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish life in poland was almost completely obliterated by nazis the ground-breaking ceremonies were conducted in an district of warsaw that was at the heart of jewish life prior to the war .
tragically , it was enclosed inside the infamous wartime jewish ghetto created by nazi germany as part of its systematic genocide against european jews .
the nazi german ghettos and death camps claimed the vast majority of poland 's jews .
the number accounts for half of the six million europeans of jewish ancestry killed by nazi dictator adolf hitler 's third reich .
europe was home to some 11 million jews prior to the holocaust .
biblical proportions designed by finnish architectural duo rainer mahlamäki and ilmari lahdelma , the museum 's entrance promises to be of biblical proportions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new museum will be facing the warsaw ghetto memorial a symbolically ruptured facade will open up to monumental undulating walls alluding to the old testament 's miraculous parting of the red sea through which the prophet moses led the jews to escape captivity in egypt to a new life in the promised land .
it is a labor of love for project director jerzy halberstadt and head of the warsaw-based jewish historical institute and holocaust survivor marian turski .
holocaust and jewish history expert israel gutman will supervise the team preparing expositions .
" this will be a museum about life that will benefit dialogue and the future , " halberstadt said , adding that the institution aimed to attract a half million visitors a year .
financed by by the polish government , the city of warsaw and the european union , the project is slated to cost around $ 65 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- , according to news agency ap .
measuring a total of 18,000 square meters -lrb- 59,000 square feet -rrb- , the museum will be one of the largest jewish museums in the world - along with yad vashem in jerusalem and the holocaust memorial in washington dc . dw staff with agency reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" europe can once again look forward to a period of strength and confidence . " merkel told the deputies that she had anticipated difficult negotiations at the summit in brussels , which saw poland threaten to block the treaty in a dispute over voting rights . if the talks had failed it would not have meant the end of europe as we know it , she said , but it would have had major consequences which would have been difficult to predict . merkel said failure could have led to a two-speed europe , with those in favor of reform pressing ahead at the expense of those who were reluctant to change . new eu treaty the treaty , a key priority of the german presidency , meant the eu was able to preserve elements of the european constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in a referendums held in 2005 . it allows for decisions to be taken by majority rather than a unanimous vote and removes the threat of national vetoes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.06.2007 opinion : the rise and fall of tony blair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only time will tell if prime minister tony blair will go down in history for leading britain into a war it did n't want or for the successes and fresh ideas he brought britons , according to dw 's irene quaile-kersken . was he really in office for 10 years ?
his departure marks the end of an era .
tony blair had nearly let us forget that great britain was a conservative stronghold for nearly two decades .
the iron lady and the pale john major were hardly history when the young , dynamic new labour leader conquered the middle by forging a " third way " between the traditional conservative and left ideals in 1997 .
he gave labour , the workers ' and unions ' party , a new image and made it a viable choice for middle-class voters by pulling the party away from the left .
the youngest prime minister since 1812 , the kids in 10 downing street had pop stars as political allies .
the era of " cool britannia " had begun .
ten years under tony blair modernized great britain .
the economy has boomed over the long-term .
unemployment has sunk .
the northern ireland conflict , which had gone on for decades , was settled .
northern ireland , scotland and wales have their own parliamentary bodies .
billions have been invested in margaret thatcher 's run-down health system and britain 's debts .
but not everything is rosy in the land of new labour .
there are still long waiting lists in the health care system .
not every privatization can be seen as a success .
and despite - or because of blair 's economic reforms - the gap between great britain 's rich and poor has not shrunk .
but those are not the reasons why blair and his party were punished at recent parliamentary elections in scotland and wales as well as on the municipal level .
blair 's government based itself on an efficient pr machine that mastered the art of the spin , and distrust among the population grew larger and larger until it culminated with the debacle of the never-found weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
despite massive public opposition , blair led the country into a war whose central premises emerged as false .
in exchange for his support of the increasingly isolated us president george w. bush , blair reaped ridicule and the nicknames " poodle " and " lap dog . "
tony blair never recovered from that .
then there are the accusations of nepotism - blair 's one-time consultant and spin doctor peter mandelson became a commissioner in brussels - and the allegations his party accepted donations in exchange for honors , which may have led to seats in the upper house of parliament .
the clean-cut image of britain 's once favorite son has long been tarnished .
the skirmish surrounding the recent eu summit , blair 's last international appearance as prime minister , also showed that blair could not keep his promise to increase great britain 's integration in europe .
while he himself enjoys , and has had success , being a staunch european on the eu stage , the tendency toward euro-skepticism in the british media and general public has grown in recent years .
only 40 percent of britons still support membership in the eu , according to a recent poll .
in his final days , blair was a placeholder while his successor gained in significance as the one pulling the strings - sometimes behind the scenes and sometimes very publicly .
now blair is leaving the political stage - at least in his role as britain 's prime minister - after a farewell that has taken too long .
it is high time for him to go .
and the british electorate seems to be thanking him for his departure .
for the first time in months , the labour party is ahead in the polls and blair 's successor , gordon brown , once written off as uncharismatic , is coming in well ahead of his conservative rival , the young , dynamic david cameron , who resembles the young blair .
the blair era is over .
" cool britannia " is ready for a change .
first with a new labour leader .
whether blair 's party will be able to stay in power after the next elections remains to be seen .
blair 's spot in history , however , is secure .
but only time will tell if the damage the iraq war did to his image will be qualified by his undeniable successes .

the world wide web as an interactive , collaborative platform for data exchange - best known as web 2.0 - has become , in industrialized countries , at least , a part of everyday life . the internet revolution is showing no signs of fatigue .
millions of people are writing wikipedia articles , reviewing books at amazon , evaluating articles they bought at ebay , publishing their holiday photos on flickr and presenting themselves on facebook .
wherever they are , they are part of a larger network that knows no national or cultural borders .
" the internet has become a platform , " said technology publisher and web 2.0 guru tim o 'reilly .
millions of networked personal computers are providing access to " the one global , electronic brain that we 're creating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon is not just an online retailer : it draws its customers to participate in product evaluation this collective brain is processing vast amounts of information at an increasing speed .
companies are already using data freely available on the internet to look for and contact their potential customers .
jeff hammerbacher of the social networking site , facebook , asserts that his company does not sell its users ' data , but it negotiates with advertisers what additional analysis can be performed on the very private details that often appear on the site .
web search giants yahoo and google , while claiming to be very protective of their user data , also point out that they follow the law in the countries in which they operate and are obliged to cooperate with law enforcement agencies , when asked to do so .
data collection with no limits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " let 's see who 'll be late for class today " in theory , at least , the possibilities for data collection and aggregation on the web are limitless .
data mining expert and former chief scientist at amazon , andreas weigend , said that if gps signals from cellular phones were available to everybody , his students could , for instance , figure out that he was 15 minutes late for his morning lecture , if they saw his cell phone emitting its signals 10 miles -lrb- 16 kilometers -rrb- away from campus .
if , however , he 'd make it to the lecture hall on time anyway , the police could , as tim o 'reilly points out , also conclude that he must have exceeded the speed limit on the road .
a speeding ticket could easily follow .
social network platforms such as facebook and myspace - in which users set up their own pages , profiles and links to other users with similar interests - ca n't say anything on their own about the actual relationships between two people : would they really get along ?
can they trust each other ?
o 'reilly , however , believes that software applications will soon be able to make decisions in the social realm that were previously reserved for humans only .
if an application can make the decision , which would normally require a face-to-face contact , then it can also decide if it should give out somebody 's phone number to a third party .
additional value through global data collection the development of new technologies goes hand in hand with the transformation of society .
five years ago , people would think twice before writing something intimate on a postcard , well-aware that anybody could read it .
nowadays , personal web logs - or blogs - are filled with publicly accessible , personal information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is one of the driving forces of the internet economy young people , especially , find nothing extraordinary about this .
while benefiting from the added value of global data collection , they are ready to contribute their part .
web researchers agree that digital devices will continue to play an increasingly prominent part in everybody 's life .
in china , says andreas weigend , one million cell new phones are sold every day .
farmers in the country may not have a computer , but they do have cell phones .
" and the government sends them , for example , information about health care on their cell phones , " weigend said .
soon , other devices for accessing information will come into play as well .
smart radios and other wireless devices , for instance , will avoid transmission bottlenecks by reconfiguring themselves to use frequencies that they sense are clear .
one laptop per child -lrb- olpc -rrb- - a non-profit organization chaired by mit media lab founder nicolas negroponte - is developing a $ 100 -lrb- 75 euros -rrb- portable computer for children in developing nations as part of a mission to bridge the digital divide between industrialized and lesser developed countries .
" we 'll be surprised " the silicon valley , for its part , has definitely recovered from the 2001 crash .
new startups are launching - although everybody is somewhat more cautious than in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oplc aims to bring computers to the underprivildged it is , however , getting crowded on the internet market .
the big players are already swallowing the smaller ones : google now owns the video-sharing platform youtube , whereas yahoo purchased the photo-sharing site flickr .
this , according to tim o 'reilly , is to be expected in the development of a new technology .
the more participants a network has , the more valuable it becomes .
and those who were there first , profit the most .
what is certain , at this point , is that there is no way back .
it 's hard , however , to make any predictions about future technological developments .

his departure marks the end of an era .
tony blair had nearly let us forget that great britain was a conservative stronghold for nearly two decades .
the iron lady and the pale john major were hardly history when the young , dynamic new labour leader conquered the middle by forging a " third way " between the traditional conservative and left ideals in 1997 .
he gave labour , the workers ' and unions ' party , a new image and made it a viable choice for middle-class voters by pulling the party away from the left .
the youngest prime minister since 1812 , the kids in 10 downing street had pop stars as political allies .
the era of " cool britannia " had begun .
ten years under tony blair modernized great britain .
the economy has boomed over the long-term .
unemployment has sunk .
the northern ireland conflict , which had gone on for decades , was settled .
northern ireland , scotland and wales have their own parliamentary bodies .
billions have been invested in margaret thatcher 's run-down health system and britain 's debts .
but not everything is rosy in the land of new labour .
there are still long waiting lists in the health care system .
not every privatization can be seen as a success .
and despite - or because of blair 's economic reforms - the gap between great britain 's rich and poor has not shrunk .
but those are not the reasons why blair and his party were punished at recent parliamentary elections in scotland and wales as well as on the municipal level .
blair 's government based itself on an efficient pr machine that mastered the art of the spin , and distrust among the population grew larger and larger until it culminated with the debacle of the never-found weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
despite massive public opposition , blair led the country into a war whose central premises emerged as false .
in exchange for his support of the increasingly isolated us president george w. bush , blair reaped ridicule and the nicknames " poodle " and " lap dog . "
tony blair never recovered from that .
then there are the accusations of nepotism - blair 's one-time consultant and spin doctor peter mandelson became a commissioner in brussels - and the allegations his party accepted donations in exchange for honors , which may have led to seats in the upper house of parliament .
the clean-cut image of britain 's once favorite son has long been tarnished .
the skirmish surrounding the recent eu summit , blair 's last international appearance as prime minister , also showed that blair could not keep his promise to increase great britain 's integration in europe .
while he himself enjoys , and has had success , being a staunch european on the eu stage , the tendency toward euro-skepticism in the british media and general public has grown in recent years .
only 40 percent of britons still support membership in the eu , according to a recent poll .
in his final days , blair was a placeholder while his successor gained in significance as the one pulling the strings - sometimes behind the scenes and sometimes very publicly .
now blair is leaving the political stage - at least in his role as britain 's prime minister - after a farewell that has taken too long .
it is high time for him to go .
and the british electorate seems to be thanking him for his departure .
for the first time in months , the labour party is ahead in the polls and blair 's successor , gordon brown , once written off as uncharismatic , is coming in well ahead of his conservative rival , the young , dynamic david cameron , who resembles the young blair .
the blair era is over .
" cool britannia " is ready for a change .
first with a new labour leader .
whether blair 's party will be able to stay in power after the next elections remains to be seen .
blair 's spot in history , however , is secure .
but only time will tell if the damage the iraq war did to his image will be qualified by his undeniable successes .

they are calling for more political responsibility to ensure that they can continue to fulfill their educational task . the dachau concentration camp memorial site near munich receives over 800,000 visitors per year .
internationally , it is among the best-known sites commemorating the memory of the millions who perished in the holocaust in europe . but faced with an acute cash crunch , memorial centers strewn across germany , dachau included , are increasingly struggling to carry out their primary task : educating future generations about the horrors of the holocaust and the valuable lessons they hold for humanity . barbara distel , director of the dachau memorial site said its education department can not meet all requests for tours or other educational offers . " the situation in dachau is unsatisfactory , " distel said .
the center only has one full-time educator . other major sites report of similar problems .
the foundation managing the memorials at sachsenhausen , ravensbrück and brandenburg in eastern germany said funding was only enough to cover operating costs .
buchenwald , also in eastern germany , has had to work with a capped budget since 1998 , despite the increase in costs . " our back is to the wall , " said rikola-gunnar lüttgenau , deputy director of the buchenwald memorial foundation .
he said the center did not have the means to revise existing permanent exhibitions or conduct youth projects , for example .
the latter could only be financed through external sources , such as other foundations . charging entrance fees for concentration camps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops who liberated dachau were horrified by what they found the president of the international dachau committee , pieter dietz de loos last month sparked a debate on whether memorial sites should introduce entrance fees to alleviate these financial problems .
the committee was founded by former prisoners following world war two and played a decisive role in setting up the memorial site at dachau .
it does not , however , contribute to the site 's funding . " the committee will be broke in five years , " said dietz de loos , a dutch attorney and son of a dachau prisoner , at the camp 's liberation ceremony in may . but the proposal to charge entry fees for concentration camps has sparked unease among many . " i can not imagine that visitors to dachau will have to pay an entrance fee , " said distel . according to the central council of jews in germany , those sites where history occurred had to be accessible to everyone . " it is only through these concrete places that visitors can thoroughly experience for themselves the presence of historical events , " the council 's vice-president salomon korn told jewish weekly jüdische allgemeine .
" such a visual link of history and an authentic place serves to reinforce and deepen remembrance . " entrance fees would only undermine this , korn said . private investors holding back american philanthropist ronald lauder set up and finances a project to preserve europe 's most notorious concentration camp , auschwitz , in present day poland . but some point out that in germany , private investors remain reluctant to do the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn says historical sites need to be maintained korn said german companies were " elegantly refraining " from contributing to financing , despite " a moral obligation and responsibility " to maintain these memorial sites . buchenwald 's lüttgenau said this was due to industry concerns that any backing could be misunderstood . " private companies fear that support for our educational work would be equal to an admission of guilt , " lüttgenau said . sites are germany 's responsibility distel said the government carried the responsibility for the memorial sites in germany .
the bavarian state government 's ministry of culture finances dachau , for example .
according to a spokesman , it provides the memorial site with some 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- annually for personnel and material costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other camp is more associated with the horrors of the holocaust than auschwitz " i consider it to be germany 's political and cultural task to ensure that these sites are equipped in a way that they can adequately work , " distel said . this view was shared by korn .
he said it was not the memorial sites ' obligation , but rather that of those politically responsible to ensure that the memory of these camps stayed alive . " the federal and state governments are obliged to ensure that everyone has access to these sites , which represent the darkest part of german history , " korn said . thomas lutz of the topography of terror foundation said , though , that it was not clear whether the political support necessary was present . " the only chance now is to make it publicly clear that there is a significant gap between the demands on the memorial sites and their ability to fulfill these , " said lutz , who heads the foundation 's department for memorial sites . german government has yet to provide a solution for now , dachau and the other sites are trying to work as effectively as possible .
lüttgenau said the buchenwald site had exhausted all savings measures .
but it was n't enough to address the needs of its half a million visitors per year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many youth groups visit former concentration camps , such as sachsenhausen " we can not attend to the growing demand for educational services , such as accompanying groups through the site , " lüttgenau said .
it has had to turn down 30 to 40 percent of such inquiries . " considering the need for more educational youth work in eastern germany , this is a dramatic situation , " lüttgenau said .
" the interest is there and we ca n't fulfill it . " the german government has said it is working on a new concept for financing the concentration camp memorial sites in germany .

but critics are warning of a bureaucratic monster . the head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- kurt beck said he wants to make it easier for employees to take a stake in german companies . according to an spd plan , employees could buy shares in a so-called " germany fund , " whose assets participating companies could access for capital .
the companies would then direct their dividends , interest and repayments back to employees who paid into the fund . beck said the spd model minimized the risk of market fluctuations or company bankruptcies since the fund would be widely spread . " if the german fund owns shares for example in 1,000 companies , it wo n't collapse if two go bankrupt , " beck said in an interview with the latest issue of the weekly newsmagazine s tern . three-way deal the germany fund would be a three-way deal between employer , employee and fund .
it would be promoted by government subsidies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business is booming for many german companies married couples with an annual gross income of up to 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 53,800 -rrb- and singles with income of up to 20,000 euros would be able to invest up to 400 euros per year in the fund .
according to beck 's concept , the government would subsidize this with a further 20 percent , or 80 euros . in addition , companies could give their employees shares in the fund worth a maximum of 240 euros per year tax-free .
a federal guarantee would protect the funds from insolvency . beck said the spd wanted to push through the plan in the second half of this legislative period .
he said he would present his concept to chancellor angela merkel at a cabinet meeting in august . cdu has its own plan both the spd and its center-right coalition partner , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , have been working on concepts for employee shareholding for some time .
both want a model that allows employees to profit if their company is doing well - without risks that are too high . the cdu will be presenting its model for employee investment on friday .
the party 's general secretary ronald pofalla said that beck 's proposal went in the direction of the cdu 's . " we want more employee participation in earnings and capital , " pofalla said , adding that it was also a way to make companies more productive and competitive . fund could become a bureaucratic monster there has , however , been criticism from the private sector .
the head of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt , said beck 's proposal went in the wrong direction .
it was contrary to the actual character of capital participation , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundt is skeptical of the fund 's potential " it 's more than questionable how the benefits of equity participation are supposed to work when a national , bureaucratic fund is connecting the employees involved and their companies , " hundt said . klaus zimmermann , head of the reputable german institute for economic research diw , called the concept " nothing more than a state-run , subsidized and government secured investment for an equity fund . "
he told the daily neue osnabrücker zeitung that it was problematic to create new subsidies for such a concept . according to stern , the powerful labor unions dgb and ig metall were involved in developing the spd concept .

but critics are warning of a bureaucratic monster . the head of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- kurt beck said he wants to make it easier for employees to take a stake in german companies . according to an spd plan , employees could buy shares in a so-called " germany fund , " whose assets participating companies could access for capital .
the companies would then direct their dividends , interest and repayments back to employees who paid into the fund . beck said the spd model minimized the risk of market fluctuations or company bankruptcies since the fund would be widely spread . " if the german fund owns shares for example in 1,000 companies , it wo n't collapse if two go bankrupt , " beck said in an interview with the latest issue of the weekly newsmagazine s tern . three-way deal the germany fund would be a three-way deal between employer , employee and fund .
it would be promoted by government subsidies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business is booming for many german companies married couples with an annual gross income of up to 40,000 euros -lrb- $ 53,800 -rrb- and singles with income of up to 20,000 euros would be able to invest up to 400 euros per year in the fund .
according to beck 's concept , the government would subsidize this with a further 20 percent , or 80 euros . in addition , companies could give their employees shares in the fund worth a maximum of 240 euros per year tax-free .
a federal guarantee would protect the funds from insolvency . beck said the spd wanted to push through the plan in the second half of this legislative period .
he said he would present his concept to chancellor angela merkel at a cabinet meeting in august . cdu has its own plan both the spd and its center-right coalition partner , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , have been working on concepts for employee shareholding for some time .
both want a model that allows employees to profit if their company is doing well - without risks that are too high . the cdu will be presenting its model for employee investment on friday .
the party 's general secretary ronald pofalla said that beck 's proposal went in the direction of the cdu 's . " we want more employee participation in earnings and capital , " pofalla said , adding that it was also a way to make companies more productive and competitive . fund could become a bureaucratic monster there has , however , been criticism from the private sector .
the head of the confederation of german employers ' associations , dieter hundt , said beck 's proposal went in the wrong direction .
it was contrary to the actual character of capital participation , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundt is skeptical of the fund 's potential " it 's more than questionable how the benefits of equity participation are supposed to work when a national , bureaucratic fund is connecting the employees involved and their companies , " hundt said . klaus zimmermann , head of the reputable german institute for economic research diw , called the concept " nothing more than a state-run , subsidized and government secured investment for an equity fund . "
he told the daily neue osnabrücker zeitung that it was problematic to create new subsidies for such a concept . according to stern , the powerful labor unions dgb and ig metall were involved in developing the spd concept .
up to now , unions have been very skeptical about developing capital investments by employees due to fluctuating stock prices and the risk of insolvency . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in many ways , he says , it is already here . web 2.0 is a term coined by o ’ reilly in 2003 to refer to the second generation of web applications .
based on collaboration and sharing among users , they include sites like facebook and wikipedia .
o ’ reilly lives and works in the small town of sebastopol , about a two-hour drive north of san francisco .
christina bergmann traveled there to talk to him about his work . mr. o ’ reilly , what exactly is web 2.0 ? web 2.0 is about applications that use the network as a platform .
the first of step is to build applications that learn from their users so that the more people use them , the better they get .
web 2.0 is based on the collective intelligence of the users . that means that a lot of users have to be involved .
does web 2.0 represent a more democratic form of the internet ? i think that the next technology markets will be open and democratic .
there 's a lot of excitement around .
the hurdles we 're facing are n't all that big , and everyone can take part .
over time the power of small groups of users will decrease .
i think this is the phase the internet is in now . so we are now in the middle of web 2.0 .
what comes next – web 3.0 ? the term web 2.0 gives the impression that a web 3.0 is coming .
but i 'm not sure that the next technology boom will be attached to the world wide web .
we still think primarily about interacting with a computer as typing on a keyboard and looking at a screen .
but increasingly computers are fading into the background . there are lots of different ways in which computing interfaces are changing .
first of all there is the use of handheld devices or cell phones as a platform . think about how cameras are increasingly being equipped with gps .
now , when you take a photograph , the location of that photograph will automatically be a part of the data uploaded to a web 2.0 application like flickr .
all of a sudden the global brain is learning something that we did not actually explicitly tell it . that means that something will be created by this community ? yes , but people wo n't know they 're doing it .
we 're heading in the direction of artificial intelligence .
of course there is still a person telling the program what to do .
we 're putting more and more information into the global network , and people are writing programs that create even more connections .
it is as though the synapses of a collective brain are growing .
i think we should expect some surprises . but if people are n't aware of what is happening to their data , doesn ’ t that create a conflict with their right to privacy ? i think a lot of concerns about privacy will come up in the further development of web 2.0 .
but i think it 's really important to understand that people are willing to trade privacy for perceived benefit .
i also think that the net gets a bit of a bad rap with regards to privacy .
when you use a credit card , for example , you 're revealing all kinds of very private information about yourself .
people do n't make a big fuss about that . are we looking at two societies – one that has access to the internet and one that remains locked out ? with time i think that more people will have access to these technologies .
the internet will become more present – that means it will be accessible via telephone but also from different devices . we think there are a billion computers out there .
but really there is only one .
that is what web 2.0 is about – getting stitched together .

christina bergmann traveled there to talk to him about his work . mr. o ’ reilly , what exactly is web 2.0 ? web 2.0 is about applications that use the network as a platform .
the first of step is to build applications that learn from their users so that the more people use them , the better they get .
web 2.0 is based on the collective intelligence of the users . that means that a lot of users have to be involved .
does web 2.0 represent a more democratic form of the internet ? i think that the next technology markets will be open and democratic .
there 's a lot of excitement around .
the hurdles we 're facing are n't all that big , and everyone can take part .
over time the power of small groups of users will decrease .
i think this is the phase the internet is in now . so we are now in the middle of web 2.0 .
what comes next – web 3.0 ? the term web 2.0 gives the impression that a web 3.0 is coming .
but i 'm not sure that the next technology boom will be attached to the world wide web .
we still think primarily about interacting with a computer as typing on a keyboard and looking at a screen .
but increasingly computers are fading into the background . there are lots of different ways in which computing interfaces are changing .
first of all there is the use of handheld devices or cell phones as a platform . think about how cameras are increasingly being equipped with gps .
now , when you take a photograph , the location of that photograph will automatically be a part of the data uploaded to a web 2.0 application like flickr .
all of a sudden the global brain is learning something that we did not actually explicitly tell it . that means that something will be created by this community ? yes , but people wo n't know they 're doing it .
we 're heading in the direction of artificial intelligence .
of course there is still a person telling the program what to do .
we 're putting more and more information into the global network , and people are writing programs that create even more connections .
it is as though the synapses of a collective brain are growing .
i think we should expect some surprises . but if people are n't aware of what is happening to their data , doesn ’ t that create a conflict with their right to privacy ? i think a lot of concerns about privacy will come up in the further development of web 2.0 .
but i think it 's really important to understand that people are willing to trade privacy for perceived benefit .
i also think that the net gets a bit of a bad rap with regards to privacy .
when you use a credit card , for example , you 're revealing all kinds of very private information about yourself .
people do n't make a big fuss about that . are we looking at two societies – one that has access to the internet and one that remains locked out ? with time i think that more people will have access to these technologies .
the internet will become more present – that means it will be accessible via telephone but also from different devices . we think there are a billion computers out there .
but really there is only one .
that is what web 2.0 is about – getting stitched together .
and what we think of as a computer today – a stand-alone device – is just an access point to the global electronic brain that we 're building . christina bergmann interviewed tim o 'reilly -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in many ways , he says , it is already here . web 2.0 is a term coined by o ’ reilly in 2003 to refer to the second generation of web applications .
based on collaboration and sharing among users , they include sites like facebook and wikipedia .
o ’ reilly lives and works in the small town of sebastopol , about a two-hour drive north of san francisco .
christina bergmann traveled there to talk to him about his work . mr. o ’ reilly , what exactly is web 2.0 ? web 2.0 is about applications that use the network as a platform .
the first of step is to build applications that learn from their users so that the more people use them , the better they get .
web 2.0 is based on the collective intelligence of the users . that means that a lot of users have to be involved .
does web 2.0 represent a more democratic form of the internet ? i think that the next technology markets will be open and democratic .
there 's a lot of excitement around .
the hurdles we 're facing are n't all that big , and everyone can take part .
over time the power of small groups of users will decrease .
i think this is the phase the internet is in now . so we are now in the middle of web 2.0 .
what comes next – web 3.0 ? the term web 2.0 gives the impression that a web 3.0 is coming .
but i 'm not sure that the next technology boom will be attached to the world wide web .
we still think primarily about interacting with a computer as typing on a keyboard and looking at a screen .
but increasingly computers are fading into the background . there are lots of different ways in which computing interfaces are changing .
first of all there is the use of handheld devices or cell phones as a platform . think about how cameras are increasingly being equipped with gps .
now , when you take a photograph , the location of that photograph will automatically be a part of the data uploaded to a web 2.0 application like flickr .
all of a sudden the global brain is learning something that we did not actually explicitly tell it . that means that something will be created by this community ? yes , but people wo n't know they 're doing it .
we 're heading in the direction of artificial intelligence .
of course there is still a person telling the program what to do .
we 're putting more and more information into the global network , and people are writing programs that create even more connections .
it is as though the synapses of a collective brain are growing .
i think we should expect some surprises . but if people are n't aware of what is happening to their data , doesn ’ t that create a conflict with their right to privacy ? i think a lot of concerns about privacy will come up in the further development of web 2.0 .
but i think it 's really important to understand that people are willing to trade privacy for perceived benefit .
i also think that the net gets a bit of a bad rap with regards to privacy .
when you use a credit card , for example , you 're revealing all kinds of very private information about yourself .
people do n't make a big fuss about that . are we looking at two societies – one that has access to the internet and one that remains locked out ? with time i think that more people will have access to these technologies .
the internet will become more present – that means it will be accessible via telephone but also from different devices . we think there are a billion computers out there .
but really there is only one .
that is what web 2.0 is about – getting stitched together .
and what we think of as a computer today – a stand-alone device – is just an access point to the global electronic brain that we 're building . christina bergmann interviewed tim o 'reilly -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are calling for more political responsibility to ensure that they can continue to fulfill their educational task . the dachau concentration camp memorial site near munich receives over 800,000 visitors per year .
internationally , it is among the best-known sites commemorating the memory of the millions who perished in the holocaust in europe . but faced with an acute cash crunch , memorial centers strewn across germany , dachau included , are increasingly struggling to carry out their primary task : educating future generations about the horrors of the holocaust and the valuable lessons they hold for humanity . barbara distel , director of the dachau memorial site said its education department can not meet all requests for tours or other educational offers . " the situation in dachau is unsatisfactory , " distel said .
the center only has one full-time educator . other major sites report of similar problems .
the foundation managing the memorials at sachsenhausen , ravensbrück and brandenburg in eastern germany said funding was only enough to cover operating costs .
buchenwald , also in eastern germany , has had to work with a capped budget since 1998 , despite the increase in costs . " our back is to the wall , " said rikola-gunnar lüttgenau , deputy director of the buchenwald memorial foundation .
he said the center did not have the means to revise existing permanent exhibitions or conduct youth projects , for example .
the latter could only be financed through external sources , such as other foundations . charging entrance fees for concentration camps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops who liberated dachau were horrified by what they found the president of the international dachau committee , pieter dietz de loos last month sparked a debate on whether memorial sites should introduce entrance fees to alleviate these financial problems .
the committee was founded by former prisoners following world war two and played a decisive role in setting up the memorial site at dachau .
it does not , however , contribute to the site 's funding . " the committee will be broke in five years , " said dietz de loos , a dutch attorney and son of a dachau prisoner , at the camp 's liberation ceremony in may . but the proposal to charge entry fees for concentration camps has sparked unease among many . " i can not imagine that visitors to dachau will have to pay an entrance fee , " said distel . according to the central council of jews in germany , those sites where history occurred had to be accessible to everyone . " it is only through these concrete places that visitors can thoroughly experience for themselves the presence of historical events , " the council 's vice-president salomon korn told jewish weekly jüdische allgemeine .
" such a visual link of history and an authentic place serves to reinforce and deepen remembrance . " entrance fees would only undermine this , korn said . private investors holding back american philanthropist ronald lauder set up and finances a project to preserve europe 's most notorious concentration camp , auschwitz , in present day poland . but some point out that in germany , private investors remain reluctant to do the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn says historical sites need to be maintained korn said german companies were " elegantly refraining " from contributing to financing , despite " a moral obligation and responsibility " to maintain these memorial sites . buchenwald 's lüttgenau said this was due to industry concerns that any backing could be misunderstood . " private companies fear that support for our educational work would be equal to an admission of guilt , " lüttgenau said . sites are germany 's responsibility distel said the government carried the responsibility for the memorial sites in germany .
the bavarian state government 's ministry of culture finances dachau , for example .
according to a spokesman , it provides the memorial site with some 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- annually for personnel and material costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other camp is more associated with the horrors of the holocaust than auschwitz " i consider it to be germany 's political and cultural task to ensure that these sites are equipped in a way that they can adequately work , " distel said . this view was shared by korn .
he said it was not the memorial sites ' obligation , but rather that of those politically responsible to ensure that the memory of these camps stayed alive . " the federal and state governments are obliged to ensure that everyone has access to these sites , which represent the darkest part of german history , " korn said . thomas lutz of the topography of terror foundation said , though , that it was not clear whether the political support necessary was present . " the only chance now is to make it publicly clear that there is a significant gap between the demands on the memorial sites and their ability to fulfill these , " said lutz , who heads the foundation 's department for memorial sites . german government has yet to provide a solution for now , dachau and the other sites are trying to work as effectively as possible .
lüttgenau said the buchenwald site had exhausted all savings measures .
but it was n't enough to address the needs of its half a million visitors per year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many youth groups visit former concentration camps , such as sachsenhausen " we can not attend to the growing demand for educational services , such as accompanying groups through the site , " lüttgenau said .
it has had to turn down 30 to 40 percent of such inquiries . " considering the need for more educational youth work in eastern germany , this is a dramatic situation , " lüttgenau said .
" the interest is there and we ca n't fulfill it . " the german government has said it is working on a new concept for financing the concentration camp memorial sites in germany .
but it has yet to present a model . " we are caught between a rock and a hard place right now , " lüttgenau said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the world wide web as an interactive , collaborative platform for data exchange - best known as web 2.0 - has become , in industrialized countries , at least , a part of everyday life . the internet revolution is showing no signs of fatigue .
millions of people are writing wikipedia articles , reviewing books at amazon , evaluating articles they bought at ebay , publishing their holiday photos on flickr and presenting themselves on facebook .
wherever they are , they are part of a larger network that knows no national or cultural borders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 27.06.2007 opinion : the rise and fall of tony blair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only time will tell if prime minister tony blair will go down in history for leading britain into a war it did n't want or for the successes and fresh ideas he brought britons , according to dw 's irene quaile-kersken . was he really in office for 10 years ?
his departure marks the end of an era .
tony blair had nearly let us forget that great britain was a conservative stronghold for nearly two decades .
the iron lady and the pale john major were hardly history when the young , dynamic new labour leader conquered the middle by forging a " third way " between the traditional conservative and left ideals in 1997 .
he gave labour , the workers ' and unions ' party , a new image and made it a viable choice for middle-class voters by pulling the party away from the left .
the youngest prime minister since 1812 , the kids in 10 downing street had pop stars as political allies .
the era of " cool britannia " had begun .
ten years under tony blair modernized great britain .
the economy has boomed over the long-term .
unemployment has sunk .
the northern ireland conflict , which had gone on for decades , was settled .
northern ireland , scotland and wales have their own parliamentary bodies .
billions have been invested in margaret thatcher 's run-down health system and britain 's debts .
but not everything is rosy in the land of new labour .
there are still long waiting lists in the health care system .
not every privatization can be seen as a success .
and despite - or because of blair 's economic reforms - the gap between great britain 's rich and poor has not shrunk .
but those are not the reasons why blair and his party were punished at recent parliamentary elections in scotland and wales as well as on the municipal level .
blair 's government based itself on an efficient pr machine that mastered the art of the spin , and distrust among the population grew larger and larger until it culminated with the debacle of the never-found weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
despite massive public opposition , blair led the country into a war whose central premises emerged as false .
in exchange for his support of the increasingly isolated us president george w. bush , blair reaped ridicule and the nicknames " poodle " and " lap dog . "
tony blair never recovered from that .
then there are the accusations of nepotism - blair 's one-time consultant and spin doctor peter mandelson became a commissioner in brussels - and the allegations his party accepted donations in exchange for honors , which may have led to seats in the upper house of parliament .
the clean-cut image of britain 's once favorite son has long been tarnished .
the skirmish surrounding the recent eu summit , blair 's last international appearance as prime minister , also showed that blair could not keep his promise to increase great britain 's integration in europe .
while he himself enjoys , and has had success , being a staunch european on the eu stage , the tendency toward euro-skepticism in the british media and general public has grown in recent years .
only 40 percent of britons still support membership in the eu , according to a recent poll .
in his final days , blair was a placeholder while his successor gained in significance as the one pulling the strings - sometimes behind the scenes and sometimes very publicly .
now blair is leaving the political stage - at least in his role as britain 's prime minister - after a farewell that has taken too long .
it is high time for him to go .
and the british electorate seems to be thanking him for his departure .
for the first time in months , the labour party is ahead in the polls and blair 's successor , gordon brown , once written off as uncharismatic , is coming in well ahead of his conservative rival , the young , dynamic david cameron , who resembles the young blair .
the blair era is over .
" cool britannia " is ready for a change .
first with a new labour leader .
whether blair 's party will be able to stay in power after the next elections remains to be seen .
blair 's spot in history , however , is secure .
but only time will tell if the damage the iraq war did to his image will be qualified by his undeniable successes .

his departure marks the end of an era .
tony blair had nearly let us forget that great britain was a conservative stronghold for nearly two decades .
the iron lady and the pale john major were hardly history when the young , dynamic new labour leader conquered the middle by forging a " third way " between the traditional conservative and left ideals in 1997 .
he gave labour , the workers ' and unions ' party , a new image and made it a viable choice for middle-class voters by pulling the party away from the left .
the youngest prime minister since 1812 , the kids in 10 downing street had pop stars as political allies .
the era of " cool britannia " had begun .
ten years under tony blair modernized great britain .
the economy has boomed over the long-term .
unemployment has sunk .
the northern ireland conflict , which had gone on for decades , was settled .
northern ireland , scotland and wales have their own parliamentary bodies .
billions have been invested in margaret thatcher 's run-down health system and britain 's debts .
but not everything is rosy in the land of new labour .
there are still long waiting lists in the health care system .
not every privatization can be seen as a success .
and despite - or because of blair 's economic reforms - the gap between great britain 's rich and poor has not shrunk .
but those are not the reasons why blair and his party were punished at recent parliamentary elections in scotland and wales as well as on the municipal level .
blair 's government based itself on an efficient pr machine that mastered the art of the spin , and distrust among the population grew larger and larger until it culminated with the debacle of the never-found weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
despite massive public opposition , blair led the country into a war whose central premises emerged as false .
in exchange for his support of the increasingly isolated us president george w. bush , blair reaped ridicule and the nicknames " poodle " and " lap dog . "
tony blair never recovered from that .
then there are the accusations of nepotism - blair 's one-time consultant and spin doctor peter mandelson became a commissioner in brussels - and the allegations his party accepted donations in exchange for honors , which may have led to seats in the upper house of parliament .
the clean-cut image of britain 's once favorite son has long been tarnished .
the skirmish surrounding the recent eu summit , blair 's last international appearance as prime minister , also showed that blair could not keep his promise to increase great britain 's integration in europe .
while he himself enjoys , and has had success , being a staunch european on the eu stage , the tendency toward euro-skepticism in the british media and general public has grown in recent years .
only 40 percent of britons still support membership in the eu , according to a recent poll .
in his final days , blair was a placeholder while his successor gained in significance as the one pulling the strings - sometimes behind the scenes and sometimes very publicly .
now blair is leaving the political stage - at least in his role as britain 's prime minister - after a farewell that has taken too long .
it is high time for him to go .
and the british electorate seems to be thanking him for his departure .
for the first time in months , the labour party is ahead in the polls and blair 's successor , gordon brown , once written off as uncharismatic , is coming in well ahead of his conservative rival , the young , dynamic david cameron , who resembles the young blair .
the blair era is over .
" cool britannia " is ready for a change .
first with a new labour leader .
whether blair 's party will be able to stay in power after the next elections remains to be seen .
blair 's spot in history , however , is secure .
but only time will tell if the damage the iraq war did to his image will be qualified by his undeniable successes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the future of the internet is now germans hesitant to look for love online wikipedia founder : " great ideas come from different places " the internet and everyday life : the constant revolution " the synapses of a collective brain are growing " internet -pipe- 27.06.2007 the future is now großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will computer programs replace the human need for face-to-face contact ?
the world wide web as an interactive , collaborative platform for data exchange - best known as web 2.0 - has become , in industrialized countries , at least , a part of everyday life . the internet revolution is showing no signs of fatigue .
millions of people are writing wikipedia articles , reviewing books at amazon , evaluating articles they bought at ebay , publishing their holiday photos on flickr and presenting themselves on facebook .
wherever they are , they are part of a larger network that knows no national or cultural borders .
" the internet has become a platform , " said technology publisher and web 2.0 guru tim o 'reilly .
millions of networked personal computers are providing access to " the one global , electronic brain that we 're creating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon is not just an online retailer : it draws its customers to participate in product evaluation this collective brain is processing vast amounts of information at an increasing speed .
companies are already using data freely available on the internet to look for and contact their potential customers .
jeff hammerbacher of the social networking site , facebook , asserts that his company does not sell its users ' data , but it negotiates with advertisers what additional analysis can be performed on the very private details that often appear on the site .
web search giants yahoo and google , while claiming to be very protective of their user data , also point out that they follow the law in the countries in which they operate and are obliged to cooperate with law enforcement agencies , when asked to do so .
data collection with no limits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " let 's see who 'll be late for class today " in theory , at least , the possibilities for data collection and aggregation on the web are limitless .
data mining expert and former chief scientist at amazon , andreas weigend , said that if gps signals from cellular phones were available to everybody , his students could , for instance , figure out that he was 15 minutes late for his morning lecture , if they saw his cell phone emitting its signals 10 miles -lrb- 16 kilometers -rrb- away from campus .
if , however , he 'd make it to the lecture hall on time anyway , the police could , as tim o 'reilly points out , also conclude that he must have exceeded the speed limit on the road .
a speeding ticket could easily follow .
social network platforms such as facebook and myspace - in which users set up their own pages , profiles and links to other users with similar interests - ca n't say anything on their own about the actual relationships between two people : would they really get along ?
can they trust each other ?
o 'reilly , however , believes that software applications will soon be able to make decisions in the social realm that were previously reserved for humans only .
if an application can make the decision , which would normally require a face-to-face contact , then it can also decide if it should give out somebody 's phone number to a third party .
additional value through global data collection the development of new technologies goes hand in hand with the transformation of society .
five years ago , people would think twice before writing something intimate on a postcard , well-aware that anybody could read it .
nowadays , personal web logs - or blogs - are filled with publicly accessible , personal information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is one of the driving forces of the internet economy young people , especially , find nothing extraordinary about this .
while benefiting from the added value of global data collection , they are ready to contribute their part .
web researchers agree that digital devices will continue to play an increasingly prominent part in everybody 's life .
in china , says andreas weigend , one million cell new phones are sold every day .
farmers in the country may not have a computer , but they do have cell phones .
" and the government sends them , for example , information about health care on their cell phones , " weigend said .
soon , other devices for accessing information will come into play as well .
smart radios and other wireless devices , for instance , will avoid transmission bottlenecks by reconfiguring themselves to use frequencies that they sense are clear .

" we 'll be surprised " the silicon valley , for its part , has definitely recovered from the 2001 crash .
new startups are launching - although everybody is somewhat more cautious than in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oplc aims to bring computers to the underprivildged it is , however , getting crowded on the internet market .
the big players are already swallowing the smaller ones : google now owns the video-sharing platform youtube , whereas yahoo purchased the photo-sharing site flickr .
this , according to tim o 'reilly , is to be expected in the development of a new technology .
the more participants a network has , the more valuable it becomes .
and those who were there first , profit the most .
what is certain , at this point , is that there is no way back .
it 's hard , however , to make any predictions about future technological developments .

the world wide web as an interactive , collaborative platform for data exchange - best known as web 2.0 - has become , in industrialized countries , at least , a part of everyday life . the internet revolution is showing no signs of fatigue .
millions of people are writing wikipedia articles , reviewing books at amazon , evaluating articles they bought at ebay , publishing their holiday photos on flickr and presenting themselves on facebook .

they are calling for more political responsibility to ensure that they can continue to fulfill their educational task . the dachau concentration camp memorial site near munich receives over 800,000 visitors per year .
internationally , it is among the best-known sites commemorating the memory of the millions who perished in the holocaust in europe . but faced with an acute cash crunch , memorial centers strewn across germany , dachau included , are increasingly struggling to carry out their primary task : educating future generations about the horrors of the holocaust and the valuable lessons they hold for humanity . barbara distel , director of the dachau memorial site said its education department can not meet all requests for tours or other educational offers . " the situation in dachau is unsatisfactory , " distel said .
the center only has one full-time educator . other major sites report of similar problems .
the foundation managing the memorials at sachsenhausen , ravensbrück and brandenburg in eastern germany said funding was only enough to cover operating costs .
buchenwald , also in eastern germany , has had to work with a capped budget since 1998 , despite the increase in costs . " our back is to the wall , " said rikola-gunnar lüttgenau , deputy director of the buchenwald memorial foundation .
he said the center did not have the means to revise existing permanent exhibitions or conduct youth projects , for example .
the latter could only be financed through external sources , such as other foundations . charging entrance fees for concentration camps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops who liberated dachau were horrified by what they found the president of the international dachau committee , pieter dietz de loos last month sparked a debate on whether memorial sites should introduce entrance fees to alleviate these financial problems .
the committee was founded by former prisoners following world war two and played a decisive role in setting up the memorial site at dachau .
it does not , however , contribute to the site 's funding . " the committee will be broke in five years , " said dietz de loos , a dutch attorney and son of a dachau prisoner , at the camp 's liberation ceremony in may . but the proposal to charge entry fees for concentration camps has sparked unease among many . " i can not imagine that visitors to dachau will have to pay an entrance fee , " said distel . according to the central council of jews in germany , those sites where history occurred had to be accessible to everyone . " it is only through these concrete places that visitors can thoroughly experience for themselves the presence of historical events , " the council 's vice-president salomon korn told jewish weekly jüdische allgemeine .
" such a visual link of history and an authentic place serves to reinforce and deepen remembrance . " entrance fees would only undermine this , korn said . private investors holding back american philanthropist ronald lauder set up and finances a project to preserve europe 's most notorious concentration camp , auschwitz , in present day poland . but some point out that in germany , private investors remain reluctant to do the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn says historical sites need to be maintained korn said german companies were " elegantly refraining " from contributing to financing , despite " a moral obligation and responsibility " to maintain these memorial sites . buchenwald 's lüttgenau said this was due to industry concerns that any backing could be misunderstood . " private companies fear that support for our educational work would be equal to an admission of guilt , " lüttgenau said . sites are germany 's responsibility distel said the government carried the responsibility for the memorial sites in germany .
the bavarian state government 's ministry of culture finances dachau , for example .
according to a spokesman , it provides the memorial site with some 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- annually for personnel and material costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other camp is more associated with the horrors of the holocaust than auschwitz " i consider it to be germany 's political and cultural task to ensure that these sites are equipped in a way that they can adequately work , " distel said . this view was shared by korn .
he said it was not the memorial sites ' obligation , but rather that of those politically responsible to ensure that the memory of these camps stayed alive . " the federal and state governments are obliged to ensure that everyone has access to these sites , which represent the darkest part of german history , " korn said . thomas lutz of the topography of terror foundation said , though , that it was not clear whether the political support necessary was present . " the only chance now is to make it publicly clear that there is a significant gap between the demands on the memorial sites and their ability to fulfill these , " said lutz , who heads the foundation 's department for memorial sites . german government has yet to provide a solution for now , dachau and the other sites are trying to work as effectively as possible .
lüttgenau said the buchenwald site had exhausted all savings measures .
but it was n't enough to address the needs of its half a million visitors per year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many youth groups visit former concentration camps , such as sachsenhausen " we can not attend to the growing demand for educational services , such as accompanying groups through the site , " lüttgenau said .
it has had to turn down 30 to 40 percent of such inquiries . " considering the need for more educational youth work in eastern germany , this is a dramatic situation , " lüttgenau said .
" the interest is there and we ca n't fulfill it . " the german government has said it is working on a new concept for financing the concentration camp memorial sites in germany .
but it has yet to present a model . " we are caught between a rock and a hard place right now , " lüttgenau said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the proposal criticizes german car makers for producing fast autos which pollute . chris davies has proposed putting the brakes on speedy sports cars which pollute the environment .

his departure marks the end of an era .
tony blair had nearly let us forget that great britain was a conservative stronghold for nearly two decades .
the iron lady and the pale john major were hardly history when the young , dynamic new labour leader conquered the middle by forging a " third way " between the traditional conservative and left ideals in 1997 .
he gave labour , the workers ' and unions ' party , a new image and made it a viable choice for middle-class voters by pulling the party away from the left .
the youngest prime minister since 1812 , the kids in 10 downing street had pop stars as political allies .
the era of " cool britannia " had begun .
ten years under tony blair modernized great britain .
the economy has boomed over the long-term .
unemployment has sunk .
the northern ireland conflict , which had gone on for decades , was settled .
northern ireland , scotland and wales have their own parliamentary bodies .
billions have been invested in margaret thatcher 's run-down health system and britain 's debts .
but not everything is rosy in the land of new labour .
there are still long waiting lists in the health care system .
not every privatization can be seen as a success .
and despite - or because of blair 's economic reforms - the gap between great britain 's rich and poor has not shrunk .
but those are not the reasons why blair and his party were punished at recent parliamentary elections in scotland and wales as well as on the municipal level .
blair 's government based itself on an efficient pr machine that mastered the art of the spin , and distrust among the population grew larger and larger until it culminated with the debacle of the never-found weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
despite massive public opposition , blair led the country into a war whose central premises emerged as false .
in exchange for his support of the increasingly isolated us president george w. bush , blair reaped ridicule and the nicknames " poodle " and " lap dog . "
tony blair never recovered from that .
then there are the accusations of nepotism - blair 's one-time consultant and spin doctor peter mandelson became a commissioner in brussels - and the allegations his party accepted donations in exchange for honors , which may have led to seats in the upper house of parliament .
the clean-cut image of britain 's once favorite son has long been tarnished .
the skirmish surrounding the recent eu summit , blair 's last international appearance as prime minister , also showed that blair could not keep his promise to increase great britain 's integration in europe .
while he himself enjoys , and has had success , being a staunch european on the eu stage , the tendency toward euro-skepticism in the british media and general public has grown in recent years .
only 40 percent of britons still support membership in the eu , according to a recent poll .
in his final days , blair was a placeholder while his successor gained in significance as the one pulling the strings - sometimes behind the scenes and sometimes very publicly .
now blair is leaving the political stage - at least in his role as britain 's prime minister - after a farewell that has taken too long .
it is high time for him to go .
and the british electorate seems to be thanking him for his departure .
for the first time in months , the labour party is ahead in the polls and blair 's successor , gordon brown , once written off as uncharismatic , is coming in well ahead of his conservative rival , the young , dynamic david cameron , who resembles the young blair .
the blair era is over .
" cool britannia " is ready for a change .
first with a new labour leader .
whether blair 's party will be able to stay in power after the next elections remains to be seen .
blair 's spot in history , however , is secure .

his departure marks the end of an era .
tony blair had nearly let us forget that great britain was a conservative stronghold for nearly two decades .
the iron lady and the pale john major were hardly history when the young , dynamic new labour leader conquered the middle by forging a " third way " between the traditional conservative and left ideals in 1997 .
he gave labour , the workers ' and unions ' party , a new image and made it a viable choice for middle-class voters by pulling the party away from the left .
the youngest prime minister since 1812 , the kids in 10 downing street had pop stars as political allies .
the era of " cool britannia " had begun .
ten years under tony blair modernized great britain .
the economy has boomed over the long-term .
unemployment has sunk .
the northern ireland conflict , which had gone on for decades , was settled .
northern ireland , scotland and wales have their own parliamentary bodies .
billions have been invested in margaret thatcher 's run-down health system and britain 's debts .
but not everything is rosy in the land of new labour .
there are still long waiting lists in the health care system .
not every privatization can be seen as a success .
and despite - or because of blair 's economic reforms - the gap between great britain 's rich and poor has not shrunk .
but those are not the reasons why blair and his party were punished at recent parliamentary elections in scotland and wales as well as on the municipal level .
blair 's government based itself on an efficient pr machine that mastered the art of the spin , and distrust among the population grew larger and larger until it culminated with the debacle of the never-found weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
despite massive public opposition , blair led the country into a war whose central premises emerged as false .
in exchange for his support of the increasingly isolated us president george w. bush , blair reaped ridicule and the nicknames " poodle " and " lap dog . "
tony blair never recovered from that .
then there are the accusations of nepotism - blair 's one-time consultant and spin doctor peter mandelson became a commissioner in brussels - and the allegations his party accepted donations in exchange for honors , which may have led to seats in the upper house of parliament .
the clean-cut image of britain 's once favorite son has long been tarnished .
the skirmish surrounding the recent eu summit , blair 's last international appearance as prime minister , also showed that blair could not keep his promise to increase great britain 's integration in europe .
while he himself enjoys , and has had success , being a staunch european on the eu stage , the tendency toward euro-skepticism in the british media and general public has grown in recent years .
only 40 percent of britons still support membership in the eu , according to a recent poll .
in his final days , blair was a placeholder while his successor gained in significance as the one pulling the strings - sometimes behind the scenes and sometimes very publicly .
now blair is leaving the political stage - at least in his role as britain 's prime minister - after a farewell that has taken too long .
it is high time for him to go .
and the british electorate seems to be thanking him for his departure .
for the first time in months , the labour party is ahead in the polls and blair 's successor , gordon brown , once written off as uncharismatic , is coming in well ahead of his conservative rival , the young , dynamic david cameron , who resembles the young blair .
the blair era is over .
" cool britannia " is ready for a change .
first with a new labour leader .
whether blair 's party will be able to stay in power after the next elections remains to be seen .
blair 's spot in history , however , is secure .
but only time will tell if the damage the iraq war did to his image will be qualified by his undeniable successes .

the proposal criticizes german car makers for producing fast autos which pollute . chris davies has proposed putting the brakes on speedy sports cars which pollute the environment .
the british european parliamentarian and member of the liberal democrats wants all cars produced in the eu to have a top speed of 162 kilometers per hour -lrb- 100 mph -rrb- that by 2013 . " at a time when europe has concerns over its energy security it is sheer madness to allow gas-guzzling cars to be built which are allowed to travel at a dangerous speed which is totally forbidden by law , " davies said tuesday . the speed on most european highways is 130 km / h .
germany is an exception , as many stretches of the autobahn do not have any speed limits .
" driving a car -lrb- faster than -rrb- that is against the law in every country but germany , " davies said , according to reuters .
" it 's nonsense .
i believe it needs to be countered . " driving the speed limit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most european countries have speed limits the german government has consistently refused to consider a comprehensive speed limit on its freeways .
the german automobile industry is strong and driving fast in a german-made porsche or bmw is considered a sacred right by some drivers . " we do not support this direction , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said of the proposal . germany backs other measures to improve road safety and cut emissions including new traffic management technology , congestion avoidance , road tolls and more driver education .
" these are modern approaches , " tiefensee said , adding that drivers who spend less time snarled in traffic need less fuel . cutting co2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants greener cars the liberal democrats ' plan as it was presented to the european parliament also calls for cutting carbon dioxide emissions to 120 grams per kilometer by 2015 and 95 grams per kilometer by 2020 .

some readers think so readers shared their views on this week 's top news stories , from the post-summit state of german-polish relations to germany 's call for the extradition of 13 cia agents and tom cruise 's foiled plans to film in germany . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
repairing german-polish relations after the eu summit i find the opinions of the german press about the summit and poland and great britain unfair and biased .
no one discussed the merit of the proposals .
each country in the eu should have the right to express their opinions and the press should show different aspects of the issue and not to be just a propaganda tool .
unfortunately , i found most of the german press like that even before the summit .
the biased opinions hurt the relations between the countries and personally hurt the friends of germany in poland and in uk .
this is where the values of eu should start . - leszek wojtowicz , poland to be politically correct , we must pretend to be shocked at the wprost cover of chancellor merkel breast-feeding the twins .
but really , this cover does n't put chancellor merkel in a bad light at all .
she is the nurturer and the power figure .
it is the two weird twins who are the babies , completely powerless and dependent .
the chancellor is blithely sailing on , in full confidence and with a great body , to new opportunities to display her new-found powers .
actually , it is a very funny cover , because of the weirdness and fecklessness of the twins .
as i see it , chancellor merkel is presented positively and even with affection , but the twins receive a potent message of disdain from within their own country . - wiley horne , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a two-speed europe on its way ?
i wish to put forth four measures which i believe would do the trick in mending german-polish relations : 1 .
buy up all the low-quality polish meat that russia refuses to allow into the country ; 2 .
force russia to lay the new pipeline through polish territory so that the kaczynski twins can steal the gas en route to germany ; 3 .
applaud and endorse the ban on gay rights in poland ; 4 .
applaud and endorse the professional ban in poland . - luis oliveira , portugal on one side are the countries that want more integration and on the other side the countries that want a minimum of integration .
a block with one speed on one side and split countries on the other side - that is the answer and i think romano prodi hinted that something like that might happen . - gustavo araujo , uruguay i suspect that poland is a country still trying to get used to the idea that , for the first time in over two centuries -lrb- except for the 20 years between the two world wars -rrb- , it is truly free to determine its own destiny .
moreover , many in poland still feel a deep sense of hurt and pain over all the tragedies of the last century .
the best that germany can do is to be as sympathetic to the current mood in poland as possible and not do anything to aggravate the relationship any further .
i believe that german democratic institutions and germany 's self-concept are strong enough to digest this current " chill " in german-polish relations and to prove that , in the end , poland can rely on german friendship even at tense moments such as now . - gary k. taylor , honduras germany calls for extradition of cia agents the agents did a great job when they followed leads dealing with terrorist threats .
why is it okay for osama bin-laden and his group to kidnap journalists and kill them ?
but when the cia follows leads and does what it takes to gets results , the world questions it .
it 's strange the world never is willing to do what it takes to get the job done .
the world always expects the us to fix the problems . - loche , us i praise those men .
they were doing their duty to defend their country .
those who call the us allies should be ashamed of their act . - rafael fermoselle , cuba no , they should not be extradited .
they were doing the jobs that they were ordered to do .
the munich prosecutors are playing to the left for their own personal notoriety . - john coo per , us tom cruise banned from filming in german defense ministry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's the wrong guy for the job , said some too many times we find ourselves complaining about issues that have little or no bearing on content .
i believe the von stauffenberg family should receive assurances that the content is accurate and presented accordingly .
i personally do not believe in the methods or teachings of the church of scientology , but tom cruise is a very good actor and it is my belief that he would do an outstanding job of representing colonel von stauffenberg . - joseph , us two reasons tom cruise should not play von stauffenberg : 1 .
he is too short , 2 .
he is not german .
i wonder if he will fake a german accent or speak like a guy from new jersey . - david worsham , us in the us ' first amendment to the bill of rights , a person 's religion is protected .
do the germans protect religion in their laws as well ?
i am not a scientologist , but i do sympathize with cruise .
in 1940 , if cruise had been a jew , i 'm sure he would not have been able to make a film in germany either .
as harsh as that statement is , it gets to the root of this issue and why the world is so interested in it . - bryan moody , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german politicians disagree over whether germany should focus on attracting foreign workers or on improving the skills of the domestic workforce . the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released a study earlier this week which showed germany had brought in 13,000 fewer legal immigrants in 2005 compared with a year earlier .
other studies have shown that highly skilled german workers are also increasingly attracted to high salaries abroad , which contributes to germany 's brain drain .
in 2005 , the united states , britain and italy had large increases in the number of legal migrants , according to the oecd 's annual international migration outlook report .
the decrease in immigration is bad for the german economy , which needs to attract highly skilled workers to stay competitive , said germany 's education minister annette schavan .
" germany needs to make it clear that we have a very high interest in foreign talent , " schavan said in a recent article in germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
schavan of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said she is n't advocating uncontrolled immigration .
rather , she wants germany to become more attractive for highly qualified , skilled workers .
focus on domestic workforce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's annette schavan while german employers agreed skilled foreign workers are needed , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has criticized the idea .
german workers should get better training and qualifications before looking to foreign workers .
the spd and cdu make up the ruling coalition in germany 's government .
spd general secretary hubertus heil said employing skilled foreign workers is at times necessary .
but employers should focus on educating and training german workers .
abandoning german workers in favor of a foreign workforce " would be fatal for the german economy , " heil said .
schavan said she agreed and believed the current left-right coalition made up of the cdu and spd has already taken steps to help german workers .
" even when everyone in germany is well trained and educated , beyond that you still need qualified specialists from elsewhere , " she said during a television interview wednesday morning .
lowering barriers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a brain drain is underway a new law requires specialized workers from non-european union countries to earn at least 85,000 euros -lrb- $ 114,400 -rrb- in order to get german work and living permits .
cdu politicians have suggested lowering that requirement to 60,000 or 40,000 euros .
small businesses and start-ups simply ca n't pay such a high salary , even for highly-qualified employees , said maria böhmer of the cdu , who is in charge of migration issues in the government .

german politicians disagree over whether germany should focus on attracting foreign workers or on improving the skills of the domestic workforce . the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released a study earlier this week which showed germany had brought in 13,000 fewer legal immigrants in 2005 compared with a year earlier .
other studies have shown that highly skilled german workers are also increasingly attracted to high salaries abroad , which contributes to germany 's brain drain .
in 2005 , the united states , britain and italy had large increases in the number of legal migrants , according to the oecd 's annual international migration outlook report .
the decrease in immigration is bad for the german economy , which needs to attract highly skilled workers to stay competitive , said germany 's education minister annette schavan .
" germany needs to make it clear that we have a very high interest in foreign talent , " schavan said in a recent article in germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
schavan of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said she is n't advocating uncontrolled immigration .
rather , she wants germany to become more attractive for highly qualified , skilled workers .
focus on domestic workforce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's annette schavan while german employers agreed skilled foreign workers are needed , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has criticized the idea .
german workers should get better training and qualifications before looking to foreign workers .
the spd and cdu make up the ruling coalition in germany 's government .
spd general secretary hubertus heil said employing skilled foreign workers is at times necessary .
but employers should focus on educating and training german workers .
abandoning german workers in favor of a foreign workforce " would be fatal for the german economy , " heil said .
schavan said she agreed and believed the current left-right coalition made up of the cdu and spd has already taken steps to help german workers .
" even when everyone in germany is well trained and educated , beyond that you still need qualified specialists from elsewhere , " she said during a television interview wednesday morning .

they are calling for more political responsibility to ensure that they can continue to fulfill their educational task . the dachau concentration camp memorial site near munich receives over 800,000 visitors per year .
internationally , it is among the best-known sites commemorating the memory of the millions who perished in the holocaust in europe . but faced with an acute cash crunch , memorial centers strewn across germany , dachau included , are increasingly struggling to carry out their primary task : educating future generations about the horrors of the holocaust and the valuable lessons they hold for humanity . barbara distel , director of the dachau memorial site said its education department can not meet all requests for tours or other educational offers . " the situation in dachau is unsatisfactory , " distel said .
the center only has one full-time educator . other major sites report of similar problems .
the foundation managing the memorials at sachsenhausen , ravensbrück and brandenburg in eastern germany said funding was only enough to cover operating costs .
buchenwald , also in eastern germany , has had to work with a capped budget since 1998 , despite the increase in costs . " our back is to the wall , " said rikola-gunnar lüttgenau , deputy director of the buchenwald memorial foundation .
he said the center did not have the means to revise existing permanent exhibitions or conduct youth projects , for example .
the latter could only be financed through external sources , such as other foundations . charging entrance fees for concentration camps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops who liberated dachau were horrified by what they found the president of the international dachau committee , pieter dietz de loos last month sparked a debate on whether memorial sites should introduce entrance fees to alleviate these financial problems .
the committee was founded by former prisoners following world war two and played a decisive role in setting up the memorial site at dachau .
it does not , however , contribute to the site 's funding . " the committee will be broke in five years , " said dietz de loos , a dutch attorney and son of a dachau prisoner , at the camp 's liberation ceremony in may . but the proposal to charge entry fees for concentration camps has sparked unease among many . " i can not imagine that visitors to dachau will have to pay an entrance fee , " said distel . according to the central council of jews in germany , those sites where history occurred had to be accessible to everyone . " it is only through these concrete places that visitors can thoroughly experience for themselves the presence of historical events , " the council 's vice-president salomon korn told jewish weekly jüdische allgemeine .
" such a visual link of history and an authentic place serves to reinforce and deepen remembrance . " entrance fees would only undermine this , korn said . private investors holding back american philanthropist ronald lauder set up and finances a project to preserve europe 's most notorious concentration camp , auschwitz , in present day poland . but some point out that in germany , private investors remain reluctant to do the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn says historical sites need to be maintained korn said german companies were " elegantly refraining " from contributing to financing , despite " a moral obligation and responsibility " to maintain these memorial sites . buchenwald 's lüttgenau said this was due to industry concerns that any backing could be misunderstood . " private companies fear that support for our educational work would be equal to an admission of guilt , " lüttgenau said . sites are germany 's responsibility distel said the government carried the responsibility for the memorial sites in germany .
the bavarian state government 's ministry of culture finances dachau , for example .
according to a spokesman , it provides the memorial site with some 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- annually for personnel and material costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other camp is more associated with the horrors of the holocaust than auschwitz " i consider it to be germany 's political and cultural task to ensure that these sites are equipped in a way that they can adequately work , " distel said . this view was shared by korn .
he said it was not the memorial sites ' obligation , but rather that of those politically responsible to ensure that the memory of these camps stayed alive . " the federal and state governments are obliged to ensure that everyone has access to these sites , which represent the darkest part of german history , " korn said . thomas lutz of the topography of terror foundation said , though , that it was not clear whether the political support necessary was present . " the only chance now is to make it publicly clear that there is a significant gap between the demands on the memorial sites and their ability to fulfill these , " said lutz , who heads the foundation 's department for memorial sites . german government has yet to provide a solution for now , dachau and the other sites are trying to work as effectively as possible .
lüttgenau said the buchenwald site had exhausted all savings measures .
but it was n't enough to address the needs of its half a million visitors per year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many youth groups visit former concentration camps , such as sachsenhausen " we can not attend to the growing demand for educational services , such as accompanying groups through the site , " lüttgenau said .
it has had to turn down 30 to 40 percent of such inquiries . " considering the need for more educational youth work in eastern germany , this is a dramatic situation , " lüttgenau said .
" the interest is there and we ca n't fulfill it . " the german government has said it is working on a new concept for financing the concentration camp memorial sites in germany .
but it has yet to present a model . " we are caught between a rock and a hard place right now , " lüttgenau said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with a new structure and a modified legal form , the company wants to steer a different course .
but there are no plans to merge porsche with volkswagen . shareholders at porsche have approved a new structure for the luxury german sports car maker .
chief executive wendelin wiedeking told an extraordinary general meeting on tuesday in stuttgart that porsche would be converted into a holding company . under the new holding , porsche 's operational business will run as a separate full subsidiary .
independently to this , the holding company will manage porsche 's interests in volkswagen -lrb- vw -rrb- .
porsche raised its stake in vw earlier this year from 27.3 percent to 30.8 percent . wiedeking told the meeting that it was important for the shareholders to be committed to this new course .
the some 1,500-strong audience , however , did not directly vote on the changes .
due to porsche 's structure , only shareholders with voting power have a say in the matter .
these are the families porsche and piech . investors also agreed to change the corporate designation to a societas europaea , a company registration recognized across the european union . no marriage planned between porsche and vw wiedeking told the shareholders that there were no plans to merge porsche and vw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw and porsche will operate side-by-side , but independently of one another " not only will there not be ' a marriage made in heaven , ' but no , we 're not even going to have a marriage here on earth , " he said , in reference to the phrase used by former daimler ceo jürgen schrempp before the merger of daimler and chrysler . according to wiedeking , no decision had been made to increase the stake in vw further . " but of course we 're continuing to watch the market to see what 's possible , " he said . wiedeking said , though , that he was still not satisfied with the progress of the restructuring at europe 's biggest carmaker . " the volkswagen group 's cost structures are not right yet and there are still too many blank spots on vw 's world map , when it comes to profitability in individual markets , " the ceo said . new profit record expected porsche said it expected to set a new profit record for the business year ending july 31 . " considering the 10 months of the year so far , it is not difficult to predict that our annual earnings at the end of this business year , will be significantly - and i mean , significantly - better than the 2.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.8 billion -rrb- in the previous year , " wiedeking said . this was due to gains tied to porsche 's stake in vw and to solid car sales . for the upcoming 2007/2008 fiscal year , wiedeking said porsche expected further momentum from the new 911 turbo cabriolet scheduled to make its worldwide debut on sept .

chief executive wendelin wiedeking told an extraordinary general meeting on tuesday in stuttgart that porsche would be converted into a holding company . under the new holding , porsche 's operational business will run as a separate full subsidiary .
independently to this , the holding company will manage porsche 's interests in volkswagen -lrb- vw -rrb- .
porsche raised its stake in vw earlier this year from 27.3 percent to 30.8 percent . wiedeking told the meeting that it was important for the shareholders to be committed to this new course .
the some 1,500-strong audience , however , did not directly vote on the changes .
due to porsche 's structure , only shareholders with voting power have a say in the matter .
these are the families porsche and piech . investors also agreed to change the corporate designation to a societas europaea , a company registration recognized across the european union . no marriage planned between porsche and vw wiedeking told the shareholders that there were no plans to merge porsche and vw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw and porsche will operate side-by-side , but independently of one another " not only will there not be ' a marriage made in heaven , ' but no , we 're not even going to have a marriage here on earth , " he said , in reference to the phrase used by former daimler ceo jürgen schrempp before the merger of daimler and chrysler . according to wiedeking , no decision had been made to increase the stake in vw further . " but of course we 're continuing to watch the market to see what 's possible , " he said . wiedeking said , though , that he was still not satisfied with the progress of the restructuring at europe 's biggest carmaker . " the volkswagen group 's cost structures are not right yet and there are still too many blank spots on vw 's world map , when it comes to profitability in individual markets , " the ceo said . new profit record expected porsche said it expected to set a new profit record for the business year ending july 31 . " considering the 10 months of the year so far , it is not difficult to predict that our annual earnings at the end of this business year , will be significantly - and i mean , significantly - better than the 2.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.8 billion -rrb- in the previous year , " wiedeking said . this was due to gains tied to porsche 's stake in vw and to solid car sales . for the upcoming 2007/2008 fiscal year , wiedeking said porsche expected further momentum from the new 911 turbo cabriolet scheduled to make its worldwide debut on sept .

" for the first time , a berlin court has set limits upon the activities of former stasi officers and their organizations , " he said . "

they are calling for more political responsibility to ensure that they can continue to fulfill their educational task . the dachau concentration camp memorial site near munich receives over 800,000 visitors per year .
internationally , it is among the best-known sites commemorating the memory of the millions who perished in the holocaust in europe . but faced with an acute cash crunch , memorial centers strewn across germany , dachau included , are increasingly struggling to carry out their primary task : educating future generations about the horrors of the holocaust and the valuable lessons they hold for humanity . barbara distel , director of the dachau memorial site said its education department can not meet all requests for tours or other educational offers . " the situation in dachau is unsatisfactory , " distel said .
the center only has one full-time educator . other major sites report of similar problems .
the foundation managing the memorials at sachsenhausen , ravensbrück and brandenburg in eastern germany said funding was only enough to cover operating costs .
buchenwald , also in eastern germany , has had to work with a capped budget since 1998 , despite the increase in costs . " our back is to the wall , " said rikola-gunnar lüttgenau , deputy director of the buchenwald memorial foundation .
he said the center did not have the means to revise existing permanent exhibitions or conduct youth projects , for example .
the latter could only be financed through external sources , such as other foundations . charging entrance fees for concentration camps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops who liberated dachau were horrified by what they found the president of the international dachau committee , pieter dietz de loos last month sparked a debate on whether memorial sites should introduce entrance fees to alleviate these financial problems .
the committee was founded by former prisoners following world war two and played a decisive role in setting up the memorial site at dachau .
it does not , however , contribute to the site 's funding . " the committee will be broke in five years , " said dietz de loos , a dutch attorney and son of a dachau prisoner , at the camp 's liberation ceremony in may . but the proposal to charge entry fees for concentration camps has sparked unease among many . " i can not imagine that visitors to dachau will have to pay an entrance fee , " said distel . according to the central council of jews in germany , those sites where history occurred had to be accessible to everyone . " it is only through these concrete places that visitors can thoroughly experience for themselves the presence of historical events , " the council 's vice-president salomon korn told jewish weekly jüdische allgemeine .
" such a visual link of history and an authentic place serves to reinforce and deepen remembrance . " entrance fees would only undermine this , korn said . private investors holding back american philanthropist ronald lauder set up and finances a project to preserve europe 's most notorious concentration camp , auschwitz , in present day poland . but some point out that in germany , private investors remain reluctant to do the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn says historical sites need to be maintained korn said german companies were " elegantly refraining " from contributing to financing , despite " a moral obligation and responsibility " to maintain these memorial sites . buchenwald 's lüttgenau said this was due to industry concerns that any backing could be misunderstood . " private companies fear that support for our educational work would be equal to an admission of guilt , " lüttgenau said . sites are germany 's responsibility distel said the government carried the responsibility for the memorial sites in germany .
the bavarian state government 's ministry of culture finances dachau , for example .
according to a spokesman , it provides the memorial site with some 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- annually for personnel and material costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other camp is more associated with the horrors of the holocaust than auschwitz " i consider it to be germany 's political and cultural task to ensure that these sites are equipped in a way that they can adequately work , " distel said . this view was shared by korn .
he said it was not the memorial sites ' obligation , but rather that of those politically responsible to ensure that the memory of these camps stayed alive . " the federal and state governments are obliged to ensure that everyone has access to these sites , which represent the darkest part of german history , " korn said . thomas lutz of the topography of terror foundation said , though , that it was not clear whether the political support necessary was present . " the only chance now is to make it publicly clear that there is a significant gap between the demands on the memorial sites and their ability to fulfill these , " said lutz , who heads the foundation 's department for memorial sites . german government has yet to provide a solution for now , dachau and the other sites are trying to work as effectively as possible .
lüttgenau said the buchenwald site had exhausted all savings measures .
but it was n't enough to address the needs of its half a million visitors per year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many youth groups visit former concentration camps , such as sachsenhausen " we can not attend to the growing demand for educational services , such as accompanying groups through the site , " lüttgenau said .
it has had to turn down 30 to 40 percent of such inquiries . " considering the need for more educational youth work in eastern germany , this is a dramatic situation , " lüttgenau said .
" the interest is there and we ca n't fulfill it . " the german government has said it is working on a new concept for financing the concentration camp memorial sites in germany .
but it has yet to present a model . " we are caught between a rock and a hard place right now , " lüttgenau said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we laid the ground for a common future for the european union and overcame the impasse , " she said in her final address to the european parliament before germany 's presidency of the eu ends on saturday . " at the end of the day we did not disappoint people 's expectations and we avoided a division , " she said .
" europe can once again look forward to a period of strength and confidence . " merkel told the deputies that she had anticipated difficult negotiations at the summit in brussels , which saw poland threaten to block the treaty in a dispute over voting rights . if the talks had failed it would not have meant the end of europe as we know it , she said , but it would have had major consequences which would have been difficult to predict . merkel said failure could have led to a two-speed europe , with those in favor of reform pressing ahead at the expense of those who were reluctant to change . new eu treaty the treaty , a key priority of the german presidency , meant the eu was able to preserve elements of the european constitution rejected by french and dutch voters in a referendums held in 2005 . it allows for decisions to be taken by majority rather than a unanimous vote and removes the threat of national vetoes .
there are also provisions for an eu president and more powers to the eu 's foreign policy chief , giving the bloc a bigger say in the world . bildunterschrift : a few high-ranking merkel fans she said the post of a high representative for foreign affairs was necessary because it would enable europe to speak with one voice as it grows more assertive on the world stage . " this is a european political quantum leap , " she said to applause from deputies . the new treaty has to be endorsed by an inter-government conference before it can be ratified and put in place in time for european parliament elections in mid-2009 . the chancellor said she hoped these talks could get underway next month when portugal takes over the rotating eu presidency from germany . licking their wounds while calling the german presidency of the eu a resounding “ success ” , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier did acknowledge that relationships between some in the eu bloc did take a few hits in the past few weeks , notably germany and poland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier speaking in berlin on wednesday speaking at a news conference in berlin steinmeier said that he hoped the “ rough ” exchanges last weekend would be soon forgotten . “ things got quite abrasive and in the long run european politics can not endure that , ” he said . steinmeier went on to criticize the polish magazine wprost for featuring a photo montage of a topless angela merkel breastfeeding the kaczynski brothers , poland 's prime minister and president . " germany wanted to be a mother for poland but she turned out to be a false mother , " said editor-in-chief stanislaw janecki . the magazine cover is just the last of a long line of recent spats between the eu neighbors but steinmeier expressed hope that such disagreements would not continue .

in many ways , he says , it is already here . web 2.0 is a term coined by o ’ reilly in 2003 to refer to the second generation of web applications .
based on collaboration and sharing among users , they include sites like facebook and wikipedia .
o ’ reilly lives and works in the small town of sebastopol , about a two-hour drive north of san francisco .
christina bergmann traveled there to talk to him about his work . mr. o ’ reilly , what exactly is web 2.0 ? web 2.0 is about applications that use the network as a platform .
the first of step is to build applications that learn from their users so that the more people use them , the better they get .
web 2.0 is based on the collective intelligence of the users . that means that a lot of users have to be involved .
does web 2.0 represent a more democratic form of the internet ? i think that the next technology markets will be open and democratic .
there 's a lot of excitement around .
the hurdles we 're facing are n't all that big , and everyone can take part .
over time the power of small groups of users will decrease .
i think this is the phase the internet is in now . so we are now in the middle of web 2.0 .
what comes next – web 3.0 ? the term web 2.0 gives the impression that a web 3.0 is coming .
but i 'm not sure that the next technology boom will be attached to the world wide web .
we still think primarily about interacting with a computer as typing on a keyboard and looking at a screen .
but increasingly computers are fading into the background . there are lots of different ways in which computing interfaces are changing .
first of all there is the use of handheld devices or cell phones as a platform . think about how cameras are increasingly being equipped with gps .
now , when you take a photograph , the location of that photograph will automatically be a part of the data uploaded to a web 2.0 application like flickr .
all of a sudden the global brain is learning something that we did not actually explicitly tell it . that means that something will be created by this community ? yes , but people wo n't know they 're doing it .
we 're heading in the direction of artificial intelligence .
of course there is still a person telling the program what to do .
we 're putting more and more information into the global network , and people are writing programs that create even more connections .
it is as though the synapses of a collective brain are growing .
i think we should expect some surprises . but if people are n't aware of what is happening to their data , doesn ’ t that create a conflict with their right to privacy ? i think a lot of concerns about privacy will come up in the further development of web 2.0 .
but i think it 's really important to understand that people are willing to trade privacy for perceived benefit .
i also think that the net gets a bit of a bad rap with regards to privacy .
when you use a credit card , for example , you 're revealing all kinds of very private information about yourself .
people do n't make a big fuss about that . are we looking at two societies – one that has access to the internet and one that remains locked out ? with time i think that more people will have access to these technologies .
the internet will become more present – that means it will be accessible via telephone but also from different devices . we think there are a billion computers out there .
but really there is only one .
that is what web 2.0 is about – getting stitched together .

they are calling for more political responsibility to ensure that they can continue to fulfill their educational task . the dachau concentration camp memorial site near munich receives over 800,000 visitors per year .
internationally , it is among the best-known sites commemorating the memory of the millions who perished in the holocaust in europe . but faced with an acute cash crunch , memorial centers strewn across germany , dachau included , are increasingly struggling to carry out their primary task : educating future generations about the horrors of the holocaust and the valuable lessons they hold for humanity . barbara distel , director of the dachau memorial site said its education department can not meet all requests for tours or other educational offers . " the situation in dachau is unsatisfactory , " distel said .
the center only has one full-time educator . other major sites report of similar problems .
the foundation managing the memorials at sachsenhausen , ravensbrück and brandenburg in eastern germany said funding was only enough to cover operating costs .
buchenwald , also in eastern germany , has had to work with a capped budget since 1998 , despite the increase in costs . " our back is to the wall , " said rikola-gunnar lüttgenau , deputy director of the buchenwald memorial foundation .
he said the center did not have the means to revise existing permanent exhibitions or conduct youth projects , for example .
the latter could only be financed through external sources , such as other foundations . charging entrance fees for concentration camps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops who liberated dachau were horrified by what they found the president of the international dachau committee , pieter dietz de loos last month sparked a debate on whether memorial sites should introduce entrance fees to alleviate these financial problems .
the committee was founded by former prisoners following world war two and played a decisive role in setting up the memorial site at dachau .
it does not , however , contribute to the site 's funding . " the committee will be broke in five years , " said dietz de loos , a dutch attorney and son of a dachau prisoner , at the camp 's liberation ceremony in may . but the proposal to charge entry fees for concentration camps has sparked unease among many . " i can not imagine that visitors to dachau will have to pay an entrance fee , " said distel . according to the central council of jews in germany , those sites where history occurred had to be accessible to everyone . " it is only through these concrete places that visitors can thoroughly experience for themselves the presence of historical events , " the council 's vice-president salomon korn told jewish weekly jüdische allgemeine .
" such a visual link of history and an authentic place serves to reinforce and deepen remembrance . " entrance fees would only undermine this , korn said . private investors holding back american philanthropist ronald lauder set up and finances a project to preserve europe 's most notorious concentration camp , auschwitz , in present day poland . but some point out that in germany , private investors remain reluctant to do the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn says historical sites need to be maintained korn said german companies were " elegantly refraining " from contributing to financing , despite " a moral obligation and responsibility " to maintain these memorial sites . buchenwald 's lüttgenau said this was due to industry concerns that any backing could be misunderstood . " private companies fear that support for our educational work would be equal to an admission of guilt , " lüttgenau said . sites are germany 's responsibility distel said the government carried the responsibility for the memorial sites in germany .
the bavarian state government 's ministry of culture finances dachau , for example .
according to a spokesman , it provides the memorial site with some 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- annually for personnel and material costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other camp is more associated with the horrors of the holocaust than auschwitz " i consider it to be germany 's political and cultural task to ensure that these sites are equipped in a way that they can adequately work , " distel said . this view was shared by korn .
he said it was not the memorial sites ' obligation , but rather that of those politically responsible to ensure that the memory of these camps stayed alive . " the federal and state governments are obliged to ensure that everyone has access to these sites , which represent the darkest part of german history , " korn said . thomas lutz of the topography of terror foundation said , though , that it was not clear whether the political support necessary was present . " the only chance now is to make it publicly clear that there is a significant gap between the demands on the memorial sites and their ability to fulfill these , " said lutz , who heads the foundation 's department for memorial sites . german government has yet to provide a solution for now , dachau and the other sites are trying to work as effectively as possible .
lüttgenau said the buchenwald site had exhausted all savings measures .
but it was n't enough to address the needs of its half a million visitors per year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many youth groups visit former concentration camps , such as sachsenhausen " we can not attend to the growing demand for educational services , such as accompanying groups through the site , " lüttgenau said .
it has had to turn down 30 to 40 percent of such inquiries . " considering the need for more educational youth work in eastern germany , this is a dramatic situation , " lüttgenau said .
" the interest is there and we ca n't fulfill it . " the german government has said it is working on a new concept for financing the concentration camp memorial sites in germany .
but it has yet to present a model . " we are caught between a rock and a hard place right now , " lüttgenau said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his departure marks the end of an era .
tony blair had nearly let us forget that great britain was a conservative stronghold for nearly two decades .
the iron lady and the pale john major were hardly history when the young , dynamic new labour leader conquered the middle by forging a " third way " between the traditional conservative and left ideals in 1997 .
he gave labour , the workers ' and unions ' party , a new image and made it a viable choice for middle-class voters by pulling the party away from the left .

billions have been invested in margaret thatcher 's run-down health system and britain 's debts .
but not everything is rosy in the land of new labour .
there are still long waiting lists in the health care system .
not every privatization can be seen as a success .
and despite - or because of blair 's economic reforms - the gap between great britain 's rich and poor has not shrunk .
but those are not the reasons why blair and his party were punished at recent parliamentary elections in scotland and wales as well as on the municipal level .
blair 's government based itself on an efficient pr machine that mastered the art of the spin , and distrust among the population grew larger and larger until it culminated with the debacle of the never-found weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
despite massive public opposition , blair led the country into a war whose central premises emerged as false .
in exchange for his support of the increasingly isolated us president george w. bush , blair reaped ridicule and the nicknames " poodle " and " lap dog . "
tony blair never recovered from that .
then there are the accusations of nepotism - blair 's one-time consultant and spin doctor peter mandelson became a commissioner in brussels - and the allegations his party accepted donations in exchange for honors , which may have led to seats in the upper house of parliament .
the clean-cut image of britain 's once favorite son has long been tarnished .
the skirmish surrounding the recent eu summit , blair 's last international appearance as prime minister , also showed that blair could not keep his promise to increase great britain 's integration in europe .
while he himself enjoys , and has had success , being a staunch european on the eu stage , the tendency toward euro-skepticism in the british media and general public has grown in recent years .
only 40 percent of britons still support membership in the eu , according to a recent poll .
in his final days , blair was a placeholder while his successor gained in significance as the one pulling the strings - sometimes behind the scenes and sometimes very publicly .
now blair is leaving the political stage - at least in his role as britain 's prime minister - after a farewell that has taken too long .
it is high time for him to go .
and the british electorate seems to be thanking him for his departure .
for the first time in months , the labour party is ahead in the polls and blair 's successor , gordon brown , once written off as uncharismatic , is coming in well ahead of his conservative rival , the young , dynamic david cameron , who resembles the young blair .

repairing german-polish relations after the eu summit i find the opinions of the german press about the summit and poland and great britain unfair and biased .

each country in the eu should have the right to express their opinions and the press should show different aspects of the issue and not to be just a propaganda tool .

the proposal criticizes german car makers for producing fast autos which pollute . chris davies has proposed putting the brakes on speedy sports cars which pollute the environment .
the british european parliamentarian and member of the liberal democrats wants all cars produced in the eu to have a top speed of 162 kilometers per hour -lrb- 100 mph -rrb- that by 2013 . " at a time when europe has concerns over its energy security it is sheer madness to allow gas-guzzling cars to be built which are allowed to travel at a dangerous speed which is totally forbidden by law , " davies said tuesday . the speed on most european highways is 130 km / h .
germany is an exception , as many stretches of the autobahn do not have any speed limits .
" driving a car -lrb- faster than -rrb- that is against the law in every country but germany , " davies said , according to reuters .
" it 's nonsense .
i believe it needs to be countered . " driving the speed limit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most european countries have speed limits the german government has consistently refused to consider a comprehensive speed limit on its freeways .
the german automobile industry is strong and driving fast in a german-made porsche or bmw is considered a sacred right by some drivers . " we do not support this direction , " german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee said of the proposal . germany backs other measures to improve road safety and cut emissions including new traffic management technology , congestion avoidance , road tolls and more driver education .
" these are modern approaches , " tiefensee said , adding that drivers who spend less time snarled in traffic need less fuel . cutting co2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants greener cars the liberal democrats ' plan as it was presented to the european parliament also calls for cutting carbon dioxide emissions to 120 grams per kilometer by 2015 and 95 grams per kilometer by 2020 .
davies said cars could meet higher standards of energy efficiency using existing technology .
currently , cars in the european market emit 162 grams per kilometer . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the officer verbally attacked a director of a museum devoted to the stasi 's dark historical legacy . the ruling , which was handed down on tuesday , found that former stasi officer wolfgang schmidt had gone beyond the bounds of free speech in criticizing museum director hubertus knabe . in an open letter in march 2006 , schmidt characterized knabe as someone who " could be described as an inciter of the people . "
the concept of incitement has extremely negative connotations in germany since it is often associated with racist agitation under the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hubertus knabe knabe runs a former stasi prison in the hohenschönhausen district of berlin that has been turned into a museum and a memorial for the victims of the east german secret police . the court ruled that schmidt , the speaker of an organization representing self-proclaimed stasi " insiders , " had knowingly spread a falsehood , fining him 2,100 euros -lrb- $ 2,800 -rrb- . continuing controversy knabe welcomed the ruling . " for the first time , a berlin court has set limits upon the activities of former stasi officers and their organizations , " he said . "

they are calling for more political responsibility to ensure that they can continue to fulfill their educational task . the dachau concentration camp memorial site near munich receives over 800,000 visitors per year .
internationally , it is among the best-known sites commemorating the memory of the millions who perished in the holocaust in europe . but faced with an acute cash crunch , memorial centers strewn across germany , dachau included , are increasingly struggling to carry out their primary task : educating future generations about the horrors of the holocaust and the valuable lessons they hold for humanity . barbara distel , director of the dachau memorial site said its education department can not meet all requests for tours or other educational offers . " the situation in dachau is unsatisfactory , " distel said .
the center only has one full-time educator . other major sites report of similar problems .
the foundation managing the memorials at sachsenhausen , ravensbrück and brandenburg in eastern germany said funding was only enough to cover operating costs .
buchenwald , also in eastern germany , has had to work with a capped budget since 1998 , despite the increase in costs . " our back is to the wall , " said rikola-gunnar lüttgenau , deputy director of the buchenwald memorial foundation .
he said the center did not have the means to revise existing permanent exhibitions or conduct youth projects , for example .
the latter could only be financed through external sources , such as other foundations . charging entrance fees for concentration camps ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops who liberated dachau were horrified by what they found the president of the international dachau committee , pieter dietz de loos last month sparked a debate on whether memorial sites should introduce entrance fees to alleviate these financial problems .
the committee was founded by former prisoners following world war two and played a decisive role in setting up the memorial site at dachau .
it does not , however , contribute to the site 's funding . " the committee will be broke in five years , " said dietz de loos , a dutch attorney and son of a dachau prisoner , at the camp 's liberation ceremony in may . but the proposal to charge entry fees for concentration camps has sparked unease among many . " i can not imagine that visitors to dachau will have to pay an entrance fee , " said distel . according to the central council of jews in germany , those sites where history occurred had to be accessible to everyone . " it is only through these concrete places that visitors can thoroughly experience for themselves the presence of historical events , " the council 's vice-president salomon korn told jewish weekly jüdische allgemeine .
" such a visual link of history and an authentic place serves to reinforce and deepen remembrance . " entrance fees would only undermine this , korn said . private investors holding back american philanthropist ronald lauder set up and finances a project to preserve europe 's most notorious concentration camp , auschwitz , in present day poland . but some point out that in germany , private investors remain reluctant to do the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn says historical sites need to be maintained korn said german companies were " elegantly refraining " from contributing to financing , despite " a moral obligation and responsibility " to maintain these memorial sites . buchenwald 's lüttgenau said this was due to industry concerns that any backing could be misunderstood . " private companies fear that support for our educational work would be equal to an admission of guilt , " lüttgenau said . sites are germany 's responsibility distel said the government carried the responsibility for the memorial sites in germany .
the bavarian state government 's ministry of culture finances dachau , for example .
according to a spokesman , it provides the memorial site with some 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- annually for personnel and material costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other camp is more associated with the horrors of the holocaust than auschwitz " i consider it to be germany 's political and cultural task to ensure that these sites are equipped in a way that they can adequately work , " distel said . this view was shared by korn .
he said it was not the memorial sites ' obligation , but rather that of those politically responsible to ensure that the memory of these camps stayed alive . " the federal and state governments are obliged to ensure that everyone has access to these sites , which represent the darkest part of german history , " korn said . thomas lutz of the topography of terror foundation said , though , that it was not clear whether the political support necessary was present . " the only chance now is to make it publicly clear that there is a significant gap between the demands on the memorial sites and their ability to fulfill these , " said lutz , who heads the foundation 's department for memorial sites . german government has yet to provide a solution for now , dachau and the other sites are trying to work as effectively as possible .
lüttgenau said the buchenwald site had exhausted all savings measures .
but it was n't enough to address the needs of its half a million visitors per year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many youth groups visit former concentration camps , such as sachsenhausen " we can not attend to the growing demand for educational services , such as accompanying groups through the site , " lüttgenau said .
it has had to turn down 30 to 40 percent of such inquiries . " considering the need for more educational youth work in eastern germany , this is a dramatic situation , " lüttgenau said .
" the interest is there and we ca n't fulfill it . " the german government has said it is working on a new concept for financing the concentration camp memorial sites in germany .
but it has yet to present a model . " we are caught between a rock and a hard place right now , " lüttgenau said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the world wide web as an interactive , collaborative platform for data exchange - best known as web 2.0 - has become , in industrialized countries , at least , a part of everyday life . the internet revolution is showing no signs of fatigue .
millions of people are writing wikipedia articles , reviewing books at amazon , evaluating articles they bought at ebay , publishing their holiday photos on flickr and presenting themselves on facebook .

the committee was founded by former prisoners following world war two and played a decisive role in setting up the memorial site at dachau .
it does not , however , contribute to the site 's funding . " the committee will be broke in five years , " said dietz de loos , a dutch attorney and son of a dachau prisoner , at the camp 's liberation ceremony in may . but the proposal to charge entry fees for concentration camps has sparked unease among many . " i can not imagine that visitors to dachau will have to pay an entrance fee , " said distel . according to the central council of jews in germany , those sites where history occurred had to be accessible to everyone . " it is only through these concrete places that visitors can thoroughly experience for themselves the presence of historical events , " the council 's vice-president salomon korn told jewish weekly jüdische allgemeine .
" such a visual link of history and an authentic place serves to reinforce and deepen remembrance . " entrance fees would only undermine this , korn said . private investors holding back american philanthropist ronald lauder set up and finances a project to preserve europe 's most notorious concentration camp , auschwitz , in present day poland . but some point out that in germany , private investors remain reluctant to do the same . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : korn says historical sites need to be maintained korn said german companies were " elegantly refraining " from contributing to financing , despite " a moral obligation and responsibility " to maintain these memorial sites . buchenwald 's lüttgenau said this was due to industry concerns that any backing could be misunderstood . " private companies fear that support for our educational work would be equal to an admission of guilt , " lüttgenau said . sites are germany 's responsibility distel said the government carried the responsibility for the memorial sites in germany .
the bavarian state government 's ministry of culture finances dachau , for example .
according to a spokesman , it provides the memorial site with some 1.5 million euros -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- annually for personnel and material costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no other camp is more associated with the horrors of the holocaust than auschwitz " i consider it to be germany 's political and cultural task to ensure that these sites are equipped in a way that they can adequately work , " distel said . this view was shared by korn .
he said it was not the memorial sites ' obligation , but rather that of those politically responsible to ensure that the memory of these camps stayed alive . " the federal and state governments are obliged to ensure that everyone has access to these sites , which represent the darkest part of german history , " korn said . thomas lutz of the topography of terror foundation said , though , that it was not clear whether the political support necessary was present . " the only chance now is to make it publicly clear that there is a significant gap between the demands on the memorial sites and their ability to fulfill these , " said lutz , who heads the foundation 's department for memorial sites . german government has yet to provide a solution for now , dachau and the other sites are trying to work as effectively as possible .
lüttgenau said the buchenwald site had exhausted all savings measures .
but it was n't enough to address the needs of its half a million visitors per year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many youth groups visit former concentration camps , such as sachsenhausen " we can not attend to the growing demand for educational services , such as accompanying groups through the site , " lüttgenau said .
it has had to turn down 30 to 40 percent of such inquiries . " considering the need for more educational youth work in eastern germany , this is a dramatic situation , " lüttgenau said .
" the interest is there and we ca n't fulfill it . " the german government has said it is working on a new concept for financing the concentration camp memorial sites in germany .
but it has yet to present a model . " we are caught between a rock and a hard place right now , " lüttgenau said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a computer-generated image of a typical 19th century jewish street in a polish town " over the past 900 years , our histories have been entangled , " polish president lech told dignitaries and onlookers standing in front of the imposing black marble warsaw ghetto uprising memorial , commemorating the 1943 doomed rebellion by members of the jewish fighting organization -lrb- zob -rrb- .
" there have been good times and bad .
but the history of the polish jews is a part of the history of my country , my nation .
it is a history that deserves being commemorated , " he said .
the land-mark museum is appropriately located in warsaw , " the greatest jewish city in europe " prior to world war ii , kaczynski said .
the warsaw ghetto before the war , poland 's jewish minority numbered some 3.5 million and accounted for roughly 10 per cent of the country 's pre- war population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jewish life in poland was almost completely obliterated by nazis the ground-breaking ceremonies were conducted in an district of warsaw that was at the heart of jewish life prior to the war .
tragically , it was enclosed inside the infamous wartime jewish ghetto created by nazi germany as part of its systematic genocide against european jews .
the nazi german ghettos and death camps claimed the vast majority of poland 's jews .
the number accounts for half of the six million europeans of jewish ancestry killed by nazi dictator adolf hitler 's third reich .
europe was home to some 11 million jews prior to the holocaust .
biblical proportions designed by finnish architectural duo rainer mahlamäki and ilmari lahdelma , the museum 's entrance promises to be of biblical proportions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new museum will be facing the warsaw ghetto memorial a symbolically ruptured facade will open up to monumental undulating walls alluding to the old testament 's miraculous parting of the red sea through which the prophet moses led the jews to escape captivity in egypt to a new life in the promised land .
it is a labor of love for project director jerzy halberstadt and head of the warsaw-based jewish historical institute and holocaust survivor marian turski .
holocaust and jewish history expert israel gutman will supervise the team preparing expositions .
" this will be a museum about life that will benefit dialogue and the future , " halberstadt said , adding that the institution aimed to attract a half million visitors a year .
financed by by the polish government , the city of warsaw and the european union , the project is slated to cost around $ 65 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- , according to news agency ap .
measuring a total of 18,000 square meters -lrb- 59,000 square feet -rrb- , the museum will be one of the largest jewish museums in the world - along with yad vashem in jerusalem and the holocaust memorial in washington dc . dw staff with agency reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the future of the internet is now germans hesitant to look for love online wikipedia founder : " great ideas come from different places " the internet and everyday life : the constant revolution " the synapses of a collective brain are growing " internet -pipe- 27.06.2007 the future is now großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will computer programs replace the human need for face-to-face contact ?
the world wide web as an interactive , collaborative platform for data exchange - best known as web 2.0 - has become , in industrialized countries , at least , a part of everyday life . the internet revolution is showing no signs of fatigue .
millions of people are writing wikipedia articles , reviewing books at amazon , evaluating articles they bought at ebay , publishing their holiday photos on flickr and presenting themselves on facebook .
wherever they are , they are part of a larger network that knows no national or cultural borders .
" the internet has become a platform , " said technology publisher and web 2.0 guru tim o 'reilly .
millions of networked personal computers are providing access to " the one global , electronic brain that we 're creating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon is not just an online retailer : it draws its customers to participate in product evaluation this collective brain is processing vast amounts of information at an increasing speed .
companies are already using data freely available on the internet to look for and contact their potential customers .
jeff hammerbacher of the social networking site , facebook , asserts that his company does not sell its users ' data , but it negotiates with advertisers what additional analysis can be performed on the very private details that often appear on the site .
web search giants yahoo and google , while claiming to be very protective of their user data , also point out that they follow the law in the countries in which they operate and are obliged to cooperate with law enforcement agencies , when asked to do so .
data collection with no limits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " let 's see who 'll be late for class today " in theory , at least , the possibilities for data collection and aggregation on the web are limitless .
data mining expert and former chief scientist at amazon , andreas weigend , said that if gps signals from cellular phones were available to everybody , his students could , for instance , figure out that he was 15 minutes late for his morning lecture , if they saw his cell phone emitting its signals 10 miles -lrb- 16 kilometers -rrb- away from campus .
if , however , he 'd make it to the lecture hall on time anyway , the police could , as tim o 'reilly points out , also conclude that he must have exceeded the speed limit on the road .
a speeding ticket could easily follow .
social network platforms such as facebook and myspace - in which users set up their own pages , profiles and links to other users with similar interests - ca n't say anything on their own about the actual relationships between two people : would they really get along ?
can they trust each other ?
o 'reilly , however , believes that software applications will soon be able to make decisions in the social realm that were previously reserved for humans only .
if an application can make the decision , which would normally require a face-to-face contact , then it can also decide if it should give out somebody 's phone number to a third party .
additional value through global data collection the development of new technologies goes hand in hand with the transformation of society .
five years ago , people would think twice before writing something intimate on a postcard , well-aware that anybody could read it .
nowadays , personal web logs - or blogs - are filled with publicly accessible , personal information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is one of the driving forces of the internet economy young people , especially , find nothing extraordinary about this .
while benefiting from the added value of global data collection , they are ready to contribute their part .
web researchers agree that digital devices will continue to play an increasingly prominent part in everybody 's life .
in china , says andreas weigend , one million cell new phones are sold every day .
farmers in the country may not have a computer , but they do have cell phones .
" and the government sends them , for example , information about health care on their cell phones , " weigend said .
soon , other devices for accessing information will come into play as well .
smart radios and other wireless devices , for instance , will avoid transmission bottlenecks by reconfiguring themselves to use frequencies that they sense are clear .
one laptop per child -lrb- olpc -rrb- - a non-profit organization chaired by mit media lab founder nicolas negroponte - is developing a $ 100 -lrb- 75 euros -rrb- portable computer for children in developing nations as part of a mission to bridge the digital divide between industrialized and lesser developed countries .
" we 'll be surprised " the silicon valley , for its part , has definitely recovered from the 2001 crash .
new startups are launching - although everybody is somewhat more cautious than in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oplc aims to bring computers to the underprivildged it is , however , getting crowded on the internet market .
the big players are already swallowing the smaller ones : google now owns the video-sharing platform youtube , whereas yahoo purchased the photo-sharing site flickr .
this , according to tim o 'reilly , is to be expected in the development of a new technology .
the more participants a network has , the more valuable it becomes .
and those who were there first , profit the most .
what is certain , at this point , is that there is no way back .
it 's hard , however , to make any predictions about future technological developments .
o 'reilly sums it up the best when he says : " i think we can expect to be surprised . " christina bergmann -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german politicians disagree over whether germany should focus on attracting foreign workers or on improving the skills of the domestic workforce . the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released a study earlier this week which showed germany had brought in 13,000 fewer legal immigrants in 2005 compared with a year earlier .
other studies have shown that highly skilled german workers are also increasingly attracted to high salaries abroad , which contributes to germany 's brain drain .
in 2005 , the united states , britain and italy had large increases in the number of legal migrants , according to the oecd 's annual international migration outlook report .
the decrease in immigration is bad for the german economy , which needs to attract highly skilled workers to stay competitive , said germany 's education minister annette schavan .
" germany needs to make it clear that we have a very high interest in foreign talent , " schavan said in a recent article in germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
schavan of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said she is n't advocating uncontrolled immigration .
rather , she wants germany to become more attractive for highly qualified , skilled workers .

the spd and cdu make up the ruling coalition in germany 's government .
spd general secretary hubertus heil said employing skilled foreign workers is at times necessary .
but employers should focus on educating and training german workers .
abandoning german workers in favor of a foreign workforce " would be fatal for the german economy , " heil said .
schavan said she agreed and believed the current left-right coalition made up of the cdu and spd has already taken steps to help german workers .

some readers think so readers shared their views on this week 's top news stories , from the post-summit state of german-polish relations to germany 's call for the extradition of 13 cia agents and tom cruise 's foiled plans to film in germany . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
repairing german-polish relations after the eu summit i find the opinions of the german press about the summit and poland and great britain unfair and biased .
no one discussed the merit of the proposals .
each country in the eu should have the right to express their opinions and the press should show different aspects of the issue and not to be just a propaganda tool .
unfortunately , i found most of the german press like that even before the summit .
the biased opinions hurt the relations between the countries and personally hurt the friends of germany in poland and in uk .
this is where the values of eu should start . - leszek wojtowicz , poland to be politically correct , we must pretend to be shocked at the wprost cover of chancellor merkel breast-feeding the twins .
but really , this cover does n't put chancellor merkel in a bad light at all .
she is the nurturer and the power figure .
it is the two weird twins who are the babies , completely powerless and dependent .
the chancellor is blithely sailing on , in full confidence and with a great body , to new opportunities to display her new-found powers .
actually , it is a very funny cover , because of the weirdness and fecklessness of the twins .
as i see it , chancellor merkel is presented positively and even with affection , but the twins receive a potent message of disdain from within their own country . - wiley horne , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is a two-speed europe on its way ?
i wish to put forth four measures which i believe would do the trick in mending german-polish relations : 1 .
buy up all the low-quality polish meat that russia refuses to allow into the country ; 2 .
force russia to lay the new pipeline through polish territory so that the kaczynski twins can steal the gas en route to germany ; 3 .
applaud and endorse the ban on gay rights in poland ; 4 .
applaud and endorse the professional ban in poland . - luis oliveira , portugal on one side are the countries that want more integration and on the other side the countries that want a minimum of integration .
a block with one speed on one side and split countries on the other side - that is the answer and i think romano prodi hinted that something like that might happen . - gustavo araujo , uruguay i suspect that poland is a country still trying to get used to the idea that , for the first time in over two centuries -lrb- except for the 20 years between the two world wars -rrb- , it is truly free to determine its own destiny .
moreover , many in poland still feel a deep sense of hurt and pain over all the tragedies of the last century .
the best that germany can do is to be as sympathetic to the current mood in poland as possible and not do anything to aggravate the relationship any further .
i believe that german democratic institutions and germany 's self-concept are strong enough to digest this current " chill " in german-polish relations and to prove that , in the end , poland can rely on german friendship even at tense moments such as now . - gary k. taylor , honduras germany calls for extradition of cia agents the agents did a great job when they followed leads dealing with terrorist threats .
why is it okay for osama bin-laden and his group to kidnap journalists and kill them ?
but when the cia follows leads and does what it takes to gets results , the world questions it .
it 's strange the world never is willing to do what it takes to get the job done .
the world always expects the us to fix the problems . - loche , us i praise those men .
they were doing their duty to defend their country .
those who call the us allies should be ashamed of their act . - rafael fermoselle , cuba no , they should not be extradited .
they were doing the jobs that they were ordered to do .
the munich prosecutors are playing to the left for their own personal notoriety . - john coo per , us tom cruise banned from filming in german defense ministry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's the wrong guy for the job , said some too many times we find ourselves complaining about issues that have little or no bearing on content .
i believe the von stauffenberg family should receive assurances that the content is accurate and presented accordingly .
i personally do not believe in the methods or teachings of the church of scientology , but tom cruise is a very good actor and it is my belief that he would do an outstanding job of representing colonel von stauffenberg . - joseph , us two reasons tom cruise should not play von stauffenberg : 1 .
he is too short , 2 .
he is not german .
i wonder if he will fake a german accent or speak like a guy from new jersey . - david worsham , us in the us ' first amendment to the bill of rights , a person 's religion is protected .
do the germans protect religion in their laws as well ?
i am not a scientologist , but i do sympathize with cruise .
in 1940 , if cruise had been a jew , i 'm sure he would not have been able to make a film in germany either .
as harsh as that statement is , it gets to the root of this issue and why the world is so interested in it . - bryan moody , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

world leaders will have to get used to a new face - and style - in 10 downing street . in a brief statement to reporters just before moving into his new home , brown said he taken note of the british people 's desire for change , promising " a new government with new priorities . "
he also said he wanted to create better opportunities for all britons . brown 's remarks came after queen elizabeth ii , in accordance with british custom , invited him to form a government . earlier in the day , tony blair fielded one last session of questions in parliament and said farewell to the staff at 10 downing street before heading to buckingham palace to tender his resignation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair bid an emotional , and lengthy , farewell in recent weeks the 56-year-old brown is expected to announce his cabinet and the rest of his government on thursday . taking center stage despite serving as chancellor of the exchequer for more than ten years under blair , brown remains a somewhat enigmatic figure for many britons .
and some question whether the scotsman will ever completely emerge from his telegenic predecessor 's shadow . brown may have promised change , but few people expect him , in the short term , to make any major domestic-policy reversals - especially as britain enjoyed an extended period of economic growth under the blair government .
but there has been some speculation that brown may be somewhat more liberal on spending as prime minister than he was as chancellor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and brown did n't always see eye-eo-eye more interesting , perhaps , is the course brown will take regarding foreign policy and , in particular , the iraq war .
although brown has said he still supports the us-led campaign in iraq , some observers expect him to take a somewhat more skeptical approach toward washington than blair . brown 's appointment ends one 's britain 's most uneasy , if longest-lasting marriages of political convenience .
once rivals for the leadership of the labour party , brown reportedly agreed in the mid-nineties to put his own ambitions to become prime minister on hold and support blair , who was elected in 1997 . in return , blair purportedly agreed to step down at some point while still in office and clear the way for brown . new partner for britain 's allies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and his wife sarah are the new residents of 10 downing street european and other world leaders were expected to begin congratulating brown personally and in public statements . in a tribute to blair published in a british newspaper on wednesday , us president george bush praised brown , writing that the then prime minister designate " was n't the image of the dour scotsman at all . " but bush was more effusive in lauding blair . " i 've heard he 's been called ' bush 's poodle , " ' bush wrote .
" he 's bigger than that .
we 're working together to achieve global peace in the face of enormous danger .
this kind of thing is just silly ridicule . " blair becomes envoy former prime minister blair was wednesday named special envoy of the diplomatic quartet pushing for middle east peace and tasked with spearheading efforts to create a palestinian state . " following discussions among the principals , today the quartet dealing with the middle east is announcing the appointment of tony blair as the quartet representative , " un spokeswoman michele montas announced . blair 's new role on the world stage was announced shortly after he stepped down after a decade in power . the post of quartet representative had been vacant since former world bank chairman john wolfensohn left in frustration in may 2006 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german politicians disagree over whether germany should focus on attracting foreign workers or on improving the skills of the domestic workforce . the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- released a study earlier this week which showed germany had brought in 13,000 fewer legal immigrants in 2005 compared with a year earlier .
other studies have shown that highly skilled german workers are also increasingly attracted to high salaries abroad , which contributes to germany 's brain drain .
in 2005 , the united states , britain and italy had large increases in the number of legal migrants , according to the oecd 's annual international migration outlook report .
the decrease in immigration is bad for the german economy , which needs to attract highly skilled workers to stay competitive , said germany 's education minister annette schavan .
" germany needs to make it clear that we have a very high interest in foreign talent , " schavan said in a recent article in germany 's süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
schavan of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- said she is n't advocating uncontrolled immigration .
rather , she wants germany to become more attractive for highly qualified , skilled workers .
focus on domestic workforce bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's annette schavan while german employers agreed skilled foreign workers are needed , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has criticized the idea .
german workers should get better training and qualifications before looking to foreign workers .
the spd and cdu make up the ruling coalition in germany 's government .
spd general secretary hubertus heil said employing skilled foreign workers is at times necessary .
but employers should focus on educating and training german workers .
abandoning german workers in favor of a foreign workforce " would be fatal for the german economy , " heil said .
schavan said she agreed and believed the current left-right coalition made up of the cdu and spd has already taken steps to help german workers .
" even when everyone in germany is well trained and educated , beyond that you still need qualified specialists from elsewhere , " she said during a television interview wednesday morning .
lowering barriers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a brain drain is underway a new law requires specialized workers from non-european union countries to earn at least 85,000 euros -lrb- $ 114,400 -rrb- in order to get german work and living permits .
cdu politicians have suggested lowering that requirement to 60,000 or 40,000 euros .
small businesses and start-ups simply ca n't pay such a high salary , even for highly-qualified employees , said maria böhmer of the cdu , who is in charge of migration issues in the government .
" when this barrier is not lowered , the best minds will leave for other countries and germany will empty out , " böhmer said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in many ways , he says , it is already here . web 2.0 is a term coined by o ’ reilly in 2003 to refer to the second generation of web applications .
based on collaboration and sharing among users , they include sites like facebook and wikipedia .
o ’ reilly lives and works in the small town of sebastopol , about a two-hour drive north of san francisco .
christina bergmann traveled there to talk to him about his work . mr. o ’ reilly , what exactly is web 2.0 ? web 2.0 is about applications that use the network as a platform .
the first of step is to build applications that learn from their users so that the more people use them , the better they get .
web 2.0 is based on the collective intelligence of the users . that means that a lot of users have to be involved .
does web 2.0 represent a more democratic form of the internet ? i think that the next technology markets will be open and democratic .
there 's a lot of excitement around .
the hurdles we 're facing are n't all that big , and everyone can take part .
over time the power of small groups of users will decrease .
i think this is the phase the internet is in now . so we are now in the middle of web 2.0 .
what comes next – web 3.0 ? the term web 2.0 gives the impression that a web 3.0 is coming .
but i 'm not sure that the next technology boom will be attached to the world wide web .
we still think primarily about interacting with a computer as typing on a keyboard and looking at a screen .
but increasingly computers are fading into the background . there are lots of different ways in which computing interfaces are changing .
first of all there is the use of handheld devices or cell phones as a platform . think about how cameras are increasingly being equipped with gps .
now , when you take a photograph , the location of that photograph will automatically be a part of the data uploaded to a web 2.0 application like flickr .
all of a sudden the global brain is learning something that we did not actually explicitly tell it . that means that something will be created by this community ? yes , but people wo n't know they 're doing it .
we 're heading in the direction of artificial intelligence .
of course there is still a person telling the program what to do .
we 're putting more and more information into the global network , and people are writing programs that create even more connections .
it is as though the synapses of a collective brain are growing .
i think we should expect some surprises . but if people are n't aware of what is happening to their data , doesn ’ t that create a conflict with their right to privacy ? i think a lot of concerns about privacy will come up in the further development of web 2.0 .
but i think it 's really important to understand that people are willing to trade privacy for perceived benefit .
i also think that the net gets a bit of a bad rap with regards to privacy .
when you use a credit card , for example , you 're revealing all kinds of very private information about yourself .
people do n't make a big fuss about that . are we looking at two societies – one that has access to the internet and one that remains locked out ? with time i think that more people will have access to these technologies .
the internet will become more present – that means it will be accessible via telephone but also from different devices . we think there are a billion computers out there .
but really there is only one .
that is what web 2.0 is about – getting stitched together .
and what we think of as a computer today – a stand-alone device – is just an access point to the global electronic brain that we 're building . christina bergmann interviewed tim o 'reilly -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

world leaders will have to get used to a new face - and style - in 10 downing street . in a brief statement to reporters just before moving into his new home , brown said he taken note of the british people 's desire for change , promising " a new government with new priorities . "
he also said he wanted to create better opportunities for all britons . brown 's remarks came after queen elizabeth ii , in accordance with british custom , invited him to form a government . earlier in the day , tony blair fielded one last session of questions in parliament and said farewell to the staff at 10 downing street before heading to buckingham palace to tender his resignation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair bid an emotional , and lengthy , farewell in recent weeks the 56-year-old brown is expected to announce his cabinet and the rest of his government on thursday . taking center stage despite serving as chancellor of the exchequer for more than ten years under blair , brown remains a somewhat enigmatic figure for many britons .
and some question whether the scotsman will ever completely emerge from his telegenic predecessor 's shadow . brown may have promised change , but few people expect him , in the short term , to make any major domestic-policy reversals - especially as britain enjoyed an extended period of economic growth under the blair government .
but there has been some speculation that brown may be somewhat more liberal on spending as prime minister than he was as chancellor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and brown did n't always see eye-eo-eye more interesting , perhaps , is the course brown will take regarding foreign policy and , in particular , the iraq war .
although brown has said he still supports the us-led campaign in iraq , some observers expect him to take a somewhat more skeptical approach toward washington than blair . brown 's appointment ends one 's britain 's most uneasy , if longest-lasting marriages of political convenience .
once rivals for the leadership of the labour party , brown reportedly agreed in the mid-nineties to put his own ambitions to become prime minister on hold and support blair , who was elected in 1997 . in return , blair purportedly agreed to step down at some point while still in office and clear the way for brown . new partner for britain 's allies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and his wife sarah are the new residents of 10 downing street european and other world leaders were expected to begin congratulating brown personally and in public statements . in a tribute to blair published in a british newspaper on wednesday , us president george bush praised brown , writing that the then prime minister designate " was n't the image of the dour scotsman at all . " but bush was more effusive in lauding blair . " i 've heard he 's been called ' bush 's poodle , " ' bush wrote .
" he 's bigger than that .
we 're working together to achieve global peace in the face of enormous danger .
this kind of thing is just silly ridicule .

" following discussions among the principals , today the quartet dealing with the middle east is announcing the appointment of tony blair as the quartet representative , " un spokeswoman michele montas announced . blair 's new role on the world stage was announced shortly after he stepped down after a decade in power . the post of quartet representative had been vacant since former world bank chairman john wolfensohn left in frustration in may 2006 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also said he wanted to create better opportunities for all britons . brown 's remarks came after queen elizabeth ii , in accordance with british custom , invited him to form a government . earlier in the day , tony blair fielded one last session of questions in parliament and said farewell to the staff at 10 downing street before heading to buckingham palace to tender his resignation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair bid an emotional , and lengthy , farewell in recent weeks the 56-year-old brown is expected to announce his cabinet and the rest of his government on thursday . taking center stage despite serving as chancellor of the exchequer for more than ten years under blair , brown remains a somewhat enigmatic figure for many britons .
and some question whether the scotsman will ever completely emerge from his telegenic predecessor 's shadow . brown may have promised change , but few people expect him , in the short term , to make any major domestic-policy reversals - especially as britain enjoyed an extended period of economic growth under the blair government .
but there has been some speculation that brown may be somewhat more liberal on spending as prime minister than he was as chancellor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and brown did n't always see eye-eo-eye more interesting , perhaps , is the course brown will take regarding foreign policy and , in particular , the iraq war .
although brown has said he still supports the us-led campaign in iraq , some observers expect him to take a somewhat more skeptical approach toward washington than blair . brown 's appointment ends one 's britain 's most uneasy , if longest-lasting marriages of political convenience .
once rivals for the leadership of the labour party , brown reportedly agreed in the mid-nineties to put his own ambitions to become prime minister on hold and support blair , who was elected in 1997 . in return , blair purportedly agreed to step down at some point while still in office and clear the way for brown . new partner for britain 's allies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and his wife sarah are the new residents of 10 downing street european and other world leaders were expected to begin congratulating brown personally and in public statements . in a tribute to blair published in a british newspaper on wednesday , us president george bush praised brown , writing that the then prime minister designate " was n't the image of the dour scotsman at all . " but bush was more effusive in lauding blair . " i 've heard he 's been called ' bush 's poodle , " ' bush wrote .
" he 's bigger than that .
we 're working together to achieve global peace in the face of enormous danger .
this kind of thing is just silly ridicule . " blair becomes envoy former prime minister blair was wednesday named special envoy of the diplomatic quartet pushing for middle east peace and tasked with spearheading efforts to create a palestinian state . " following discussions among the principals , today the quartet dealing with the middle east is announcing the appointment of tony blair as the quartet representative , " un spokeswoman michele montas announced . blair 's new role on the world stage was announced shortly after he stepped down after a decade in power . the post of quartet representative had been vacant since former world bank chairman john wolfensohn left in frustration in may 2006 . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in many ways , he says , it is already here . web 2.0 is a term coined by o ’ reilly in 2003 to refer to the second generation of web applications .
based on collaboration and sharing among users , they include sites like facebook and wikipedia .
o ’ reilly lives and works in the small town of sebastopol , about a two-hour drive north of san francisco .
christina bergmann traveled there to talk to him about his work . mr. o ’ reilly , what exactly is web 2.0 ? web 2.0 is about applications that use the network as a platform .
the first of step is to build applications that learn from their users so that the more people use them , the better they get .
web 2.0 is based on the collective intelligence of the users . that means that a lot of users have to be involved .
does web 2.0 represent a more democratic form of the internet ? i think that the next technology markets will be open and democratic .
there 's a lot of excitement around .
the hurdles we 're facing are n't all that big , and everyone can take part .
over time the power of small groups of users will decrease .
i think this is the phase the internet is in now . so we are now in the middle of web 2.0 .
what comes next – web 3.0 ? the term web 2.0 gives the impression that a web 3.0 is coming .
but i 'm not sure that the next technology boom will be attached to the world wide web .
we still think primarily about interacting with a computer as typing on a keyboard and looking at a screen .
but increasingly computers are fading into the background . there are lots of different ways in which computing interfaces are changing .
first of all there is the use of handheld devices or cell phones as a platform . think about how cameras are increasingly being equipped with gps .
now , when you take a photograph , the location of that photograph will automatically be a part of the data uploaded to a web 2.0 application like flickr .
all of a sudden the global brain is learning something that we did not actually explicitly tell it . that means that something will be created by this community ? yes , but people wo n't know they 're doing it .
we 're heading in the direction of artificial intelligence .
of course there is still a person telling the program what to do .
we 're putting more and more information into the global network , and people are writing programs that create even more connections .
it is as though the synapses of a collective brain are growing .
i think we should expect some surprises . but if people are n't aware of what is happening to their data , doesn ’ t that create a conflict with their right to privacy ? i think a lot of concerns about privacy will come up in the further development of web 2.0 .
but i think it 's really important to understand that people are willing to trade privacy for perceived benefit .
i also think that the net gets a bit of a bad rap with regards to privacy .
when you use a credit card , for example , you 're revealing all kinds of very private information about yourself .
people do n't make a big fuss about that . are we looking at two societies – one that has access to the internet and one that remains locked out ? with time i think that more people will have access to these technologies .
the internet will become more present – that means it will be accessible via telephone but also from different devices . we think there are a billion computers out there .
but really there is only one .
that is what web 2.0 is about – getting stitched together .
and what we think of as a computer today – a stand-alone device – is just an access point to the global electronic brain that we 're building . christina bergmann interviewed tim o 'reilly -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

millions of networked personal computers are providing access to " the one global , electronic brain that we 're creating . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon is not just an online retailer : it draws its customers to participate in product evaluation this collective brain is processing vast amounts of information at an increasing speed .
companies are already using data freely available on the internet to look for and contact their potential customers .
jeff hammerbacher of the social networking site , facebook , asserts that his company does not sell its users ' data , but it negotiates with advertisers what additional analysis can be performed on the very private details that often appear on the site .
web search giants yahoo and google , while claiming to be very protective of their user data , also point out that they follow the law in the countries in which they operate and are obliged to cooperate with law enforcement agencies , when asked to do so .
data collection with no limits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " let 's see who 'll be late for class today " in theory , at least , the possibilities for data collection and aggregation on the web are limitless .
data mining expert and former chief scientist at amazon , andreas weigend , said that if gps signals from cellular phones were available to everybody , his students could , for instance , figure out that he was 15 minutes late for his morning lecture , if they saw his cell phone emitting its signals 10 miles -lrb- 16 kilometers -rrb- away from campus .
if , however , he 'd make it to the lecture hall on time anyway , the police could , as tim o 'reilly points out , also conclude that he must have exceeded the speed limit on the road .
a speeding ticket could easily follow .
social network platforms such as facebook and myspace - in which users set up their own pages , profiles and links to other users with similar interests - ca n't say anything on their own about the actual relationships between two people : would they really get along ?
can they trust each other ?
o 'reilly , however , believes that software applications will soon be able to make decisions in the social realm that were previously reserved for humans only .
if an application can make the decision , which would normally require a face-to-face contact , then it can also decide if it should give out somebody 's phone number to a third party .
additional value through global data collection the development of new technologies goes hand in hand with the transformation of society .
five years ago , people would think twice before writing something intimate on a postcard , well-aware that anybody could read it .
nowadays , personal web logs - or blogs - are filled with publicly accessible , personal information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is one of the driving forces of the internet economy young people , especially , find nothing extraordinary about this .
while benefiting from the added value of global data collection , they are ready to contribute their part .
web researchers agree that digital devices will continue to play an increasingly prominent part in everybody 's life .
in china , says andreas weigend , one million cell new phones are sold every day .
farmers in the country may not have a computer , but they do have cell phones .
" and the government sends them , for example , information about health care on their cell phones , " weigend said .
soon , other devices for accessing information will come into play as well .
smart radios and other wireless devices , for instance , will avoid transmission bottlenecks by reconfiguring themselves to use frequencies that they sense are clear .
one laptop per child -lrb- olpc -rrb- - a non-profit organization chaired by mit media lab founder nicolas negroponte - is developing a $ 100 -lrb- 75 euros -rrb- portable computer for children in developing nations as part of a mission to bridge the digital divide between industrialized and lesser developed countries .
" we 'll be surprised " the silicon valley , for its part , has definitely recovered from the 2001 crash .
new startups are launching - although everybody is somewhat more cautious than in the past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oplc aims to bring computers to the underprivildged it is , however , getting crowded on the internet market .
the big players are already swallowing the smaller ones : google now owns the video-sharing platform youtube , whereas yahoo purchased the photo-sharing site flickr .
this , according to tim o 'reilly , is to be expected in the development of a new technology .
the more participants a network has , the more valuable it becomes .
and those who were there first , profit the most .
what is certain , at this point , is that there is no way back .
it 's hard , however , to make any predictions about future technological developments .
o 'reilly sums it up the best when he says : " i think we can expect to be surprised . " christina bergmann -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the high-speed rail link from berkshire to essex is vital to keep london ahead of rival cities , they said .
" if we do not invest in the future we will pay the price , " said mervyn davies , chairman of international bank standard chartered .
a bill is going through parliament to obtain the authority to build the £ 15bn crossrail scheme .
funding has yet to be secured for the scheme , which would stretch from maidenhead in berkshire via heathrow airport to shenfield , essex , through tunnels beneath london .
the project would create an important communication link for the capital , mr davies said .
" london is doing well as a city and i think if you are going to compete with the leading cities and leading financial centres of the world you need good communication links , " he said .
" that is why crossrail is so important to the future of london . "
mr davies added : " there is no doubt that if we do not have it , we will have future problems . "
the scheme is also backed by trade union leaders and london mayor ken livingstone , who estimated it would benefit the uk economy by £ 30bn if it became operational in 2015 as planned .
mr livingstone has described crossrail as " even more important to london 's long-term prosperity than our victory in winning the olympic games " .

marine hall in fleetwood is out-of-date and despite its many uses - including a theatre and wedding venue - it needs a new look , wyre borough council said .
waterfront operations manager kieran clerkin said : " the marine hall has a lot of potential but there 's no doubt it needs a new image . "
about £ 80,000 has been allocated for the work and it will start on 16 july .
the main areas for refurbishment are the foyer , the cafe and the wyre lounge bar and work will include new seating , flooring and decor .
mr clerkin added : " we want to create a much more welcoming atmosphere for our customers . "
the council says it hopes to attract better professional acts to play there .
marine hall was opened on fleetwood esplanade in 1935 .
