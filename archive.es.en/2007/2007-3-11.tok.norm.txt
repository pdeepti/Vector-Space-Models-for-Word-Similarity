he spoke to dw-world.de about his bundesliga expectations . sosa agreed to leave estudiantes de la plata for a four-year contract with munich reported to be worth 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.1 million -rrb- as of next season . dw-world.de talked to the 21-year-old about what he can offer the bavarian team . dw-world.de : bayern munich has a royal history with a kaiser in franz beckenbauer and a prince in lukas podolski .
now you 're already being called the " little prince . "
where does the nickname come from ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is sosa be munich 's next big thing ?
when i was 15 years old and started training with studiantes , my coach and some teammates at the time thought my style was very similar to enzo francescoli 's .
back then he was the prince so i could only be a little prince .
i think the nickname is funny and i have gotten used to it . are you familiar with your future club ? who does n't know bayern munich ?
it 's one of the best clubs in the world .
an excellent team and a great place to be .
i watched the game against real madrid -lrb- the first of a pair that saw munich advance to the champions league quarterfinals on wednesday -rrb- and was impressed .
it is n't easy to get such a good result in madrid .
bayern showed how good they really are . the team has suffered from missing german captain michael ballack for the whole season .
what do you think of the idea that you will replace him ? ballack is an exceptional player .
that the team misses him is a sign of that .
but i 'm not a fan of comparisons .
i 'm a completely different guy - ernesto sosa , you know .
i am going to offer my performance , my playing style , my drive and my discipline to the club . how would you describe yourself ? i 'm a relaxed kind of guy who always wants to improve .
i put a lot of importance on working hard .
i favor the collective - in soccer it 's not about individuals but about what they can do for the team . it 's not always easy for latin americans to fit into german soccer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sosa should be able to find plenty of affection from his future munich teammates well , i do n't know any people in germany and do n't speak the language so that 's a logical consequence , but it wo n't always be that way for me .
i 've heard that munich is a great city , so that 's good to know . have you had any contact with martin demichelis , your countryman at bayern munich ? i do n't know him personally , unfortunately .
but we do have a common friend and i 've heard through him that i can count on martin 's support .
it 's a nice offer and i 'm glad to have it .
i 'll be approaching him sometime . what is your favorite way to spend your free time ? what i enjoy most is spending time with friends and my family .
i 'm from the country and do n't get to see people close to me very often .
so that makes every moment worth its weight in gold .
i also like to listen to music from where i come from , a " cumbia santafecina " is always like an invitation to start dancing .
sadly , as a soccer player i do n't get as many chances to accept the invitation as i 'd like . daniel martinez interviewed ernesto sosa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitzfeld works the old champions league magic bayern munich 's veteran coach ottmar hitzfeld could barely disguise his excitement after the club he returned to a month ago reached the champions league quarterfinals at real madrid 's expense .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.03.2007 spain unveils memorial to madrid train bomb victims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relatives and friends of the victims of the attacks place flowers at the new memorial a small glass tower channeling light into an underground chamber was unveiled as a memorial to victims of the madrid train bombings , metres away from where the blasts killed 191 people three years ago on sunday . king juan carlos and queen sofia inaugurated the memorial - a glittering cylinder of glass brick - less than a month after 29 suspects went on trial in the attack that ripped apart four rush-hour trains approaching madrid 's atocha railway station . around 1,800 people were injured by 10 bombs , which had been stuffed into sports bags and set off by mobile phones .
one woman remains in a coma and hundreds others are still plagued by medical and psychological problems . on a sunny spring day , relatives of victims and survivors bowed their heads in silence as the king laid a wreath at the foot of the 11-metre -lrb- 36 ft -rrb- tower - its height a reference to the date spain suffered its worst peace-time attack . " a place of reflection " the tower 's architects - five friends working on their first commission - said the design 's main ingredient was light .
sunshine hitting the column of 15,000 glass bricks focuses light into an empty , blue chamber below a busy highway , which the public can access via atocha station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish king juan carlos , queen sofia , prince felipe and his wife letizia look at the interior of the memorial from below , visitors can peer skywards to read hundreds of messages of condolence and support wrapped around the inside of the cylinder . " when the sunlight completely fills the chamber , it 's like an explosion of light .
it 's a calm environment , a place of reflection , " one of the architects , esau acosta , from firm estudio fam told reuters . three days after the bombs , spain held general elections and voted out the conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , a close us ally , putting in its place a socialist government that quickly fulfilled a pledge to pull spanish troops out of iraq . the trial of those accused of carrying out the attacks will hear from more than 600 witnesses and 100 experts before a panel of three judges gives its verdict , probably in early autumn . separate commemorations were held at two other stations hit by blasts on sunday . massive opposition demonstrations on the eve of the bombings anniversary , spain 's opposition conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- organized a new mass rally against the government in madrid after bringing thousands out on the streets on friday evening in 65 towns and cities across the country . the pp is seeking to get its own back with unceasing attacks on the socialist government 's alleged soft line on basque separatism . under a banner reading , " spain for freedom .
no more concessions to eta " , the opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- has billed the protest as the most important demonstration in spain 's 30-year democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people took part in opposition demonstrations over the weekend prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said in the senate last week that the pp could not make up for its own past mistakes by stirring up political trouble against his government .

" there is no cooperation in sight on a strengthening of lebanon 's sovereignty , " merkel said , speaking at a european-israeli dialogue in berlin . " everything is pointing to syria 's not being able or not being willing to take a step in the direction of the great majority of the international community , " she said , adding however that " the door " was open . eu countries currently make up the bulk of an expanded 12,000-strong un peace force deployed last year in lebanon alongside lebanese troops . solana said his visit next week , sanctioned by eu heads of state and government who met in brussels last week for a summit , would be part of a general trip to the region that would also take in lebanon and saudi arabia . he said he had been mandated to take " a trip to syria , to tell the syrians what the situation is ... to tell them we want them to work with us and with the international community , particularly on the lebanon issue . " solana is scheduled to travel to saudi arabia on monday and is also expected to attend the march 28 summit of arab league leaders in riyadh . " a european road map " french president jacques chirac said he " approved without reservations " solana 's trip , adding that the eu official would go to the region " with a european road map " for future relations . chirac , who held lengthy talks with solana last week , said the visit would begin with a meeting with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , followed by talks with jordan 's king abdullah ii and then syrian president bashar al-assad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu forces make up the bulk of a 12,000-strong un peace force in lebanon eu officials had said that syria could not be approached in a concerted way by the bloc until chirac leaves office , which appears almost certain after presidential elections in may . an official with the french president 's delegation confirmed that an agreement had been reached on " the terms of reference of a personal mission by javier solana to go to syria , in the name of the european union . " he explained that chirac felt it was better to have a focused eu approach , rather than rely on attempts to engage the syrians by individual member countries , like contacts made through the german and spanish foreign ministers . eu officials acknowledge privately that they have been looking for a way to resume talks with syria and prise it away from the powerful influence of iran , which , like damascus , holds sway over the militant group hezbollah in lebanon . last week , eu leaders underlined their " determination to reinforce lebanon 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and independence . " in a statement , they " urged all members of the international community to lend their support " to efforts to set up a special tribunal to look into hariri 's killing . solana to press syria to play constructive role on a visit to brussels last week , saad hariri , the late prime minister 's son , accused syria of blocking moves to end a dangerous political deadlock in his country , as saudi arabia works to end it . " i believe that the main problem today is the syrian regime who is trying to stop this agreement , " saad hariri , who is also lebanon 's parliamentary majority leader , said . a european diplomatic source said solana will seek to impress on his lebanese hosts the value of syria playing a more constructive role in areas such as lebanon , iraq and the middle east peace process .
syria has received many iraqi refugees . the eu had finalized a partnership and cooperation agreement with syria in late 2004 , but the deal was frozen without being formally signed . the eu has remained syria 's main donor , giving it around 300 million euros worth of aid since 1995 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel criticizes iran , syria during middle east tour chancellor angela merkel met emirati president khalifa monday as part of her efforts to revive the middle east peace process .

" there is no cooperation in sight on a strengthening of lebanon 's sovereignty , " merkel said , speaking at a european-israeli dialogue in berlin . " everything is pointing to syria 's not being able or not being willing to take a step in the direction of the great majority of the international community , " she said , adding however that " the door " was open . eu countries currently make up the bulk of an expanded 12,000-strong un peace force deployed last year in lebanon alongside lebanese troops . solana said his visit next week , sanctioned by eu heads of state and government who met in brussels last week for a summit , would be part of a general trip to the region that would also take in lebanon and saudi arabia . he said he had been mandated to take " a trip to syria , to tell the syrians what the situation is ... to tell them we want them to work with us and with the international community , particularly on the lebanon issue . " solana is scheduled to travel to saudi arabia on monday and is also expected to attend the march 28 summit of arab league leaders in riyadh . " a european road map " french president jacques chirac said he " approved without reservations " solana 's trip , adding that the eu official would go to the region " with a european road map " for future relations . chirac , who held lengthy talks with solana last week , said the visit would begin with a meeting with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , followed by talks with jordan 's king abdullah ii and then syrian president bashar al-assad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu forces make up the bulk of a 12,000-strong un peace force in lebanon eu officials had said that syria could not be approached in a concerted way by the bloc until chirac leaves office , which appears almost certain after presidential elections in may . an official with the french president 's delegation confirmed that an agreement had been reached on " the terms of reference of a personal mission by javier solana to go to syria , in the name of the european union . " he explained that chirac felt it was better to have a focused eu approach , rather than rely on attempts to engage the syrians by individual member countries , like contacts made through the german and spanish foreign ministers . eu officials acknowledge privately that they have been looking for a way to resume talks with syria and prise it away from the powerful influence of iran , which , like damascus , holds sway over the militant group hezbollah in lebanon . last week , eu leaders underlined their " determination to reinforce lebanon 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and independence . " in a statement , they " urged all members of the international community to lend their support " to efforts to set up a special tribunal to look into hariri 's killing . solana to press syria to play constructive role on a visit to brussels last week , saad hariri , the late prime minister 's son , accused syria of blocking moves to end a dangerous political deadlock in his country , as saudi arabia works to end it . " i believe that the main problem today is the syrian regime who is trying to stop this agreement , " saad hariri , who is also lebanon 's parliamentary majority leader , said . a european diplomatic source said solana will seek to impress on his lebanese hosts the value of syria playing a more constructive role in areas such as lebanon , iraq and the middle east peace process .
syria has received many iraqi refugees . the eu had finalized a partnership and cooperation agreement with syria in late 2004 , but the deal was frozen without being formally signed . the eu has remained syria 's main donor , giving it around 300 million euros worth of aid since 1995 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel criticizes iran , syria during middle east tour chancellor angela merkel met emirati president khalifa monday as part of her efforts to revive the middle east peace process .

" there is no cooperation in sight on a strengthening of lebanon 's sovereignty , " merkel said , speaking at a european-israeli dialogue in berlin . " everything is pointing to syria 's not being able or not being willing to take a step in the direction of the great majority of the international community , " she said , adding however that " the door " was open . eu countries currently make up the bulk of an expanded 12,000-strong un peace force deployed last year in lebanon alongside lebanese troops . solana said his visit next week , sanctioned by eu heads of state and government who met in brussels last week for a summit , would be part of a general trip to the region that would also take in lebanon and saudi arabia . he said he had been mandated to take " a trip to syria , to tell the syrians what the situation is ... to tell them we want them to work with us and with the international community , particularly on the lebanon issue . " solana is scheduled to travel to saudi arabia on monday and is also expected to attend the march 28 summit of arab league leaders in riyadh . " a european road map " french president jacques chirac said he " approved without reservations " solana 's trip , adding that the eu official would go to the region " with a european road map " for future relations . chirac , who held lengthy talks with solana last week , said the visit would begin with a meeting with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , followed by talks with jordan 's king abdullah ii and then syrian president bashar al-assad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu forces make up the bulk of a 12,000-strong un peace force in lebanon eu officials had said that syria could not be approached in a concerted way by the bloc until chirac leaves office , which appears almost certain after presidential elections in may . an official with the french president 's delegation confirmed that an agreement had been reached on " the terms of reference of a personal mission by javier solana to go to syria , in the name of the european union . " he explained that chirac felt it was better to have a focused eu approach , rather than rely on attempts to engage the syrians by individual member countries , like contacts made through the german and spanish foreign ministers . eu officials acknowledge privately that they have been looking for a way to resume talks with syria and prise it away from the powerful influence of iran , which , like damascus , holds sway over the militant group hezbollah in lebanon . last week , eu leaders underlined their " determination to reinforce lebanon 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and independence . " in a statement , they " urged all members of the international community to lend their support " to efforts to set up a special tribunal to look into hariri 's killing . solana to press syria to play constructive role on a visit to brussels last week , saad hariri , the late prime minister 's son , accused syria of blocking moves to end a dangerous political deadlock in his country , as saudi arabia works to end it . " i believe that the main problem today is the syrian regime who is trying to stop this agreement , " saad hariri , who is also lebanon 's parliamentary majority leader , said . a european diplomatic source said solana will seek to impress on his lebanese hosts the value of syria playing a more constructive role in areas such as lebanon , iraq and the middle east peace process .
syria has received many iraqi refugees . the eu had finalized a partnership and cooperation agreement with syria in late 2004 , but the deal was frozen without being formally signed . the eu has remained syria 's main donor , giving it around 300 million euros worth of aid since 1995 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel criticizes iran , syria during middle east tour chancellor angela merkel met emirati president khalifa monday as part of her efforts to revive the middle east peace process .

his adaptation of the günter grass novel " the tin drum , " which was also made in the baltic sea port of gdansk , was awarded a best foreign language film oscar in 1980 . " eastern europe is my destiny , " schlöndorff said . schlöndorff based his latest movie , which premiered in germany this week - two weeks after its polish release - on the life of activist anna walentynowicz , a crane operator whose firing in august 1980 led 17,000 workers at the gdansk shipyard to put down their tools and join a movement that would eventually help topple communism . between fiction and history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlöndorff 's latest movie is based on true events inspired by walentynowicz and led by lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard , millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . despite the obvious similarities with walentynowicz , the film 's protagonist - agniezska - is a fictional character .

" there is no cooperation in sight on a strengthening of lebanon 's sovereignty , " merkel said , speaking at a european-israeli dialogue in berlin . " everything is pointing to syria 's not being able or not being willing to take a step in the direction of the great majority of the international community , " she said , adding however that " the door " was open . eu countries currently make up the bulk of an expanded 12,000-strong un peace force deployed last year in lebanon alongside lebanese troops . solana said his visit next week , sanctioned by eu heads of state and government who met in brussels last week for a summit , would be part of a general trip to the region that would also take in lebanon and saudi arabia . he said he had been mandated to take " a trip to syria , to tell the syrians what the situation is ... to tell them we want them to work with us and with the international community , particularly on the lebanon issue . " solana is scheduled to travel to saudi arabia on monday and is also expected to attend the march 28 summit of arab league leaders in riyadh . " a european road map " french president jacques chirac said he " approved without reservations " solana 's trip , adding that the eu official would go to the region " with a european road map " for future relations . chirac , who held lengthy talks with solana last week , said the visit would begin with a meeting with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , followed by talks with jordan 's king abdullah ii and then syrian president bashar al-assad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu forces make up the bulk of a 12,000-strong un peace force in lebanon eu officials had said that syria could not be approached in a concerted way by the bloc until chirac leaves office , which appears almost certain after presidential elections in may . an official with the french president 's delegation confirmed that an agreement had been reached on " the terms of reference of a personal mission by javier solana to go to syria , in the name of the european union . " he explained that chirac felt it was better to have a focused eu approach , rather than rely on attempts to engage the syrians by individual member countries , like contacts made through the german and spanish foreign ministers . eu officials acknowledge privately that they have been looking for a way to resume talks with syria and prise it away from the powerful influence of iran , which , like damascus , holds sway over the militant group hezbollah in lebanon . last week , eu leaders underlined their " determination to reinforce lebanon 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and independence .

" strike " is not the first movie that german director völker schlöndorff filmed in poland .
his adaptation of the günter grass novel " the tin drum , " which was also made in the baltic sea port of gdansk , was awarded a best foreign language film oscar in 1980 . " eastern europe is my destiny , " schlöndorff said . schlöndorff based his latest movie , which premiered in germany this week - two weeks after its polish release - on the life of activist anna walentynowicz , a crane operator whose firing in august 1980 led 17,000 workers at the gdansk shipyard to put down their tools and join a movement that would eventually help topple communism . between fiction and history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlöndorff 's latest movie is based on true events inspired by walentynowicz and led by lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard , millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . despite the obvious similarities with walentynowicz , the film 's protagonist - agniezska - is a fictional character .
played by katharina thalbach , who also starred in " the tin drum , " she is brave , resolute , charismatic and uncompromising : both a faithful catholic and a convinced communist , a working , single mother on a personal quest for justice . " she 's a picture-book hero , i call her ' the hero of gdansk , " ' said schlöndorff .
" she has no intention of saving the world or even bringing communism down . " " at the same time , she 's a faithful catholic praying to her -lrb- pope john paul ii -rrb- woytila .
it is a story that reminds me of brecht 's ' saint joan of the stockyards , " ' he said . dreamers and politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : true heroism is n't necessarily glamorous in the movie , agniezska is portrayed as the emotional driving force behind the solidarity movement , but also as a modest person who will eventually become overshadowed by lech walesa , the masculine icon of the polish protests . in one scene of the movie , walesa - played by polish heartthrob andrzej chyra - tells her : " you are a dreamer .
and i do politics .
every ship needs a captain . " anna walentynowicz fell into obscurity after the protests achieved their goal and the movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as the soviet bloc 's only independent trade union .
lech walesa , on the other hand , remained in politics and won the nobel peace prize in 1983 . artistic rendering or misinterpretation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solidarity was a powerful social movement while " strike " is a tribute to the rise of solidarity , the movie caused quite a controversy when it was shown in poland last month .
it was slammed as " offensive " by several of the real-life heroes who founded the trade union . " this film does not present the true facts of anna walentynowicz 's life , " solidarity activist joanna gwiazda was quoted by the polish pap news agency . gwiazda said schlöndorff misrepresented walentynowicz as being illiterate and skewed facts about her personal life . joanna 's husband and fellow activist andrzej gwiazda also accused schlöndorff of misrepresenting poles and falling victim to national stereotypes . " the film shows poorly-educated and hard-drinking shipyard workers - it fits perfectly with the -lrb- false -rrb- vision of poles as drunks and thieves , " he said . a spokesperson for walentynowicz said the 77-year-old pensioner was threatening a lawsuit should schlöndorff refuse to cut several scenes she finds slanderous . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the oscar is an unbelievably powerful statue " dw-world spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck about how it feels to be nominated for an oscar for " the lives of others , " his film about an east german spy .

he spoke to dw-world.de about his bundesliga expectations . sosa agreed to leave estudiantes de la plata for a four-year contract with munich reported to be worth 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.1 million -rrb- as of next season . dw-world.de talked to the 21-year-old about what he can offer the bavarian team . dw-world.de : bayern munich has a royal history with a kaiser in franz beckenbauer and a prince in lukas podolski .
now you 're already being called the " little prince . "
where does the nickname come from ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is sosa be munich 's next big thing ?
when i was 15 years old and started training with studiantes , my coach and some teammates at the time thought my style was very similar to enzo francescoli 's .
back then he was the prince so i could only be a little prince .
i think the nickname is funny and i have gotten used to it . are you familiar with your future club ? who does n't know bayern munich ?
it 's one of the best clubs in the world .
an excellent team and a great place to be .
i watched the game against real madrid -lrb- the first of a pair that saw munich advance to the champions league quarterfinals on wednesday -rrb- and was impressed .
it is n't easy to get such a good result in madrid .
bayern showed how good they really are . the team has suffered from missing german captain michael ballack for the whole season .
what do you think of the idea that you will replace him ? ballack is an exceptional player .
that the team misses him is a sign of that .
but i 'm not a fan of comparisons .
i 'm a completely different guy - ernesto sosa , you know .
i am going to offer my performance , my playing style , my drive and my discipline to the club . how would you describe yourself ? i 'm a relaxed kind of guy who always wants to improve .
i put a lot of importance on working hard .
i favor the collective - in soccer it 's not about individuals but about what they can do for the team . it 's not always easy for latin americans to fit into german soccer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sosa should be able to find plenty of affection from his future munich teammates well , i do n't know any people in germany and do n't speak the language so that 's a logical consequence , but it wo n't always be that way for me .
i 've heard that munich is a great city , so that 's good to know . have you had any contact with martin demichelis , your countryman at bayern munich ? i do n't know him personally , unfortunately .
but we do have a common friend and i 've heard through him that i can count on martin 's support .
it 's a nice offer and i 'm glad to have it .
i 'll be approaching him sometime . what is your favorite way to spend your free time ? what i enjoy most is spending time with friends and my family .
i 'm from the country and do n't get to see people close to me very often .
so that makes every moment worth its weight in gold .
i also like to listen to music from where i come from , a " cumbia santafecina " is always like an invitation to start dancing .
sadly , as a soccer player i do n't get as many chances to accept the invitation as i 'd like . daniel martinez interviewed ernesto sosa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitzfeld works the old champions league magic bayern munich 's veteran coach ottmar hitzfeld could barely disguise his excitement after the club he returned to a month ago reached the champions league quarterfinals at real madrid 's expense .

" strike " is not the first movie that german director völker schlöndorff filmed in poland .
his adaptation of the günter grass novel " the tin drum , " which was also made in the baltic sea port of gdansk , was awarded a best foreign language film oscar in 1980 . " eastern europe is my destiny , " schlöndorff said . schlöndorff based his latest movie , which premiered in germany this week - two weeks after its polish release - on the life of activist anna walentynowicz , a crane operator whose firing in august 1980 led 17,000 workers at the gdansk shipyard to put down their tools and join a movement that would eventually help topple communism . between fiction and history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlöndorff 's latest movie is based on true events inspired by walentynowicz and led by lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard , millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . despite the obvious similarities with walentynowicz , the film 's protagonist - agniezska - is a fictional character .
played by katharina thalbach , who also starred in " the tin drum , " she is brave , resolute , charismatic and uncompromising : both a faithful catholic and a convinced communist , a working , single mother on a personal quest for justice . " she 's a picture-book hero , i call her ' the hero of gdansk , " ' said schlöndorff .
" she has no intention of saving the world or even bringing communism down . " " at the same time , she 's a faithful catholic praying to her -lrb- pope john paul ii -rrb- woytila .
it is a story that reminds me of brecht 's ' saint joan of the stockyards , " ' he said . dreamers and politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : true heroism is n't necessarily glamorous in the movie , agniezska is portrayed as the emotional driving force behind the solidarity movement , but also as a modest person who will eventually become overshadowed by lech walesa , the masculine icon of the polish protests . in one scene of the movie , walesa - played by polish heartthrob andrzej chyra - tells her : " you are a dreamer .

it was slammed as " offensive " by several of the real-life heroes who founded the trade union . " this film does not present the true facts of anna walentynowicz 's life , " solidarity activist joanna gwiazda was quoted by the polish pap news agency . gwiazda said schlöndorff misrepresented walentynowicz as being illiterate and skewed facts about her personal life . joanna 's husband and fellow activist andrzej gwiazda also accused schlöndorff of misrepresenting poles and falling victim to national stereotypes .

" strike " is not the first movie that german director völker schlöndorff filmed in poland .
his adaptation of the günter grass novel " the tin drum , " which was also made in the baltic sea port of gdansk , was awarded a best foreign language film oscar in 1980 . " eastern europe is my destiny , " schlöndorff said . schlöndorff based his latest movie , which premiered in germany this week - two weeks after its polish release - on the life of activist anna walentynowicz , a crane operator whose firing in august 1980 led 17,000 workers at the gdansk shipyard to put down their tools and join a movement that would eventually help topple communism . between fiction and history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlöndorff 's latest movie is based on true events inspired by walentynowicz and led by lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard , millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . despite the obvious similarities with walentynowicz , the film 's protagonist - agniezska - is a fictional character .
played by katharina thalbach , who also starred in " the tin drum , " she is brave , resolute , charismatic and uncompromising : both a faithful catholic and a convinced communist , a working , single mother on a personal quest for justice . " she 's a picture-book hero , i call her ' the hero of gdansk , " ' said schlöndorff .
" she has no intention of saving the world or even bringing communism down . " " at the same time , she 's a faithful catholic praying to her -lrb- pope john paul ii -rrb- woytila .
it is a story that reminds me of brecht 's ' saint joan of the stockyards , " ' he said . dreamers and politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : true heroism is n't necessarily glamorous in the movie , agniezska is portrayed as the emotional driving force behind the solidarity movement , but also as a modest person who will eventually become overshadowed by lech walesa , the masculine icon of the polish protests . in one scene of the movie , walesa - played by polish heartthrob andrzej chyra - tells her : " you are a dreamer .
and i do politics .
every ship needs a captain . " anna walentynowicz fell into obscurity after the protests achieved their goal and the movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as the soviet bloc 's only independent trade union .
lech walesa , on the other hand , remained in politics and won the nobel peace prize in 1983 . artistic rendering or misinterpretation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solidarity was a powerful social movement while " strike " is a tribute to the rise of solidarity , the movie caused quite a controversy when it was shown in poland last month .
it was slammed as " offensive " by several of the real-life heroes who founded the trade union . " this film does not present the true facts of anna walentynowicz 's life , " solidarity activist joanna gwiazda was quoted by the polish pap news agency . gwiazda said schlöndorff misrepresented walentynowicz as being illiterate and skewed facts about her personal life . joanna 's husband and fellow activist andrzej gwiazda also accused schlöndorff of misrepresenting poles and falling victim to national stereotypes . " the film shows poorly-educated and hard-drinking shipyard workers - it fits perfectly with the -lrb- false -rrb- vision of poles as drunks and thieves , " he said . a spokesperson for walentynowicz said the 77-year-old pensioner was threatening a lawsuit should schlöndorff refuse to cut several scenes she finds slanderous . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the oscar is an unbelievably powerful statue " dw-world spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck about how it feels to be nominated for an oscar for " the lives of others , " his film about an east german spy .

he spoke to dw-world.de about his bundesliga expectations . sosa agreed to leave estudiantes de la plata for a four-year contract with munich reported to be worth 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.1 million -rrb- as of next season . dw-world.de talked to the 21-year-old about what he can offer the bavarian team . dw-world.de : bayern munich has a royal history with a kaiser in franz beckenbauer and a prince in lukas podolski .
now you 're already being called the " little prince . "
where does the nickname come from ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is sosa be munich 's next big thing ?
when i was 15 years old and started training with studiantes , my coach and some teammates at the time thought my style was very similar to enzo francescoli 's .
back then he was the prince so i could only be a little prince .
i think the nickname is funny and i have gotten used to it . are you familiar with your future club ? who does n't know bayern munich ?
it 's one of the best clubs in the world .
an excellent team and a great place to be .
i watched the game against real madrid -lrb- the first of a pair that saw munich advance to the champions league quarterfinals on wednesday -rrb- and was impressed .
it is n't easy to get such a good result in madrid .
bayern showed how good they really are . the team has suffered from missing german captain michael ballack for the whole season .
what do you think of the idea that you will replace him ? ballack is an exceptional player .
that the team misses him is a sign of that .
but i 'm not a fan of comparisons .
i 'm a completely different guy - ernesto sosa , you know .
i am going to offer my performance , my playing style , my drive and my discipline to the club . how would you describe yourself ? i 'm a relaxed kind of guy who always wants to improve .
i put a lot of importance on working hard .
i favor the collective - in soccer it 's not about individuals but about what they can do for the team . it 's not always easy for latin americans to fit into german soccer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sosa should be able to find plenty of affection from his future munich teammates well , i do n't know any people in germany and do n't speak the language so that 's a logical consequence , but it wo n't always be that way for me .
i 've heard that munich is a great city , so that 's good to know . have you had any contact with martin demichelis , your countryman at bayern munich ? i do n't know him personally , unfortunately .
but we do have a common friend and i 've heard through him that i can count on martin 's support .
it 's a nice offer and i 'm glad to have it .
i 'll be approaching him sometime . what is your favorite way to spend your free time ? what i enjoy most is spending time with friends and my family .
i 'm from the country and do n't get to see people close to me very often .
so that makes every moment worth its weight in gold .
i also like to listen to music from where i come from , a " cumbia santafecina " is always like an invitation to start dancing .

" there is no cooperation in sight on a strengthening of lebanon 's sovereignty , " merkel said , speaking at a european-israeli dialogue in berlin . " everything is pointing to syria 's not being able or not being willing to take a step in the direction of the great majority of the international community , " she said , adding however that " the door " was open . eu countries currently make up the bulk of an expanded 12,000-strong un peace force deployed last year in lebanon alongside lebanese troops . solana said his visit next week , sanctioned by eu heads of state and government who met in brussels last week for a summit , would be part of a general trip to the region that would also take in lebanon and saudi arabia . he said he had been mandated to take " a trip to syria , to tell the syrians what the situation is ... to tell them we want them to work with us and with the international community , particularly on the lebanon issue . " solana is scheduled to travel to saudi arabia on monday and is also expected to attend the march 28 summit of arab league leaders in riyadh . " a european road map " french president jacques chirac said he " approved without reservations " solana 's trip , adding that the eu official would go to the region " with a european road map " for future relations . chirac , who held lengthy talks with solana last week , said the visit would begin with a meeting with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , followed by talks with jordan 's king abdullah ii and then syrian president bashar al-assad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu forces make up the bulk of a 12,000-strong un peace force in lebanon eu officials had said that syria could not be approached in a concerted way by the bloc until chirac leaves office , which appears almost certain after presidential elections in may . an official with the french president 's delegation confirmed that an agreement had been reached on " the terms of reference of a personal mission by javier solana to go to syria , in the name of the european union . " he explained that chirac felt it was better to have a focused eu approach , rather than rely on attempts to engage the syrians by individual member countries , like contacts made through the german and spanish foreign ministers . eu officials acknowledge privately that they have been looking for a way to resume talks with syria and prise it away from the powerful influence of iran , which , like damascus , holds sway over the militant group hezbollah in lebanon . last week , eu leaders underlined their " determination to reinforce lebanon 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and independence . " in a statement , they " urged all members of the international community to lend their support " to efforts to set up a special tribunal to look into hariri 's killing . solana to press syria to play constructive role on a visit to brussels last week , saad hariri , the late prime minister 's son , accused syria of blocking moves to end a dangerous political deadlock in his country , as saudi arabia works to end it . " i believe that the main problem today is the syrian regime who is trying to stop this agreement , " saad hariri , who is also lebanon 's parliamentary majority leader , said . a european diplomatic source said solana will seek to impress on his lebanese hosts the value of syria playing a more constructive role in areas such as lebanon , iraq and the middle east peace process .
syria has received many iraqi refugees . the eu had finalized a partnership and cooperation agreement with syria in late 2004 , but the deal was frozen without being formally signed . the eu has remained syria 's main donor , giving it around 300 million euros worth of aid since 1995 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel criticizes iran , syria during middle east tour chancellor angela merkel met emirati president khalifa monday as part of her efforts to revive the middle east peace process .

" there is no cooperation in sight on a strengthening of lebanon 's sovereignty , " merkel said , speaking at a european-israeli dialogue in berlin . " everything is pointing to syria 's not being able or not being willing to take a step in the direction of the great majority of the international community , " she said , adding however that " the door " was open . eu countries currently make up the bulk of an expanded 12,000-strong un peace force deployed last year in lebanon alongside lebanese troops . solana said his visit next week , sanctioned by eu heads of state and government who met in brussels last week for a summit , would be part of a general trip to the region that would also take in lebanon and saudi arabia . he said he had been mandated to take " a trip to syria , to tell the syrians what the situation is ... to tell them we want them to work with us and with the international community , particularly on the lebanon issue . " solana is scheduled to travel to saudi arabia on monday and is also expected to attend the march 28 summit of arab league leaders in riyadh . " a european road map " french president jacques chirac said he " approved without reservations " solana 's trip , adding that the eu official would go to the region " with a european road map " for future relations . chirac , who held lengthy talks with solana last week , said the visit would begin with a meeting with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , followed by talks with jordan 's king abdullah ii and then syrian president bashar al-assad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu forces make up the bulk of a 12,000-strong un peace force in lebanon eu officials had said that syria could not be approached in a concerted way by the bloc until chirac leaves office , which appears almost certain after presidential elections in may . an official with the french president 's delegation confirmed that an agreement had been reached on " the terms of reference of a personal mission by javier solana to go to syria , in the name of the european union . " he explained that chirac felt it was better to have a focused eu approach , rather than rely on attempts to engage the syrians by individual member countries , like contacts made through the german and spanish foreign ministers . eu officials acknowledge privately that they have been looking for a way to resume talks with syria and prise it away from the powerful influence of iran , which , like damascus , holds sway over the militant group hezbollah in lebanon . last week , eu leaders underlined their " determination to reinforce lebanon 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and independence . " in a statement , they " urged all members of the international community to lend their support " to efforts to set up a special tribunal to look into hariri 's killing . solana to press syria to play constructive role on a visit to brussels last week , saad hariri , the late prime minister 's son , accused syria of blocking moves to end a dangerous political deadlock in his country , as saudi arabia works to end it . " i believe that the main problem today is the syrian regime who is trying to stop this agreement , " saad hariri , who is also lebanon 's parliamentary majority leader , said . a european diplomatic source said solana will seek to impress on his lebanese hosts the value of syria playing a more constructive role in areas such as lebanon , iraq and the middle east peace process .
syria has received many iraqi refugees . the eu had finalized a partnership and cooperation agreement with syria in late 2004 , but the deal was frozen without being formally signed . the eu has remained syria 's main donor , giving it around 300 million euros worth of aid since 1995 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel criticizes iran , syria during middle east tour chancellor angela merkel met emirati president khalifa monday as part of her efforts to revive the middle east peace process .
she used the talks to criticize iran and syria for their destabilizing roles in the region .

he spoke to dw-world.de about his bundesliga expectations . sosa agreed to leave estudiantes de la plata for a four-year contract with munich reported to be worth 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.1 million -rrb- as of next season . dw-world.de talked to the 21-year-old about what he can offer the bavarian team . dw-world.de : bayern munich has a royal history with a kaiser in franz beckenbauer and a prince in lukas podolski .
now you 're already being called the " little prince . "
where does the nickname come from ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is sosa be munich 's next big thing ?
when i was 15 years old and started training with studiantes , my coach and some teammates at the time thought my style was very similar to enzo francescoli 's .
back then he was the prince so i could only be a little prince .
i think the nickname is funny and i have gotten used to it . are you familiar with your future club ? who does n't know bayern munich ?
it 's one of the best clubs in the world .
an excellent team and a great place to be .
i watched the game against real madrid -lrb- the first of a pair that saw munich advance to the champions league quarterfinals on wednesday -rrb- and was impressed .
it is n't easy to get such a good result in madrid .
bayern showed how good they really are . the team has suffered from missing german captain michael ballack for the whole season .
what do you think of the idea that you will replace him ? ballack is an exceptional player .

" strike " is not the first movie that german director völker schlöndorff filmed in poland .
his adaptation of the günter grass novel " the tin drum , " which was also made in the baltic sea port of gdansk , was awarded a best foreign language film oscar in 1980 . " eastern europe is my destiny , " schlöndorff said . schlöndorff based his latest movie , which premiered in germany this week - two weeks after its polish release - on the life of activist anna walentynowicz , a crane operator whose firing in august 1980 led 17,000 workers at the gdansk shipyard to put down their tools and join a movement that would eventually help topple communism . between fiction and history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlöndorff 's latest movie is based on true events inspired by walentynowicz and led by lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard , millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . despite the obvious similarities with walentynowicz , the film 's protagonist - agniezska - is a fictional character .
played by katharina thalbach , who also starred in " the tin drum , " she is brave , resolute , charismatic and uncompromising : both a faithful catholic and a convinced communist , a working , single mother on a personal quest for justice . " she 's a picture-book hero , i call her ' the hero of gdansk , " ' said schlöndorff .
" she has no intention of saving the world or even bringing communism down . " " at the same time , she 's a faithful catholic praying to her -lrb- pope john paul ii -rrb- woytila .
it is a story that reminds me of brecht 's ' saint joan of the stockyards , " ' he said . dreamers and politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : true heroism is n't necessarily glamorous in the movie , agniezska is portrayed as the emotional driving force behind the solidarity movement , but also as a modest person who will eventually become overshadowed by lech walesa , the masculine icon of the polish protests . in one scene of the movie , walesa - played by polish heartthrob andrzej chyra - tells her : " you are a dreamer .
and i do politics .
every ship needs a captain . " anna walentynowicz fell into obscurity after the protests achieved their goal and the movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as the soviet bloc 's only independent trade union .
lech walesa , on the other hand , remained in politics and won the nobel peace prize in 1983 . artistic rendering or misinterpretation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solidarity was a powerful social movement while " strike " is a tribute to the rise of solidarity , the movie caused quite a controversy when it was shown in poland last month .
it was slammed as " offensive " by several of the real-life heroes who founded the trade union . " this film does not present the true facts of anna walentynowicz 's life , " solidarity activist joanna gwiazda was quoted by the polish pap news agency . gwiazda said schlöndorff misrepresented walentynowicz as being illiterate and skewed facts about her personal life . joanna 's husband and fellow activist andrzej gwiazda also accused schlöndorff of misrepresenting poles and falling victim to national stereotypes . " the film shows poorly-educated and hard-drinking shipyard workers - it fits perfectly with the -lrb- false -rrb- vision of poles as drunks and thieves , " he said . a spokesperson for walentynowicz said the 77-year-old pensioner was threatening a lawsuit should schlöndorff refuse to cut several scenes she finds slanderous . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the oscar is an unbelievably powerful statue " dw-world spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck about how it feels to be nominated for an oscar for " the lives of others , " his film about an east german spy .

" there is no cooperation in sight on a strengthening of lebanon 's sovereignty , " merkel said , speaking at a european-israeli dialogue in berlin . " everything is pointing to syria 's not being able or not being willing to take a step in the direction of the great majority of the international community , " she said , adding however that " the door " was open . eu countries currently make up the bulk of an expanded 12,000-strong un peace force deployed last year in lebanon alongside lebanese troops . solana said his visit next week , sanctioned by eu heads of state and government who met in brussels last week for a summit , would be part of a general trip to the region that would also take in lebanon and saudi arabia . he said he had been mandated to take " a trip to syria , to tell the syrians what the situation is ... to tell them we want them to work with us and with the international community , particularly on the lebanon issue . " solana is scheduled to travel to saudi arabia on monday and is also expected to attend the march 28 summit of arab league leaders in riyadh . " a european road map " french president jacques chirac said he " approved without reservations " solana 's trip , adding that the eu official would go to the region " with a european road map " for future relations . chirac , who held lengthy talks with solana last week , said the visit would begin with a meeting with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , followed by talks with jordan 's king abdullah ii and then syrian president bashar al-assad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu forces make up the bulk of a 12,000-strong un peace force in lebanon eu officials had said that syria could not be approached in a concerted way by the bloc until chirac leaves office , which appears almost certain after presidential elections in may . an official with the french president 's delegation confirmed that an agreement had been reached on " the terms of reference of a personal mission by javier solana to go to syria , in the name of the european union . " he explained that chirac felt it was better to have a focused eu approach , rather than rely on attempts to engage the syrians by individual member countries , like contacts made through the german and spanish foreign ministers . eu officials acknowledge privately that they have been looking for a way to resume talks with syria and prise it away from the powerful influence of iran , which , like damascus , holds sway over the militant group hezbollah in lebanon . last week , eu leaders underlined their " determination to reinforce lebanon 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and independence . " in a statement , they " urged all members of the international community to lend their support " to efforts to set up a special tribunal to look into hariri 's killing . solana to press syria to play constructive role on a visit to brussels last week , saad hariri , the late prime minister 's son , accused syria of blocking moves to end a dangerous political deadlock in his country , as saudi arabia works to end it . " i believe that the main problem today is the syrian regime who is trying to stop this agreement , " saad hariri , who is also lebanon 's parliamentary majority leader , said . a european diplomatic source said solana will seek to impress on his lebanese hosts the value of syria playing a more constructive role in areas such as lebanon , iraq and the middle east peace process .
syria has received many iraqi refugees . the eu had finalized a partnership and cooperation agreement with syria in late 2004 , but the deal was frozen without being formally signed . the eu has remained syria 's main donor , giving it around 300 million euros worth of aid since 1995 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel criticizes iran , syria during middle east tour chancellor angela merkel met emirati president khalifa monday as part of her efforts to revive the middle east peace process .

" there is no cooperation in sight on a strengthening of lebanon 's sovereignty , " merkel said , speaking at a european-israeli dialogue in berlin . " everything is pointing to syria 's not being able or not being willing to take a step in the direction of the great majority of the international community , " she said , adding however that " the door " was open . eu countries currently make up the bulk of an expanded 12,000-strong un peace force deployed last year in lebanon alongside lebanese troops . solana said his visit next week , sanctioned by eu heads of state and government who met in brussels last week for a summit , would be part of a general trip to the region that would also take in lebanon and saudi arabia . he said he had been mandated to take " a trip to syria , to tell the syrians what the situation is ... to tell them we want them to work with us and with the international community , particularly on the lebanon issue . " solana is scheduled to travel to saudi arabia on monday and is also expected to attend the march 28 summit of arab league leaders in riyadh . " a european road map " french president jacques chirac said he " approved without reservations " solana 's trip , adding that the eu official would go to the region " with a european road map " for future relations . chirac , who held lengthy talks with solana last week , said the visit would begin with a meeting with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , followed by talks with jordan 's king abdullah ii and then syrian president bashar al-assad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu forces make up the bulk of a 12,000-strong un peace force in lebanon eu officials had said that syria could not be approached in a concerted way by the bloc until chirac leaves office , which appears almost certain after presidential elections in may . an official with the french president 's delegation confirmed that an agreement had been reached on " the terms of reference of a personal mission by javier solana to go to syria , in the name of the european union . " he explained that chirac felt it was better to have a focused eu approach , rather than rely on attempts to engage the syrians by individual member countries , like contacts made through the german and spanish foreign ministers . eu officials acknowledge privately that they have been looking for a way to resume talks with syria and prise it away from the powerful influence of iran , which , like damascus , holds sway over the militant group hezbollah in lebanon . last week , eu leaders underlined their " determination to reinforce lebanon 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and independence . " in a statement , they " urged all members of the international community to lend their support " to efforts to set up a special tribunal to look into hariri 's killing . solana to press syria to play constructive role on a visit to brussels last week , saad hariri , the late prime minister 's son , accused syria of blocking moves to end a dangerous political deadlock in his country , as saudi arabia works to end it . " i believe that the main problem today is the syrian regime who is trying to stop this agreement , " saad hariri , who is also lebanon 's parliamentary majority leader , said . a european diplomatic source said solana will seek to impress on his lebanese hosts the value of syria playing a more constructive role in areas such as lebanon , iraq and the middle east peace process .
syria has received many iraqi refugees . the eu had finalized a partnership and cooperation agreement with syria in late 2004 , but the deal was frozen without being formally signed . the eu has remained syria 's main donor , giving it around 300 million euros worth of aid since 1995 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel criticizes iran , syria during middle east tour chancellor angela merkel met emirati president khalifa monday as part of her efforts to revive the middle east peace process .

it appeared on the same day as iraqi militants threatened to kill german hostages . the group , which calls itself the " voice of the khalifate , " said germany and austria were provoking attacks by cooperating with the us . " why would you -lrb- germany -rrb- want all this -lrb- economic interests -rrb- threatened for the sake of bush and his band ? " the group said in a video posted on an islamist web site believed to be used by extremist groups , including al qaeda . " is n't it stupid to encourage the mujahideen to launch attacks in your country ? " a masked speaker said in the video which is in arabic language with german subtitles . the speaker in the video also said that austria relied on tourism for much of its revenue , adding : " this situation would change if there is a security threat and austria becomes a country targeted by the mujahideen . "
the speaker added that austria could have no interest in getting involved in a war between the mujahideen and the us . " do not destroy the security of a whole country for the sake of five soldiers you have sent to afghanistan , " said the speaker .

" the berlin-born woman , who is married to an iraqi professor , was kidnapped along with her son in early february by gunmen who broke into the family 's home in baghdad . germany vehemently opposed the us-led war in iraq , but it does have 3,000 troops in the relatively stable north of afghanistan , where it commands the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- . italy too urged to pull out troops from afghanistan meanwhile , news agency afp reported that a top taliban commander threatened saturday to kill a kidnapped italian journalist unless spokesmen from the movement were freed and a date set for italian troops to withdraw from afghanistan . " if our demands are not met within seven days , we will slaughter this man , " said mullah dadullah , speaking to afp by telephone from an unknown location .
" we have no enmity with the italians .

" strike " is not the first movie that german director völker schlöndorff filmed in poland .
his adaptation of the günter grass novel " the tin drum , " which was also made in the baltic sea port of gdansk , was awarded a best foreign language film oscar in 1980 . " eastern europe is my destiny , " schlöndorff said . schlöndorff based his latest movie , which premiered in germany this week - two weeks after its polish release - on the life of activist anna walentynowicz , a crane operator whose firing in august 1980 led 17,000 workers at the gdansk shipyard to put down their tools and join a movement that would eventually help topple communism . between fiction and history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlöndorff 's latest movie is based on true events inspired by walentynowicz and led by lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard , millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . despite the obvious similarities with walentynowicz , the film 's protagonist - agniezska - is a fictional character .

" she 's a picture-book hero , i call her ' the hero of gdansk , " ' said schlöndorff .
" she has no intention of saving the world or even bringing communism down . " " at the same time , she 's a faithful catholic praying to her -lrb- pope john paul ii -rrb- woytila .

" this film does not present the true facts of anna walentynowicz 's life , " solidarity activist joanna gwiazda was quoted by the polish pap news agency . gwiazda said schlöndorff misrepresented walentynowicz as being illiterate and skewed facts about her personal life . joanna 's husband and fellow activist andrzej gwiazda also accused schlöndorff of misrepresenting poles and falling victim to national stereotypes .

he spoke to dw-world.de about his bundesliga expectations . sosa agreed to leave estudiantes de la plata for a four-year contract with munich reported to be worth 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.1 million -rrb- as of next season . dw-world.de talked to the 21-year-old about what he can offer the bavarian team . dw-world.de : bayern munich has a royal history with a kaiser in franz beckenbauer and a prince in lukas podolski .
now you 're already being called the " little prince . "
where does the nickname come from ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is sosa be munich 's next big thing ?
when i was 15 years old and started training with studiantes , my coach and some teammates at the time thought my style was very similar to enzo francescoli 's .
back then he was the prince so i could only be a little prince .
i think the nickname is funny and i have gotten used to it . are you familiar with your future club ? who does n't know bayern munich ?
it 's one of the best clubs in the world .
an excellent team and a great place to be .

" strike " is not the first movie that german director völker schlöndorff filmed in poland .
his adaptation of the günter grass novel " the tin drum , " which was also made in the baltic sea port of gdansk , was awarded a best foreign language film oscar in 1980 . " eastern europe is my destiny , " schlöndorff said . schlöndorff based his latest movie , which premiered in germany this week - two weeks after its polish release - on the life of activist anna walentynowicz , a crane operator whose firing in august 1980 led 17,000 workers at the gdansk shipyard to put down their tools and join a movement that would eventually help topple communism . between fiction and history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlöndorff 's latest movie is based on true events inspired by walentynowicz and led by lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard , millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . despite the obvious similarities with walentynowicz , the film 's protagonist - agniezska - is a fictional character .
played by katharina thalbach , who also starred in " the tin drum , " she is brave , resolute , charismatic and uncompromising : both a faithful catholic and a convinced communist , a working , single mother on a personal quest for justice . " she 's a picture-book hero , i call her ' the hero of gdansk , " ' said schlöndorff .
" she has no intention of saving the world or even bringing communism down . " " at the same time , she 's a faithful catholic praying to her -lrb- pope john paul ii -rrb- woytila .
it is a story that reminds me of brecht 's ' saint joan of the stockyards , " ' he said . dreamers and politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : true heroism is n't necessarily glamorous in the movie , agniezska is portrayed as the emotional driving force behind the solidarity movement , but also as a modest person who will eventually become overshadowed by lech walesa , the masculine icon of the polish protests . in one scene of the movie , walesa - played by polish heartthrob andrzej chyra - tells her : " you are a dreamer .
and i do politics .
every ship needs a captain . " anna walentynowicz fell into obscurity after the protests achieved their goal and the movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as the soviet bloc 's only independent trade union .
lech walesa , on the other hand , remained in politics and won the nobel peace prize in 1983 . artistic rendering or misinterpretation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solidarity was a powerful social movement while " strike " is a tribute to the rise of solidarity , the movie caused quite a controversy when it was shown in poland last month .
it was slammed as " offensive " by several of the real-life heroes who founded the trade union . " this film does not present the true facts of anna walentynowicz 's life , " solidarity activist joanna gwiazda was quoted by the polish pap news agency . gwiazda said schlöndorff misrepresented walentynowicz as being illiterate and skewed facts about her personal life . joanna 's husband and fellow activist andrzej gwiazda also accused schlöndorff of misrepresenting poles and falling victim to national stereotypes . " the film shows poorly-educated and hard-drinking shipyard workers - it fits perfectly with the -lrb- false -rrb- vision of poles as drunks and thieves , " he said . a spokesperson for walentynowicz said the 77-year-old pensioner was threatening a lawsuit should schlöndorff refuse to cut several scenes she finds slanderous . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the oscar is an unbelievably powerful statue " dw-world spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck about how it feels to be nominated for an oscar for " the lives of others , " his film about an east german spy .

" strike " is not the first movie that german director völker schlöndorff filmed in poland .
his adaptation of the günter grass novel " the tin drum , " which was also made in the baltic sea port of gdansk , was awarded a best foreign language film oscar in 1980 . " eastern europe is my destiny , " schlöndorff said . schlöndorff based his latest movie , which premiered in germany this week - two weeks after its polish release - on the life of activist anna walentynowicz , a crane operator whose firing in august 1980 led 17,000 workers at the gdansk shipyard to put down their tools and join a movement that would eventually help topple communism . between fiction and history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlöndorff 's latest movie is based on true events inspired by walentynowicz and led by lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard , millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . despite the obvious similarities with walentynowicz , the film 's protagonist - agniezska - is a fictional character .
played by katharina thalbach , who also starred in " the tin drum , " she is brave , resolute , charismatic and uncompromising : both a faithful catholic and a convinced communist , a working , single mother on a personal quest for justice . " she 's a picture-book hero , i call her ' the hero of gdansk , " ' said schlöndorff .
" she has no intention of saving the world or even bringing communism down . " " at the same time , she 's a faithful catholic praying to her -lrb- pope john paul ii -rrb- woytila .
it is a story that reminds me of brecht 's ' saint joan of the stockyards , " ' he said . dreamers and politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : true heroism is n't necessarily glamorous in the movie , agniezska is portrayed as the emotional driving force behind the solidarity movement , but also as a modest person who will eventually become overshadowed by lech walesa , the masculine icon of the polish protests . in one scene of the movie , walesa - played by polish heartthrob andrzej chyra - tells her : " you are a dreamer .
and i do politics .
every ship needs a captain . " anna walentynowicz fell into obscurity after the protests achieved their goal and the movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as the soviet bloc 's only independent trade union .
lech walesa , on the other hand , remained in politics and won the nobel peace prize in 1983 . artistic rendering or misinterpretation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solidarity was a powerful social movement while " strike " is a tribute to the rise of solidarity , the movie caused quite a controversy when it was shown in poland last month .
it was slammed as " offensive " by several of the real-life heroes who founded the trade union . " this film does not present the true facts of anna walentynowicz 's life , " solidarity activist joanna gwiazda was quoted by the polish pap news agency . gwiazda said schlöndorff misrepresented walentynowicz as being illiterate and skewed facts about her personal life . joanna 's husband and fellow activist andrzej gwiazda also accused schlöndorff of misrepresenting poles and falling victim to national stereotypes . " the film shows poorly-educated and hard-drinking shipyard workers - it fits perfectly with the -lrb- false -rrb- vision of poles as drunks and thieves , " he said . a spokesperson for walentynowicz said the 77-year-old pensioner was threatening a lawsuit should schlöndorff refuse to cut several scenes she finds slanderous . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the oscar is an unbelievably powerful statue " dw-world spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck about how it feels to be nominated for an oscar for " the lives of others , " his film about an east german spy .

he spoke to dw-world.de about his bundesliga expectations . sosa agreed to leave estudiantes de la plata for a four-year contract with munich reported to be worth 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.1 million -rrb- as of next season . dw-world.de talked to the 21-year-old about what he can offer the bavarian team . dw-world.de : bayern munich has a royal history with a kaiser in franz beckenbauer and a prince in lukas podolski .
now you 're already being called the " little prince . "
where does the nickname come from ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is sosa be munich 's next big thing ?
when i was 15 years old and started training with studiantes , my coach and some teammates at the time thought my style was very similar to enzo francescoli 's .
back then he was the prince so i could only be a little prince .
i think the nickname is funny and i have gotten used to it . are you familiar with your future club ? who does n't know bayern munich ?
it 's one of the best clubs in the world .
an excellent team and a great place to be .
i watched the game against real madrid -lrb- the first of a pair that saw munich advance to the champions league quarterfinals on wednesday -rrb- and was impressed .
it is n't easy to get such a good result in madrid .
bayern showed how good they really are . the team has suffered from missing german captain michael ballack for the whole season .
what do you think of the idea that you will replace him ? ballack is an exceptional player .
that the team misses him is a sign of that .
but i 'm not a fan of comparisons .
i 'm a completely different guy - ernesto sosa , you know .
i am going to offer my performance , my playing style , my drive and my discipline to the club . how would you describe yourself ? i 'm a relaxed kind of guy who always wants to improve .
i put a lot of importance on working hard .
i favor the collective - in soccer it 's not about individuals but about what they can do for the team . it 's not always easy for latin americans to fit into german soccer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sosa should be able to find plenty of affection from his future munich teammates well , i do n't know any people in germany and do n't speak the language so that 's a logical consequence , but it wo n't always be that way for me .
i 've heard that munich is a great city , so that 's good to know . have you had any contact with martin demichelis , your countryman at bayern munich ? i do n't know him personally , unfortunately .
but we do have a common friend and i 've heard through him that i can count on martin 's support .
it 's a nice offer and i 'm glad to have it .
i 'll be approaching him sometime . what is your favorite way to spend your free time ? what i enjoy most is spending time with friends and my family .
i 'm from the country and do n't get to see people close to me very often .
so that makes every moment worth its weight in gold .
i also like to listen to music from where i come from , a " cumbia santafecina " is always like an invitation to start dancing .
sadly , as a soccer player i do n't get as many chances to accept the invitation as i 'd like . daniel martinez interviewed ernesto sosa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitzfeld works the old champions league magic bayern munich 's veteran coach ottmar hitzfeld could barely disguise his excitement after the club he returned to a month ago reached the champions league quarterfinals at real madrid 's expense .

he spoke to dw-world.de about his bundesliga expectations . sosa agreed to leave estudiantes de la plata for a four-year contract with munich reported to be worth 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.1 million -rrb- as of next season . dw-world.de talked to the 21-year-old about what he can offer the bavarian team . dw-world.de : bayern munich has a royal history with a kaiser in franz beckenbauer and a prince in lukas podolski .
now you 're already being called the " little prince . "
where does the nickname come from ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is sosa be munich 's next big thing ?
when i was 15 years old and started training with studiantes , my coach and some teammates at the time thought my style was very similar to enzo francescoli 's .
back then he was the prince so i could only be a little prince .
i think the nickname is funny and i have gotten used to it . are you familiar with your future club ? who does n't know bayern munich ?
it 's one of the best clubs in the world .
an excellent team and a great place to be .
i watched the game against real madrid -lrb- the first of a pair that saw munich advance to the champions league quarterfinals on wednesday -rrb- and was impressed .
it is n't easy to get such a good result in madrid .
bayern showed how good they really are . the team has suffered from missing german captain michael ballack for the whole season .
what do you think of the idea that you will replace him ? ballack is an exceptional player .
that the team misses him is a sign of that .
but i 'm not a fan of comparisons .
i 'm a completely different guy - ernesto sosa , you know .
i am going to offer my performance , my playing style , my drive and my discipline to the club . how would you describe yourself ? i 'm a relaxed kind of guy who always wants to improve .
i put a lot of importance on working hard .
i favor the collective - in soccer it 's not about individuals but about what they can do for the team . it 's not always easy for latin americans to fit into german soccer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sosa should be able to find plenty of affection from his future munich teammates well , i do n't know any people in germany and do n't speak the language so that 's a logical consequence , but it wo n't always be that way for me .
i 've heard that munich is a great city , so that 's good to know . have you had any contact with martin demichelis , your countryman at bayern munich ? i do n't know him personally , unfortunately .
but we do have a common friend and i 've heard through him that i can count on martin 's support .
it 's a nice offer and i 'm glad to have it .
i 'll be approaching him sometime . what is your favorite way to spend your free time ? what i enjoy most is spending time with friends and my family .
i 'm from the country and do n't get to see people close to me very often .
so that makes every moment worth its weight in gold .
i also like to listen to music from where i come from , a " cumbia santafecina " is always like an invitation to start dancing .
sadly , as a soccer player i do n't get as many chances to accept the invitation as i 'd like . daniel martinez interviewed ernesto sosa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitzfeld works the old champions league magic bayern munich 's veteran coach ottmar hitzfeld could barely disguise his excitement after the club he returned to a month ago reached the champions league quarterfinals at real madrid 's expense .
-lrb- 08.03.2007 -rrb- wins for bayern , bremen ; defeats for schalke , stuttgart the german title race is back on after werder bremen and bayern munich both won saturday and stuttgart lost , leaving just six points separating the top four clubs .
-lrb- 05.03.2007 -rrb- " real madrid and bayern are in search of a new identity " legendary midfielder paul breitner was a star with both bayern munich and real madrid in the 1970s and 80s .
dw-world.de talked to him about what these two faltering giants need to do to regain their former dominance .

he spoke to dw-world.de about his bundesliga expectations . sosa agreed to leave estudiantes de la plata for a four-year contract with munich reported to be worth 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.1 million -rrb- as of next season . dw-world.de talked to the 21-year-old about what he can offer the bavarian team . dw-world.de : bayern munich has a royal history with a kaiser in franz beckenbauer and a prince in lukas podolski .
now you 're already being called the " little prince . "
where does the nickname come from ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is sosa be munich 's next big thing ?
when i was 15 years old and started training with studiantes , my coach and some teammates at the time thought my style was very similar to enzo francescoli 's .
back then he was the prince so i could only be a little prince .
i think the nickname is funny and i have gotten used to it . are you familiar with your future club ? who does n't know bayern munich ?
it 's one of the best clubs in the world .
an excellent team and a great place to be .
i watched the game against real madrid -lrb- the first of a pair that saw munich advance to the champions league quarterfinals on wednesday -rrb- and was impressed .
it is n't easy to get such a good result in madrid .
bayern showed how good they really are . the team has suffered from missing german captain michael ballack for the whole season .
what do you think of the idea that you will replace him ? ballack is an exceptional player .
that the team misses him is a sign of that .
but i 'm not a fan of comparisons .
i 'm a completely different guy - ernesto sosa , you know .
i am going to offer my performance , my playing style , my drive and my discipline to the club . how would you describe yourself ? i 'm a relaxed kind of guy who always wants to improve .
i put a lot of importance on working hard .
i favor the collective - in soccer it 's not about individuals but about what they can do for the team . it 's not always easy for latin americans to fit into german soccer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sosa should be able to find plenty of affection from his future munich teammates well , i do n't know any people in germany and do n't speak the language so that 's a logical consequence , but it wo n't always be that way for me .
i 've heard that munich is a great city , so that 's good to know . have you had any contact with martin demichelis , your countryman at bayern munich ? i do n't know him personally , unfortunately .
but we do have a common friend and i 've heard through him that i can count on martin 's support .
it 's a nice offer and i 'm glad to have it .
i 'll be approaching him sometime . what is your favorite way to spend your free time ? what i enjoy most is spending time with friends and my family .
i 'm from the country and do n't get to see people close to me very often .
so that makes every moment worth its weight in gold .
i also like to listen to music from where i come from , a " cumbia santafecina " is always like an invitation to start dancing .
sadly , as a soccer player i do n't get as many chances to accept the invitation as i 'd like . daniel martinez interviewed ernesto sosa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitzfeld works the old champions league magic bayern munich 's veteran coach ottmar hitzfeld could barely disguise his excitement after the club he returned to a month ago reached the champions league quarterfinals at real madrid 's expense .

one woman remains in a coma and hundreds others are still plagued by medical and psychological problems . on a sunny spring day , relatives of victims and survivors bowed their heads in silence as the king laid a wreath at the foot of the 11-metre -lrb- 36 ft -rrb- tower - its height a reference to the date spain suffered its worst peace-time attack . " a place of reflection " the tower 's architects - five friends working on their first commission - said the design 's main ingredient was light .
sunshine hitting the column of 15,000 glass bricks focuses light into an empty , blue chamber below a busy highway , which the public can access via atocha station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish king juan carlos , queen sofia , prince felipe and his wife letizia look at the interior of the memorial from below , visitors can peer skywards to read hundreds of messages of condolence and support wrapped around the inside of the cylinder . " when the sunlight completely fills the chamber , it 's like an explosion of light .
it 's a calm environment , a place of reflection , " one of the architects , esau acosta , from firm estudio fam told reuters . three days after the bombs , spain held general elections and voted out the conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , a close us ally , putting in its place a socialist government that quickly fulfilled a pledge to pull spanish troops out of iraq . the trial of those accused of carrying out the attacks will hear from more than 600 witnesses and 100 experts before a panel of three judges gives its verdict , probably in early autumn . separate commemorations were held at two other stations hit by blasts on sunday . massive opposition demonstrations on the eve of the bombings anniversary , spain 's opposition conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- organized a new mass rally against the government in madrid after bringing thousands out on the streets on friday evening in 65 towns and cities across the country . the pp is seeking to get its own back with unceasing attacks on the socialist government 's alleged soft line on basque separatism . under a banner reading , " spain for freedom .
no more concessions to eta " , the opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- has billed the protest as the most important demonstration in spain 's 30-year democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people took part in opposition demonstrations over the weekend prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said in the senate last week that the pp could not make up for its own past mistakes by stirring up political trouble against his government . " you were the ones who lost the march 14 -lrb- 2005 -rrb- elections ... through your own errors , " zapatero charged , singling out the pp 's backing for the us-led invasion of iraq and its insistence that the basque separatist movement eta carried out the train bombings . most spanish observers believe the bombs were planted by radical muslims angry at the decision in 2003 by then pp prime minister jose maria aznar to back the invasion and send spanish troops in support . however , pp hardliners and sections of the right-wing media insist on a " conspiracy theory " whereby eta might have colluded with islamists in the attacks on crowded commuter trains and stations . eta is classified in spain , in brussels and in washington as a terrorist group .
polls often show that spaniards view eta as their country 's biggest problem , part of a threat that also includes muslim extremism . " spain is christian " with municipal elections three months off and general elections next year , the pp is nevertheless playing the eta card for all it is worth , boosted by the december 30 car bomb blast at madrid airport that killed two people . it was the first deadly attack since mid-2003 by the group in its violent campaign for independence for the northern basque country , breaking a self-declared truce that had raised hopes for a solution to the long-running crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister zapatero inspected the site of the eta blast at the madrid airport last december while the government promptly declared that eta had ruled itself out of any peace negotiations , the pp has now seized on zapatero 's decision to release conditionally basque militant jose ignacio de juana chaos , who had spent 20 years in jail for 25 murders . after being given a further prison term just ahead of his scheduled release for expressing support for eta in newspaper articles , juana chaos began a hunger strike which left him emaciated to the extent doctors feared for his life . in the face of pp charges of giving into eta blackmail , the government retorted that it had showed " humanitarian " clemency to juana chaos , while also fearing his death could have turned him into an eta martyr . zapatero also accused the pp of hypocrisy , pointing out that while last in power it released more than 300 eta prisoners before the end of their sentences . right-wingers are still prepared to drag in the march 11 bombings into their protests however : demonstrators against zapatero have carried placards reading , " spain is christian , not muslim .

" there is no cooperation in sight on a strengthening of lebanon 's sovereignty , " merkel said , speaking at a european-israeli dialogue in berlin . " everything is pointing to syria 's not being able or not being willing to take a step in the direction of the great majority of the international community , " she said , adding however that " the door " was open . eu countries currently make up the bulk of an expanded 12,000-strong un peace force deployed last year in lebanon alongside lebanese troops . solana said his visit next week , sanctioned by eu heads of state and government who met in brussels last week for a summit , would be part of a general trip to the region that would also take in lebanon and saudi arabia . he said he had been mandated to take " a trip to syria , to tell the syrians what the situation is ... to tell them we want them to work with us and with the international community , particularly on the lebanon issue . " solana is scheduled to travel to saudi arabia on monday and is also expected to attend the march 28 summit of arab league leaders in riyadh . " a european road map " french president jacques chirac said he " approved without reservations " solana 's trip , adding that the eu official would go to the region " with a european road map " for future relations . chirac , who held lengthy talks with solana last week , said the visit would begin with a meeting with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , followed by talks with jordan 's king abdullah ii and then syrian president bashar al-assad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu forces make up the bulk of a 12,000-strong un peace force in lebanon eu officials had said that syria could not be approached in a concerted way by the bloc until chirac leaves office , which appears almost certain after presidential elections in may . an official with the french president 's delegation confirmed that an agreement had been reached on " the terms of reference of a personal mission by javier solana to go to syria , in the name of the european union . " he explained that chirac felt it was better to have a focused eu approach , rather than rely on attempts to engage the syrians by individual member countries , like contacts made through the german and spanish foreign ministers . eu officials acknowledge privately that they have been looking for a way to resume talks with syria and prise it away from the powerful influence of iran , which , like damascus , holds sway over the militant group hezbollah in lebanon . last week , eu leaders underlined their " determination to reinforce lebanon 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and independence . " in a statement , they " urged all members of the international community to lend their support " to efforts to set up a special tribunal to look into hariri 's killing . solana to press syria to play constructive role on a visit to brussels last week , saad hariri , the late prime minister 's son , accused syria of blocking moves to end a dangerous political deadlock in his country , as saudi arabia works to end it . " i believe that the main problem today is the syrian regime who is trying to stop this agreement , " saad hariri , who is also lebanon 's parliamentary majority leader , said . a european diplomatic source said solana will seek to impress on his lebanese hosts the value of syria playing a more constructive role in areas such as lebanon , iraq and the middle east peace process .
syria has received many iraqi refugees . the eu had finalized a partnership and cooperation agreement with syria in late 2004 , but the deal was frozen without being formally signed . the eu has remained syria 's main donor , giving it around 300 million euros worth of aid since 1995 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel criticizes iran , syria during middle east tour chancellor angela merkel met emirati president khalifa monday as part of her efforts to revive the middle east peace process .

" there is no cooperation in sight on a strengthening of lebanon 's sovereignty , " merkel said , speaking at a european-israeli dialogue in berlin . " everything is pointing to syria 's not being able or not being willing to take a step in the direction of the great majority of the international community , " she said , adding however that " the door " was open . eu countries currently make up the bulk of an expanded 12,000-strong un peace force deployed last year in lebanon alongside lebanese troops . solana said his visit next week , sanctioned by eu heads of state and government who met in brussels last week for a summit , would be part of a general trip to the region that would also take in lebanon and saudi arabia . he said he had been mandated to take " a trip to syria , to tell the syrians what the situation is ... to tell them we want them to work with us and with the international community , particularly on the lebanon issue . " solana is scheduled to travel to saudi arabia on monday and is also expected to attend the march 28 summit of arab league leaders in riyadh . " a european road map " french president jacques chirac said he " approved without reservations " solana 's trip , adding that the eu official would go to the region " with a european road map " for future relations . chirac , who held lengthy talks with solana last week , said the visit would begin with a meeting with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , followed by talks with jordan 's king abdullah ii and then syrian president bashar al-assad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu forces make up the bulk of a 12,000-strong un peace force in lebanon eu officials had said that syria could not be approached in a concerted way by the bloc until chirac leaves office , which appears almost certain after presidential elections in may . an official with the french president 's delegation confirmed that an agreement had been reached on " the terms of reference of a personal mission by javier solana to go to syria , in the name of the european union . " he explained that chirac felt it was better to have a focused eu approach , rather than rely on attempts to engage the syrians by individual member countries , like contacts made through the german and spanish foreign ministers . eu officials acknowledge privately that they have been looking for a way to resume talks with syria and prise it away from the powerful influence of iran , which , like damascus , holds sway over the militant group hezbollah in lebanon . last week , eu leaders underlined their " determination to reinforce lebanon 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and independence .

he spoke to dw-world.de about his bundesliga expectations . sosa agreed to leave estudiantes de la plata for a four-year contract with munich reported to be worth 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.1 million -rrb- as of next season . dw-world.de talked to the 21-year-old about what he can offer the bavarian team . dw-world.de : bayern munich has a royal history with a kaiser in franz beckenbauer and a prince in lukas podolski .
now you 're already being called the " little prince . "
where does the nickname come from ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is sosa be munich 's next big thing ?
when i was 15 years old and started training with studiantes , my coach and some teammates at the time thought my style was very similar to enzo francescoli 's .
back then he was the prince so i could only be a little prince .
i think the nickname is funny and i have gotten used to it . are you familiar with your future club ? who does n't know bayern munich ?
it 's one of the best clubs in the world .
an excellent team and a great place to be .
i watched the game against real madrid -lrb- the first of a pair that saw munich advance to the champions league quarterfinals on wednesday -rrb- and was impressed .
it is n't easy to get such a good result in madrid .
bayern showed how good they really are . the team has suffered from missing german captain michael ballack for the whole season .
what do you think of the idea that you will replace him ? ballack is an exceptional player .
that the team misses him is a sign of that .
but i 'm not a fan of comparisons .
i 'm a completely different guy - ernesto sosa , you know .
i am going to offer my performance , my playing style , my drive and my discipline to the club . how would you describe yourself ? i 'm a relaxed kind of guy who always wants to improve .
i put a lot of importance on working hard .
i favor the collective - in soccer it 's not about individuals but about what they can do for the team . it 's not always easy for latin americans to fit into german soccer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sosa should be able to find plenty of affection from his future munich teammates well , i do n't know any people in germany and do n't speak the language so that 's a logical consequence , but it wo n't always be that way for me .
i 've heard that munich is a great city , so that 's good to know . have you had any contact with martin demichelis , your countryman at bayern munich ? i do n't know him personally , unfortunately .
but we do have a common friend and i 've heard through him that i can count on martin 's support .
it 's a nice offer and i 'm glad to have it .
i 'll be approaching him sometime . what is your favorite way to spend your free time ? what i enjoy most is spending time with friends and my family .
i 'm from the country and do n't get to see people close to me very often .
so that makes every moment worth its weight in gold .
i also like to listen to music from where i come from , a " cumbia santafecina " is always like an invitation to start dancing .

" strike " is not the first movie that german director völker schlöndorff filmed in poland .
his adaptation of the günter grass novel " the tin drum , " which was also made in the baltic sea port of gdansk , was awarded a best foreign language film oscar in 1980 . " eastern europe is my destiny , " schlöndorff said . schlöndorff based his latest movie , which premiered in germany this week - two weeks after its polish release - on the life of activist anna walentynowicz , a crane operator whose firing in august 1980 led 17,000 workers at the gdansk shipyard to put down their tools and join a movement that would eventually help topple communism . between fiction and history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlöndorff 's latest movie is based on true events inspired by walentynowicz and led by lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard , millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . despite the obvious similarities with walentynowicz , the film 's protagonist - agniezska - is a fictional character .

" strike " is not the first movie that german director völker schlöndorff filmed in poland .
his adaptation of the günter grass novel " the tin drum , " which was also made in the baltic sea port of gdansk , was awarded a best foreign language film oscar in 1980 . " eastern europe is my destiny , " schlöndorff said . schlöndorff based his latest movie , which premiered in germany this week - two weeks after its polish release - on the life of activist anna walentynowicz , a crane operator whose firing in august 1980 led 17,000 workers at the gdansk shipyard to put down their tools and join a movement that would eventually help topple communism . between fiction and history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlöndorff 's latest movie is based on true events inspired by walentynowicz and led by lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard , millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . despite the obvious similarities with walentynowicz , the film 's protagonist - agniezska - is a fictional character .
played by katharina thalbach , who also starred in " the tin drum , " she is brave , resolute , charismatic and uncompromising : both a faithful catholic and a convinced communist , a working , single mother on a personal quest for justice . " she 's a picture-book hero , i call her ' the hero of gdansk , " ' said schlöndorff .
" she has no intention of saving the world or even bringing communism down . " " at the same time , she 's a faithful catholic praying to her -lrb- pope john paul ii -rrb- woytila .
it is a story that reminds me of brecht 's ' saint joan of the stockyards , " ' he said . dreamers and politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : true heroism is n't necessarily glamorous in the movie , agniezska is portrayed as the emotional driving force behind the solidarity movement , but also as a modest person who will eventually become overshadowed by lech walesa , the masculine icon of the polish protests . in one scene of the movie , walesa - played by polish heartthrob andrzej chyra - tells her : " you are a dreamer .
and i do politics .
every ship needs a captain . " anna walentynowicz fell into obscurity after the protests achieved their goal and the movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as the soviet bloc 's only independent trade union .
lech walesa , on the other hand , remained in politics and won the nobel peace prize in 1983 . artistic rendering or misinterpretation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solidarity was a powerful social movement while " strike " is a tribute to the rise of solidarity , the movie caused quite a controversy when it was shown in poland last month .
it was slammed as " offensive " by several of the real-life heroes who founded the trade union . " this film does not present the true facts of anna walentynowicz 's life , " solidarity activist joanna gwiazda was quoted by the polish pap news agency . gwiazda said schlöndorff misrepresented walentynowicz as being illiterate and skewed facts about her personal life . joanna 's husband and fellow activist andrzej gwiazda also accused schlöndorff of misrepresenting poles and falling victim to national stereotypes . " the film shows poorly-educated and hard-drinking shipyard workers - it fits perfectly with the -lrb- false -rrb- vision of poles as drunks and thieves , " he said . a spokesperson for walentynowicz said the 77-year-old pensioner was threatening a lawsuit should schlöndorff refuse to cut several scenes she finds slanderous . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the oscar is an unbelievably powerful statue " dw-world spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck about how it feels to be nominated for an oscar for " the lives of others , " his film about an east german spy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.03.2007 german-polish coproduction tackles rise of solidarity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slice of history : katharina thalbach as agnieszka and andrzej chyra as lech in " strike " a new film by oscar-winning german director volker schlöndorff dramatizes the 1980 strikes which gave birth to poland 's legendary anti-communist solidarity trade union . " strike " is not the first movie that german director völker schlöndorff filmed in poland .
his adaptation of the günter grass novel " the tin drum , " which was also made in the baltic sea port of gdansk , was awarded a best foreign language film oscar in 1980 . " eastern europe is my destiny , " schlöndorff said . schlöndorff based his latest movie , which premiered in germany this week - two weeks after its polish release - on the life of activist anna walentynowicz , a crane operator whose firing in august 1980 led 17,000 workers at the gdansk shipyard to put down their tools and join a movement that would eventually help topple communism . between fiction and history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlöndorff 's latest movie is based on true events inspired by walentynowicz and led by lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard , millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . despite the obvious similarities with walentynowicz , the film 's protagonist - agniezska - is a fictional character .
played by katharina thalbach , who also starred in " the tin drum , " she is brave , resolute , charismatic and uncompromising : both a faithful catholic and a convinced communist , a working , single mother on a personal quest for justice . " she 's a picture-book hero , i call her ' the hero of gdansk , " ' said schlöndorff .
" she has no intention of saving the world or even bringing communism down . " " at the same time , she 's a faithful catholic praying to her -lrb- pope john paul ii -rrb- woytila .
it is a story that reminds me of brecht 's ' saint joan of the stockyards , " ' he said . dreamers and politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : true heroism is n't necessarily glamorous in the movie , agniezska is portrayed as the emotional driving force behind the solidarity movement , but also as a modest person who will eventually become overshadowed by lech walesa , the masculine icon of the polish protests . in one scene of the movie , walesa - played by polish heartthrob andrzej chyra - tells her : " you are a dreamer .

" there is no cooperation in sight on a strengthening of lebanon 's sovereignty , " merkel said , speaking at a european-israeli dialogue in berlin . " everything is pointing to syria 's not being able or not being willing to take a step in the direction of the great majority of the international community , " she said , adding however that " the door " was open . eu countries currently make up the bulk of an expanded 12,000-strong un peace force deployed last year in lebanon alongside lebanese troops . solana said his visit next week , sanctioned by eu heads of state and government who met in brussels last week for a summit , would be part of a general trip to the region that would also take in lebanon and saudi arabia . he said he had been mandated to take " a trip to syria , to tell the syrians what the situation is ... to tell them we want them to work with us and with the international community , particularly on the lebanon issue . " solana is scheduled to travel to saudi arabia on monday and is also expected to attend the march 28 summit of arab league leaders in riyadh . " a european road map " french president jacques chirac said he " approved without reservations " solana 's trip , adding that the eu official would go to the region " with a european road map " for future relations . chirac , who held lengthy talks with solana last week , said the visit would begin with a meeting with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , followed by talks with jordan 's king abdullah ii and then syrian president bashar al-assad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu forces make up the bulk of a 12,000-strong un peace force in lebanon eu officials had said that syria could not be approached in a concerted way by the bloc until chirac leaves office , which appears almost certain after presidential elections in may . an official with the french president 's delegation confirmed that an agreement had been reached on " the terms of reference of a personal mission by javier solana to go to syria , in the name of the european union . " he explained that chirac felt it was better to have a focused eu approach , rather than rely on attempts to engage the syrians by individual member countries , like contacts made through the german and spanish foreign ministers . eu officials acknowledge privately that they have been looking for a way to resume talks with syria and prise it away from the powerful influence of iran , which , like damascus , holds sway over the militant group hezbollah in lebanon . last week , eu leaders underlined their " determination to reinforce lebanon 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and independence . " in a statement , they " urged all members of the international community to lend their support " to efforts to set up a special tribunal to look into hariri 's killing . solana to press syria to play constructive role on a visit to brussels last week , saad hariri , the late prime minister 's son , accused syria of blocking moves to end a dangerous political deadlock in his country , as saudi arabia works to end it . " i believe that the main problem today is the syrian regime who is trying to stop this agreement , " saad hariri , who is also lebanon 's parliamentary majority leader , said . a european diplomatic source said solana will seek to impress on his lebanese hosts the value of syria playing a more constructive role in areas such as lebanon , iraq and the middle east peace process .
syria has received many iraqi refugees . the eu had finalized a partnership and cooperation agreement with syria in late 2004 , but the deal was frozen without being formally signed . the eu has remained syria 's main donor , giving it around 300 million euros worth of aid since 1995 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel criticizes iran , syria during middle east tour chancellor angela merkel met emirati president khalifa monday as part of her efforts to revive the middle east peace process .

one woman remains in a coma and hundreds others are still plagued by medical and psychological problems . on a sunny spring day , relatives of victims and survivors bowed their heads in silence as the king laid a wreath at the foot of the 11-metre -lrb- 36 ft -rrb- tower - its height a reference to the date spain suffered its worst peace-time attack . " a place of reflection " the tower 's architects - five friends working on their first commission - said the design 's main ingredient was light .
sunshine hitting the column of 15,000 glass bricks focuses light into an empty , blue chamber below a busy highway , which the public can access via atocha station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish king juan carlos , queen sofia , prince felipe and his wife letizia look at the interior of the memorial from below , visitors can peer skywards to read hundreds of messages of condolence and support wrapped around the inside of the cylinder . " when the sunlight completely fills the chamber , it 's like an explosion of light .
it 's a calm environment , a place of reflection , " one of the architects , esau acosta , from firm estudio fam told reuters . three days after the bombs , spain held general elections and voted out the conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , a close us ally , putting in its place a socialist government that quickly fulfilled a pledge to pull spanish troops out of iraq . the trial of those accused of carrying out the attacks will hear from more than 600 witnesses and 100 experts before a panel of three judges gives its verdict , probably in early autumn . separate commemorations were held at two other stations hit by blasts on sunday . massive opposition demonstrations on the eve of the bombings anniversary , spain 's opposition conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- organized a new mass rally against the government in madrid after bringing thousands out on the streets on friday evening in 65 towns and cities across the country . the pp is seeking to get its own back with unceasing attacks on the socialist government 's alleged soft line on basque separatism . under a banner reading , " spain for freedom .
no more concessions to eta " , the opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- has billed the protest as the most important demonstration in spain 's 30-year democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people took part in opposition demonstrations over the weekend prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said in the senate last week that the pp could not make up for its own past mistakes by stirring up political trouble against his government . " you were the ones who lost the march 14 -lrb- 2005 -rrb- elections ... through your own errors , " zapatero charged , singling out the pp 's backing for the us-led invasion of iraq and its insistence that the basque separatist movement eta carried out the train bombings . most spanish observers believe the bombs were planted by radical muslims angry at the decision in 2003 by then pp prime minister jose maria aznar to back the invasion and send spanish troops in support . however , pp hardliners and sections of the right-wing media insist on a " conspiracy theory " whereby eta might have colluded with islamists in the attacks on crowded commuter trains and stations . eta is classified in spain , in brussels and in washington as a terrorist group .
polls often show that spaniards view eta as their country 's biggest problem , part of a threat that also includes muslim extremism . " spain is christian " with municipal elections three months off and general elections next year , the pp is nevertheless playing the eta card for all it is worth , boosted by the december 30 car bomb blast at madrid airport that killed two people . it was the first deadly attack since mid-2003 by the group in its violent campaign for independence for the northern basque country , breaking a self-declared truce that had raised hopes for a solution to the long-running crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister zapatero inspected the site of the eta blast at the madrid airport last december while the government promptly declared that eta had ruled itself out of any peace negotiations , the pp has now seized on zapatero 's decision to release conditionally basque militant jose ignacio de juana chaos , who had spent 20 years in jail for 25 murders . after being given a further prison term just ahead of his scheduled release for expressing support for eta in newspaper articles , juana chaos began a hunger strike which left him emaciated to the extent doctors feared for his life . in the face of pp charges of giving into eta blackmail , the government retorted that it had showed " humanitarian " clemency to juana chaos , while also fearing his death could have turned him into an eta martyr . zapatero also accused the pp of hypocrisy , pointing out that while last in power it released more than 300 eta prisoners before the end of their sentences . right-wingers are still prepared to drag in the march 11 bombings into their protests however : demonstrators against zapatero have carried placards reading , " spain is christian , not muslim .

" there is no cooperation in sight on a strengthening of lebanon 's sovereignty , " merkel said , speaking at a european-israeli dialogue in berlin . " everything is pointing to syria 's not being able or not being willing to take a step in the direction of the great majority of the international community , " she said , adding however that " the door " was open . eu countries currently make up the bulk of an expanded 12,000-strong un peace force deployed last year in lebanon alongside lebanese troops . solana said his visit next week , sanctioned by eu heads of state and government who met in brussels last week for a summit , would be part of a general trip to the region that would also take in lebanon and saudi arabia . he said he had been mandated to take " a trip to syria , to tell the syrians what the situation is ... to tell them we want them to work with us and with the international community , particularly on the lebanon issue . " solana is scheduled to travel to saudi arabia on monday and is also expected to attend the march 28 summit of arab league leaders in riyadh . " a european road map " french president jacques chirac said he " approved without reservations " solana 's trip , adding that the eu official would go to the region " with a european road map " for future relations . chirac , who held lengthy talks with solana last week , said the visit would begin with a meeting with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , followed by talks with jordan 's king abdullah ii and then syrian president bashar al-assad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu forces make up the bulk of a 12,000-strong un peace force in lebanon eu officials had said that syria could not be approached in a concerted way by the bloc until chirac leaves office , which appears almost certain after presidential elections in may . an official with the french president 's delegation confirmed that an agreement had been reached on " the terms of reference of a personal mission by javier solana to go to syria , in the name of the european union . " he explained that chirac felt it was better to have a focused eu approach , rather than rely on attempts to engage the syrians by individual member countries , like contacts made through the german and spanish foreign ministers . eu officials acknowledge privately that they have been looking for a way to resume talks with syria and prise it away from the powerful influence of iran , which , like damascus , holds sway over the militant group hezbollah in lebanon . last week , eu leaders underlined their " determination to reinforce lebanon 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and independence . " in a statement , they " urged all members of the international community to lend their support " to efforts to set up a special tribunal to look into hariri 's killing . solana to press syria to play constructive role on a visit to brussels last week , saad hariri , the late prime minister 's son , accused syria of blocking moves to end a dangerous political deadlock in his country , as saudi arabia works to end it . " i believe that the main problem today is the syrian regime who is trying to stop this agreement , " saad hariri , who is also lebanon 's parliamentary majority leader , said . a european diplomatic source said solana will seek to impress on his lebanese hosts the value of syria playing a more constructive role in areas such as lebanon , iraq and the middle east peace process .
syria has received many iraqi refugees . the eu had finalized a partnership and cooperation agreement with syria in late 2004 , but the deal was frozen without being formally signed . the eu has remained syria 's main donor , giving it around 300 million euros worth of aid since 1995 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel criticizes iran , syria during middle east tour chancellor angela merkel met emirati president khalifa monday as part of her efforts to revive the middle east peace process .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.03.2007 spain unveils memorial to madrid train bomb victims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relatives and friends of the victims of the attacks place flowers at the new memorial a small glass tower channeling light into an underground chamber was unveiled as a memorial to victims of the madrid train bombings , metres away from where the blasts killed 191 people three years ago on sunday . king juan carlos and queen sofia inaugurated the memorial - a glittering cylinder of glass brick - less than a month after 29 suspects went on trial in the attack that ripped apart four rush-hour trains approaching madrid 's atocha railway station . around 1,800 people were injured by 10 bombs , which had been stuffed into sports bags and set off by mobile phones .
one woman remains in a coma and hundreds others are still plagued by medical and psychological problems . on a sunny spring day , relatives of victims and survivors bowed their heads in silence as the king laid a wreath at the foot of the 11-metre -lrb- 36 ft -rrb- tower - its height a reference to the date spain suffered its worst peace-time attack . " a place of reflection " the tower 's architects - five friends working on their first commission - said the design 's main ingredient was light .
sunshine hitting the column of 15,000 glass bricks focuses light into an empty , blue chamber below a busy highway , which the public can access via atocha station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish king juan carlos , queen sofia , prince felipe and his wife letizia look at the interior of the memorial from below , visitors can peer skywards to read hundreds of messages of condolence and support wrapped around the inside of the cylinder . " when the sunlight completely fills the chamber , it 's like an explosion of light .
it 's a calm environment , a place of reflection , " one of the architects , esau acosta , from firm estudio fam told reuters . three days after the bombs , spain held general elections and voted out the conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , a close us ally , putting in its place a socialist government that quickly fulfilled a pledge to pull spanish troops out of iraq . the trial of those accused of carrying out the attacks will hear from more than 600 witnesses and 100 experts before a panel of three judges gives its verdict , probably in early autumn . separate commemorations were held at two other stations hit by blasts on sunday . massive opposition demonstrations on the eve of the bombings anniversary , spain 's opposition conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- organized a new mass rally against the government in madrid after bringing thousands out on the streets on friday evening in 65 towns and cities across the country . the pp is seeking to get its own back with unceasing attacks on the socialist government 's alleged soft line on basque separatism . under a banner reading , " spain for freedom .
no more concessions to eta " , the opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- has billed the protest as the most important demonstration in spain 's 30-year democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people took part in opposition demonstrations over the weekend prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said in the senate last week that the pp could not make up for its own past mistakes by stirring up political trouble against his government . " you were the ones who lost the march 14 -lrb- 2005 -rrb- elections ... through your own errors , " zapatero charged , singling out the pp 's backing for the us-led invasion of iraq and its insistence that the basque separatist movement eta carried out the train bombings . most spanish observers believe the bombs were planted by radical muslims angry at the decision in 2003 by then pp prime minister jose maria aznar to back the invasion and send spanish troops in support . however , pp hardliners and sections of the right-wing media insist on a " conspiracy theory " whereby eta might have colluded with islamists in the attacks on crowded commuter trains and stations . eta is classified in spain , in brussels and in washington as a terrorist group .
polls often show that spaniards view eta as their country 's biggest problem , part of a threat that also includes muslim extremism . " spain is christian " with municipal elections three months off and general elections next year , the pp is nevertheless playing the eta card for all it is worth , boosted by the december 30 car bomb blast at madrid airport that killed two people . it was the first deadly attack since mid-2003 by the group in its violent campaign for independence for the northern basque country , breaking a self-declared truce that had raised hopes for a solution to the long-running crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister zapatero inspected the site of the eta blast at the madrid airport last december while the government promptly declared that eta had ruled itself out of any peace negotiations , the pp has now seized on zapatero 's decision to release conditionally basque militant jose ignacio de juana chaos , who had spent 20 years in jail for 25 murders . after being given a further prison term just ahead of his scheduled release for expressing support for eta in newspaper articles , juana chaos began a hunger strike which left him emaciated to the extent doctors feared for his life . in the face of pp charges of giving into eta blackmail , the government retorted that it had showed " humanitarian " clemency to juana chaos , while also fearing his death could have turned him into an eta martyr . zapatero also accused the pp of hypocrisy , pointing out that while last in power it released more than 300 eta prisoners before the end of their sentences . right-wingers are still prepared to drag in the march 11 bombings into their protests however : demonstrators against zapatero have carried placards reading , " spain is christian , not muslim .

" when the sunlight completely fills the chamber , it 's like an explosion of light .
it 's a calm environment , a place of reflection , " one of the architects , esau acosta , from firm estudio fam told reuters . three days after the bombs , spain held general elections and voted out the conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , a close us ally , putting in its place a socialist government that quickly fulfilled a pledge to pull spanish troops out of iraq . the trial of those accused of carrying out the attacks will hear from more than 600 witnesses and 100 experts before a panel of three judges gives its verdict , probably in early autumn . separate commemorations were held at two other stations hit by blasts on sunday . massive opposition demonstrations on the eve of the bombings anniversary , spain 's opposition conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- organized a new mass rally against the government in madrid after bringing thousands out on the streets on friday evening in 65 towns and cities across the country . the pp is seeking to get its own back with unceasing attacks on the socialist government 's alleged soft line on basque separatism . under a banner reading , " spain for freedom .
no more concessions to eta " , the opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- has billed the protest as the most important demonstration in spain 's 30-year democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people took part in opposition demonstrations over the weekend prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said in the senate last week that the pp could not make up for its own past mistakes by stirring up political trouble against his government . " you were the ones who lost the march 14 -lrb- 2005 -rrb- elections ... through your own errors , " zapatero charged , singling out the pp 's backing for the us-led invasion of iraq and its insistence that the basque separatist movement eta carried out the train bombings . most spanish observers believe the bombs were planted by radical muslims angry at the decision in 2003 by then pp prime minister jose maria aznar to back the invasion and send spanish troops in support . however , pp hardliners and sections of the right-wing media insist on a " conspiracy theory " whereby eta might have colluded with islamists in the attacks on crowded commuter trains and stations . eta is classified in spain , in brussels and in washington as a terrorist group .
polls often show that spaniards view eta as their country 's biggest problem , part of a threat that also includes muslim extremism . " spain is christian " with municipal elections three months off and general elections next year , the pp is nevertheless playing the eta card for all it is worth , boosted by the december 30 car bomb blast at madrid airport that killed two people . it was the first deadly attack since mid-2003 by the group in its violent campaign for independence for the northern basque country , breaking a self-declared truce that had raised hopes for a solution to the long-running crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister zapatero inspected the site of the eta blast at the madrid airport last december while the government promptly declared that eta had ruled itself out of any peace negotiations , the pp has now seized on zapatero 's decision to release conditionally basque militant jose ignacio de juana chaos , who had spent 20 years in jail for 25 murders . after being given a further prison term just ahead of his scheduled release for expressing support for eta in newspaper articles , juana chaos began a hunger strike which left him emaciated to the extent doctors feared for his life . in the face of pp charges of giving into eta blackmail , the government retorted that it had showed " humanitarian " clemency to juana chaos , while also fearing his death could have turned him into an eta martyr . zapatero also accused the pp of hypocrisy , pointing out that while last in power it released more than 300 eta prisoners before the end of their sentences . right-wingers are still prepared to drag in the march 11 bombings into their protests however : demonstrators against zapatero have carried placards reading , " spain is christian , not muslim .

it 's a calm environment , a place of reflection , " one of the architects , esau acosta , from firm estudio fam told reuters . three days after the bombs , spain held general elections and voted out the conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , a close us ally , putting in its place a socialist government that quickly fulfilled a pledge to pull spanish troops out of iraq . the trial of those accused of carrying out the attacks will hear from more than 600 witnesses and 100 experts before a panel of three judges gives its verdict , probably in early autumn . separate commemorations were held at two other stations hit by blasts on sunday . massive opposition demonstrations on the eve of the bombings anniversary , spain 's opposition conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- organized a new mass rally against the government in madrid after bringing thousands out on the streets on friday evening in 65 towns and cities across the country . the pp is seeking to get its own back with unceasing attacks on the socialist government 's alleged soft line on basque separatism . under a banner reading , " spain for freedom .
no more concessions to eta " , the opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- has billed the protest as the most important demonstration in spain 's 30-year democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people took part in opposition demonstrations over the weekend prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said in the senate last week that the pp could not make up for its own past mistakes by stirring up political trouble against his government . " you were the ones who lost the march 14 -lrb- 2005 -rrb- elections ... through your own errors , " zapatero charged , singling out the pp 's backing for the us-led invasion of iraq and its insistence that the basque separatist movement eta carried out the train bombings . most spanish observers believe the bombs were planted by radical muslims angry at the decision in 2003 by then pp prime minister jose maria aznar to back the invasion and send spanish troops in support . however , pp hardliners and sections of the right-wing media insist on a " conspiracy theory " whereby eta might have colluded with islamists in the attacks on crowded commuter trains and stations . eta is classified in spain , in brussels and in washington as a terrorist group .
polls often show that spaniards view eta as their country 's biggest problem , part of a threat that also includes muslim extremism . " spain is christian " with municipal elections three months off and general elections next year , the pp is nevertheless playing the eta card for all it is worth , boosted by the december 30 car bomb blast at madrid airport that killed two people . it was the first deadly attack since mid-2003 by the group in its violent campaign for independence for the northern basque country , breaking a self-declared truce that had raised hopes for a solution to the long-running crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister zapatero inspected the site of the eta blast at the madrid airport last december while the government promptly declared that eta had ruled itself out of any peace negotiations , the pp has now seized on zapatero 's decision to release conditionally basque militant jose ignacio de juana chaos , who had spent 20 years in jail for 25 murders . after being given a further prison term just ahead of his scheduled release for expressing support for eta in newspaper articles , juana chaos began a hunger strike which left him emaciated to the extent doctors feared for his life . in the face of pp charges of giving into eta blackmail , the government retorted that it had showed " humanitarian " clemency to juana chaos , while also fearing his death could have turned him into an eta martyr . zapatero also accused the pp of hypocrisy , pointing out that while last in power it released more than 300 eta prisoners before the end of their sentences . right-wingers are still prepared to drag in the march 11 bombings into their protests however : demonstrators against zapatero have carried placards reading , " spain is christian , not muslim .

his adaptation of the günter grass novel " the tin drum , " which was also made in the baltic sea port of gdansk , was awarded a best foreign language film oscar in 1980 . " eastern europe is my destiny , " schlöndorff said . schlöndorff based his latest movie , which premiered in germany this week - two weeks after its polish release - on the life of activist anna walentynowicz , a crane operator whose firing in august 1980 led 17,000 workers at the gdansk shipyard to put down their tools and join a movement that would eventually help topple communism . between fiction and history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlöndorff 's latest movie is based on true events inspired by walentynowicz and led by lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard , millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . despite the obvious similarities with walentynowicz , the film 's protagonist - agniezska - is a fictional character .

he spoke to dw-world.de about his bundesliga expectations . sosa agreed to leave estudiantes de la plata for a four-year contract with munich reported to be worth 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.1 million -rrb- as of next season . dw-world.de talked to the 21-year-old about what he can offer the bavarian team . dw-world.de : bayern munich has a royal history with a kaiser in franz beckenbauer and a prince in lukas podolski .
now you 're already being called the " little prince . "
where does the nickname come from ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is sosa be munich 's next big thing ?
when i was 15 years old and started training with studiantes , my coach and some teammates at the time thought my style was very similar to enzo francescoli 's .
back then he was the prince so i could only be a little prince .
i think the nickname is funny and i have gotten used to it . are you familiar with your future club ? who does n't know bayern munich ?
it 's one of the best clubs in the world .
an excellent team and a great place to be .
i watched the game against real madrid -lrb- the first of a pair that saw munich advance to the champions league quarterfinals on wednesday -rrb- and was impressed .
it is n't easy to get such a good result in madrid .
bayern showed how good they really are . the team has suffered from missing german captain michael ballack for the whole season .
what do you think of the idea that you will replace him ? ballack is an exceptional player .
that the team misses him is a sign of that .
but i 'm not a fan of comparisons .
i 'm a completely different guy - ernesto sosa , you know .
i am going to offer my performance , my playing style , my drive and my discipline to the club . how would you describe yourself ? i 'm a relaxed kind of guy who always wants to improve .
i put a lot of importance on working hard .
i favor the collective - in soccer it 's not about individuals but about what they can do for the team . it 's not always easy for latin americans to fit into german soccer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sosa should be able to find plenty of affection from his future munich teammates well , i do n't know any people in germany and do n't speak the language so that 's a logical consequence , but it wo n't always be that way for me .
i 've heard that munich is a great city , so that 's good to know . have you had any contact with martin demichelis , your countryman at bayern munich ? i do n't know him personally , unfortunately .
but we do have a common friend and i 've heard through him that i can count on martin 's support .
it 's a nice offer and i 'm glad to have it .
i 'll be approaching him sometime . what is your favorite way to spend your free time ? what i enjoy most is spending time with friends and my family .
i 'm from the country and do n't get to see people close to me very often .
so that makes every moment worth its weight in gold .
i also like to listen to music from where i come from , a " cumbia santafecina " is always like an invitation to start dancing .
sadly , as a soccer player i do n't get as many chances to accept the invitation as i 'd like . daniel martinez interviewed ernesto sosa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hitzfeld works the old champions league magic bayern munich 's veteran coach ottmar hitzfeld could barely disguise his excitement after the club he returned to a month ago reached the champions league quarterfinals at real madrid 's expense .
-lrb- 08.03.2007 -rrb- wins for bayern , bremen ; defeats for schalke , stuttgart the german title race is back on after werder bremen and bayern munich both won saturday and stuttgart lost , leaving just six points separating the top four clubs .
-lrb- 05.03.2007 -rrb- " real madrid and bayern are in search of a new identity " legendary midfielder paul breitner was a star with both bayern munich and real madrid in the 1970s and 80s .
dw-world.de talked to him about what these two faltering giants need to do to regain their former dominance .

" strike " is not the first movie that german director völker schlöndorff filmed in poland .
his adaptation of the günter grass novel " the tin drum , " which was also made in the baltic sea port of gdansk , was awarded a best foreign language film oscar in 1980 . " eastern europe is my destiny , " schlöndorff said . schlöndorff based his latest movie , which premiered in germany this week - two weeks after its polish release - on the life of activist anna walentynowicz , a crane operator whose firing in august 1980 led 17,000 workers at the gdansk shipyard to put down their tools and join a movement that would eventually help topple communism . between fiction and history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlöndorff 's latest movie is based on true events inspired by walentynowicz and led by lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard , millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . despite the obvious similarities with walentynowicz , the film 's protagonist - agniezska - is a fictional character .
played by katharina thalbach , who also starred in " the tin drum , " she is brave , resolute , charismatic and uncompromising : both a faithful catholic and a convinced communist , a working , single mother on a personal quest for justice . " she 's a picture-book hero , i call her ' the hero of gdansk , " ' said schlöndorff .
" she has no intention of saving the world or even bringing communism down . " " at the same time , she 's a faithful catholic praying to her -lrb- pope john paul ii -rrb- woytila .
it is a story that reminds me of brecht 's ' saint joan of the stockyards , " ' he said . dreamers and politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : true heroism is n't necessarily glamorous in the movie , agniezska is portrayed as the emotional driving force behind the solidarity movement , but also as a modest person who will eventually become overshadowed by lech walesa , the masculine icon of the polish protests . in one scene of the movie , walesa - played by polish heartthrob andrzej chyra - tells her : " you are a dreamer .
and i do politics .
every ship needs a captain . " anna walentynowicz fell into obscurity after the protests achieved their goal and the movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as the soviet bloc 's only independent trade union .

he spoke to dw-world.de about his bundesliga expectations . sosa agreed to leave estudiantes de la plata for a four-year contract with munich reported to be worth 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.1 million -rrb- as of next season . dw-world.de talked to the 21-year-old about what he can offer the bavarian team . dw-world.de : bayern munich has a royal history with a kaiser in franz beckenbauer and a prince in lukas podolski .
now you 're already being called the " little prince . "
where does the nickname come from ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is sosa be munich 's next big thing ?
when i was 15 years old and started training with studiantes , my coach and some teammates at the time thought my style was very similar to enzo francescoli 's .
back then he was the prince so i could only be a little prince .
i think the nickname is funny and i have gotten used to it . are you familiar with your future club ? who does n't know bayern munich ?
it 's one of the best clubs in the world .
an excellent team and a great place to be .
i watched the game against real madrid -lrb- the first of a pair that saw munich advance to the champions league quarterfinals on wednesday -rrb- and was impressed .
it is n't easy to get such a good result in madrid .
bayern showed how good they really are . the team has suffered from missing german captain michael ballack for the whole season .
what do you think of the idea that you will replace him ? ballack is an exceptional player .
that the team misses him is a sign of that .
but i 'm not a fan of comparisons .

i 've heard that munich is a great city , so that 's good to know . have you had any contact with martin demichelis , your countryman at bayern munich ? i do n't know him personally , unfortunately .
but we do have a common friend and i 've heard through him that i can count on martin 's support .
it 's a nice offer and i 'm glad to have it .
i 'll be approaching him sometime . what is your favorite way to spend your free time ? what i enjoy most is spending time with friends and my family .
i 'm from the country and do n't get to see people close to me very often .
so that makes every moment worth its weight in gold .
i also like to listen to music from where i come from , a " cumbia santafecina " is always like an invitation to start dancing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.03.2007 german-polish coproduction tackles rise of solidarity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slice of history : katharina thalbach as agnieszka and andrzej chyra as lech in " strike " a new film by oscar-winning german director volker schlöndorff dramatizes the 1980 strikes which gave birth to poland 's legendary anti-communist solidarity trade union . " strike " is not the first movie that german director völker schlöndorff filmed in poland .
his adaptation of the günter grass novel " the tin drum , " which was also made in the baltic sea port of gdansk , was awarded a best foreign language film oscar in 1980 . " eastern europe is my destiny , " schlöndorff said . schlöndorff based his latest movie , which premiered in germany this week - two weeks after its polish release - on the life of activist anna walentynowicz , a crane operator whose firing in august 1980 led 17,000 workers at the gdansk shipyard to put down their tools and join a movement that would eventually help topple communism . between fiction and history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlöndorff 's latest movie is based on true events inspired by walentynowicz and led by lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard , millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . despite the obvious similarities with walentynowicz , the film 's protagonist - agniezska - is a fictional character .
played by katharina thalbach , who also starred in " the tin drum , " she is brave , resolute , charismatic and uncompromising : both a faithful catholic and a convinced communist , a working , single mother on a personal quest for justice . " she 's a picture-book hero , i call her ' the hero of gdansk , " ' said schlöndorff .
" she has no intention of saving the world or even bringing communism down . " " at the same time , she 's a faithful catholic praying to her -lrb- pope john paul ii -rrb- woytila .
it is a story that reminds me of brecht 's ' saint joan of the stockyards , " ' he said . dreamers and politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : true heroism is n't necessarily glamorous in the movie , agniezska is portrayed as the emotional driving force behind the solidarity movement , but also as a modest person who will eventually become overshadowed by lech walesa , the masculine icon of the polish protests . in one scene of the movie , walesa - played by polish heartthrob andrzej chyra - tells her : " you are a dreamer .
and i do politics .
every ship needs a captain . " anna walentynowicz fell into obscurity after the protests achieved their goal and the movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as the soviet bloc 's only independent trade union .
lech walesa , on the other hand , remained in politics and won the nobel peace prize in 1983 . artistic rendering or misinterpretation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solidarity was a powerful social movement while " strike " is a tribute to the rise of solidarity , the movie caused quite a controversy when it was shown in poland last month .
it was slammed as " offensive " by several of the real-life heroes who founded the trade union . " this film does not present the true facts of anna walentynowicz 's life , " solidarity activist joanna gwiazda was quoted by the polish pap news agency . gwiazda said schlöndorff misrepresented walentynowicz as being illiterate and skewed facts about her personal life . joanna 's husband and fellow activist andrzej gwiazda also accused schlöndorff of misrepresenting poles and falling victim to national stereotypes . " the film shows poorly-educated and hard-drinking shipyard workers - it fits perfectly with the -lrb- false -rrb- vision of poles as drunks and thieves , " he said . a spokesperson for walentynowicz said the 77-year-old pensioner was threatening a lawsuit should schlöndorff refuse to cut several scenes she finds slanderous . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the oscar is an unbelievably powerful statue " dw-world spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck about how it feels to be nominated for an oscar for " the lives of others , " his film about an east german spy .

i 'll be approaching him sometime . what is your favorite way to spend your free time ? what i enjoy most is spending time with friends and my family .

so that makes every moment worth its weight in gold .

" strike " is not the first movie that german director völker schlöndorff filmed in poland .
his adaptation of the günter grass novel " the tin drum , " which was also made in the baltic sea port of gdansk , was awarded a best foreign language film oscar in 1980 . " eastern europe is my destiny , " schlöndorff said . schlöndorff based his latest movie , which premiered in germany this week - two weeks after its polish release - on the life of activist anna walentynowicz , a crane operator whose firing in august 1980 led 17,000 workers at the gdansk shipyard to put down their tools and join a movement that would eventually help topple communism . between fiction and history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlöndorff 's latest movie is based on true events inspired by walentynowicz and led by lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard , millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . despite the obvious similarities with walentynowicz , the film 's protagonist - agniezska - is a fictional character .
played by katharina thalbach , who also starred in " the tin drum , " she is brave , resolute , charismatic and uncompromising : both a faithful catholic and a convinced communist , a working , single mother on a personal quest for justice . " she 's a picture-book hero , i call her ' the hero of gdansk , " ' said schlöndorff .
" she has no intention of saving the world or even bringing communism down . " " at the same time , she 's a faithful catholic praying to her -lrb- pope john paul ii -rrb- woytila .
it is a story that reminds me of brecht 's ' saint joan of the stockyards , " ' he said . dreamers and politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : true heroism is n't necessarily glamorous in the movie , agniezska is portrayed as the emotional driving force behind the solidarity movement , but also as a modest person who will eventually become overshadowed by lech walesa , the masculine icon of the polish protests . in one scene of the movie , walesa - played by polish heartthrob andrzej chyra - tells her : " you are a dreamer .
and i do politics .
every ship needs a captain . " anna walentynowicz fell into obscurity after the protests achieved their goal and the movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as the soviet bloc 's only independent trade union .
lech walesa , on the other hand , remained in politics and won the nobel peace prize in 1983 . artistic rendering or misinterpretation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solidarity was a powerful social movement while " strike " is a tribute to the rise of solidarity , the movie caused quite a controversy when it was shown in poland last month .
it was slammed as " offensive " by several of the real-life heroes who founded the trade union . " this film does not present the true facts of anna walentynowicz 's life , " solidarity activist joanna gwiazda was quoted by the polish pap news agency . gwiazda said schlöndorff misrepresented walentynowicz as being illiterate and skewed facts about her personal life . joanna 's husband and fellow activist andrzej gwiazda also accused schlöndorff of misrepresenting poles and falling victim to national stereotypes . " the film shows poorly-educated and hard-drinking shipyard workers - it fits perfectly with the -lrb- false -rrb- vision of poles as drunks and thieves , " he said . a spokesperson for walentynowicz said the 77-year-old pensioner was threatening a lawsuit should schlöndorff refuse to cut several scenes she finds slanderous . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the oscar is an unbelievably powerful statue " dw-world spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck about how it feels to be nominated for an oscar for " the lives of others , " his film about an east german spy .

it appeared on the same day as iraqi militants threatened to kill german hostages . the group , which calls itself the " voice of the khalifate , " said germany and austria were provoking attacks by cooperating with the us . " why would you -lrb- germany -rrb- want all this -lrb- economic interests -rrb- threatened for the sake of bush and his band ? " the group said in a video posted on an islamist web site believed to be used by extremist groups , including al qaeda . " is n't it stupid to encourage the mujahideen to launch attacks in your country ? " a masked speaker said in the video which is in arabic language with german subtitles . the speaker in the video also said that austria relied on tourism for much of its revenue , adding : " this situation would change if there is a security threat and austria becomes a country targeted by the mujahideen . "
the speaker added that austria could have no interest in getting involved in a war between the mujahideen and the us . " do not destroy the security of a whole country for the sake of five soldiers you have sent to afghanistan , " said the speaker .
" decide quickly and withdraw your soldiers . " austria beefs up security in kabul stefan hirsch , a spokesman for the austrian defense ministry in vienna told reuters that austria was aware of the video message . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria says it only has five officers in afghanistan to help boost security in kabul " we have immediately arranged the maximum security precautions for our officers in kabul … -lrb- who -rrb- have been instructed not to leave the premises of the headquarters -lrb- of nato-led forces -rrb- . " austria has been involved in the peacekeeping mission in afghanistan since 2002 .
the mandate for its deployment ends at the end of the year , following which the government has to decide on a possible extension . the german foreign ministry has so far declined to comment on the video . minister : germany trying to free hostages the video appeared on the same day as another message was issued by a little-known militant group in iraq which said it would kill two german hostages , a mother and son , in 10 days unless berlin withdrew its troops from iraq . foreign minister frank walter steinmeier said saturday germany will do everything in its power to secure the release of the two hostages .
the minister said a foreign ministry crisis team was studying the video . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier says germany will do everything it can to secure the release of the hostages steinmeier described the video , in which the 61-year-old woman was shown begging for her life , as " a distressing document . " the berlin-born woman , who is married to an iraqi professor , was kidnapped along with her son in early february by gunmen who broke into the family 's home in baghdad . germany vehemently opposed the us-led war in iraq , but it does have 3,000 troops in the relatively stable north of afghanistan , where it commands the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- . italy too urged to pull out troops from afghanistan meanwhile , news agency afp reported that a top taliban commander threatened saturday to kill a kidnapped italian journalist unless spokesmen from the movement were freed and a date set for italian troops to withdraw from afghanistan . " if our demands are not met within seven days , we will slaughter this man , " said mullah dadullah , speaking to afp by telephone from an unknown location .
" we have no enmity with the italians .
if they set a date for their withdrawal , we will release the italian , " he said . the 52-year-old repubblica correspondent daniele mastrogiacomo has been missing in southern afghanistan since sunday last week along with two afghans , believed to be an interpreter and a driver or guide . italy has nearly 2,000 troops in afghanistan as part of a 35,000-strong nato-led force .

" there is no cooperation in sight on a strengthening of lebanon 's sovereignty , " merkel said , speaking at a european-israeli dialogue in berlin . " everything is pointing to syria 's not being able or not being willing to take a step in the direction of the great majority of the international community , " she said , adding however that " the door " was open . eu countries currently make up the bulk of an expanded 12,000-strong un peace force deployed last year in lebanon alongside lebanese troops . solana said his visit next week , sanctioned by eu heads of state and government who met in brussels last week for a summit , would be part of a general trip to the region that would also take in lebanon and saudi arabia . he said he had been mandated to take " a trip to syria , to tell the syrians what the situation is ... to tell them we want them to work with us and with the international community , particularly on the lebanon issue . " solana is scheduled to travel to saudi arabia on monday and is also expected to attend the march 28 summit of arab league leaders in riyadh . " a european road map " french president jacques chirac said he " approved without reservations " solana 's trip , adding that the eu official would go to the region " with a european road map " for future relations . chirac , who held lengthy talks with solana last week , said the visit would begin with a meeting with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , followed by talks with jordan 's king abdullah ii and then syrian president bashar al-assad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu forces make up the bulk of a 12,000-strong un peace force in lebanon eu officials had said that syria could not be approached in a concerted way by the bloc until chirac leaves office , which appears almost certain after presidential elections in may . an official with the french president 's delegation confirmed that an agreement had been reached on " the terms of reference of a personal mission by javier solana to go to syria , in the name of the european union . " he explained that chirac felt it was better to have a focused eu approach , rather than rely on attempts to engage the syrians by individual member countries , like contacts made through the german and spanish foreign ministers . eu officials acknowledge privately that they have been looking for a way to resume talks with syria and prise it away from the powerful influence of iran , which , like damascus , holds sway over the militant group hezbollah in lebanon . last week , eu leaders underlined their " determination to reinforce lebanon 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and independence . " in a statement , they " urged all members of the international community to lend their support " to efforts to set up a special tribunal to look into hariri 's killing . solana to press syria to play constructive role on a visit to brussels last week , saad hariri , the late prime minister 's son , accused syria of blocking moves to end a dangerous political deadlock in his country , as saudi arabia works to end it . " i believe that the main problem today is the syrian regime who is trying to stop this agreement , " saad hariri , who is also lebanon 's parliamentary majority leader , said . a european diplomatic source said solana will seek to impress on his lebanese hosts the value of syria playing a more constructive role in areas such as lebanon , iraq and the middle east peace process .
syria has received many iraqi refugees . the eu had finalized a partnership and cooperation agreement with syria in late 2004 , but the deal was frozen without being formally signed . the eu has remained syria 's main donor , giving it around 300 million euros worth of aid since 1995 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel criticizes iran , syria during middle east tour chancellor angela merkel met emirati president khalifa monday as part of her efforts to revive the middle east peace process .

" there is no cooperation in sight on a strengthening of lebanon 's sovereignty , " merkel said , speaking at a european-israeli dialogue in berlin . " everything is pointing to syria 's not being able or not being willing to take a step in the direction of the great majority of the international community , " she said , adding however that " the door " was open . eu countries currently make up the bulk of an expanded 12,000-strong un peace force deployed last year in lebanon alongside lebanese troops . solana said his visit next week , sanctioned by eu heads of state and government who met in brussels last week for a summit , would be part of a general trip to the region that would also take in lebanon and saudi arabia . he said he had been mandated to take " a trip to syria , to tell the syrians what the situation is ... to tell them we want them to work with us and with the international community , particularly on the lebanon issue . " solana is scheduled to travel to saudi arabia on monday and is also expected to attend the march 28 summit of arab league leaders in riyadh . " a european road map " french president jacques chirac said he " approved without reservations " solana 's trip , adding that the eu official would go to the region " with a european road map " for future relations . chirac , who held lengthy talks with solana last week , said the visit would begin with a meeting with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , followed by talks with jordan 's king abdullah ii and then syrian president bashar al-assad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu forces make up the bulk of a 12,000-strong un peace force in lebanon eu officials had said that syria could not be approached in a concerted way by the bloc until chirac leaves office , which appears almost certain after presidential elections in may . an official with the french president 's delegation confirmed that an agreement had been reached on " the terms of reference of a personal mission by javier solana to go to syria , in the name of the european union . " he explained that chirac felt it was better to have a focused eu approach , rather than rely on attempts to engage the syrians by individual member countries , like contacts made through the german and spanish foreign ministers . eu officials acknowledge privately that they have been looking for a way to resume talks with syria and prise it away from the powerful influence of iran , which , like damascus , holds sway over the militant group hezbollah in lebanon . last week , eu leaders underlined their " determination to reinforce lebanon 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and independence . " in a statement , they " urged all members of the international community to lend their support " to efforts to set up a special tribunal to look into hariri 's killing . solana to press syria to play constructive role on a visit to brussels last week , saad hariri , the late prime minister 's son , accused syria of blocking moves to end a dangerous political deadlock in his country , as saudi arabia works to end it . " i believe that the main problem today is the syrian regime who is trying to stop this agreement , " saad hariri , who is also lebanon 's parliamentary majority leader , said . a european diplomatic source said solana will seek to impress on his lebanese hosts the value of syria playing a more constructive role in areas such as lebanon , iraq and the middle east peace process .
syria has received many iraqi refugees . the eu had finalized a partnership and cooperation agreement with syria in late 2004 , but the deal was frozen without being formally signed . the eu has remained syria 's main donor , giving it around 300 million euros worth of aid since 1995 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel criticizes iran , syria during middle east tour chancellor angela merkel met emirati president khalifa monday as part of her efforts to revive the middle east peace process .

" a european road map " french president jacques chirac said he " approved without reservations " solana 's trip , adding that the eu official would go to the region " with a european road map " for future relations . chirac , who held lengthy talks with solana last week , said the visit would begin with a meeting with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , followed by talks with jordan 's king abdullah ii and then syrian president bashar al-assad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu forces make up the bulk of a 12,000-strong un peace force in lebanon eu officials had said that syria could not be approached in a concerted way by the bloc until chirac leaves office , which appears almost certain after presidential elections in may . an official with the french president 's delegation confirmed that an agreement had been reached on " the terms of reference of a personal mission by javier solana to go to syria , in the name of the european union . " he explained that chirac felt it was better to have a focused eu approach , rather than rely on attempts to engage the syrians by individual member countries , like contacts made through the german and spanish foreign ministers . eu officials acknowledge privately that they have been looking for a way to resume talks with syria and prise it away from the powerful influence of iran , which , like damascus , holds sway over the militant group hezbollah in lebanon . last week , eu leaders underlined their " determination to reinforce lebanon 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and independence . " in a statement , they " urged all members of the international community to lend their support " to efforts to set up a special tribunal to look into hariri 's killing . solana to press syria to play constructive role on a visit to brussels last week , saad hariri , the late prime minister 's son , accused syria of blocking moves to end a dangerous political deadlock in his country , as saudi arabia works to end it . " i believe that the main problem today is the syrian regime who is trying to stop this agreement , " saad hariri , who is also lebanon 's parliamentary majority leader , said . a european diplomatic source said solana will seek to impress on his lebanese hosts the value of syria playing a more constructive role in areas such as lebanon , iraq and the middle east peace process .
syria has received many iraqi refugees . the eu had finalized a partnership and cooperation agreement with syria in late 2004 , but the deal was frozen without being formally signed . the eu has remained syria 's main donor , giving it around 300 million euros worth of aid since 1995 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel criticizes iran , syria during middle east tour chancellor angela merkel met emirati president khalifa monday as part of her efforts to revive the middle east peace process .

it appeared on the same day as iraqi militants threatened to kill german hostages . the group , which calls itself the " voice of the khalifate , " said germany and austria were provoking attacks by cooperating with the us . " why would you -lrb- germany -rrb- want all this -lrb- economic interests -rrb- threatened for the sake of bush and his band ?

" a masked speaker said in the video which is in arabic language with german subtitles . the speaker in the video also said that austria relied on tourism for much of its revenue , adding : " this situation would change if there is a security threat and austria becomes a country targeted by the mujahideen . "
the speaker added that austria could have no interest in getting involved in a war between the mujahideen and the us . " do not destroy the security of a whole country for the sake of five soldiers you have sent to afghanistan , " said the speaker .

one woman remains in a coma and hundreds others are still plagued by medical and psychological problems . on a sunny spring day , relatives of victims and survivors bowed their heads in silence as the king laid a wreath at the foot of the 11-metre -lrb- 36 ft -rrb- tower - its height a reference to the date spain suffered its worst peace-time attack . " a place of reflection " the tower 's architects - five friends working on their first commission - said the design 's main ingredient was light .
sunshine hitting the column of 15,000 glass bricks focuses light into an empty , blue chamber below a busy highway , which the public can access via atocha station . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish king juan carlos , queen sofia , prince felipe and his wife letizia look at the interior of the memorial from below , visitors can peer skywards to read hundreds of messages of condolence and support wrapped around the inside of the cylinder . " when the sunlight completely fills the chamber , it 's like an explosion of light .
it 's a calm environment , a place of reflection , " one of the architects , esau acosta , from firm estudio fam told reuters . three days after the bombs , spain held general elections and voted out the conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , a close us ally , putting in its place a socialist government that quickly fulfilled a pledge to pull spanish troops out of iraq . the trial of those accused of carrying out the attacks will hear from more than 600 witnesses and 100 experts before a panel of three judges gives its verdict , probably in early autumn . separate commemorations were held at two other stations hit by blasts on sunday . massive opposition demonstrations on the eve of the bombings anniversary , spain 's opposition conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- organized a new mass rally against the government in madrid after bringing thousands out on the streets on friday evening in 65 towns and cities across the country . the pp is seeking to get its own back with unceasing attacks on the socialist government 's alleged soft line on basque separatism . under a banner reading , " spain for freedom .
no more concessions to eta " , the opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- has billed the protest as the most important demonstration in spain 's 30-year democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people took part in opposition demonstrations over the weekend prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said in the senate last week that the pp could not make up for its own past mistakes by stirring up political trouble against his government . " you were the ones who lost the march 14 -lrb- 2005 -rrb- elections ... through your own errors , " zapatero charged , singling out the pp 's backing for the us-led invasion of iraq and its insistence that the basque separatist movement eta carried out the train bombings . most spanish observers believe the bombs were planted by radical muslims angry at the decision in 2003 by then pp prime minister jose maria aznar to back the invasion and send spanish troops in support . however , pp hardliners and sections of the right-wing media insist on a " conspiracy theory " whereby eta might have colluded with islamists in the attacks on crowded commuter trains and stations . eta is classified in spain , in brussels and in washington as a terrorist group .
polls often show that spaniards view eta as their country 's biggest problem , part of a threat that also includes muslim extremism . " spain is christian " with municipal elections three months off and general elections next year , the pp is nevertheless playing the eta card for all it is worth , boosted by the december 30 car bomb blast at madrid airport that killed two people . it was the first deadly attack since mid-2003 by the group in its violent campaign for independence for the northern basque country , breaking a self-declared truce that had raised hopes for a solution to the long-running crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister zapatero inspected the site of the eta blast at the madrid airport last december while the government promptly declared that eta had ruled itself out of any peace negotiations , the pp has now seized on zapatero 's decision to release conditionally basque militant jose ignacio de juana chaos , who had spent 20 years in jail for 25 murders . after being given a further prison term just ahead of his scheduled release for expressing support for eta in newspaper articles , juana chaos began a hunger strike which left him emaciated to the extent doctors feared for his life . in the face of pp charges of giving into eta blackmail , the government retorted that it had showed " humanitarian " clemency to juana chaos , while also fearing his death could have turned him into an eta martyr . zapatero also accused the pp of hypocrisy , pointing out that while last in power it released more than 300 eta prisoners before the end of their sentences . right-wingers are still prepared to drag in the march 11 bombings into their protests however : demonstrators against zapatero have carried placards reading , " spain is christian , not muslim .

" there is no cooperation in sight on a strengthening of lebanon 's sovereignty , " merkel said , speaking at a european-israeli dialogue in berlin . " everything is pointing to syria 's not being able or not being willing to take a step in the direction of the great majority of the international community , " she said , adding however that " the door " was open . eu countries currently make up the bulk of an expanded 12,000-strong un peace force deployed last year in lebanon alongside lebanese troops . solana said his visit next week , sanctioned by eu heads of state and government who met in brussels last week for a summit , would be part of a general trip to the region that would also take in lebanon and saudi arabia . he said he had been mandated to take " a trip to syria , to tell the syrians what the situation is ... to tell them we want them to work with us and with the international community , particularly on the lebanon issue . " solana is scheduled to travel to saudi arabia on monday and is also expected to attend the march 28 summit of arab league leaders in riyadh . " a european road map " french president jacques chirac said he " approved without reservations " solana 's trip , adding that the eu official would go to the region " with a european road map " for future relations . chirac , who held lengthy talks with solana last week , said the visit would begin with a meeting with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , followed by talks with jordan 's king abdullah ii and then syrian president bashar al-assad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu forces make up the bulk of a 12,000-strong un peace force in lebanon eu officials had said that syria could not be approached in a concerted way by the bloc until chirac leaves office , which appears almost certain after presidential elections in may . an official with the french president 's delegation confirmed that an agreement had been reached on " the terms of reference of a personal mission by javier solana to go to syria , in the name of the european union . " he explained that chirac felt it was better to have a focused eu approach , rather than rely on attempts to engage the syrians by individual member countries , like contacts made through the german and spanish foreign ministers . eu officials acknowledge privately that they have been looking for a way to resume talks with syria and prise it away from the powerful influence of iran , which , like damascus , holds sway over the militant group hezbollah in lebanon . last week , eu leaders underlined their " determination to reinforce lebanon 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and independence . " in a statement , they " urged all members of the international community to lend their support " to efforts to set up a special tribunal to look into hariri 's killing . solana to press syria to play constructive role on a visit to brussels last week , saad hariri , the late prime minister 's son , accused syria of blocking moves to end a dangerous political deadlock in his country , as saudi arabia works to end it . " i believe that the main problem today is the syrian regime who is trying to stop this agreement , " saad hariri , who is also lebanon 's parliamentary majority leader , said . a european diplomatic source said solana will seek to impress on his lebanese hosts the value of syria playing a more constructive role in areas such as lebanon , iraq and the middle east peace process .
syria has received many iraqi refugees . the eu had finalized a partnership and cooperation agreement with syria in late 2004 , but the deal was frozen without being formally signed . the eu has remained syria 's main donor , giving it around 300 million euros worth of aid since 1995 . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel criticizes iran , syria during middle east tour chancellor angela merkel met emirati president khalifa monday as part of her efforts to revive the middle east peace process .

now you 're already being called the " little prince . "
where does the nickname come from ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is sosa be munich 's next big thing ?
when i was 15 years old and started training with studiantes , my coach and some teammates at the time thought my style was very similar to enzo francescoli 's .
back then he was the prince so i could only be a little prince .
i think the nickname is funny and i have gotten used to it . are you familiar with your future club ? who does n't know bayern munich ?
it 's one of the best clubs in the world .
an excellent team and a great place to be .
i watched the game against real madrid -lrb- the first of a pair that saw munich advance to the champions league quarterfinals on wednesday -rrb- and was impressed .
it is n't easy to get such a good result in madrid .
bayern showed how good they really are . the team has suffered from missing german captain michael ballack for the whole season .

i 've heard that munich is a great city , so that 's good to know . have you had any contact with martin demichelis , your countryman at bayern munich ? i do n't know him personally , unfortunately .

" strike " is not the first movie that german director völker schlöndorff filmed in poland .
his adaptation of the günter grass novel " the tin drum , " which was also made in the baltic sea port of gdansk , was awarded a best foreign language film oscar in 1980 . " eastern europe is my destiny , " schlöndorff said . schlöndorff based his latest movie , which premiered in germany this week - two weeks after its polish release - on the life of activist anna walentynowicz , a crane operator whose firing in august 1980 led 17,000 workers at the gdansk shipyard to put down their tools and join a movement that would eventually help topple communism . between fiction and history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlöndorff 's latest movie is based on true events inspired by walentynowicz and led by lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard , millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . despite the obvious similarities with walentynowicz , the film 's protagonist - agniezska - is a fictional character .
played by katharina thalbach , who also starred in " the tin drum , " she is brave , resolute , charismatic and uncompromising : both a faithful catholic and a convinced communist , a working , single mother on a personal quest for justice . " she 's a picture-book hero , i call her ' the hero of gdansk , " ' said schlöndorff .
" she has no intention of saving the world or even bringing communism down . " " at the same time , she 's a faithful catholic praying to her -lrb- pope john paul ii -rrb- woytila .
it is a story that reminds me of brecht 's ' saint joan of the stockyards , " ' he said . dreamers and politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : true heroism is n't necessarily glamorous in the movie , agniezska is portrayed as the emotional driving force behind the solidarity movement , but also as a modest person who will eventually become overshadowed by lech walesa , the masculine icon of the polish protests . in one scene of the movie , walesa - played by polish heartthrob andrzej chyra - tells her : " you are a dreamer .
and i do politics .
every ship needs a captain . " anna walentynowicz fell into obscurity after the protests achieved their goal and the movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as the soviet bloc 's only independent trade union .
lech walesa , on the other hand , remained in politics and won the nobel peace prize in 1983 . artistic rendering or misinterpretation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solidarity was a powerful social movement while " strike " is a tribute to the rise of solidarity , the movie caused quite a controversy when it was shown in poland last month .
it was slammed as " offensive " by several of the real-life heroes who founded the trade union . " this film does not present the true facts of anna walentynowicz 's life , " solidarity activist joanna gwiazda was quoted by the polish pap news agency . gwiazda said schlöndorff misrepresented walentynowicz as being illiterate and skewed facts about her personal life . joanna 's husband and fellow activist andrzej gwiazda also accused schlöndorff of misrepresenting poles and falling victim to national stereotypes . " the film shows poorly-educated and hard-drinking shipyard workers - it fits perfectly with the -lrb- false -rrb- vision of poles as drunks and thieves , " he said . a spokesperson for walentynowicz said the 77-year-old pensioner was threatening a lawsuit should schlöndorff refuse to cut several scenes she finds slanderous . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the oscar is an unbelievably powerful statue " dw-world spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck about how it feels to be nominated for an oscar for " the lives of others , " his film about an east german spy .

" strike " is not the first movie that german director völker schlöndorff filmed in poland .
his adaptation of the günter grass novel " the tin drum , " which was also made in the baltic sea port of gdansk , was awarded a best foreign language film oscar in 1980 . " eastern europe is my destiny , " schlöndorff said . schlöndorff based his latest movie , which premiered in germany this week - two weeks after its polish release - on the life of activist anna walentynowicz , a crane operator whose firing in august 1980 led 17,000 workers at the gdansk shipyard to put down their tools and join a movement that would eventually help topple communism . between fiction and history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlöndorff 's latest movie is based on true events inspired by walentynowicz and led by lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard , millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . despite the obvious similarities with walentynowicz , the film 's protagonist - agniezska - is a fictional character .

" when the sunlight completely fills the chamber , it 's like an explosion of light .
it 's a calm environment , a place of reflection , " one of the architects , esau acosta , from firm estudio fam told reuters . three days after the bombs , spain held general elections and voted out the conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- , a close us ally , putting in its place a socialist government that quickly fulfilled a pledge to pull spanish troops out of iraq . the trial of those accused of carrying out the attacks will hear from more than 600 witnesses and 100 experts before a panel of three judges gives its verdict , probably in early autumn . separate commemorations were held at two other stations hit by blasts on sunday . massive opposition demonstrations on the eve of the bombings anniversary , spain 's opposition conservative popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- organized a new mass rally against the government in madrid after bringing thousands out on the streets on friday evening in 65 towns and cities across the country . the pp is seeking to get its own back with unceasing attacks on the socialist government 's alleged soft line on basque separatism . under a banner reading , " spain for freedom .
no more concessions to eta " , the opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- has billed the protest as the most important demonstration in spain 's 30-year democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of people took part in opposition demonstrations over the weekend prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero said in the senate last week that the pp could not make up for its own past mistakes by stirring up political trouble against his government . " you were the ones who lost the march 14 -lrb- 2005 -rrb- elections ... through your own errors , " zapatero charged , singling out the pp 's backing for the us-led invasion of iraq and its insistence that the basque separatist movement eta carried out the train bombings . most spanish observers believe the bombs were planted by radical muslims angry at the decision in 2003 by then pp prime minister jose maria aznar to back the invasion and send spanish troops in support . however , pp hardliners and sections of the right-wing media insist on a " conspiracy theory " whereby eta might have colluded with islamists in the attacks on crowded commuter trains and stations . eta is classified in spain , in brussels and in washington as a terrorist group .
polls often show that spaniards view eta as their country 's biggest problem , part of a threat that also includes muslim extremism . " spain is christian " with municipal elections three months off and general elections next year , the pp is nevertheless playing the eta card for all it is worth , boosted by the december 30 car bomb blast at madrid airport that killed two people . it was the first deadly attack since mid-2003 by the group in its violent campaign for independence for the northern basque country , breaking a self-declared truce that had raised hopes for a solution to the long-running crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's prime minister zapatero inspected the site of the eta blast at the madrid airport last december while the government promptly declared that eta had ruled itself out of any peace negotiations , the pp has now seized on zapatero 's decision to release conditionally basque militant jose ignacio de juana chaos , who had spent 20 years in jail for 25 murders . after being given a further prison term just ahead of his scheduled release for expressing support for eta in newspaper articles , juana chaos began a hunger strike which left him emaciated to the extent doctors feared for his life . in the face of pp charges of giving into eta blackmail , the government retorted that it had showed " humanitarian " clemency to juana chaos , while also fearing his death could have turned him into an eta martyr . zapatero also accused the pp of hypocrisy , pointing out that while last in power it released more than 300 eta prisoners before the end of their sentences . right-wingers are still prepared to drag in the march 11 bombings into their protests however : demonstrators against zapatero have carried placards reading , " spain is christian , not muslim .

" everything is pointing to syria 's not being able or not being willing to take a step in the direction of the great majority of the international community , " she said , adding however that " the door " was open . eu countries currently make up the bulk of an expanded 12,000-strong un peace force deployed last year in lebanon alongside lebanese troops . solana said his visit next week , sanctioned by eu heads of state and government who met in brussels last week for a summit , would be part of a general trip to the region that would also take in lebanon and saudi arabia . he said he had been mandated to take " a trip to syria , to tell the syrians what the situation is ... to tell them we want them to work with us and with the international community , particularly on the lebanon issue . " solana is scheduled to travel to saudi arabia on monday and is also expected to attend the march 28 summit of arab league leaders in riyadh . " a european road map " french president jacques chirac said he " approved without reservations " solana 's trip , adding that the eu official would go to the region " with a european road map " for future relations . chirac , who held lengthy talks with solana last week , said the visit would begin with a meeting with lebanese prime minister fuad siniora , followed by talks with jordan 's king abdullah ii and then syrian president bashar al-assad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu forces make up the bulk of a 12,000-strong un peace force in lebanon eu officials had said that syria could not be approached in a concerted way by the bloc until chirac leaves office , which appears almost certain after presidential elections in may . an official with the french president 's delegation confirmed that an agreement had been reached on " the terms of reference of a personal mission by javier solana to go to syria , in the name of the european union . " he explained that chirac felt it was better to have a focused eu approach , rather than rely on attempts to engage the syrians by individual member countries , like contacts made through the german and spanish foreign ministers . eu officials acknowledge privately that they have been looking for a way to resume talks with syria and prise it away from the powerful influence of iran , which , like damascus , holds sway over the militant group hezbollah in lebanon . last week , eu leaders underlined their " determination to reinforce lebanon 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and independence . " in a statement , they " urged all members of the international community to lend their support " to efforts to set up a special tribunal to look into hariri 's killing . solana to press syria to play constructive role on a visit to brussels last week , saad hariri , the late prime minister 's son , accused syria of blocking moves to end a dangerous political deadlock in his country , as saudi arabia works to end it . " i believe that the main problem today is the syrian regime who is trying to stop this agreement , " saad hariri , who is also lebanon 's parliamentary majority leader , said . a european diplomatic source said solana will seek to impress on his lebanese hosts the value of syria playing a more constructive role in areas such as lebanon , iraq and the middle east peace process .

it appeared on the same day as iraqi militants threatened to kill german hostages . the group , which calls itself the " voice of the khalifate , " said germany and austria were provoking attacks by cooperating with the us . " why would you -lrb- germany -rrb- want all this -lrb- economic interests -rrb- threatened for the sake of bush and his band ?

" is n't it stupid to encourage the mujahideen to launch attacks in your country ? " a masked speaker said in the video which is in arabic language with german subtitles . the speaker in the video also said that austria relied on tourism for much of its revenue , adding : " this situation would change if there is a security threat and austria becomes a country targeted by the mujahideen . "
the speaker added that austria could have no interest in getting involved in a war between the mujahideen and the us . " do not destroy the security of a whole country for the sake of five soldiers you have sent to afghanistan , " said the speaker .

" strike " is not the first movie that german director völker schlöndorff filmed in poland .
his adaptation of the günter grass novel " the tin drum , " which was also made in the baltic sea port of gdansk , was awarded a best foreign language film oscar in 1980 . " eastern europe is my destiny , " schlöndorff said . schlöndorff based his latest movie , which premiered in germany this week - two weeks after its polish release - on the life of activist anna walentynowicz , a crane operator whose firing in august 1980 led 17,000 workers at the gdansk shipyard to put down their tools and join a movement that would eventually help topple communism . between fiction and history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlöndorff 's latest movie is based on true events inspired by walentynowicz and led by lech walesa , an electrician at the shipyard , millions of polish white and blue-collar workers took to the streets demanding better working conditions , even though only 10 years earlier similar strikes had ended in bloodshed with dozens of people killed by machine gun fire and over 1,000 injured . despite the obvious similarities with walentynowicz , the film 's protagonist - agniezska - is a fictional character .
played by katharina thalbach , who also starred in " the tin drum , " she is brave , resolute , charismatic and uncompromising : both a faithful catholic and a convinced communist , a working , single mother on a personal quest for justice . " she 's a picture-book hero , i call her ' the hero of gdansk , " ' said schlöndorff .
" she has no intention of saving the world or even bringing communism down . " " at the same time , she 's a faithful catholic praying to her -lrb- pope john paul ii -rrb- woytila .
it is a story that reminds me of brecht 's ' saint joan of the stockyards , " ' he said . dreamers and politicians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : true heroism is n't necessarily glamorous in the movie , agniezska is portrayed as the emotional driving force behind the solidarity movement , but also as a modest person who will eventually become overshadowed by lech walesa , the masculine icon of the polish protests . in one scene of the movie , walesa - played by polish heartthrob andrzej chyra - tells her : " you are a dreamer .
and i do politics .
every ship needs a captain . " anna walentynowicz fell into obscurity after the protests achieved their goal and the movement , which would soon be formally known as solidarity , was accepted as the soviet bloc 's only independent trade union .
lech walesa , on the other hand , remained in politics and won the nobel peace prize in 1983 . artistic rendering or misinterpretation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solidarity was a powerful social movement while " strike " is a tribute to the rise of solidarity , the movie caused quite a controversy when it was shown in poland last month .
it was slammed as " offensive " by several of the real-life heroes who founded the trade union . " this film does not present the true facts of anna walentynowicz 's life , " solidarity activist joanna gwiazda was quoted by the polish pap news agency . gwiazda said schlöndorff misrepresented walentynowicz as being illiterate and skewed facts about her personal life . joanna 's husband and fellow activist andrzej gwiazda also accused schlöndorff of misrepresenting poles and falling victim to national stereotypes . " the film shows poorly-educated and hard-drinking shipyard workers - it fits perfectly with the -lrb- false -rrb- vision of poles as drunks and thieves , " he said . a spokesperson for walentynowicz said the 77-year-old pensioner was threatening a lawsuit should schlöndorff refuse to cut several scenes she finds slanderous . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : " the oscar is an unbelievably powerful statue " dw-world spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck about how it feels to be nominated for an oscar for " the lives of others , " his film about an east german spy .

the poor conditions have significantly reduced ocean temperatures , making them the coolest for up to five years .
it has been a blessing for the corals - usually in the summer they are at risk of serious scorching and bleaching .
the great barrier reef is the world 's largest living organism , stretching over more than 345,000 sq km .
it is also the world 's most protected marine area and has been under threat from a combination of global warming , pollution and over-fishing .
cooler water scientists had predicted that this summer would be a tough one for the reef .
they feared that extreme heat would scorch the coral .
but recent storms that dumped torrential rain across much of australia 's north-east have brought some unexpected good news .
great barrier reef more than 2,000 km long home to 1,500 types of fish only living thing the naked eye can see from space the region 's normally warm seas have been stirred .
jeff maynard of the great barrier reef marine park authority says the water has become cooler .
" this year reef temperatures have shown that temperatures for the majority of the great barrier marine park are below the long-term averages we see for this time of year , " he said .
" so right now we 're considering bleaching risks to be low compared to bleaching years like ' 98 and 2002 . "
the future , however , still does not look good .
researchers believe as the world 's climate continues to change the bleaching of the coral will become increasingly common .
bleaching occurs when unusually warm seas cause the organisms that make up the coral to die .
all that is left is a white limestone skeleton .
the great barrier reef is home to 1,500 types of fish and at more than 2,000 km long , it is the only living thing the naked eye can see from space .

the party will publish a consultation document on sunday asking people for their views on various proposals .
the proposals include levying vat or fuel duty on domestic flights and a green air miles scheme .
shadow chancellor george osborne said the tax proposals would be targeted at frequent fliers and not families taking their annual holiday .
another measure under consideration in the greener skies consultation paper is scrapping air passenger duty and replacing it with a new " per flight " tax based on carbon emissions .
bbc political correspondent sean curran said the conservatives had been forced to " grasp the nettle " of tackling air travel by making the environment one of the party 's political priorities .
but he said it remained to be seen whether voters would accept the measures as necessary to tackle climate change .
' maximum impact ' mr osborne said : " we 're saying that taxes on aviation need to increase .
" that 's because we think you need to take the tough long-term decisions to tackle climate change . "
but he said the taxes needed to be designed so that they did not " hit people who only have one package holiday a year " and that they target " more dirty engines on aeroplanes " .
" that way we have the maximum environmental effect and we also do n't tax people out of their one foreign holiday a year , " he said .
he added that the measures would not mean an overall increase in taxes for families because for every pound the party increased aviation taxation , a pound would be cut in taxes elsewhere .
dave timms , of friends of the earth , welcomed the proposals to tackle the environmental problems of air travel .
" what 's good about this announcement is that the conservatives are recognising that the cost of aviation has to rise , " he told the bbc . "
we believe taxation is an extremely blunt instrument in terms of reducing carbon emissions " british airways send us your comments " aviation is the fastest growing area of the uk 's carbon emissions , and if we do n't do something about it we have no chance of meeting international targets , or any targets that the government might set . "
but the treasury said the green taxes would not have the intended effect of reducing greenhouse gases .
a spokesman said : " for example , domestic taxation of aviation fuel in the uk would only lead to importation of fuel from countries where tax is not levied . "
' damage economy ' transport secretary douglas alexander accused the tories of being " more interested in making a headline " .
he said : " there is no evidence they have thought through these proposals .
" at the most basic level the taxation of aviation fuel is governed by international law and can not be changed at a whim . "
virgin atlantic said " green " taxes would not work and urged the conservatives to invest instead in developing lighter and cleaner planes and fossil-free fuels .
the airline 's communications director , paul charles , said the proposals " would damage the uk economy " because they would " make uk airlines less competitive and shift jobs to other countries in europe " .
british airways said taxation was " an extremely blunt instrument in terms of reducing carbon emissions " .
easyjet dismissed air passenger duty as " probably the worst tax ever invented " but it gave a cautious welcome to the idea of a " per flight " tax , saying it would help to sideline airlines using " dirty " aircraft .

the party will publish a consultation document on sunday asking people for their views on various proposals .
the proposals include levying vat or fuel duty on domestic flights and a green air miles scheme .
shadow chancellor george osborne said the tax proposals would be targeted at frequent fliers and not families taking their annual holiday .
another measure under consideration in the greener skies consultation paper is scrapping air passenger duty and replacing it with a new " per flight " tax based on carbon emissions .
bbc political correspondent sean curran said the conservatives had been forced to " grasp the nettle " of tackling air travel by making the environment one of the party 's political priorities .
but he said it remained to be seen whether voters would accept the measures as necessary to tackle climate change .
' maximum impact ' mr osborne said : " we 're saying that taxes on aviation need to increase .
" that 's because we think you need to take the tough long-term decisions to tackle climate change . "
george osborne said the target was not the annual family holiday but he said the taxes needed to be designed so that they did not " hit people who only have one package holiday a year " and that they target " more dirty engines on aeroplanes " .
" that way we have the maximum environmental effect and we also do n't tax people out of their one foreign holiday a year , " he said .
he added that the measures would not mean an overall increase in taxes for families because for every pound the party increased aviation taxation , a pound would be cut in taxes elsewhere .
dave timms , of friends of the earth , welcomed the proposals to tackle the environmental problems of air travel .

a spokesman said : " for example , domestic taxation of aviation fuel in the uk would only lead to importation of fuel from countries where tax is not levied . "

virgin atlantic said " green " taxes would not work and urged the conservatives to invest instead in developing lighter and cleaner planes and fossil-free fuels .

" the german g8 presidency in 2007 has made development in africa a top priority which shows continued determination by rich countries to help tackle the issues facing the continent , " hilary benn added .
' dignity ' mr geldof said if wealthy countries broke their promises over africa it would " kill the poor " on that continent .
" when they put their name , they sign the pride , the honour , and the dignity of their respective countries .
you do not break that , " he told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
" you particularly do n't break it because the promise of the rich to the poor broken , kills the poor . "
european leaders signed an agreement on aid and trade at the g8 summit at gleneagles two years ago .
oxfam said mr blair 's " vision " on aid risked being deeply undermined .
mr geldof said europe was guilty of ignoring the situation in africa , as the european union marks its 50th anniversary .
natural resources he said : " on our 50th birthday anniversary we are silent about our closest neighbour and where potentially two million people will be killed in one region alone , darfur .
" what have europe got to say on our 50th birthday about this ?
nothing , absolutely nothing . "
mr geldof accused china , amongst others , of exploiting africa 's natural resources .
" into the vacuum of our lack of fulfilment have stepped the chinese , who do not care about the values of democracy , transparency and accountability , and said ' we 'll give you the money so long as we have influence over your resources and your politics ' , " he said .
mr geldof praised the prime minister 's international lead on africa , and said he thought this would be continued by gordon brown if he succeeded mr blair as prime minister .
the government has said it is committed to spending 0.7 % of national wealth on aid by 2013 , two years ahead of a un target .

the charity says donations from rich nations have fallen since the prime minister 's commission for africa report two years ago sought more aid .
campaigner bob geldof criticised european leaders for losing interest in africa since the gleneagles agreement .
the international development secretary said the uk was working to ensure g8 donors keep the promises made .
" the german g8 presidency in 2007 has made development in africa a top priority which shows continued determination by rich countries to help tackle the issues facing the continent , " hilary benn added .
' dignity ' mr geldof said if wealthy countries broke their promises over africa it would " kill the poor " on that continent .
" when they put their name , they sign the pride , the honour , and the dignity of their respective countries .
you do not break that , " he told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
" you particularly do n't break it because the promise of the rich to the poor broken , kills the poor . "
european leaders signed an agreement on aid and trade at the g8 summit at gleneagles two years ago .
oxfam said mr blair 's " vision " on aid risked being deeply undermined .
mr geldof said europe was guilty of ignoring the situation in africa , as the european union marks its 50th anniversary .
natural resources he said : " on our 50th birthday anniversary we are silent about our closest neighbour and where potentially two million people will be killed in one region alone , darfur .
" what have europe got to say on our 50th birthday about this ?
nothing , absolutely nothing . "
mr geldof accused china , amongst others , of exploiting africa 's natural resources .
" into the vacuum of our lack of fulfilment have stepped the chinese , who do not care about the values of democracy , transparency and accountability , and said ' we 'll give you the money so long as we have influence over your resources and your politics ' , " he said .
mr geldof praised the prime minister 's international lead on africa , and said he thought this would be continued by gordon brown if he succeeded mr blair as prime minister .
the government has said it is committed to spending 0.7 % of national wealth on aid by 2013 , two years ahead of a un target .

virgin said the taxes would damage the uk economy , and british airways called them an " extremely blunt instrument " to tackle carbon emissions .
the proposals include levying vat or fuel duty on domestic flights and a green air miles scheme .
shadow chancellor george osborne said the taxes would be targeted at frequent fliers and not family holidays .
another measure under consideration in the greener skies consultation paper is scrapping air passenger duty and replacing it with a new " per flight " tax based on carbon emissions .
the party publishes the document on sunday and will ask people for their views on various proposals .
mr osborne said : " we 're saying that taxes on aviation need to increase .
osborne interview " that 's because we think you need to take the tough long-term decisions to tackle climate change . "
but he said the taxes needed to be designed so that they did not " hit people who only have one package holiday a year " and that they target " more dirty engines on aeroplanes " .
" that way we have the maximum environmental effect and we also do n't tax people out of their one foreign holiday a year , " he said .
he added that the measures would not mean an overall increase in taxes for families because for every pound the party increased aviation taxation , a pound would be cut in taxes elsewhere .
' shift jobs ' virgin atlantic said " green " taxes would not work and urged the conservatives to invest instead in developing lighter and cleaner planes and fossil-free fuels .
we believe taxation is an extremely blunt instrument in terms of reducing carbon emissions british airways send us your comments travellers give their views the airline 's communications director paul charles said the proposals " would damage the uk economy " because they would " make uk airlines less competitive and shift jobs to other countries in europe " .
british airways said taxation was " an extremely blunt instrument in terms of reducing carbon emissions " .
easyjet dismissed air passenger duty as " probably the worst tax ever invented " but it gave a cautious welcome to the idea of a " per flight " tax , saying it would help to sideline airlines using " dirty " aircraft .
chris goater from the airport operators association said aviation accounted for a very low percentage of world co2 emissions , and that the issue had to be tackled internationally .
international law transport secretary douglas alexander accused the tories of being " more interested in making a headline " .
he said : " there is no evidence they have thought through these proposals .
" at the most basic level the taxation of aviation fuel is governed by international law and can not be changed at a whim . "
the treasury said the green taxes would not have the intended effect of reducing greenhouse gases .
' fastest growing ' dave timms of friends of the earth welcomed the proposals to tackle the environmental problems of air travel .
he said : " aviation is the fastest growing area of the uk 's carbon emissions , and if we do n't do something about it we have no chance of meeting international targets , or any targets that the government might set . "
bbc news political correspondent robin brant says conservative leader david cameron feels the environment is a vote winner .
our correspondent said : " the conservatives are saying this is about shifting the burden of taxes , so some people will pay more in tax , but there are others they claim - families - who will pay less tax .

virgin said the taxes would damage the uk economy , and british airways called them an " extremely blunt instrument " to tackle carbon emissions .
the proposals include levying vat or fuel duty on domestic flights and a green air miles scheme .
shadow chancellor george osborne said the taxes would be targeted at frequent fliers and not family holidays .
another measure under consideration in the greener skies consultation paper is scrapping air passenger duty and replacing it with a new " per flight " tax based on carbon emissions .
the party publishes the document on sunday and will ask people for their views on various proposals .
mr osborne said : " we 're saying that taxes on aviation need to increase .
osborne interview " that 's because we think you need to take the tough long-term decisions to tackle climate change . "
but he said the taxes needed to be designed so that they did not " hit people who only have one package holiday a year " and that they target " more dirty engines on aeroplanes " .
" that way we have the maximum environmental effect and we also do n't tax people out of their one foreign holiday a year , " he said .
he added that the measures would not mean an overall increase in taxes for families because for every pound the party increased aviation taxation , a pound would be cut in taxes elsewhere .

british airways said taxation was " an extremely blunt instrument in terms of reducing carbon emissions " .
easyjet dismissed air passenger duty as " probably the worst tax ever invented " but it gave a cautious welcome to the idea of a " per flight " tax , saying it would help to sideline airlines using " dirty " aircraft .
chris goater from the airport operators association said aviation accounted for a very low percentage of world co2 emissions , and that the issue had to be tackled internationally .
international law transport secretary douglas alexander accused the tories of being " more interested in making a headline " .
he said : " there is no evidence they have thought through these proposals .
" at the most basic level the taxation of aviation fuel is governed by international law and can not be changed at a whim . "
the treasury said the green taxes would not have the intended effect of reducing greenhouse gases .
