in the first leg real won 3-2 at home , but bayern hope things will be different in munich . the first leg two weeks ago was a bit like a battle between bruce springsteen and prince : the bavarians who used to be boss against the artists formerly known as the galacticos .
languishing in fourth place in their respective national leagues , both bayern and real were looking to restore some pride in tuesday 's match at bernabeu .
and both teams got some of what they wanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern had trouble coping with real 's pace real showed they meant business from the opening whistle and had their home fans cheering in the 10th minute , when raul muscled his way past a furiously sliding bayern keeper oliver kahn in the box .
the veteran striker slotted home to put the hosts up 1-0 . munich had trouble putting together combinations , but thanks to a set piece they got the equalizer thirteen minutes later .
bayern oldie-but-goodie willy sagnol blasted a free kick from around 40 meters out , and defender lucio headed beyond reach real keeper iker casillas . last hurrahs before hollywood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham is a no-go in munich after getting injured the rest of the first half was all madrid .
surprisingly the main motor of their impressive run was much-maligned midfielder david beckham , who is headed for los angeles in the summer and who had recently been left out of the squad . beckham was clearly out to prove he 's not washed up .
in the 28th minute , he fired a corner across the mouth of the goal .
defender ivan helguera headed the ball into the upper right corner , brushing raul 's hair in the process .
real were back in the lead . six minutes later , beckham pushed the ball forward , where it eventually found a criminally unmarked ruud van nistelrooy .
the dutchman fired home from five meters to give madrid a 3-1 advantage . real 's first half showed a return to the fluid attacking style that gained them the champions league title in 2002 .

beckham curled a lethal-looking free kick toward the upper-left-hand corner of goal , but kahn acrobatically parried it to keep the visitors in the game . after that , real curiously chose to pack it in at the back - never a madrid strong point even in the club 's best years . for half an hour , it looked as though real might be able to hold their two-goal advantage .
bayern 's lack of true playmaker was all too apparent as they seldom created open shots on goal . but in 79th minute , substitute bayern striker claudio pizarro was narrowly denied by casillas from 10 meters .
two minutes from time , midfielder mark van bommel drop-kicked a short real clearance into the back of the net for the final 3-2 scoreline . glass half-full or half-empty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel flexed his muscles late in the match the result was a bit of balsam for the wounded pride of these two former titans .
speaking after the match , kahn said " this is one of those losses that feels like a victory . " indeed , both sides played to a higher standard than their critics thought them capable of , treating fans to one of the better matches of this champions league season . but the game also showed that bayern - despite van bommel 's late goal - still need a creative director in midfield .
and real 's late weakness suggested that the squad is perhaps too old to pile on pressure over 90 minutes .
plus , beckham is out with injury for the return match . that sets the stage for a tough battle when the two teams play their return leg in munich on march 7 .
a 1-0 win for bayern would be enough to send them through to the tournament 's next round and force real to question why they failed to seal this encounter when they had the chance . whichever team comes up short in munich will be in for some harsh scrutiny from media and fans .

nine eu countries currently have a registration fee or motor vehicle tax contingent on co2 emissions , according to the association of european car-makers . austria , the netherlands and portugal reward owners of environmentally friendly cars with sliding registration fees .
in denmark , sweden and great britain , the vehicle tax is determined by the level of co2 emissions . car-owners with low-emission vehicles are given break on both the one-time registration fee and the annual vehicle tax in belgium , france and cyprus . in great britain , owners of vehicles that emit less that 100 grams of co2 per kilometer pay no tax at all , whereas the annual rate for diesel vehicles emitting more than 225 grams per kilometer is a hefty 320 euros -lrb- $ 421 -rrb- .

" changing the tax in england has already had an effect on which new cars people buy , " said uwe kunert , transportation expert from the german institute for economic research .
sweden is experiencing the same effect . in the netherlands , tax revenues fell so dramatically that the government had to alter the tax reforms .

" there 's has n't been any overwhelming successes yet .

nine eu countries currently have a registration fee or motor vehicle tax contingent on co2 emissions , according to the association of european car-makers . austria , the netherlands and portugal reward owners of environmentally friendly cars with sliding registration fees .
in denmark , sweden and great britain , the vehicle tax is determined by the level of co2 emissions . car-owners with low-emission vehicles are given break on both the one-time registration fee and the annual vehicle tax in belgium , france and cyprus . in great britain , owners of vehicles that emit less that 100 grams of co2 per kilometer pay no tax at all , whereas the annual rate for diesel vehicles emitting more than 225 grams per kilometer is a hefty 320 euros -lrb- $ 421 -rrb- .
france has a similar system for company cars . in sweden , drivers pay 1.62 euros for every gram of co2 over 100 grams per kilometer that their vehicle emits . reaping the benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the us be the next to reward drivers for choosing planet-friendly vehicles ?
" changing the tax in england has already had an effect on which new cars people buy , " said uwe kunert , transportation expert from the german institute for economic research .
sweden is experiencing the same effect . in the netherlands , tax revenues fell so dramatically that the government had to alter the tax reforms .
kunert is cautious not to count any chickens before they hatch , however . " it 's still difficult for most countries , " he said .
" there 's has n't been any overwhelming successes yet . " the price tag on the planet in germany , the success of reforms will depend on the affordability of environmentally friendly motors . low-emission models like volkswagen three-liter lupo disappeared from the market because they were too expensive - but also because not enough advertising was done .

nine eu countries currently have a registration fee or motor vehicle tax contingent on co2 emissions , according to the association of european car-makers . austria , the netherlands and portugal reward owners of environmentally friendly cars with sliding registration fees .
in denmark , sweden and great britain , the vehicle tax is determined by the level of co2 emissions . car-owners with low-emission vehicles are given break on both the one-time registration fee and the annual vehicle tax in belgium , france and cyprus . in great britain , owners of vehicles that emit less that 100 grams of co2 per kilometer pay no tax at all , whereas the annual rate for diesel vehicles emitting more than 225 grams per kilometer is a hefty 320 euros -lrb- $ 421 -rrb- .
france has a similar system for company cars . in sweden , drivers pay 1.62 euros for every gram of co2 over 100 grams per kilometer that their vehicle emits . reaping the benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the us be the next to reward drivers for choosing planet-friendly vehicles ?
" changing the tax in england has already had an effect on which new cars people buy , " said uwe kunert , transportation expert from the german institute for economic research .
sweden is experiencing the same effect . in the netherlands , tax revenues fell so dramatically that the government had to alter the tax reforms .
kunert is cautious not to count any chickens before they hatch , however . " it 's still difficult for most countries , " he said .
" there 's has n't been any overwhelming successes yet . " the price tag on the planet in germany , the success of reforms will depend on the affordability of environmentally friendly motors . low-emission models like volkswagen three-liter lupo disappeared from the market because they were too expensive - but also because not enough advertising was done .

in the first leg real won 3-2 at home , but bayern hope things will be different in munich . the first leg two weeks ago was a bit like a battle between bruce springsteen and prince : the bavarians who used to be boss against the artists formerly known as the galacticos .
languishing in fourth place in their respective national leagues , both bayern and real were looking to restore some pride in tuesday 's match at bernabeu .
and both teams got some of what they wanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern had trouble coping with real 's pace real showed they meant business from the opening whistle and had their home fans cheering in the 10th minute , when raul muscled his way past a furiously sliding bayern keeper oliver kahn in the box .
the veteran striker slotted home to put the hosts up 1-0 . munich had trouble putting together combinations , but thanks to a set piece they got the equalizer thirteen minutes later .
bayern oldie-but-goodie willy sagnol blasted a free kick from around 40 meters out , and defender lucio headed beyond reach real keeper iker casillas . last hurrahs before hollywood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham is a no-go in munich after getting injured the rest of the first half was all madrid .
surprisingly the main motor of their impressive run was much-maligned midfielder david beckham , who is headed for los angeles in the summer and who had recently been left out of the squad . beckham was clearly out to prove he 's not washed up .
in the 28th minute , he fired a corner across the mouth of the goal .
defender ivan helguera headed the ball into the upper right corner , brushing raul 's hair in the process .
real were back in the lead . six minutes later , beckham pushed the ball forward , where it eventually found a criminally unmarked ruud van nistelrooy .
the dutchman fired home from five meters to give madrid a 3-1 advantage . real 's first half showed a return to the fluid attacking style that gained them the champions league title in 2002 .
meanwhile bayern were plagued by the midfield sluggishness and defensive lapses that have characterized their mediocre season . a familiar face comes up big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thanks to kahn , bayern avoided disaster the match could have turned into a debacle for munich in the second half , were it not for a sterling play by their 37-year-old keeper .
beckham curled a lethal-looking free kick toward the upper-left-hand corner of goal , but kahn acrobatically parried it to keep the visitors in the game . after that , real curiously chose to pack it in at the back - never a madrid strong point even in the club 's best years . for half an hour , it looked as though real might be able to hold their two-goal advantage .
bayern 's lack of true playmaker was all too apparent as they seldom created open shots on goal . but in 79th minute , substitute bayern striker claudio pizarro was narrowly denied by casillas from 10 meters .
two minutes from time , midfielder mark van bommel drop-kicked a short real clearance into the back of the net for the final 3-2 scoreline . glass half-full or half-empty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel flexed his muscles late in the match the result was a bit of balsam for the wounded pride of these two former titans .
speaking after the match , kahn said " this is one of those losses that feels like a victory . " indeed , both sides played to a higher standard than their critics thought them capable of , treating fans to one of the better matches of this champions league season . but the game also showed that bayern - despite van bommel 's late goal - still need a creative director in midfield .
and real 's late weakness suggested that the squad is perhaps too old to pile on pressure over 90 minutes .
plus , beckham is out with injury for the return match . that sets the stage for a tough battle when the two teams play their return leg in munich on march 7 .
a 1-0 win for bayern would be enough to send them through to the tournament 's next round and force real to question why they failed to seal this encounter when they had the chance . whichever team comes up short in munich will be in for some harsh scrutiny from media and fans .
real and bayern are accustomed to silverware .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de peacekeeping -pipe- 21.02.2007 britain , denmark to pull out troops from iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has over 7,000 soldiers in iraq britain , along with denmark , confirmed it would begin a major troop withdrawal from iraq in coming months and lithuania too has indicated it may follow suit .
washington however denies its coalition is crumbling . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday the british force in southern iraq would drop from 7,100 to 5,500 in coming months and could fall below 5,000 this year . blair , who has seen his popularity erode at home over his decision to go to war , said that soldiers however would remain into 2008 to provide support and training if iraq wanted . following britain 's lead , denmark and lithuania said they would withdraw most of their troops by august . denmark said its 430 ground troops would leave by august this year .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said the decision to withdraw troops was " taken together with our coalition allies , namely britain . " lithuanian defence minister juozas olekas told the baltic news service -lrb- bns -rrb- agency it was a " realistic possibility " that lithuania would not replace its 50 troops when their mission in iraq ends in august . the lithuanians are serving with a danish battalion near the southern city of basra , within the british-led multinational division .
like fellow baltic states latvia and estonia , lithuania joined nato in 2004 , and has been a staunch supporter of the united states in iraq . a string of other countries which sent troops either from the outset or later have already withdrawn from iraq , and others are planning to do so in the coming months . south korea and poland , with the largest contingents after the us and britain , have said they will leave by the end of the year . " next chapter can be written by iraqis " britain 's move was particularly important for washington as it is the second largest part of the us-led force in iraq after the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair said the peacekeeping reins had to be gradually handed over to the iraqis blair has faced huge domestic pressure over the unpopular war but he would not give a timetable for a complete british withdrawal . " the uk military presence will continue into 2008 for as long as we are wanted and have a job to do , " the prime minister told the british parliament on wednesday . british , danish and other multinational troops have been concentrated around the southern city of basra , which blair said remains " dangerous " but had improved enough for security to be handed over to iraqi forces . " what all this means is not that basra is how we want it to be , but it does mean that the next chapter in basra 's history can be written by iraqis , " blair said .
" increasingly our role will be supporting training and our numbers will be able to reduce accordingly , " he said . blair said british forces that remain would train iraqi troops , secure the iraq-iran border and supply routes and boost the ability of iraqi forces to conduct operations against extremist groups . blair 's unwavering support for president george w. bush over the us-led invasion in march 2003 has undermined his support at home .
britain put 40,000 troops into the invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six danish soldiers have been killed since 2003 in the violence in iraq in denmark , the government has been under increasing pressure to withdraw from iraq , and in january rasmussen voiced hopes that troop numbers could be reduced during 2007 .
six danish soldiers have been killed in iraq since 2003 . a poll published in early february showed that 64 percent of danes were " opposed " or " vehemently opposed " to the troop presence . meanwhile , bulgaria 's parliament voted on wednesday to extend the presence of the 155 bulgarian troops in iraq by a year . us denies coalition is crumbling britain 's announcement threw the spotlight on the us strategy in iraq , which has heightened bush 's unpopularity with the us public . us secretary of state condoleezza rice denied that the us-led coalition was crumbling . " the coalition remains intact and in fact the british still have thousands of soldiers deployed in iraq , in the south , " rice said in berlin .
she said the british pullout was part of the coalition strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said in berlin wednesday that the us-led coalition was not crumbling " it is the plan that as it is possible to transfer responsibilities to the iraqis , coalition forces would no longer be needed in those circumstances . " blair telephoned the us president on tuesday to warn him of the announcement , the white house said . " president bush sees this as a sign of success and what is possible for us once we help the iraqis deal with the sectarian violence in baghdad , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe . vice president dick cheney said the british drawdown was justified given the situation in basra , but stressed there could be no retreat from iraq . " i want you to know that the american people will not support a policy of retreat , " cheney said on the uss kitty hawk aircraft carrier while on a trip to japan .
" we want to complete the mission , we want to get it done right , and we want to return with honor , " he said . australian prime minister john howard , another strong backer of the us-led invasion , said he would not reduce australia 's 550 combat troops in iraq , part of a 1,400-strong force in the country . the united states has about 138,000 troops in iraq and has started sending another 21,500 to baghdad and surrounding provinces where the insurgency and sectarian violence has worsened in recent months . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost half of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .
dw 's peter philipp believes blair is playing a dangerous game .

" it is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings , including hospitals , have been artificially bloated by these cartels , " competition commissioner neelie kroes said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes says the damage caused by the cartel will last for many years " the national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong , but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway , " she said .
" the damage caused by this cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and elevators - for these companies the memory of this fine should last just as long , " she added . german firm gets stiffest fine german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the heaviest fine ever imposed by eu regulators on a single company in a cartel case because it was a repeated offender .
the german group was fined 480 million euros . otis , a unit of us conglomerate united technologies corporation , was given a fine of 225 million euros for its role , followed by schindler with a penalty of 144 million euros and kone with 142 million euros . eu antitrust investigators conducted so-called " dawn raids " on lift and escalator makers across europe in january 2004 after getting a tip off about the cartel .
after the raids , the companies handed over more evidence in the hope of winning leniency or reduced fines . the european commission said that high-ranking national-level management ran the cartel by holding secret meetings in bars and restaurants .
they also visited the countryside and traveled abroad and used pre-paid mobile phone cards to avoid regulators ' scrutiny . eu campaign against illegal cartels kroes , europe 's top antitrust regulator , is leading a campaign against illegal cartels and has been chalking up record fines against companies targeted by her crackdown . after bumper fines in 2006 , eu regulators in january ordered 10 companies to pay 750 million euros for fixing prices and carving up the market in electrical generation equipment .
after the lift makers case , that fine is now the third biggest ever against a cartel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the stiffest penalty until wednesday , the biggest fine in a european cartel case was 855 million euros in penalties imposed on eight vitamin makers in 2001 .
the vitamin makers ' fine was later reduced to 790 million euros by an eu court . despite the record fine on the lift makers , higher penalties are likely in future cases after the commission tightened its rules for calculating fines , making them heavier for repeat offenders and long-lasting cartels .
the reform could potentially cost guilty companies up to 10 times more than before . the commission was also given a boost in its anti-cartel campaign earlier this month with a ruling from the european court of justice that gave regulators more freedom to fix fines , especially how far back regulators can take previous offences into account . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission slaps huge fine on siemens for price fixing the eu has fined power equipment manufacturers for their roles in a price-fixing scheme .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 21.02.2007 opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost a quarter of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .
dw 's peter philipp believes blair is playing a dangerous game . despite not being able to influence events in iraq through his actions , british prime minister tony blair can at least use the situation there for his own domestic purposes .
news that blair intends to withdraw almost a quarter of the british occupation force in iraq - 1,600 of some 7,000 soldiers stationed there - can not be seen in any other light .
it is no coincidence that public opinion back in the uk is in favor of a withdrawal , while the fact that blair has already announced his resignation means he may not be around to face the consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair finds himself in a very difficult position .
up until now , the prime minister was the united states ' most dependable ally in iraq but now he appears to be jumping ship just at the moment when president george w. bush is looking to strengthen the troop deployment in the country .
blair could face the wrath of a president betrayed .
while there is certainly a difference between the operations of the us forces in their crackdown on insurgents and criminal gangs in baghdad and the british occupation of the relatively less volatile southern city of basra , a withdrawal of the british contingent at a time when more not fewer troops is the message from washington is certainly a risk .
one way in which blair could avoid the rapprochement of the americans while scoring a domestic success would be to declare " mission accomplished . "
however , washington will know better than most how successful the british contribution to security in iraq has been while the british public would be unlikely to suddenly view the iraq adventure in a better light just because the troops are now coming home .
at best , blair will be seen in the uk as trying to rectify what is seen as the biggest mistake of his premiership and as trying to shake off the shackles of us loyalty before he departs the political arena .
it is unlikely that much will be changed in iraq 's situation by the british departure .
the main fear is that the shiite majority in the south will rise up against the occupying forces and that the united states , with enough on their plate in baghdad and the rest of the country , will then be over-stretched .
this would surely end blair 's dream of being inducted in the us hall of fame for honorable allies .
however there is little to suggest that any such uprising would happen .
the iraqi shiites have absolutely no interest in openly engaging the occupation forces , especially when they hold a majority of power in the iraqi government already .
there is no need to fight for something that has already been handed to them by a democratic process .
the only conceivable danger would be a confrontation between the united states and iran .
tehran could activate allies in iraq to make life very complicated for the americans and where better to ferment unrest than in southern iraq , an area of the country which would have been weakened by a partial british withdrawal ? peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and a middle east expert -lrb- nda -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe says saddam 's execution solves no problems for iraq as european nations criticized the execution of saddam hussein out of opposition to the death penalty , sunday newspapers across the continent were pessimistic as to whether the hanging would solve any of iraq 's problems .

" those are not principles put there to be an obstacle , they are put there because they 're foundational for peace , " she said . " it 's very difficult to imagine a circumstance where you have peace talks but one party does n't recognize the existence of the other , " rice said . hamas , which the us , european union and israel consider a terrorist organization , has not yet clearly agreed to the west 's conditions of recognizing israel , renouncing violence and honoring past agreements with the jewish state . rice also emphasized the importance of continuing to support abbas in his power struggle with iranian-backed hamas . inconclusive summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ehud olmert -lrb- r -rrb- , rice and palestinian president mahmoud abbas -lrb- l -rrb- at talsk in jerusalem on monday rice held an inconclusive summit monday in jerusalem with abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert . steinmeier , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called the meeting " a first step " but noted that hopes for peace were complicated by the fraught negotiations on the formation of a palestinian government . " that is why we need to be particularly realistic going into these talks , " he said , referring to the quartet gathering . " we are nevertheless determined to seize this opportunity , " he said . russia and the un said they would use the berlin meeting to push for the unity government to be recognized .
moscow said it would call for the removal of aid and diplomatic boycotts imposed on the palestinian government after it fell under hamas ' control following january 2006 elections . growing unease the embargo imposed by the quartet after the 2006 elections has caused widespread economic hardship in the palestinian areas and there is growing unease in europe over the measures . the spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , cristina gallach , said that palestinian unity was a crucial step forward but indicated it was too early to consider lifting the embargo . " obviously one can not put everything on the table because they are still in negotiations - we have not yet seen the composition of the government , " she said . un chief ban ki-moon said in berlin ahead of the quartet talks that he was " encouraged " by the power-sharing deal between fatah and hamas . bildunterschrift : quartet members at a washington meeting defending the unity government abbas , long portrayed by washington as the best " partner for peace " with israel , has embarked on a diplomatic offensive of his own .
he is touring europe to defend the unity government deal . he insists the agreement reached between his fatah party and hamas should satisfy the quartet principles since it obliges the new unity government to respect international resolutions and agreements signed by the fatah-led palestine liberation organisation - meaning deals with the jewish state . palestinians urged the quartet powers to give their incoming government a chance . " we hope the quartet will take a positive approach towards the government and not resort to pressure and boycott , " said ghazi hamad , spokesman for the hamas-led government . israel has ruled out dealing with any government that includes hamas . it reiterated its hope that the quartet will stick to the conditions imposed on the palestinian government for the aid boycott to be lifted .

it is seeking the ministers ' approval of the plan in order to get backing from eu leaders at a march 8-9 summit in brussels . details of how eu nations - especially eu newcomers from central and eastern europe - would share-out the emission reductions still had to be worked out , gabriel said . earlier , several eu states including finland , hungary and poland had argued against binding targets on reducing co2 emission levels after 2012 . however , calls for firmer action had come , among others , from slovenia , spain and britain which said all eu states must stand up and commit to serious climate action or lose their " leadership role " on the issue . germany , which currently holds the european union 's six-month rotating presidency as well heads the g8 , has made tackling climate change a key priority .

in the first leg real won 3-2 at home , but bayern hope things will be different in munich . the first leg two weeks ago was a bit like a battle between bruce springsteen and prince : the bavarians who used to be boss against the artists formerly known as the galacticos .
languishing in fourth place in their respective national leagues , both bayern and real were looking to restore some pride in tuesday 's match at bernabeu .
and both teams got some of what they wanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern had trouble coping with real 's pace real showed they meant business from the opening whistle and had their home fans cheering in the 10th minute , when raul muscled his way past a furiously sliding bayern keeper oliver kahn in the box .
the veteran striker slotted home to put the hosts up 1-0 . munich had trouble putting together combinations , but thanks to a set piece they got the equalizer thirteen minutes later .
bayern oldie-but-goodie willy sagnol blasted a free kick from around 40 meters out , and defender lucio headed beyond reach real keeper iker casillas . last hurrahs before hollywood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham is a no-go in munich after getting injured the rest of the first half was all madrid .
surprisingly the main motor of their impressive run was much-maligned midfielder david beckham , who is headed for los angeles in the summer and who had recently been left out of the squad . beckham was clearly out to prove he 's not washed up .
in the 28th minute , he fired a corner across the mouth of the goal .
defender ivan helguera headed the ball into the upper right corner , brushing raul 's hair in the process .
real were back in the lead . six minutes later , beckham pushed the ball forward , where it eventually found a criminally unmarked ruud van nistelrooy .
the dutchman fired home from five meters to give madrid a 3-1 advantage . real 's first half showed a return to the fluid attacking style that gained them the champions league title in 2002 .
meanwhile bayern were plagued by the midfield sluggishness and defensive lapses that have characterized their mediocre season . a familiar face comes up big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thanks to kahn , bayern avoided disaster the match could have turned into a debacle for munich in the second half , were it not for a sterling play by their 37-year-old keeper .
beckham curled a lethal-looking free kick toward the upper-left-hand corner of goal , but kahn acrobatically parried it to keep the visitors in the game . after that , real curiously chose to pack it in at the back - never a madrid strong point even in the club 's best years . for half an hour , it looked as though real might be able to hold their two-goal advantage .
bayern 's lack of true playmaker was all too apparent as they seldom created open shots on goal . but in 79th minute , substitute bayern striker claudio pizarro was narrowly denied by casillas from 10 meters .
two minutes from time , midfielder mark van bommel drop-kicked a short real clearance into the back of the net for the final 3-2 scoreline . glass half-full or half-empty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel flexed his muscles late in the match the result was a bit of balsam for the wounded pride of these two former titans .
speaking after the match , kahn said " this is one of those losses that feels like a victory . " indeed , both sides played to a higher standard than their critics thought them capable of , treating fans to one of the better matches of this champions league season . but the game also showed that bayern - despite van bommel 's late goal - still need a creative director in midfield .
and real 's late weakness suggested that the squad is perhaps too old to pile on pressure over 90 minutes .
plus , beckham is out with injury for the return match . that sets the stage for a tough battle when the two teams play their return leg in munich on march 7 .
a 1-0 win for bayern would be enough to send them through to the tournament 's next round and force real to question why they failed to seal this encounter when they had the chance . whichever team comes up short in munich will be in for some harsh scrutiny from media and fans .
real and bayern are accustomed to silverware .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 21.02.2007 opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost a quarter of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .
dw 's peter philipp believes blair is playing a dangerous game . despite not being able to influence events in iraq through his actions , british prime minister tony blair can at least use the situation there for his own domestic purposes .
news that blair intends to withdraw almost a quarter of the british occupation force in iraq - 1,600 of some 7,000 soldiers stationed there - can not be seen in any other light .
it is no coincidence that public opinion back in the uk is in favor of a withdrawal , while the fact that blair has already announced his resignation means he may not be around to face the consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair finds himself in a very difficult position .
up until now , the prime minister was the united states ' most dependable ally in iraq but now he appears to be jumping ship just at the moment when president george w. bush is looking to strengthen the troop deployment in the country .
blair could face the wrath of a president betrayed .
while there is certainly a difference between the operations of the us forces in their crackdown on insurgents and criminal gangs in baghdad and the british occupation of the relatively less volatile southern city of basra , a withdrawal of the british contingent at a time when more not fewer troops is the message from washington is certainly a risk .
one way in which blair could avoid the rapprochement of the americans while scoring a domestic success would be to declare " mission accomplished . "
however , washington will know better than most how successful the british contribution to security in iraq has been while the british public would be unlikely to suddenly view the iraq adventure in a better light just because the troops are now coming home .
at best , blair will be seen in the uk as trying to rectify what is seen as the biggest mistake of his premiership and as trying to shake off the shackles of us loyalty before he departs the political arena .
it is unlikely that much will be changed in iraq 's situation by the british departure .
the main fear is that the shiite majority in the south will rise up against the occupying forces and that the united states , with enough on their plate in baghdad and the rest of the country , will then be over-stretched .
this would surely end blair 's dream of being inducted in the us hall of fame for honorable allies .
however there is little to suggest that any such uprising would happen .
the iraqi shiites have absolutely no interest in openly engaging the occupation forces , especially when they hold a majority of power in the iraqi government already .
there is no need to fight for something that has already been handed to them by a democratic process .
the only conceivable danger would be a confrontation between the united states and iran .
tehran could activate allies in iraq to make life very complicated for the americans and where better to ferment unrest than in southern iraq , an area of the country which would have been weakened by a partial british withdrawal ? peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and a middle east expert -lrb- nda -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe says saddam 's execution solves no problems for iraq as european nations criticized the execution of saddam hussein out of opposition to the death penalty , sunday newspapers across the continent were pessimistic as to whether the hanging would solve any of iraq 's problems .

washington however denies its coalition is crumbling . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday the british force in southern iraq would drop from 7,100 to 5,500 in coming months and could fall below 5,000 this year . blair , who has seen his popularity erode at home over his decision to go to war , said that soldiers however would remain into 2008 to provide support and training if iraq wanted . following britain 's lead , denmark and lithuania said they would withdraw most of their troops by august . denmark said its 430 ground troops would leave by august this year .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said the decision to withdraw troops was " taken together with our coalition allies , namely britain . " lithuanian defence minister juozas olekas told the baltic news service -lrb- bns -rrb- agency it was a " realistic possibility " that lithuania would not replace its 50 troops when their mission in iraq ends in august . the lithuanians are serving with a danish battalion near the southern city of basra , within the british-led multinational division .
like fellow baltic states latvia and estonia , lithuania joined nato in 2004 , and has been a staunch supporter of the united states in iraq . a string of other countries which sent troops either from the outset or later have already withdrawn from iraq , and others are planning to do so in the coming months . south korea and poland , with the largest contingents after the us and britain , have said they will leave by the end of the year . " next chapter can be written by iraqis " britain 's move was particularly important for washington as it is the second largest part of the us-led force in iraq after the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair said the peacekeeping reins had to be gradually handed over to the iraqis blair has faced huge domestic pressure over the unpopular war but he would not give a timetable for a complete british withdrawal . " the uk military presence will continue into 2008 for as long as we are wanted and have a job to do , " the prime minister told the british parliament on wednesday . british , danish and other multinational troops have been concentrated around the southern city of basra , which blair said remains " dangerous " but had improved enough for security to be handed over to iraqi forces . " what all this means is not that basra is how we want it to be , but it does mean that the next chapter in basra 's history can be written by iraqis , " blair said .
" increasingly our role will be supporting training and our numbers will be able to reduce accordingly , " he said . blair said british forces that remain would train iraqi troops , secure the iraq-iran border and supply routes and boost the ability of iraqi forces to conduct operations against extremist groups . blair 's unwavering support for president george w. bush over the us-led invasion in march 2003 has undermined his support at home .
britain put 40,000 troops into the invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six danish soldiers have been killed since 2003 in the violence in iraq in denmark , the government has been under increasing pressure to withdraw from iraq , and in january rasmussen voiced hopes that troop numbers could be reduced during 2007 .
six danish soldiers have been killed in iraq since 2003 . a poll published in early february showed that 64 percent of danes were " opposed " or " vehemently opposed " to the troop presence . meanwhile , bulgaria 's parliament voted on wednesday to extend the presence of the 155 bulgarian troops in iraq by a year . us denies coalition is crumbling britain 's announcement threw the spotlight on the us strategy in iraq , which has heightened bush 's unpopularity with the us public . us secretary of state condoleezza rice denied that the us-led coalition was crumbling . " the coalition remains intact and in fact the british still have thousands of soldiers deployed in iraq , in the south , " rice said in berlin .
she said the british pullout was part of the coalition strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said in berlin wednesday that the us-led coalition was not crumbling " it is the plan that as it is possible to transfer responsibilities to the iraqis , coalition forces would no longer be needed in those circumstances . " blair telephoned the us president on tuesday to warn him of the announcement , the white house said . " president bush sees this as a sign of success and what is possible for us once we help the iraqis deal with the sectarian violence in baghdad , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe . vice president dick cheney said the british drawdown was justified given the situation in basra , but stressed there could be no retreat from iraq . " i want you to know that the american people will not support a policy of retreat , " cheney said on the uss kitty hawk aircraft carrier while on a trip to japan .
" we want to complete the mission , we want to get it done right , and we want to return with honor , " he said . australian prime minister john howard , another strong backer of the us-led invasion , said he would not reduce australia 's 550 combat troops in iraq , part of a 1,400-strong force in the country . the united states has about 138,000 troops in iraq and has started sending another 21,500 to baghdad and surrounding provinces where the insurgency and sectarian violence has worsened in recent months . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost half of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .

dw 's peter philipp believes blair is playing a dangerous game . despite not being able to influence events in iraq through his actions , british prime minister tony blair can at least use the situation there for his own domestic purposes .
news that blair intends to withdraw almost a quarter of the british occupation force in iraq - 1,600 of some 7,000 soldiers stationed there - can not be seen in any other light .
it is no coincidence that public opinion back in the uk is in favor of a withdrawal , while the fact that blair has already announced his resignation means he may not be around to face the consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair finds himself in a very difficult position .
up until now , the prime minister was the united states ' most dependable ally in iraq but now he appears to be jumping ship just at the moment when president george w. bush is looking to strengthen the troop deployment in the country .
blair could face the wrath of a president betrayed .
while there is certainly a difference between the operations of the us forces in their crackdown on insurgents and criminal gangs in baghdad and the british occupation of the relatively less volatile southern city of basra , a withdrawal of the british contingent at a time when more not fewer troops is the message from washington is certainly a risk .
one way in which blair could avoid the rapprochement of the americans while scoring a domestic success would be to declare " mission accomplished . "
however , washington will know better than most how successful the british contribution to security in iraq has been while the british public would be unlikely to suddenly view the iraq adventure in a better light just because the troops are now coming home .
at best , blair will be seen in the uk as trying to rectify what is seen as the biggest mistake of his premiership and as trying to shake off the shackles of us loyalty before he departs the political arena .
it is unlikely that much will be changed in iraq 's situation by the british departure .
the main fear is that the shiite majority in the south will rise up against the occupying forces and that the united states , with enough on their plate in baghdad and the rest of the country , will then be over-stretched .
this would surely end blair 's dream of being inducted in the us hall of fame for honorable allies .
however there is little to suggest that any such uprising would happen .
the iraqi shiites have absolutely no interest in openly engaging the occupation forces , especially when they hold a majority of power in the iraqi government already .
there is no need to fight for something that has already been handed to them by a democratic process .
the only conceivable danger would be a confrontation between the united states and iran .
tehran could activate allies in iraq to make life very complicated for the americans and where better to ferment unrest than in southern iraq , an area of the country which would have been weakened by a partial british withdrawal ? peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and a middle east expert -lrb- nda -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe says saddam 's execution solves no problems for iraq as european nations criticized the execution of saddam hussein out of opposition to the death penalty , sunday newspapers across the continent were pessimistic as to whether the hanging would solve any of iraq 's problems .

in the first leg real won 3-2 at home , but bayern hope things will be different in munich . the first leg two weeks ago was a bit like a battle between bruce springsteen and prince : the bavarians who used to be boss against the artists formerly known as the galacticos .
languishing in fourth place in their respective national leagues , both bayern and real were looking to restore some pride in tuesday 's match at bernabeu .
and both teams got some of what they wanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern had trouble coping with real 's pace real showed they meant business from the opening whistle and had their home fans cheering in the 10th minute , when raul muscled his way past a furiously sliding bayern keeper oliver kahn in the box .
the veteran striker slotted home to put the hosts up 1-0 . munich had trouble putting together combinations , but thanks to a set piece they got the equalizer thirteen minutes later .
bayern oldie-but-goodie willy sagnol blasted a free kick from around 40 meters out , and defender lucio headed beyond reach real keeper iker casillas . last hurrahs before hollywood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham is a no-go in munich after getting injured the rest of the first half was all madrid .
surprisingly the main motor of their impressive run was much-maligned midfielder david beckham , who is headed for los angeles in the summer and who had recently been left out of the squad . beckham was clearly out to prove he 's not washed up .
in the 28th minute , he fired a corner across the mouth of the goal .
defender ivan helguera headed the ball into the upper right corner , brushing raul 's hair in the process .
real were back in the lead . six minutes later , beckham pushed the ball forward , where it eventually found a criminally unmarked ruud van nistelrooy .
the dutchman fired home from five meters to give madrid a 3-1 advantage . real 's first half showed a return to the fluid attacking style that gained them the champions league title in 2002 .
meanwhile bayern were plagued by the midfield sluggishness and defensive lapses that have characterized their mediocre season . a familiar face comes up big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thanks to kahn , bayern avoided disaster the match could have turned into a debacle for munich in the second half , were it not for a sterling play by their 37-year-old keeper .
beckham curled a lethal-looking free kick toward the upper-left-hand corner of goal , but kahn acrobatically parried it to keep the visitors in the game . after that , real curiously chose to pack it in at the back - never a madrid strong point even in the club 's best years . for half an hour , it looked as though real might be able to hold their two-goal advantage .
bayern 's lack of true playmaker was all too apparent as they seldom created open shots on goal . but in 79th minute , substitute bayern striker claudio pizarro was narrowly denied by casillas from 10 meters .
two minutes from time , midfielder mark van bommel drop-kicked a short real clearance into the back of the net for the final 3-2 scoreline . glass half-full or half-empty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel flexed his muscles late in the match the result was a bit of balsam for the wounded pride of these two former titans .
speaking after the match , kahn said " this is one of those losses that feels like a victory . " indeed , both sides played to a higher standard than their critics thought them capable of , treating fans to one of the better matches of this champions league season . but the game also showed that bayern - despite van bommel 's late goal - still need a creative director in midfield .
and real 's late weakness suggested that the squad is perhaps too old to pile on pressure over 90 minutes .
plus , beckham is out with injury for the return match . that sets the stage for a tough battle when the two teams play their return leg in munich on march 7 .
a 1-0 win for bayern would be enough to send them through to the tournament 's next round and force real to question why they failed to seal this encounter when they had the chance . whichever team comes up short in munich will be in for some harsh scrutiny from media and fans .
real and bayern are accustomed to silverware .

it is seeking the ministers ' approval of the plan in order to get backing from eu leaders at a march 8-9 summit in brussels . details of how eu nations - especially eu newcomers from central and eastern europe - would share-out the emission reductions still had to be worked out , gabriel said . earlier , several eu states including finland , hungary and poland had argued against binding targets on reducing co2 emission levels after 2012 . however , calls for firmer action had come , among others , from slovenia , spain and britain which said all eu states must stand up and commit to serious climate action or lose their " leadership role " on the issue . germany , which currently holds the european union 's six-month rotating presidency as well heads the g8 , has made tackling climate change a key priority .

bayern oldie-but-goodie willy sagnol blasted a free kick from around 40 meters out , and defender lucio headed beyond reach real keeper iker casillas . last hurrahs before hollywood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham is a no-go in munich after getting injured the rest of the first half was all madrid .
surprisingly the main motor of their impressive run was much-maligned midfielder david beckham , who is headed for los angeles in the summer and who had recently been left out of the squad . beckham was clearly out to prove he 's not washed up .
in the 28th minute , he fired a corner across the mouth of the goal .
defender ivan helguera headed the ball into the upper right corner , brushing raul 's hair in the process .
real were back in the lead . six minutes later , beckham pushed the ball forward , where it eventually found a criminally unmarked ruud van nistelrooy .
the dutchman fired home from five meters to give madrid a 3-1 advantage . real 's first half showed a return to the fluid attacking style that gained them the champions league title in 2002 .
meanwhile bayern were plagued by the midfield sluggishness and defensive lapses that have characterized their mediocre season . a familiar face comes up big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thanks to kahn , bayern avoided disaster the match could have turned into a debacle for munich in the second half , were it not for a sterling play by their 37-year-old keeper .
beckham curled a lethal-looking free kick toward the upper-left-hand corner of goal , but kahn acrobatically parried it to keep the visitors in the game . after that , real curiously chose to pack it in at the back - never a madrid strong point even in the club 's best years . for half an hour , it looked as though real might be able to hold their two-goal advantage .
bayern 's lack of true playmaker was all too apparent as they seldom created open shots on goal . but in 79th minute , substitute bayern striker claudio pizarro was narrowly denied by casillas from 10 meters .
two minutes from time , midfielder mark van bommel drop-kicked a short real clearance into the back of the net for the final 3-2 scoreline . glass half-full or half-empty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel flexed his muscles late in the match the result was a bit of balsam for the wounded pride of these two former titans .
speaking after the match , kahn said " this is one of those losses that feels like a victory . " indeed , both sides played to a higher standard than their critics thought them capable of , treating fans to one of the better matches of this champions league season . but the game also showed that bayern - despite van bommel 's late goal - still need a creative director in midfield .
and real 's late weakness suggested that the squad is perhaps too old to pile on pressure over 90 minutes .
plus , beckham is out with injury for the return match . that sets the stage for a tough battle when the two teams play their return leg in munich on march 7 .
a 1-0 win for bayern would be enough to send them through to the tournament 's next round and force real to question why they failed to seal this encounter when they had the chance . whichever team comes up short in munich will be in for some harsh scrutiny from media and fans .
real and bayern are accustomed to silverware .

it is seeking the ministers ' approval of the plan in order to get backing from eu leaders at a march 8-9 summit in brussels . details of how eu nations - especially eu newcomers from central and eastern europe - would share-out the emission reductions still had to be worked out , gabriel said . earlier , several eu states including finland , hungary and poland had argued against binding targets on reducing co2 emission levels after 2012 . however , calls for firmer action had come , among others , from slovenia , spain and britain which said all eu states must stand up and commit to serious climate action or lose their " leadership role " on the issue . germany , which currently holds the european union 's six-month rotating presidency as well heads the g8 , has made tackling climate change a key priority .

" he also urged the eu to forge a strategy to mobilise resources and engage other countries for the period after the 2012 expiry of the current kyoto protocol on climate change . climate change and the switch to a low-carbon economy are expected to be key issues to be discussed by eu leaders at their summit in brussels on march 8-9 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german plan to tax cars on emissions gets wary nod plans by the german government to tax cars based on emissions instead of engine size in a bid to encourage carmakers to design " greener " cars have met with a cautious welcome .

" those are not principles put there to be an obstacle , they are put there because they 're foundational for peace , " she said . " it 's very difficult to imagine a circumstance where you have peace talks but one party does n't recognize the existence of the other , " rice said . hamas , which the us , european union and israel consider a terrorist organization , has not yet clearly agreed to the west 's conditions of recognizing israel , renouncing violence and honoring past agreements with the jewish state . rice also emphasized the importance of continuing to support abbas in his power struggle with iranian-backed hamas . inconclusive summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ehud olmert -lrb- r -rrb- , rice and palestinian president mahmoud abbas -lrb- l -rrb- at talsk in jerusalem on monday rice held an inconclusive summit monday in jerusalem with abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert . steinmeier , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called the meeting " a first step " but noted that hopes for peace were complicated by the fraught negotiations on the formation of a palestinian government . " that is why we need to be particularly realistic going into these talks , " he said , referring to the quartet gathering . " we are nevertheless determined to seize this opportunity , " he said . russia and the un said they would use the berlin meeting to push for the unity government to be recognized .
moscow said it would call for the removal of aid and diplomatic boycotts imposed on the palestinian government after it fell under hamas ' control following january 2006 elections . growing unease the embargo imposed by the quartet after the 2006 elections has caused widespread economic hardship in the palestinian areas and there is growing unease in europe over the measures . the spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , cristina gallach , said that palestinian unity was a crucial step forward but indicated it was too early to consider lifting the embargo . " obviously one can not put everything on the table because they are still in negotiations - we have not yet seen the composition of the government , " she said . un chief ban ki-moon said in berlin ahead of the quartet talks that he was " encouraged " by the power-sharing deal between fatah and hamas . bildunterschrift : quartet members at a washington meeting defending the unity government abbas , long portrayed by washington as the best " partner for peace " with israel , has embarked on a diplomatic offensive of his own .
he is touring europe to defend the unity government deal . he insists the agreement reached between his fatah party and hamas should satisfy the quartet principles since it obliges the new unity government to respect international resolutions and agreements signed by the fatah-led palestine liberation organisation - meaning deals with the jewish state . palestinians urged the quartet powers to give their incoming government a chance . " we hope the quartet will take a positive approach towards the government and not resort to pressure and boycott , " said ghazi hamad , spokesman for the hamas-led government . israel has ruled out dealing with any government that includes hamas . it reiterated its hope that the quartet will stick to the conditions imposed on the palestinian government for the aid boycott to be lifted .

washington however denies its coalition is crumbling . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday the british force in southern iraq would drop from 7,100 to 5,500 in coming months and could fall below 5,000 this year . blair , who has seen his popularity erode at home over his decision to go to war , said that soldiers however would remain into 2008 to provide support and training if iraq wanted . following britain 's lead , denmark and lithuania said they would withdraw most of their troops by august . denmark said its 430 ground troops would leave by august this year .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said the decision to withdraw troops was " taken together with our coalition allies , namely britain . " lithuanian defence minister juozas olekas told the baltic news service -lrb- bns -rrb- agency it was a " realistic possibility " that lithuania would not replace its 50 troops when their mission in iraq ends in august . the lithuanians are serving with a danish battalion near the southern city of basra , within the british-led multinational division .
like fellow baltic states latvia and estonia , lithuania joined nato in 2004 , and has been a staunch supporter of the united states in iraq . a string of other countries which sent troops either from the outset or later have already withdrawn from iraq , and others are planning to do so in the coming months . south korea and poland , with the largest contingents after the us and britain , have said they will leave by the end of the year . " next chapter can be written by iraqis " britain 's move was particularly important for washington as it is the second largest part of the us-led force in iraq after the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair said the peacekeeping reins had to be gradually handed over to the iraqis blair has faced huge domestic pressure over the unpopular war but he would not give a timetable for a complete british withdrawal . " the uk military presence will continue into 2008 for as long as we are wanted and have a job to do , " the prime minister told the british parliament on wednesday . british , danish and other multinational troops have been concentrated around the southern city of basra , which blair said remains " dangerous " but had improved enough for security to be handed over to iraqi forces . " what all this means is not that basra is how we want it to be , but it does mean that the next chapter in basra 's history can be written by iraqis , " blair said .
" increasingly our role will be supporting training and our numbers will be able to reduce accordingly , " he said . blair said british forces that remain would train iraqi troops , secure the iraq-iran border and supply routes and boost the ability of iraqi forces to conduct operations against extremist groups . blair 's unwavering support for president george w. bush over the us-led invasion in march 2003 has undermined his support at home .
britain put 40,000 troops into the invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six danish soldiers have been killed since 2003 in the violence in iraq in denmark , the government has been under increasing pressure to withdraw from iraq , and in january rasmussen voiced hopes that troop numbers could be reduced during 2007 .
six danish soldiers have been killed in iraq since 2003 . a poll published in early february showed that 64 percent of danes were " opposed " or " vehemently opposed " to the troop presence . meanwhile , bulgaria 's parliament voted on wednesday to extend the presence of the 155 bulgarian troops in iraq by a year . us denies coalition is crumbling britain 's announcement threw the spotlight on the us strategy in iraq , which has heightened bush 's unpopularity with the us public . us secretary of state condoleezza rice denied that the us-led coalition was crumbling . " the coalition remains intact and in fact the british still have thousands of soldiers deployed in iraq , in the south , " rice said in berlin .
she said the british pullout was part of the coalition strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said in berlin wednesday that the us-led coalition was not crumbling " it is the plan that as it is possible to transfer responsibilities to the iraqis , coalition forces would no longer be needed in those circumstances . " blair telephoned the us president on tuesday to warn him of the announcement , the white house said . " president bush sees this as a sign of success and what is possible for us once we help the iraqis deal with the sectarian violence in baghdad , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe . vice president dick cheney said the british drawdown was justified given the situation in basra , but stressed there could be no retreat from iraq . " i want you to know that the american people will not support a policy of retreat , " cheney said on the uss kitty hawk aircraft carrier while on a trip to japan .
" we want to complete the mission , we want to get it done right , and we want to return with honor , " he said . australian prime minister john howard , another strong backer of the us-led invasion , said he would not reduce australia 's 550 combat troops in iraq , part of a 1,400-strong force in the country . the united states has about 138,000 troops in iraq and has started sending another 21,500 to baghdad and surrounding provinces where the insurgency and sectarian violence has worsened in recent months . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost half of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .

the new report shows that 66.8 percent of men in germany are overweight , with 18.8 percent of those hitting levels of obesity .
that 's almost twice as many as their prospective partners in the uk .
the eurostat figures show that 33.6 percent of english women are fat .

the statistics office uses the " body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- " to determine what being fat means .
bmi is defined as the individual 's body weight divided by the square of their height .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 21.02.2007 opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost a quarter of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .
dw 's peter philipp believes blair is playing a dangerous game . despite not being able to influence events in iraq through his actions , british prime minister tony blair can at least use the situation there for his own domestic purposes .
news that blair intends to withdraw almost a quarter of the british occupation force in iraq - 1,600 of some 7,000 soldiers stationed there - can not be seen in any other light .
it is no coincidence that public opinion back in the uk is in favor of a withdrawal , while the fact that blair has already announced his resignation means he may not be around to face the consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair finds himself in a very difficult position .
up until now , the prime minister was the united states ' most dependable ally in iraq but now he appears to be jumping ship just at the moment when president george w. bush is looking to strengthen the troop deployment in the country .
blair could face the wrath of a president betrayed .
while there is certainly a difference between the operations of the us forces in their crackdown on insurgents and criminal gangs in baghdad and the british occupation of the relatively less volatile southern city of basra , a withdrawal of the british contingent at a time when more not fewer troops is the message from washington is certainly a risk .
one way in which blair could avoid the rapprochement of the americans while scoring a domestic success would be to declare " mission accomplished . "
however , washington will know better than most how successful the british contribution to security in iraq has been while the british public would be unlikely to suddenly view the iraq adventure in a better light just because the troops are now coming home .
at best , blair will be seen in the uk as trying to rectify what is seen as the biggest mistake of his premiership and as trying to shake off the shackles of us loyalty before he departs the political arena .
it is unlikely that much will be changed in iraq 's situation by the british departure .
the main fear is that the shiite majority in the south will rise up against the occupying forces and that the united states , with enough on their plate in baghdad and the rest of the country , will then be over-stretched .
this would surely end blair 's dream of being inducted in the us hall of fame for honorable allies .
however there is little to suggest that any such uprising would happen .
the iraqi shiites have absolutely no interest in openly engaging the occupation forces , especially when they hold a majority of power in the iraqi government already .
there is no need to fight for something that has already been handed to them by a democratic process .
the only conceivable danger would be a confrontation between the united states and iran .
tehran could activate allies in iraq to make life very complicated for the americans and where better to ferment unrest than in southern iraq , an area of the country which would have been weakened by a partial british withdrawal ? peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and a middle east expert -lrb- nda -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe says saddam 's execution solves no problems for iraq as european nations criticized the execution of saddam hussein out of opposition to the death penalty , sunday newspapers across the continent were pessimistic as to whether the hanging would solve any of iraq 's problems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 21.02.2007 eu slaps record near billion-euro fine on lift cartel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's back to the ground floor for the companies involved in the lift cartel eu competition regulators imposed their biggest fine ever on wednesday , hitting lift makers otis , schindler , thyssenkrupp and kone with a penalty of nearly a billion euros for running an illegal cartel . the european commission accused the companies of operating a cartel for the installation and maintenance of lifts and escalators in belgium , germany , luxembourg and the netherlands between at least 1995 and 2004 . the european union 's antitrust watchdog said it was fining them a combined 992 million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- for rigging bids for procurement contracts , fixing prices , sharing out projects , carving up markets and exchanging sensitive information . the total fine also included a 1.8-million-euro penalty against japanese company mitsubishi for a role in the cartel limited to the netherlands . " it is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings , including hospitals , have been artificially bloated by these cartels , " competition commissioner neelie kroes said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes says the damage caused by the cartel will last for many years " the national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong , but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway , " she said .
" the damage caused by this cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and elevators - for these companies the memory of this fine should last just as long , " she added . german firm gets stiffest fine german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the heaviest fine ever imposed by eu regulators on a single company in a cartel case because it was a repeated offender .
the german group was fined 480 million euros . otis , a unit of us conglomerate united technologies corporation , was given a fine of 225 million euros for its role , followed by schindler with a penalty of 144 million euros and kone with 142 million euros . eu antitrust investigators conducted so-called " dawn raids " on lift and escalator makers across europe in january 2004 after getting a tip off about the cartel .
after the raids , the companies handed over more evidence in the hope of winning leniency or reduced fines . the european commission said that high-ranking national-level management ran the cartel by holding secret meetings in bars and restaurants .
they also visited the countryside and traveled abroad and used pre-paid mobile phone cards to avoid regulators ' scrutiny . eu campaign against illegal cartels kroes , europe 's top antitrust regulator , is leading a campaign against illegal cartels and has been chalking up record fines against companies targeted by her crackdown . after bumper fines in 2006 , eu regulators in january ordered 10 companies to pay 750 million euros for fixing prices and carving up the market in electrical generation equipment .
after the lift makers case , that fine is now the third biggest ever against a cartel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the stiffest penalty until wednesday , the biggest fine in a european cartel case was 855 million euros in penalties imposed on eight vitamin makers in 2001 .
the vitamin makers ' fine was later reduced to 790 million euros by an eu court . despite the record fine on the lift makers , higher penalties are likely in future cases after the commission tightened its rules for calculating fines , making them heavier for repeat offenders and long-lasting cartels .
the reform could potentially cost guilty companies up to 10 times more than before . the commission was also given a boost in its anti-cartel campaign earlier this month with a ruling from the european court of justice that gave regulators more freedom to fix fines , especially how far back regulators can take previous offences into account . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission slaps huge fine on siemens for price fixing the eu has fined power equipment manufacturers for their roles in a price-fixing scheme .

de vries said that the abduction of terror suspects to third-party countries where torture is used in interrogation , the holding of so-called " enemy combatants " without trial at the prison camp in the us naval base in guantanamo , cuba and the widely-publicized abuse of prisoners at abu ghraib prison in iraq had all undermined the fight against islamist extremism .

" i hope the united states , now that there is a new political dynamic in the us congress , can return to a mainstream interpretation of international human rights . "
the issue of rendition has added resonance in europe after the european parliament announced last week that a number of eu governments - including italy and germany - knew about the secret cia flights transporting suspects through europe but chose to look the other way .
de vries , the man charged with overseeing and coordinating the eu 's fight against terror , was himself strongly criticized by the european parliament for not providing answers on the allegations of complicity by eu governments in cia rendition .
national responsibility for secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu states are accused of turning a blind eye to cia flights however , de vries responded by saying that there had been no hard evidence to substantiate the accusations made against the eu countries by european lawmakers and that judgment should be reserved until the authorities in member states had carried out and completed their own investigations into the allegations of collusion .
he insisted that secret intelligence services remained under national control and that neither the eu as a whole nor he as anti-terrorism coordinator had much power to change that .
de vries told the european parliament that member states should exercise more parliamentary control on the activities of their secret services .
rebuild trust , work for peace de vries , who steps in march after three years in the job , said that a change in approach by the us and the eu to regain trust from the islamic world was essential in the battle of ideas with radical islamists . " ultimately that 's the long-term approach we need , " he said , adding that a concerted effort to bring peace to the middle east would also help .
until these objectives can be achieved , de fries said , the terrorism threat in the eu would remain at its current high level and would remain so for a number of years .

de vries calls for eu streamlining he also called for a streamlining of decision-making on cooperation against terrorism and organized crime within the eu and for the introduction of majority votes instead of insisting on unanimity among all 27 countries .
" unanimous decisions simply take too long , " he said , blaming them for the eu 's failure to coordinate cross border operations between national police forces when tracking international criminals .

in the first leg real won 3-2 at home , but bayern hope things will be different in munich . the first leg two weeks ago was a bit like a battle between bruce springsteen and prince : the bavarians who used to be boss against the artists formerly known as the galacticos .
languishing in fourth place in their respective national leagues , both bayern and real were looking to restore some pride in tuesday 's match at bernabeu .
and both teams got some of what they wanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern had trouble coping with real 's pace real showed they meant business from the opening whistle and had their home fans cheering in the 10th minute , when raul muscled his way past a furiously sliding bayern keeper oliver kahn in the box .
the veteran striker slotted home to put the hosts up 1-0 . munich had trouble putting together combinations , but thanks to a set piece they got the equalizer thirteen minutes later .
bayern oldie-but-goodie willy sagnol blasted a free kick from around 40 meters out , and defender lucio headed beyond reach real keeper iker casillas . last hurrahs before hollywood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham is a no-go in munich after getting injured the rest of the first half was all madrid .
surprisingly the main motor of their impressive run was much-maligned midfielder david beckham , who is headed for los angeles in the summer and who had recently been left out of the squad . beckham was clearly out to prove he 's not washed up .
in the 28th minute , he fired a corner across the mouth of the goal .
defender ivan helguera headed the ball into the upper right corner , brushing raul 's hair in the process .
real were back in the lead . six minutes later , beckham pushed the ball forward , where it eventually found a criminally unmarked ruud van nistelrooy .
the dutchman fired home from five meters to give madrid a 3-1 advantage . real 's first half showed a return to the fluid attacking style that gained them the champions league title in 2002 .
meanwhile bayern were plagued by the midfield sluggishness and defensive lapses that have characterized their mediocre season . a familiar face comes up big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thanks to kahn , bayern avoided disaster the match could have turned into a debacle for munich in the second half , were it not for a sterling play by their 37-year-old keeper .
beckham curled a lethal-looking free kick toward the upper-left-hand corner of goal , but kahn acrobatically parried it to keep the visitors in the game . after that , real curiously chose to pack it in at the back - never a madrid strong point even in the club 's best years . for half an hour , it looked as though real might be able to hold their two-goal advantage .
bayern 's lack of true playmaker was all too apparent as they seldom created open shots on goal . but in 79th minute , substitute bayern striker claudio pizarro was narrowly denied by casillas from 10 meters .
two minutes from time , midfielder mark van bommel drop-kicked a short real clearance into the back of the net for the final 3-2 scoreline . glass half-full or half-empty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel flexed his muscles late in the match the result was a bit of balsam for the wounded pride of these two former titans .
speaking after the match , kahn said " this is one of those losses that feels like a victory . " indeed , both sides played to a higher standard than their critics thought them capable of , treating fans to one of the better matches of this champions league season . but the game also showed that bayern - despite van bommel 's late goal - still need a creative director in midfield .
and real 's late weakness suggested that the squad is perhaps too old to pile on pressure over 90 minutes .
plus , beckham is out with injury for the return match . that sets the stage for a tough battle when the two teams play their return leg in munich on march 7 .
a 1-0 win for bayern would be enough to send them through to the tournament 's next round and force real to question why they failed to seal this encounter when they had the chance . whichever team comes up short in munich will be in for some harsh scrutiny from media and fans .
real and bayern are accustomed to silverware .

" … blair will hardly be able to improve his image in history books , " the paper wrote .
" he said himself that he had wanted to lead great britain into the euro zone , into the heart of europe , but what he 's ended up doing is turning the united kingdom into an aircraft carrier for the united states , " the paper wrote .
it also pointed out that british voters will punish blair 's labour party just like american voters did with the republicans in congressional elections in november .
" democracies sometimes need a long time for their self-purification processes , but it 's amazing to see that the democratic process works in the end . " the obermain-tagblatt got right to the point : " the signal from london could n't be more embarrassing for washington - tony blair , the us ' closest ally , disentangles himself from the circle of unity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis listen to us president bush promise more troops to iraq in january berlin 's tagesspiegel pondered the dilemma : " … sir richard dannatt , the new , unusually upfront british supreme commander of the armed forces , even believes that the mere presence of his soldiers in basra triggers more violence than they prevent , " the paper wrote . " … .the brits and war-weary danes are sending out a signal of resignation with their announcement that they would withdraw troops . "
the paper said the us ' most loyal allies were following on the heels of the tens of thousands of iraqis who have fled their country .
" and that during a time when the us is trying to make one last attempt to turn the tide . " braunschweiger zeitung said withdrawing troops from iraq is the right thing to do .
the west has lost .
that should be openly acknowledged , " the paper opined .
" the war against saddam hussein was based on lies , and the war is ending with lies , " the paper continued .
" blair wants to go down in the history books as the prime minister who brought troops home .
he does n't want to leave that to his successor , gordon brown .

but critics say germany is n't doing enough to promote linguistic diversity and multilingual education . the integration debate in germany has included a strong focus on immigrant children 's language skills .
both politicians and educators agree that it 's especially important to speak the language of the country you live in - and speak it well in order to get a good education and find a job . in germany , though , children from immigrant families often have problems at school .
their german just is n't good enough .
as a result , some german states are giving fewer lessons in these kids ' native tongues - a move not all teachers and linguists agree with . ruprecht baur , professor for german as a foreign language at duisburg-essen university , said several questions always come up in discussions on integration .
does the fact that a child comes from an immigrant family and speaks a different language prevent him or her from learning german and doing well at school ?
should the parents speak german at home , and avoid their native tongue ?
and is being exposed to two languages the reason some children here , notably with an italian or turkish background , fail in school ? according to baur , these questions arise despite multilingualism being the rule almost everywhere in the world . " international studies show that the mother tongue is no distraction , " baur said .
" the majority of people all over the world speak several languages .
they 're born with a mother language , and often know two more . " germany lacking interest in linguistic heritage the european union has repeatedly stressed the importance and its support of linguistic pluralism .
eu guidelines even commit member states to promote language classes in the children 's mother tongues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some turkish children perfect their mother tongue in germany that 's the case in germany as well - in theory .
in practice , north rhine-westphalia for example has cut back on native language teaching positions .
neighboring hesse has discontinued these classes altogether . the western german states reasoned that learning german at an early age was more important .
but vassilios fthenakis , professor for development psychology at italy 's bozen university , is critical of germany 's educational policies . " it 's an ongoing german problem : not taking a serious interest in the importance of a child 's mother language and culture , but pushing forward integration that is n't working , " fthenakis said .
" it 's a fundamental problem that germany does n't first strengthen a child 's mother language and culture , and then push learning german from that point on . " immigrant parents should n't speak german at home cultural and linguistic diversity is a richness that should be used for the individual and collective learning experience , the greek-born fthenakis said .
germany though did n't have policies like sweden , england or france do .
he said german guidelines could only be called disoriented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some grade schools offer language training for immigrant children according to fthenakis , the role that the family and their educational level play should not be underestimated .
young students will quickly learn german if they can speak and write in their mother language , fthenakis said . he said he is convinced that the language learning process should start before kids enter the school system .
in germany , that would be before the age of six .
every child is open to any language in the world before its first birthday - learning a second language is no problem at all , fthenakis said . critics of the multilingual approach said immigrant parents should speak german with their children at home .
but this was counterproductive , said duisburg-essen university 's baur . " if the parents do n't speak german well , they should n't speak it with their children , " baur said .
" at some point , the children 's german language abilities will be better than the parents ' , and then they 'll make fun of them and say , you ca n't even speak the language properly that you 're trying to speak with me .

editorialists warned that national interests were overriding economic priorities at the airplane maker . airbus parent eads must proceed with restructuring its subsidiary , the financial times commented .
" a house divided against itself can not stand , " the london-based business daily wrote in its wednesday edition .
" the past days have shown how the group 's dysfunctional structure hampers its effectiveness .
so long as the group is run in the interests of franco-german balance instead of purely commercially , then its performance will continue to suffer - to the detriment of shareholders and staff alike . " zurich 's tages-anzeiger remarked that the franco-german dispute about who will carry the brunt of airbus ' restructuring is hurting the company 's competitiveness .
" economic criteria are on the verge of going under on account of regional-political considerations , selfishness and petty jealousies , " the swiss paper noted .
" but time is too short for pointing the finger .
if airbus does n't want to lose more ground against its archrival boeing , a decision has to be taken soon . " the french daily le monde struck similar tones that the company should change its structure if it wants to succeed .
" the power 8 restructuring plan is very painful , with cutbacks of over 10,000 jobs , but it is essential , " the paris paper wrote .
" airbus is in danger of going under due to an anachronistic national battle .
if the company wants to continue playing in the same category as boeing , it must change its industrial model and give up the german-french double leadership , which shows today how much it disables things .
germany has a right to a normal share , but berlin has to realize that airbus above all has to be freed from nationalism . " the nordwest-zeitung in oldenburg observed that the one-time model group for pan-european cooperation eads with its subsidiary airbus had emerged as a battleground of national interests .
" practically every hour , authoritative sources and lesser sources are speaking out , " the german daily wrote .
" the seal of quality is still undamaged , just the masquerade of a german-french partnership which functions over all hierarchical steps has fallen .
the influence from paris has been too massive for years - and more recently also from berlin - to let the management act according to economic considerations alone . " the political components are much more dangerous to airbus than economic factors , remarked the fuldaer zeitung .
" the french appear to follow a tough position not least because of the upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections , clearly at the expense of german sites , " the paper commented .
" chancellor angela merkel is therefore well advised to give top priority to the cutbacks of 10,000 jobs in question and defend vested german interests against its neighboring country 's greediness .
on top of everything , the fact that france wants to pull a fast one on germany does n't exactly strengthen the political side 's negotiating power vis-à-vis private investors .

" those are not principles put there to be an obstacle , they are put there because they 're foundational for peace , " she said . " it 's very difficult to imagine a circumstance where you have peace talks but one party does n't recognize the existence of the other , " rice said . hamas , which the us , european union and israel consider a terrorist organization , has not yet clearly agreed to the west 's conditions of recognizing israel , renouncing violence and honoring past agreements with the jewish state . rice also emphasized the importance of continuing to support abbas in his power struggle with iranian-backed hamas . inconclusive summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ehud olmert -lrb- r -rrb- , rice and palestinian president mahmoud abbas -lrb- l -rrb- at talsk in jerusalem on monday rice held an inconclusive summit monday in jerusalem with abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert . steinmeier , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called the meeting " a first step " but noted that hopes for peace were complicated by the fraught negotiations on the formation of a palestinian government . " that is why we need to be particularly realistic going into these talks , " he said , referring to the quartet gathering . " we are nevertheless determined to seize this opportunity , " he said . russia and the un said they would use the berlin meeting to push for the unity government to be recognized .
moscow said it would call for the removal of aid and diplomatic boycotts imposed on the palestinian government after it fell under hamas ' control following january 2006 elections . growing unease the embargo imposed by the quartet after the 2006 elections has caused widespread economic hardship in the palestinian areas and there is growing unease in europe over the measures . the spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , cristina gallach , said that palestinian unity was a crucial step forward but indicated it was too early to consider lifting the embargo . " obviously one can not put everything on the table because they are still in negotiations - we have not yet seen the composition of the government , " she said . un chief ban ki-moon said in berlin ahead of the quartet talks that he was " encouraged " by the power-sharing deal between fatah and hamas . bildunterschrift : quartet members at a washington meeting defending the unity government abbas , long portrayed by washington as the best " partner for peace " with israel , has embarked on a diplomatic offensive of his own .
he is touring europe to defend the unity government deal . he insists the agreement reached between his fatah party and hamas should satisfy the quartet principles since it obliges the new unity government to respect international resolutions and agreements signed by the fatah-led palestine liberation organisation - meaning deals with the jewish state . palestinians urged the quartet powers to give their incoming government a chance . " we hope the quartet will take a positive approach towards the government and not resort to pressure and boycott , " said ghazi hamad , spokesman for the hamas-led government . israel has ruled out dealing with any government that includes hamas . it reiterated its hope that the quartet will stick to the conditions imposed on the palestinian government for the aid boycott to be lifted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 21.02.2007 eu anti-terrorism chief urges us to change tactics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuses such as those at abu ghraib have undermined the west 's fight against terror the us needs to re-embrace basic human rights , abandon tactics such as rendition and rebuild trust with the islamic world if the west 's war against terrorism is to be successful , says the eu 's anti-terrorism coordinator . the european union 's anti-terrorism coordinator , gijs de vries , has criticized us tactics in the war in terror , saying that victory can only be achieved through a return to " mainstream " human rights norms and the abandonment of policies such as special rendition .
de vries said that the abduction of terror suspects to third-party countries where torture is used in interrogation , the holding of so-called " enemy combatants " without trial at the prison camp in the us naval base in guantanamo , cuba and the widely-publicized abuse of prisoners at abu ghraib prison in iraq had all undermined the fight against islamist extremism .
image tarnished by scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gijs de vries hopes for a us return to human rights norms " the cia renditions , together with abu ghraib , guantanamo bay , and the military commissions act , unfortunately have tarnished the image of the united states in the fight against terrorism , among muslims and non-muslims , " de vries told reuters news service .
" i hope the united states , now that there is a new political dynamic in the us congress , can return to a mainstream interpretation of international human rights . "
the issue of rendition has added resonance in europe after the european parliament announced last week that a number of eu governments - including italy and germany - knew about the secret cia flights transporting suspects through europe but chose to look the other way .
de vries , the man charged with overseeing and coordinating the eu 's fight against terror , was himself strongly criticized by the european parliament for not providing answers on the allegations of complicity by eu governments in cia rendition .
national responsibility for secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu states are accused of turning a blind eye to cia flights however , de vries responded by saying that there had been no hard evidence to substantiate the accusations made against the eu countries by european lawmakers and that judgment should be reserved until the authorities in member states had carried out and completed their own investigations into the allegations of collusion .
he insisted that secret intelligence services remained under national control and that neither the eu as a whole nor he as anti-terrorism coordinator had much power to change that .
de vries told the european parliament that member states should exercise more parliamentary control on the activities of their secret services .
rebuild trust , work for peace de vries , who steps in march after three years in the job , said that a change in approach by the us and the eu to regain trust from the islamic world was essential in the battle of ideas with radical islamists . " ultimately that 's the long-term approach we need , " he said , adding that a concerted effort to bring peace to the middle east would also help .
until these objectives can be achieved , de fries said , the terrorism threat in the eu would remain at its current high level and would remain so for a number of years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does not rule out another attack on madrid 's scale " we can not exclude that attacks on the scale of london or madrid could be repeated .
meanwhile we see that other types of threats are also materializing , " he said , referring to a recent alleged plot to kidnap and behead a british muslim soldier in the uk .
de vries calls for eu streamlining he also called for a streamlining of decision-making on cooperation against terrorism and organized crime within the eu and for the introduction of majority votes instead of insisting on unanimity among all 27 countries .
" unanimous decisions simply take too long , " he said , blaming them for the eu 's failure to coordinate cross border operations between national police forces when tracking international criminals .

" it is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings , including hospitals , have been artificially bloated by these cartels , " competition commissioner neelie kroes said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes says the damage caused by the cartel will last for many years " the national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong , but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway , " she said .
" the damage caused by this cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and elevators - for these companies the memory of this fine should last just as long , " she added . german firm gets stiffest fine german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the heaviest fine ever imposed by eu regulators on a single company in a cartel case because it was a repeated offender .
the german group was fined 480 million euros . otis , a unit of us conglomerate united technologies corporation , was given a fine of 225 million euros for its role , followed by schindler with a penalty of 144 million euros and kone with 142 million euros . eu antitrust investigators conducted so-called " dawn raids " on lift and escalator makers across europe in january 2004 after getting a tip off about the cartel .
after the raids , the companies handed over more evidence in the hope of winning leniency or reduced fines . the european commission said that high-ranking national-level management ran the cartel by holding secret meetings in bars and restaurants .
they also visited the countryside and traveled abroad and used pre-paid mobile phone cards to avoid regulators ' scrutiny . eu campaign against illegal cartels kroes , europe 's top antitrust regulator , is leading a campaign against illegal cartels and has been chalking up record fines against companies targeted by her crackdown . after bumper fines in 2006 , eu regulators in january ordered 10 companies to pay 750 million euros for fixing prices and carving up the market in electrical generation equipment .
after the lift makers case , that fine is now the third biggest ever against a cartel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the stiffest penalty until wednesday , the biggest fine in a european cartel case was 855 million euros in penalties imposed on eight vitamin makers in 2001 .
the vitamin makers ' fine was later reduced to 790 million euros by an eu court . despite the record fine on the lift makers , higher penalties are likely in future cases after the commission tightened its rules for calculating fines , making them heavier for repeat offenders and long-lasting cartels .
the reform could potentially cost guilty companies up to 10 times more than before . the commission was also given a boost in its anti-cartel campaign earlier this month with a ruling from the european court of justice that gave regulators more freedom to fix fines , especially how far back regulators can take previous offences into account . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission slaps huge fine on siemens for price fixing the eu has fined power equipment manufacturers for their roles in a price-fixing scheme .

in the first leg real won 3-2 at home , but bayern hope things will be different in munich . the first leg two weeks ago was a bit like a battle between bruce springsteen and prince : the bavarians who used to be boss against the artists formerly known as the galacticos .
languishing in fourth place in their respective national leagues , both bayern and real were looking to restore some pride in tuesday 's match at bernabeu .
and both teams got some of what they wanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern had trouble coping with real 's pace real showed they meant business from the opening whistle and had their home fans cheering in the 10th minute , when raul muscled his way past a furiously sliding bayern keeper oliver kahn in the box .
the veteran striker slotted home to put the hosts up 1-0 . munich had trouble putting together combinations , but thanks to a set piece they got the equalizer thirteen minutes later .
bayern oldie-but-goodie willy sagnol blasted a free kick from around 40 meters out , and defender lucio headed beyond reach real keeper iker casillas . last hurrahs before hollywood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham is a no-go in munich after getting injured the rest of the first half was all madrid .
surprisingly the main motor of their impressive run was much-maligned midfielder david beckham , who is headed for los angeles in the summer and who had recently been left out of the squad . beckham was clearly out to prove he 's not washed up .
in the 28th minute , he fired a corner across the mouth of the goal .
defender ivan helguera headed the ball into the upper right corner , brushing raul 's hair in the process .
real were back in the lead . six minutes later , beckham pushed the ball forward , where it eventually found a criminally unmarked ruud van nistelrooy .
the dutchman fired home from five meters to give madrid a 3-1 advantage . real 's first half showed a return to the fluid attacking style that gained them the champions league title in 2002 .
meanwhile bayern were plagued by the midfield sluggishness and defensive lapses that have characterized their mediocre season . a familiar face comes up big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thanks to kahn , bayern avoided disaster the match could have turned into a debacle for munich in the second half , were it not for a sterling play by their 37-year-old keeper .
beckham curled a lethal-looking free kick toward the upper-left-hand corner of goal , but kahn acrobatically parried it to keep the visitors in the game . after that , real curiously chose to pack it in at the back - never a madrid strong point even in the club 's best years . for half an hour , it looked as though real might be able to hold their two-goal advantage .
bayern 's lack of true playmaker was all too apparent as they seldom created open shots on goal . but in 79th minute , substitute bayern striker claudio pizarro was narrowly denied by casillas from 10 meters .
two minutes from time , midfielder mark van bommel drop-kicked a short real clearance into the back of the net for the final 3-2 scoreline . glass half-full or half-empty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel flexed his muscles late in the match the result was a bit of balsam for the wounded pride of these two former titans .
speaking after the match , kahn said " this is one of those losses that feels like a victory . " indeed , both sides played to a higher standard than their critics thought them capable of , treating fans to one of the better matches of this champions league season . but the game also showed that bayern - despite van bommel 's late goal - still need a creative director in midfield .
and real 's late weakness suggested that the squad is perhaps too old to pile on pressure over 90 minutes .
plus , beckham is out with injury for the return match . that sets the stage for a tough battle when the two teams play their return leg in munich on march 7 .
a 1-0 win for bayern would be enough to send them through to the tournament 's next round and force real to question why they failed to seal this encounter when they had the chance . whichever team comes up short in munich will be in for some harsh scrutiny from media and fans .
real and bayern are accustomed to silverware .

nine eu countries currently have a registration fee or motor vehicle tax contingent on co2 emissions , according to the association of european car-makers . austria , the netherlands and portugal reward owners of environmentally friendly cars with sliding registration fees .
in denmark , sweden and great britain , the vehicle tax is determined by the level of co2 emissions . car-owners with low-emission vehicles are given break on both the one-time registration fee and the annual vehicle tax in belgium , france and cyprus . in great britain , owners of vehicles that emit less that 100 grams of co2 per kilometer pay no tax at all , whereas the annual rate for diesel vehicles emitting more than 225 grams per kilometer is a hefty 320 euros -lrb- $ 421 -rrb- .
france has a similar system for company cars . in sweden , drivers pay 1.62 euros for every gram of co2 over 100 grams per kilometer that their vehicle emits . reaping the benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the us be the next to reward drivers for choosing planet-friendly vehicles ?
" changing the tax in england has already had an effect on which new cars people buy , " said uwe kunert , transportation expert from the german institute for economic research .

nine eu countries currently have a registration fee or motor vehicle tax contingent on co2 emissions , according to the association of european car-makers . austria , the netherlands and portugal reward owners of environmentally friendly cars with sliding registration fees .
in denmark , sweden and great britain , the vehicle tax is determined by the level of co2 emissions . car-owners with low-emission vehicles are given break on both the one-time registration fee and the annual vehicle tax in belgium , france and cyprus . in great britain , owners of vehicles that emit less that 100 grams of co2 per kilometer pay no tax at all , whereas the annual rate for diesel vehicles emitting more than 225 grams per kilometer is a hefty 320 euros -lrb- $ 421 -rrb- .
france has a similar system for company cars . in sweden , drivers pay 1.62 euros for every gram of co2 over 100 grams per kilometer that their vehicle emits . reaping the benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the us be the next to reward drivers for choosing planet-friendly vehicles ?
" changing the tax in england has already had an effect on which new cars people buy , " said uwe kunert , transportation expert from the german institute for economic research .

" those are not principles put there to be an obstacle , they are put there because they 're foundational for peace , " she said . " it 's very difficult to imagine a circumstance where you have peace talks but one party does n't recognize the existence of the other , " rice said . hamas , which the us , european union and israel consider a terrorist organization , has not yet clearly agreed to the west 's conditions of recognizing israel , renouncing violence and honoring past agreements with the jewish state . rice also emphasized the importance of continuing to support abbas in his power struggle with iranian-backed hamas . inconclusive summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ehud olmert -lrb- r -rrb- , rice and palestinian president mahmoud abbas -lrb- l -rrb- at talsk in jerusalem on monday rice held an inconclusive summit monday in jerusalem with abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert . steinmeier , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called the meeting " a first step " but noted that hopes for peace were complicated by the fraught negotiations on the formation of a palestinian government . " that is why we need to be particularly realistic going into these talks , " he said , referring to the quartet gathering . " we are nevertheless determined to seize this opportunity , " he said . russia and the un said they would use the berlin meeting to push for the unity government to be recognized .
moscow said it would call for the removal of aid and diplomatic boycotts imposed on the palestinian government after it fell under hamas ' control following january 2006 elections . growing unease the embargo imposed by the quartet after the 2006 elections has caused widespread economic hardship in the palestinian areas and there is growing unease in europe over the measures . the spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , cristina gallach , said that palestinian unity was a crucial step forward but indicated it was too early to consider lifting the embargo . " obviously one can not put everything on the table because they are still in negotiations - we have not yet seen the composition of the government , " she said . un chief ban ki-moon said in berlin ahead of the quartet talks that he was " encouraged " by the power-sharing deal between fatah and hamas . bildunterschrift : quartet members at a washington meeting defending the unity government abbas , long portrayed by washington as the best " partner for peace " with israel , has embarked on a diplomatic offensive of his own .
he is touring europe to defend the unity government deal . he insists the agreement reached between his fatah party and hamas should satisfy the quartet principles since it obliges the new unity government to respect international resolutions and agreements signed by the fatah-led palestine liberation organisation - meaning deals with the jewish state . palestinians urged the quartet powers to give their incoming government a chance . " we hope the quartet will take a positive approach towards the government and not resort to pressure and boycott , " said ghazi hamad , spokesman for the hamas-led government . israel has ruled out dealing with any government that includes hamas . it reiterated its hope that the quartet will stick to the conditions imposed on the palestinian government for the aid boycott to be lifted .

however , the fat lads from the fatherland would have to move fast to secure a date as competition for the super-size lovers from the island would be fierce .
the new report shows that 66.8 percent of men in germany are overweight , with 18.8 percent of those hitting levels of obesity .
that 's almost twice as many as their prospective partners in the uk .
the eurostat figures show that 33.6 percent of english women are fat .

" in all member states , the percentage of overweight men was higher than that of overweight women , " the report states .
the statistics office uses the " body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- " to determine what being fat means .
bmi is defined as the individual 's body weight divided by the square of their height .

washington however denies its coalition is crumbling . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday the british force in southern iraq would drop from 7,100 to 5,500 in coming months and could fall below 5,000 this year . blair , who has seen his popularity erode at home over his decision to go to war , said that soldiers however would remain into 2008 to provide support and training if iraq wanted . following britain 's lead , denmark and lithuania said they would withdraw most of their troops by august . denmark said its 430 ground troops would leave by august this year .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said the decision to withdraw troops was " taken together with our coalition allies , namely britain . " lithuanian defence minister juozas olekas told the baltic news service -lrb- bns -rrb- agency it was a " realistic possibility " that lithuania would not replace its 50 troops when their mission in iraq ends in august . the lithuanians are serving with a danish battalion near the southern city of basra , within the british-led multinational division .
like fellow baltic states latvia and estonia , lithuania joined nato in 2004 , and has been a staunch supporter of the united states in iraq . a string of other countries which sent troops either from the outset or later have already withdrawn from iraq , and others are planning to do so in the coming months . south korea and poland , with the largest contingents after the us and britain , have said they will leave by the end of the year . " next chapter can be written by iraqis " britain 's move was particularly important for washington as it is the second largest part of the us-led force in iraq after the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair said the peacekeeping reins had to be gradually handed over to the iraqis blair has faced huge domestic pressure over the unpopular war but he would not give a timetable for a complete british withdrawal . " the uk military presence will continue into 2008 for as long as we are wanted and have a job to do , " the prime minister told the british parliament on wednesday . british , danish and other multinational troops have been concentrated around the southern city of basra , which blair said remains " dangerous " but had improved enough for security to be handed over to iraqi forces . " what all this means is not that basra is how we want it to be , but it does mean that the next chapter in basra 's history can be written by iraqis , " blair said .
" increasingly our role will be supporting training and our numbers will be able to reduce accordingly , " he said . blair said british forces that remain would train iraqi troops , secure the iraq-iran border and supply routes and boost the ability of iraqi forces to conduct operations against extremist groups . blair 's unwavering support for president george w. bush over the us-led invasion in march 2003 has undermined his support at home .
britain put 40,000 troops into the invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six danish soldiers have been killed since 2003 in the violence in iraq in denmark , the government has been under increasing pressure to withdraw from iraq , and in january rasmussen voiced hopes that troop numbers could be reduced during 2007 .
six danish soldiers have been killed in iraq since 2003 . a poll published in early february showed that 64 percent of danes were " opposed " or " vehemently opposed " to the troop presence . meanwhile , bulgaria 's parliament voted on wednesday to extend the presence of the 155 bulgarian troops in iraq by a year . us denies coalition is crumbling britain 's announcement threw the spotlight on the us strategy in iraq , which has heightened bush 's unpopularity with the us public . us secretary of state condoleezza rice denied that the us-led coalition was crumbling . " the coalition remains intact and in fact the british still have thousands of soldiers deployed in iraq , in the south , " rice said in berlin .
she said the british pullout was part of the coalition strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said in berlin wednesday that the us-led coalition was not crumbling " it is the plan that as it is possible to transfer responsibilities to the iraqis , coalition forces would no longer be needed in those circumstances . " blair telephoned the us president on tuesday to warn him of the announcement , the white house said . " president bush sees this as a sign of success and what is possible for us once we help the iraqis deal with the sectarian violence in baghdad , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe . vice president dick cheney said the british drawdown was justified given the situation in basra , but stressed there could be no retreat from iraq . " i want you to know that the american people will not support a policy of retreat , " cheney said on the uss kitty hawk aircraft carrier while on a trip to japan .
" we want to complete the mission , we want to get it done right , and we want to return with honor , " he said . australian prime minister john howard , another strong backer of the us-led invasion , said he would not reduce australia 's 550 combat troops in iraq , part of a 1,400-strong force in the country . the united states has about 138,000 troops in iraq and has started sending another 21,500 to baghdad and surrounding provinces where the insurgency and sectarian violence has worsened in recent months . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost half of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .

" it is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings , including hospitals , have been artificially bloated by these cartels , " competition commissioner neelie kroes said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes says the damage caused by the cartel will last for many years " the national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong , but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway , " she said .
" the damage caused by this cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and elevators - for these companies the memory of this fine should last just as long , " she added . german firm gets stiffest fine german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the heaviest fine ever imposed by eu regulators on a single company in a cartel case because it was a repeated offender .
the german group was fined 480 million euros . otis , a unit of us conglomerate united technologies corporation , was given a fine of 225 million euros for its role , followed by schindler with a penalty of 144 million euros and kone with 142 million euros . eu antitrust investigators conducted so-called " dawn raids " on lift and escalator makers across europe in january 2004 after getting a tip off about the cartel .
after the raids , the companies handed over more evidence in the hope of winning leniency or reduced fines . the european commission said that high-ranking national-level management ran the cartel by holding secret meetings in bars and restaurants .
they also visited the countryside and traveled abroad and used pre-paid mobile phone cards to avoid regulators ' scrutiny . eu campaign against illegal cartels kroes , europe 's top antitrust regulator , is leading a campaign against illegal cartels and has been chalking up record fines against companies targeted by her crackdown . after bumper fines in 2006 , eu regulators in january ordered 10 companies to pay 750 million euros for fixing prices and carving up the market in electrical generation equipment .
after the lift makers case , that fine is now the third biggest ever against a cartel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the stiffest penalty until wednesday , the biggest fine in a european cartel case was 855 million euros in penalties imposed on eight vitamin makers in 2001 .
the vitamin makers ' fine was later reduced to 790 million euros by an eu court . despite the record fine on the lift makers , higher penalties are likely in future cases after the commission tightened its rules for calculating fines , making them heavier for repeat offenders and long-lasting cartels .
the reform could potentially cost guilty companies up to 10 times more than before . the commission was also given a boost in its anti-cartel campaign earlier this month with a ruling from the european court of justice that gave regulators more freedom to fix fines , especially how far back regulators can take previous offences into account . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission slaps huge fine on siemens for price fixing the eu has fined power equipment manufacturers for their roles in a price-fixing scheme .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 21.02.2007 eu anti-terrorism chief urges us to change tactics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuses such as those at abu ghraib have undermined the west 's fight against terror the us needs to re-embrace basic human rights , abandon tactics such as rendition and rebuild trust with the islamic world if the west 's war against terrorism is to be successful , says the eu 's anti-terrorism coordinator . the european union 's anti-terrorism coordinator , gijs de vries , has criticized us tactics in the war in terror , saying that victory can only be achieved through a return to " mainstream " human rights norms and the abandonment of policies such as special rendition .
de vries said that the abduction of terror suspects to third-party countries where torture is used in interrogation , the holding of so-called " enemy combatants " without trial at the prison camp in the us naval base in guantanamo , cuba and the widely-publicized abuse of prisoners at abu ghraib prison in iraq had all undermined the fight against islamist extremism .
image tarnished by scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gijs de vries hopes for a us return to human rights norms " the cia renditions , together with abu ghraib , guantanamo bay , and the military commissions act , unfortunately have tarnished the image of the united states in the fight against terrorism , among muslims and non-muslims , " de vries told reuters news service .
" i hope the united states , now that there is a new political dynamic in the us congress , can return to a mainstream interpretation of international human rights . "
the issue of rendition has added resonance in europe after the european parliament announced last week that a number of eu governments - including italy and germany - knew about the secret cia flights transporting suspects through europe but chose to look the other way .
de vries , the man charged with overseeing and coordinating the eu 's fight against terror , was himself strongly criticized by the european parliament for not providing answers on the allegations of complicity by eu governments in cia rendition .
national responsibility for secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu states are accused of turning a blind eye to cia flights however , de vries responded by saying that there had been no hard evidence to substantiate the accusations made against the eu countries by european lawmakers and that judgment should be reserved until the authorities in member states had carried out and completed their own investigations into the allegations of collusion .
he insisted that secret intelligence services remained under national control and that neither the eu as a whole nor he as anti-terrorism coordinator had much power to change that .
de vries told the european parliament that member states should exercise more parliamentary control on the activities of their secret services .
rebuild trust , work for peace de vries , who steps in march after three years in the job , said that a change in approach by the us and the eu to regain trust from the islamic world was essential in the battle of ideas with radical islamists . " ultimately that 's the long-term approach we need , " he said , adding that a concerted effort to bring peace to the middle east would also help .
until these objectives can be achieved , de fries said , the terrorism threat in the eu would remain at its current high level and would remain so for a number of years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does not rule out another attack on madrid 's scale " we can not exclude that attacks on the scale of london or madrid could be repeated .
meanwhile we see that other types of threats are also materializing , " he said , referring to a recent alleged plot to kidnap and behead a british muslim soldier in the uk .
de vries calls for eu streamlining he also called for a streamlining of decision-making on cooperation against terrorism and organized crime within the eu and for the introduction of majority votes instead of insisting on unanimity among all 27 countries .
" unanimous decisions simply take too long , " he said , blaming them for the eu 's failure to coordinate cross border operations between national police forces when tracking international criminals .
de fries became the european union 's first anti-terrorism coordinator just days after the bomb attacks in madrid in march 2004 , which killed 191 people . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia agents to stand trial for kidnapping in italy an italian judge ordered 26 americans , most of them thought to be cia agents , and the former head of italy 's military intelligence to stand trial over the 2003 kidnapping of an egyptian imam .

in the first leg real won 3-2 at home , but bayern hope things will be different in munich . the first leg two weeks ago was a bit like a battle between bruce springsteen and prince : the bavarians who used to be boss against the artists formerly known as the galacticos .
languishing in fourth place in their respective national leagues , both bayern and real were looking to restore some pride in tuesday 's match at bernabeu .
and both teams got some of what they wanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern had trouble coping with real 's pace real showed they meant business from the opening whistle and had their home fans cheering in the 10th minute , when raul muscled his way past a furiously sliding bayern keeper oliver kahn in the box .
the veteran striker slotted home to put the hosts up 1-0 . munich had trouble putting together combinations , but thanks to a set piece they got the equalizer thirteen minutes later .
bayern oldie-but-goodie willy sagnol blasted a free kick from around 40 meters out , and defender lucio headed beyond reach real keeper iker casillas . last hurrahs before hollywood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham is a no-go in munich after getting injured the rest of the first half was all madrid .
surprisingly the main motor of their impressive run was much-maligned midfielder david beckham , who is headed for los angeles in the summer and who had recently been left out of the squad . beckham was clearly out to prove he 's not washed up .
in the 28th minute , he fired a corner across the mouth of the goal .
defender ivan helguera headed the ball into the upper right corner , brushing raul 's hair in the process .
real were back in the lead . six minutes later , beckham pushed the ball forward , where it eventually found a criminally unmarked ruud van nistelrooy .
the dutchman fired home from five meters to give madrid a 3-1 advantage . real 's first half showed a return to the fluid attacking style that gained them the champions league title in 2002 .
meanwhile bayern were plagued by the midfield sluggishness and defensive lapses that have characterized their mediocre season . a familiar face comes up big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thanks to kahn , bayern avoided disaster the match could have turned into a debacle for munich in the second half , were it not for a sterling play by their 37-year-old keeper .
beckham curled a lethal-looking free kick toward the upper-left-hand corner of goal , but kahn acrobatically parried it to keep the visitors in the game . after that , real curiously chose to pack it in at the back - never a madrid strong point even in the club 's best years . for half an hour , it looked as though real might be able to hold their two-goal advantage .
bayern 's lack of true playmaker was all too apparent as they seldom created open shots on goal . but in 79th minute , substitute bayern striker claudio pizarro was narrowly denied by casillas from 10 meters .
two minutes from time , midfielder mark van bommel drop-kicked a short real clearance into the back of the net for the final 3-2 scoreline . glass half-full or half-empty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel flexed his muscles late in the match the result was a bit of balsam for the wounded pride of these two former titans .
speaking after the match , kahn said " this is one of those losses that feels like a victory . " indeed , both sides played to a higher standard than their critics thought them capable of , treating fans to one of the better matches of this champions league season . but the game also showed that bayern - despite van bommel 's late goal - still need a creative director in midfield .
and real 's late weakness suggested that the squad is perhaps too old to pile on pressure over 90 minutes .
plus , beckham is out with injury for the return match . that sets the stage for a tough battle when the two teams play their return leg in munich on march 7 .
a 1-0 win for bayern would be enough to send them through to the tournament 's next round and force real to question why they failed to seal this encounter when they had the chance . whichever team comes up short in munich will be in for some harsh scrutiny from media and fans .
real and bayern are accustomed to silverware .
with their domestic campaigns having faltered , the champions league is the last realistic chance at a title for both clubs . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " real madrid and bayern are in search of a new identity " legendary midfielder paul breitner was a star with both bayern munich and real madrid in the 1970s and 80s .

washington however denies its coalition is crumbling . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday the british force in southern iraq would drop from 7,100 to 5,500 in coming months and could fall below 5,000 this year . blair , who has seen his popularity erode at home over his decision to go to war , said that soldiers however would remain into 2008 to provide support and training if iraq wanted . following britain 's lead , denmark and lithuania said they would withdraw most of their troops by august . denmark said its 430 ground troops would leave by august this year .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said the decision to withdraw troops was " taken together with our coalition allies , namely britain . " lithuanian defence minister juozas olekas told the baltic news service -lrb- bns -rrb- agency it was a " realistic possibility " that lithuania would not replace its 50 troops when their mission in iraq ends in august . the lithuanians are serving with a danish battalion near the southern city of basra , within the british-led multinational division .
like fellow baltic states latvia and estonia , lithuania joined nato in 2004 , and has been a staunch supporter of the united states in iraq . a string of other countries which sent troops either from the outset or later have already withdrawn from iraq , and others are planning to do so in the coming months . south korea and poland , with the largest contingents after the us and britain , have said they will leave by the end of the year .

" the uk military presence will continue into 2008 for as long as we are wanted and have a job to do , " the prime minister told the british parliament on wednesday . british , danish and other multinational troops have been concentrated around the southern city of basra , which blair said remains " dangerous " but had improved enough for security to be handed over to iraqi forces . " what all this means is not that basra is how we want it to be , but it does mean that the next chapter in basra 's history can be written by iraqis , " blair said .
" increasingly our role will be supporting training and our numbers will be able to reduce accordingly , " he said . blair said british forces that remain would train iraqi troops , secure the iraq-iran border and supply routes and boost the ability of iraqi forces to conduct operations against extremist groups . blair 's unwavering support for president george w. bush over the us-led invasion in march 2003 has undermined his support at home .
britain put 40,000 troops into the invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six danish soldiers have been killed since 2003 in the violence in iraq in denmark , the government has been under increasing pressure to withdraw from iraq , and in january rasmussen voiced hopes that troop numbers could be reduced during 2007 .
six danish soldiers have been killed in iraq since 2003 . a poll published in early february showed that 64 percent of danes were " opposed " or " vehemently opposed " to the troop presence . meanwhile , bulgaria 's parliament voted on wednesday to extend the presence of the 155 bulgarian troops in iraq by a year . us denies coalition is crumbling britain 's announcement threw the spotlight on the us strategy in iraq , which has heightened bush 's unpopularity with the us public . us secretary of state condoleezza rice denied that the us-led coalition was crumbling .

she said the british pullout was part of the coalition strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said in berlin wednesday that the us-led coalition was not crumbling " it is the plan that as it is possible to transfer responsibilities to the iraqis , coalition forces would no longer be needed in those circumstances .

" i want you to know that the american people will not support a policy of retreat , " cheney said on the uss kitty hawk aircraft carrier while on a trip to japan .
" we want to complete the mission , we want to get it done right , and we want to return with honor , " he said . australian prime minister john howard , another strong backer of the us-led invasion , said he would not reduce australia 's 550 combat troops in iraq , part of a 1,400-strong force in the country . the united states has about 138,000 troops in iraq and has started sending another 21,500 to baghdad and surrounding provinces where the insurgency and sectarian violence has worsened in recent months . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost half of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .

washington however denies its coalition is crumbling . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday the british force in southern iraq would drop from 7,100 to 5,500 in coming months and could fall below 5,000 this year . blair , who has seen his popularity erode at home over his decision to go to war , said that soldiers however would remain into 2008 to provide support and training if iraq wanted . following britain 's lead , denmark and lithuania said they would withdraw most of their troops by august . denmark said its 430 ground troops would leave by august this year .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said the decision to withdraw troops was " taken together with our coalition allies , namely britain . " lithuanian defence minister juozas olekas told the baltic news service -lrb- bns -rrb- agency it was a " realistic possibility " that lithuania would not replace its 50 troops when their mission in iraq ends in august . the lithuanians are serving with a danish battalion near the southern city of basra , within the british-led multinational division .
like fellow baltic states latvia and estonia , lithuania joined nato in 2004 , and has been a staunch supporter of the united states in iraq . a string of other countries which sent troops either from the outset or later have already withdrawn from iraq , and others are planning to do so in the coming months . south korea and poland , with the largest contingents after the us and britain , have said they will leave by the end of the year . " next chapter can be written by iraqis " britain 's move was particularly important for washington as it is the second largest part of the us-led force in iraq after the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair said the peacekeeping reins had to be gradually handed over to the iraqis blair has faced huge domestic pressure over the unpopular war but he would not give a timetable for a complete british withdrawal . " the uk military presence will continue into 2008 for as long as we are wanted and have a job to do , " the prime minister told the british parliament on wednesday . british , danish and other multinational troops have been concentrated around the southern city of basra , which blair said remains " dangerous " but had improved enough for security to be handed over to iraqi forces . " what all this means is not that basra is how we want it to be , but it does mean that the next chapter in basra 's history can be written by iraqis , " blair said .
" increasingly our role will be supporting training and our numbers will be able to reduce accordingly , " he said . blair said british forces that remain would train iraqi troops , secure the iraq-iran border and supply routes and boost the ability of iraqi forces to conduct operations against extremist groups . blair 's unwavering support for president george w. bush over the us-led invasion in march 2003 has undermined his support at home .
britain put 40,000 troops into the invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six danish soldiers have been killed since 2003 in the violence in iraq in denmark , the government has been under increasing pressure to withdraw from iraq , and in january rasmussen voiced hopes that troop numbers could be reduced during 2007 .
six danish soldiers have been killed in iraq since 2003 . a poll published in early february showed that 64 percent of danes were " opposed " or " vehemently opposed " to the troop presence . meanwhile , bulgaria 's parliament voted on wednesday to extend the presence of the 155 bulgarian troops in iraq by a year . us denies coalition is crumbling britain 's announcement threw the spotlight on the us strategy in iraq , which has heightened bush 's unpopularity with the us public . us secretary of state condoleezza rice denied that the us-led coalition was crumbling . " the coalition remains intact and in fact the british still have thousands of soldiers deployed in iraq , in the south , " rice said in berlin .
she said the british pullout was part of the coalition strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said in berlin wednesday that the us-led coalition was not crumbling " it is the plan that as it is possible to transfer responsibilities to the iraqis , coalition forces would no longer be needed in those circumstances . " blair telephoned the us president on tuesday to warn him of the announcement , the white house said . " president bush sees this as a sign of success and what is possible for us once we help the iraqis deal with the sectarian violence in baghdad , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe . vice president dick cheney said the british drawdown was justified given the situation in basra , but stressed there could be no retreat from iraq . " i want you to know that the american people will not support a policy of retreat , " cheney said on the uss kitty hawk aircraft carrier while on a trip to japan .
" we want to complete the mission , we want to get it done right , and we want to return with honor , " he said . australian prime minister john howard , another strong backer of the us-led invasion , said he would not reduce australia 's 550 combat troops in iraq , part of a 1,400-strong force in the country . the united states has about 138,000 troops in iraq and has started sending another 21,500 to baghdad and surrounding provinces where the insurgency and sectarian violence has worsened in recent months . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost half of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .

in the first leg real won 3-2 at home , but bayern hope things will be different in munich . the first leg two weeks ago was a bit like a battle between bruce springsteen and prince : the bavarians who used to be boss against the artists formerly known as the galacticos .
languishing in fourth place in their respective national leagues , both bayern and real were looking to restore some pride in tuesday 's match at bernabeu .
and both teams got some of what they wanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern had trouble coping with real 's pace real showed they meant business from the opening whistle and had their home fans cheering in the 10th minute , when raul muscled his way past a furiously sliding bayern keeper oliver kahn in the box .
the veteran striker slotted home to put the hosts up 1-0 . munich had trouble putting together combinations , but thanks to a set piece they got the equalizer thirteen minutes later .

surprisingly the main motor of their impressive run was much-maligned midfielder david beckham , who is headed for los angeles in the summer and who had recently been left out of the squad . beckham was clearly out to prove he 's not washed up .
in the 28th minute , he fired a corner across the mouth of the goal .
defender ivan helguera headed the ball into the upper right corner , brushing raul 's hair in the process .
real were back in the lead . six minutes later , beckham pushed the ball forward , where it eventually found a criminally unmarked ruud van nistelrooy .
the dutchman fired home from five meters to give madrid a 3-1 advantage . real 's first half showed a return to the fluid attacking style that gained them the champions league title in 2002 .
meanwhile bayern were plagued by the midfield sluggishness and defensive lapses that have characterized their mediocre season . a familiar face comes up big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thanks to kahn , bayern avoided disaster the match could have turned into a debacle for munich in the second half , were it not for a sterling play by their 37-year-old keeper .
beckham curled a lethal-looking free kick toward the upper-left-hand corner of goal , but kahn acrobatically parried it to keep the visitors in the game . after that , real curiously chose to pack it in at the back - never a madrid strong point even in the club 's best years . for half an hour , it looked as though real might be able to hold their two-goal advantage .
bayern 's lack of true playmaker was all too apparent as they seldom created open shots on goal . but in 79th minute , substitute bayern striker claudio pizarro was narrowly denied by casillas from 10 meters .

speaking after the match , kahn said " this is one of those losses that feels like a victory . " indeed , both sides played to a higher standard than their critics thought them capable of , treating fans to one of the better matches of this champions league season . but the game also showed that bayern - despite van bommel 's late goal - still need a creative director in midfield .
and real 's late weakness suggested that the squad is perhaps too old to pile on pressure over 90 minutes .
plus , beckham is out with injury for the return match . that sets the stage for a tough battle when the two teams play their return leg in munich on march 7 .
a 1-0 win for bayern would be enough to send them through to the tournament 's next round and force real to question why they failed to seal this encounter when they had the chance . whichever team comes up short in munich will be in for some harsh scrutiny from media and fans .

washington however denies its coalition is crumbling . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday the british force in southern iraq would drop from 7,100 to 5,500 in coming months and could fall below 5,000 this year . blair , who has seen his popularity erode at home over his decision to go to war , said that soldiers however would remain into 2008 to provide support and training if iraq wanted . following britain 's lead , denmark and lithuania said they would withdraw most of their troops by august . denmark said its 430 ground troops would leave by august this year .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said the decision to withdraw troops was " taken together with our coalition allies , namely britain . " lithuanian defence minister juozas olekas told the baltic news service -lrb- bns -rrb- agency it was a " realistic possibility " that lithuania would not replace its 50 troops when their mission in iraq ends in august . the lithuanians are serving with a danish battalion near the southern city of basra , within the british-led multinational division .
like fellow baltic states latvia and estonia , lithuania joined nato in 2004 , and has been a staunch supporter of the united states in iraq . a string of other countries which sent troops either from the outset or later have already withdrawn from iraq , and others are planning to do so in the coming months . south korea and poland , with the largest contingents after the us and britain , have said they will leave by the end of the year . " next chapter can be written by iraqis " britain 's move was particularly important for washington as it is the second largest part of the us-led force in iraq after the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair said the peacekeeping reins had to be gradually handed over to the iraqis blair has faced huge domestic pressure over the unpopular war but he would not give a timetable for a complete british withdrawal . " the uk military presence will continue into 2008 for as long as we are wanted and have a job to do , " the prime minister told the british parliament on wednesday . british , danish and other multinational troops have been concentrated around the southern city of basra , which blair said remains " dangerous " but had improved enough for security to be handed over to iraqi forces . " what all this means is not that basra is how we want it to be , but it does mean that the next chapter in basra 's history can be written by iraqis , " blair said .
" increasingly our role will be supporting training and our numbers will be able to reduce accordingly , " he said . blair said british forces that remain would train iraqi troops , secure the iraq-iran border and supply routes and boost the ability of iraqi forces to conduct operations against extremist groups . blair 's unwavering support for president george w. bush over the us-led invasion in march 2003 has undermined his support at home .
britain put 40,000 troops into the invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six danish soldiers have been killed since 2003 in the violence in iraq in denmark , the government has been under increasing pressure to withdraw from iraq , and in january rasmussen voiced hopes that troop numbers could be reduced during 2007 .
six danish soldiers have been killed in iraq since 2003 . a poll published in early february showed that 64 percent of danes were " opposed " or " vehemently opposed " to the troop presence . meanwhile , bulgaria 's parliament voted on wednesday to extend the presence of the 155 bulgarian troops in iraq by a year . us denies coalition is crumbling britain 's announcement threw the spotlight on the us strategy in iraq , which has heightened bush 's unpopularity with the us public . us secretary of state condoleezza rice denied that the us-led coalition was crumbling . " the coalition remains intact and in fact the british still have thousands of soldiers deployed in iraq , in the south , " rice said in berlin .
she said the british pullout was part of the coalition strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said in berlin wednesday that the us-led coalition was not crumbling " it is the plan that as it is possible to transfer responsibilities to the iraqis , coalition forces would no longer be needed in those circumstances . " blair telephoned the us president on tuesday to warn him of the announcement , the white house said . " president bush sees this as a sign of success and what is possible for us once we help the iraqis deal with the sectarian violence in baghdad , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe . vice president dick cheney said the british drawdown was justified given the situation in basra , but stressed there could be no retreat from iraq . " i want you to know that the american people will not support a policy of retreat , " cheney said on the uss kitty hawk aircraft carrier while on a trip to japan .
" we want to complete the mission , we want to get it done right , and we want to return with honor , " he said . australian prime minister john howard , another strong backer of the us-led invasion , said he would not reduce australia 's 550 combat troops in iraq , part of a 1,400-strong force in the country . the united states has about 138,000 troops in iraq and has started sending another 21,500 to baghdad and surrounding provinces where the insurgency and sectarian violence has worsened in recent months . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost half of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .
dw 's peter philipp believes blair is playing a dangerous game .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 21.02.2007 eu anti-terrorism chief urges us to change tactics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuses such as those at abu ghraib have undermined the west 's fight against terror the us needs to re-embrace basic human rights , abandon tactics such as rendition and rebuild trust with the islamic world if the west 's war against terrorism is to be successful , says the eu 's anti-terrorism coordinator . the european union 's anti-terrorism coordinator , gijs de vries , has criticized us tactics in the war in terror , saying that victory can only be achieved through a return to " mainstream " human rights norms and the abandonment of policies such as special rendition .
de vries said that the abduction of terror suspects to third-party countries where torture is used in interrogation , the holding of so-called " enemy combatants " without trial at the prison camp in the us naval base in guantanamo , cuba and the widely-publicized abuse of prisoners at abu ghraib prison in iraq had all undermined the fight against islamist extremism .
image tarnished by scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gijs de vries hopes for a us return to human rights norms " the cia renditions , together with abu ghraib , guantanamo bay , and the military commissions act , unfortunately have tarnished the image of the united states in the fight against terrorism , among muslims and non-muslims , " de vries told reuters news service .
" i hope the united states , now that there is a new political dynamic in the us congress , can return to a mainstream interpretation of international human rights . "
the issue of rendition has added resonance in europe after the european parliament announced last week that a number of eu governments - including italy and germany - knew about the secret cia flights transporting suspects through europe but chose to look the other way .
de vries , the man charged with overseeing and coordinating the eu 's fight against terror , was himself strongly criticized by the european parliament for not providing answers on the allegations of complicity by eu governments in cia rendition .
national responsibility for secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu states are accused of turning a blind eye to cia flights however , de vries responded by saying that there had been no hard evidence to substantiate the accusations made against the eu countries by european lawmakers and that judgment should be reserved until the authorities in member states had carried out and completed their own investigations into the allegations of collusion .
he insisted that secret intelligence services remained under national control and that neither the eu as a whole nor he as anti-terrorism coordinator had much power to change that .
de vries told the european parliament that member states should exercise more parliamentary control on the activities of their secret services .
rebuild trust , work for peace de vries , who steps in march after three years in the job , said that a change in approach by the us and the eu to regain trust from the islamic world was essential in the battle of ideas with radical islamists . " ultimately that 's the long-term approach we need , " he said , adding that a concerted effort to bring peace to the middle east would also help .
until these objectives can be achieved , de fries said , the terrorism threat in the eu would remain at its current high level and would remain so for a number of years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does not rule out another attack on madrid 's scale " we can not exclude that attacks on the scale of london or madrid could be repeated .
meanwhile we see that other types of threats are also materializing , " he said , referring to a recent alleged plot to kidnap and behead a british muslim soldier in the uk .
de vries calls for eu streamlining he also called for a streamlining of decision-making on cooperation against terrorism and organized crime within the eu and for the introduction of majority votes instead of insisting on unanimity among all 27 countries .
" unanimous decisions simply take too long , " he said , blaming them for the eu 's failure to coordinate cross border operations between national police forces when tracking international criminals .
de fries became the european union 's first anti-terrorism coordinator just days after the bomb attacks in madrid in march 2004 , which killed 191 people . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia agents to stand trial for kidnapping in italy an italian judge ordered 26 americans , most of them thought to be cia agents , and the former head of italy 's military intelligence to stand trial over the 2003 kidnapping of an egyptian imam .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 21.02.2007 opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost a quarter of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .
dw 's peter philipp believes blair is playing a dangerous game . despite not being able to influence events in iraq through his actions , british prime minister tony blair can at least use the situation there for his own domestic purposes .
news that blair intends to withdraw almost a quarter of the british occupation force in iraq - 1,600 of some 7,000 soldiers stationed there - can not be seen in any other light .
it is no coincidence that public opinion back in the uk is in favor of a withdrawal , while the fact that blair has already announced his resignation means he may not be around to face the consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair finds himself in a very difficult position .
up until now , the prime minister was the united states ' most dependable ally in iraq but now he appears to be jumping ship just at the moment when president george w. bush is looking to strengthen the troop deployment in the country .
blair could face the wrath of a president betrayed .
while there is certainly a difference between the operations of the us forces in their crackdown on insurgents and criminal gangs in baghdad and the british occupation of the relatively less volatile southern city of basra , a withdrawal of the british contingent at a time when more not fewer troops is the message from washington is certainly a risk .
one way in which blair could avoid the rapprochement of the americans while scoring a domestic success would be to declare " mission accomplished . "
however , washington will know better than most how successful the british contribution to security in iraq has been while the british public would be unlikely to suddenly view the iraq adventure in a better light just because the troops are now coming home .
at best , blair will be seen in the uk as trying to rectify what is seen as the biggest mistake of his premiership and as trying to shake off the shackles of us loyalty before he departs the political arena .
it is unlikely that much will be changed in iraq 's situation by the british departure .
the main fear is that the shiite majority in the south will rise up against the occupying forces and that the united states , with enough on their plate in baghdad and the rest of the country , will then be over-stretched .
this would surely end blair 's dream of being inducted in the us hall of fame for honorable allies .
however there is little to suggest that any such uprising would happen .
the iraqi shiites have absolutely no interest in openly engaging the occupation forces , especially when they hold a majority of power in the iraqi government already .
there is no need to fight for something that has already been handed to them by a democratic process .
the only conceivable danger would be a confrontation between the united states and iran .
tehran could activate allies in iraq to make life very complicated for the americans and where better to ferment unrest than in southern iraq , an area of the country which would have been weakened by a partial british withdrawal ? peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and a middle east expert -lrb- nda -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe says saddam 's execution solves no problems for iraq as european nations criticized the execution of saddam hussein out of opposition to the death penalty , sunday newspapers across the continent were pessimistic as to whether the hanging would solve any of iraq 's problems .

in the first leg real won 3-2 at home , but bayern hope things will be different in munich . the first leg two weeks ago was a bit like a battle between bruce springsteen and prince : the bavarians who used to be boss against the artists formerly known as the galacticos .
languishing in fourth place in their respective national leagues , both bayern and real were looking to restore some pride in tuesday 's match at bernabeu .
and both teams got some of what they wanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern had trouble coping with real 's pace real showed they meant business from the opening whistle and had their home fans cheering in the 10th minute , when raul muscled his way past a furiously sliding bayern keeper oliver kahn in the box .
the veteran striker slotted home to put the hosts up 1-0 . munich had trouble putting together combinations , but thanks to a set piece they got the equalizer thirteen minutes later .
bayern oldie-but-goodie willy sagnol blasted a free kick from around 40 meters out , and defender lucio headed beyond reach real keeper iker casillas . last hurrahs before hollywood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham is a no-go in munich after getting injured the rest of the first half was all madrid .
surprisingly the main motor of their impressive run was much-maligned midfielder david beckham , who is headed for los angeles in the summer and who had recently been left out of the squad . beckham was clearly out to prove he 's not washed up .
in the 28th minute , he fired a corner across the mouth of the goal .
defender ivan helguera headed the ball into the upper right corner , brushing raul 's hair in the process .
real were back in the lead . six minutes later , beckham pushed the ball forward , where it eventually found a criminally unmarked ruud van nistelrooy .
the dutchman fired home from five meters to give madrid a 3-1 advantage . real 's first half showed a return to the fluid attacking style that gained them the champions league title in 2002 .
meanwhile bayern were plagued by the midfield sluggishness and defensive lapses that have characterized their mediocre season . a familiar face comes up big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thanks to kahn , bayern avoided disaster the match could have turned into a debacle for munich in the second half , were it not for a sterling play by their 37-year-old keeper .
beckham curled a lethal-looking free kick toward the upper-left-hand corner of goal , but kahn acrobatically parried it to keep the visitors in the game . after that , real curiously chose to pack it in at the back - never a madrid strong point even in the club 's best years . for half an hour , it looked as though real might be able to hold their two-goal advantage .
bayern 's lack of true playmaker was all too apparent as they seldom created open shots on goal . but in 79th minute , substitute bayern striker claudio pizarro was narrowly denied by casillas from 10 meters .
two minutes from time , midfielder mark van bommel drop-kicked a short real clearance into the back of the net for the final 3-2 scoreline . glass half-full or half-empty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel flexed his muscles late in the match the result was a bit of balsam for the wounded pride of these two former titans .
speaking after the match , kahn said " this is one of those losses that feels like a victory . " indeed , both sides played to a higher standard than their critics thought them capable of , treating fans to one of the better matches of this champions league season . but the game also showed that bayern - despite van bommel 's late goal - still need a creative director in midfield .
and real 's late weakness suggested that the squad is perhaps too old to pile on pressure over 90 minutes .
plus , beckham is out with injury for the return match . that sets the stage for a tough battle when the two teams play their return leg in munich on march 7 .
a 1-0 win for bayern would be enough to send them through to the tournament 's next round and force real to question why they failed to seal this encounter when they had the chance . whichever team comes up short in munich will be in for some harsh scrutiny from media and fans .
real and bayern are accustomed to silverware .

in the first leg real won 3-2 at home , but bayern hope things will be different in munich . the first leg two weeks ago was a bit like a battle between bruce springsteen and prince : the bavarians who used to be boss against the artists formerly known as the galacticos .
languishing in fourth place in their respective national leagues , both bayern and real were looking to restore some pride in tuesday 's match at bernabeu .
and both teams got some of what they wanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern had trouble coping with real 's pace real showed they meant business from the opening whistle and had their home fans cheering in the 10th minute , when raul muscled his way past a furiously sliding bayern keeper oliver kahn in the box .
the veteran striker slotted home to put the hosts up 1-0 . munich had trouble putting together combinations , but thanks to a set piece they got the equalizer thirteen minutes later .
bayern oldie-but-goodie willy sagnol blasted a free kick from around 40 meters out , and defender lucio headed beyond reach real keeper iker casillas . last hurrahs before hollywood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham is a no-go in munich after getting injured the rest of the first half was all madrid .
surprisingly the main motor of their impressive run was much-maligned midfielder david beckham , who is headed for los angeles in the summer and who had recently been left out of the squad . beckham was clearly out to prove he 's not washed up .
in the 28th minute , he fired a corner across the mouth of the goal .
defender ivan helguera headed the ball into the upper right corner , brushing raul 's hair in the process .
real were back in the lead . six minutes later , beckham pushed the ball forward , where it eventually found a criminally unmarked ruud van nistelrooy .
the dutchman fired home from five meters to give madrid a 3-1 advantage . real 's first half showed a return to the fluid attacking style that gained them the champions league title in 2002 .
meanwhile bayern were plagued by the midfield sluggishness and defensive lapses that have characterized their mediocre season . a familiar face comes up big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thanks to kahn , bayern avoided disaster the match could have turned into a debacle for munich in the second half , were it not for a sterling play by their 37-year-old keeper .
beckham curled a lethal-looking free kick toward the upper-left-hand corner of goal , but kahn acrobatically parried it to keep the visitors in the game . after that , real curiously chose to pack it in at the back - never a madrid strong point even in the club 's best years . for half an hour , it looked as though real might be able to hold their two-goal advantage .
bayern 's lack of true playmaker was all too apparent as they seldom created open shots on goal . but in 79th minute , substitute bayern striker claudio pizarro was narrowly denied by casillas from 10 meters .
two minutes from time , midfielder mark van bommel drop-kicked a short real clearance into the back of the net for the final 3-2 scoreline . glass half-full or half-empty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel flexed his muscles late in the match the result was a bit of balsam for the wounded pride of these two former titans .

de vries said that the abduction of terror suspects to third-party countries where torture is used in interrogation , the holding of so-called " enemy combatants " without trial at the prison camp in the us naval base in guantanamo , cuba and the widely-publicized abuse of prisoners at abu ghraib prison in iraq had all undermined the fight against islamist extremism .
image tarnished by scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gijs de vries hopes for a us return to human rights norms " the cia renditions , together with abu ghraib , guantanamo bay , and the military commissions act , unfortunately have tarnished the image of the united states in the fight against terrorism , among muslims and non-muslims , " de vries told reuters news service .
" i hope the united states , now that there is a new political dynamic in the us congress , can return to a mainstream interpretation of international human rights . "
the issue of rendition has added resonance in europe after the european parliament announced last week that a number of eu governments - including italy and germany - knew about the secret cia flights transporting suspects through europe but chose to look the other way .
de vries , the man charged with overseeing and coordinating the eu 's fight against terror , was himself strongly criticized by the european parliament for not providing answers on the allegations of complicity by eu governments in cia rendition .
national responsibility for secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu states are accused of turning a blind eye to cia flights however , de vries responded by saying that there had been no hard evidence to substantiate the accusations made against the eu countries by european lawmakers and that judgment should be reserved until the authorities in member states had carried out and completed their own investigations into the allegations of collusion .
he insisted that secret intelligence services remained under national control and that neither the eu as a whole nor he as anti-terrorism coordinator had much power to change that .
de vries told the european parliament that member states should exercise more parliamentary control on the activities of their secret services .
rebuild trust , work for peace de vries , who steps in march after three years in the job , said that a change in approach by the us and the eu to regain trust from the islamic world was essential in the battle of ideas with radical islamists . " ultimately that 's the long-term approach we need , " he said , adding that a concerted effort to bring peace to the middle east would also help .
until these objectives can be achieved , de fries said , the terrorism threat in the eu would remain at its current high level and would remain so for a number of years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does not rule out another attack on madrid 's scale " we can not exclude that attacks on the scale of london or madrid could be repeated .
meanwhile we see that other types of threats are also materializing , " he said , referring to a recent alleged plot to kidnap and behead a british muslim soldier in the uk .
de vries calls for eu streamlining he also called for a streamlining of decision-making on cooperation against terrorism and organized crime within the eu and for the introduction of majority votes instead of insisting on unanimity among all 27 countries .
" unanimous decisions simply take too long , " he said , blaming them for the eu 's failure to coordinate cross border operations between national police forces when tracking international criminals .

de vries said that the abduction of terror suspects to third-party countries where torture is used in interrogation , the holding of so-called " enemy combatants " without trial at the prison camp in the us naval base in guantanamo , cuba and the widely-publicized abuse of prisoners at abu ghraib prison in iraq had all undermined the fight against islamist extremism .
image tarnished by scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gijs de vries hopes for a us return to human rights norms " the cia renditions , together with abu ghraib , guantanamo bay , and the military commissions act , unfortunately have tarnished the image of the united states in the fight against terrorism , among muslims and non-muslims , " de vries told reuters news service .
" i hope the united states , now that there is a new political dynamic in the us congress , can return to a mainstream interpretation of international human rights . "
the issue of rendition has added resonance in europe after the european parliament announced last week that a number of eu governments - including italy and germany - knew about the secret cia flights transporting suspects through europe but chose to look the other way .
de vries , the man charged with overseeing and coordinating the eu 's fight against terror , was himself strongly criticized by the european parliament for not providing answers on the allegations of complicity by eu governments in cia rendition .
national responsibility for secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu states are accused of turning a blind eye to cia flights however , de vries responded by saying that there had been no hard evidence to substantiate the accusations made against the eu countries by european lawmakers and that judgment should be reserved until the authorities in member states had carried out and completed their own investigations into the allegations of collusion .
he insisted that secret intelligence services remained under national control and that neither the eu as a whole nor he as anti-terrorism coordinator had much power to change that .
de vries told the european parliament that member states should exercise more parliamentary control on the activities of their secret services .
rebuild trust , work for peace de vries , who steps in march after three years in the job , said that a change in approach by the us and the eu to regain trust from the islamic world was essential in the battle of ideas with radical islamists . " ultimately that 's the long-term approach we need , " he said , adding that a concerted effort to bring peace to the middle east would also help .
until these objectives can be achieved , de fries said , the terrorism threat in the eu would remain at its current high level and would remain so for a number of years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does not rule out another attack on madrid 's scale " we can not exclude that attacks on the scale of london or madrid could be repeated .
meanwhile we see that other types of threats are also materializing , " he said , referring to a recent alleged plot to kidnap and behead a british muslim soldier in the uk .
de vries calls for eu streamlining he also called for a streamlining of decision-making on cooperation against terrorism and organized crime within the eu and for the introduction of majority votes instead of insisting on unanimity among all 27 countries .
" unanimous decisions simply take too long , " he said , blaming them for the eu 's failure to coordinate cross border operations between national police forces when tracking international criminals .
de fries became the european union 's first anti-terrorism coordinator just days after the bomb attacks in madrid in march 2004 , which killed 191 people . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia agents to stand trial for kidnapping in italy an italian judge ordered 26 americans , most of them thought to be cia agents , and the former head of italy 's military intelligence to stand trial over the 2003 kidnapping of an egyptian imam .

" it is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings , including hospitals , have been artificially bloated by these cartels , " competition commissioner neelie kroes said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes says the damage caused by the cartel will last for many years " the national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong , but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway , " she said .
" the damage caused by this cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and elevators - for these companies the memory of this fine should last just as long , " she added . german firm gets stiffest fine german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the heaviest fine ever imposed by eu regulators on a single company in a cartel case because it was a repeated offender .
the german group was fined 480 million euros . otis , a unit of us conglomerate united technologies corporation , was given a fine of 225 million euros for its role , followed by schindler with a penalty of 144 million euros and kone with 142 million euros . eu antitrust investigators conducted so-called " dawn raids " on lift and escalator makers across europe in january 2004 after getting a tip off about the cartel .
after the raids , the companies handed over more evidence in the hope of winning leniency or reduced fines . the european commission said that high-ranking national-level management ran the cartel by holding secret meetings in bars and restaurants .
they also visited the countryside and traveled abroad and used pre-paid mobile phone cards to avoid regulators ' scrutiny . eu campaign against illegal cartels kroes , europe 's top antitrust regulator , is leading a campaign against illegal cartels and has been chalking up record fines against companies targeted by her crackdown . after bumper fines in 2006 , eu regulators in january ordered 10 companies to pay 750 million euros for fixing prices and carving up the market in electrical generation equipment .
after the lift makers case , that fine is now the third biggest ever against a cartel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the stiffest penalty until wednesday , the biggest fine in a european cartel case was 855 million euros in penalties imposed on eight vitamin makers in 2001 .
the vitamin makers ' fine was later reduced to 790 million euros by an eu court . despite the record fine on the lift makers , higher penalties are likely in future cases after the commission tightened its rules for calculating fines , making them heavier for repeat offenders and long-lasting cartels .
the reform could potentially cost guilty companies up to 10 times more than before . the commission was also given a boost in its anti-cartel campaign earlier this month with a ruling from the european court of justice that gave regulators more freedom to fix fines , especially how far back regulators can take previous offences into account . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission slaps huge fine on siemens for price fixing the eu has fined power equipment manufacturers for their roles in a price-fixing scheme .

" immigrant parents should n't speak german at home cultural and linguistic diversity is a richness that should be used for the individual and collective learning experience , the greek-born fthenakis said .
germany though did n't have policies like sweden , england or france do .
he said german guidelines could only be called disoriented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some grade schools offer language training for immigrant children according to fthenakis , the role that the family and their educational level play should not be underestimated .
young students will quickly learn german if they can speak and write in their mother language , fthenakis said . he said he is convinced that the language learning process should start before kids enter the school system .
in germany , that would be before the age of six .
every child is open to any language in the world before its first birthday - learning a second language is no problem at all , fthenakis said . critics of the multilingual approach said immigrant parents should speak german with their children at home .
but this was counterproductive , said duisburg-essen university 's baur . " if the parents do n't speak german well , they should n't speak it with their children , " baur said .
" at some point , the children 's german language abilities will be better than the parents ' , and then they 'll make fun of them and say , you ca n't even speak the language properly that you 're trying to speak with me .

" it is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings , including hospitals , have been artificially bloated by these cartels , " competition commissioner neelie kroes said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes says the damage caused by the cartel will last for many years " the national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong , but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway , " she said .
" the damage caused by this cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and elevators - for these companies the memory of this fine should last just as long , " she added . german firm gets stiffest fine german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the heaviest fine ever imposed by eu regulators on a single company in a cartel case because it was a repeated offender .
the german group was fined 480 million euros . otis , a unit of us conglomerate united technologies corporation , was given a fine of 225 million euros for its role , followed by schindler with a penalty of 144 million euros and kone with 142 million euros . eu antitrust investigators conducted so-called " dawn raids " on lift and escalator makers across europe in january 2004 after getting a tip off about the cartel .

after the lift makers case , that fine is now the third biggest ever against a cartel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the stiffest penalty until wednesday , the biggest fine in a european cartel case was 855 million euros in penalties imposed on eight vitamin makers in 2001 .
the vitamin makers ' fine was later reduced to 790 million euros by an eu court . despite the record fine on the lift makers , higher penalties are likely in future cases after the commission tightened its rules for calculating fines , making them heavier for repeat offenders and long-lasting cartels .

" … blair will hardly be able to improve his image in history books , " the paper wrote .
" he said himself that he had wanted to lead great britain into the euro zone , into the heart of europe , but what he 's ended up doing is turning the united kingdom into an aircraft carrier for the united states , " the paper wrote .
it also pointed out that british voters will punish blair 's labour party just like american voters did with the republicans in congressional elections in november .

dw 's peter philipp believes blair is playing a dangerous game . despite not being able to influence events in iraq through his actions , british prime minister tony blair can at least use the situation there for his own domestic purposes .
news that blair intends to withdraw almost a quarter of the british occupation force in iraq - 1,600 of some 7,000 soldiers stationed there - can not be seen in any other light .
it is no coincidence that public opinion back in the uk is in favor of a withdrawal , while the fact that blair has already announced his resignation means he may not be around to face the consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair finds himself in a very difficult position .
up until now , the prime minister was the united states ' most dependable ally in iraq but now he appears to be jumping ship just at the moment when president george w. bush is looking to strengthen the troop deployment in the country .
blair could face the wrath of a president betrayed .
while there is certainly a difference between the operations of the us forces in their crackdown on insurgents and criminal gangs in baghdad and the british occupation of the relatively less volatile southern city of basra , a withdrawal of the british contingent at a time when more not fewer troops is the message from washington is certainly a risk .
one way in which blair could avoid the rapprochement of the americans while scoring a domestic success would be to declare " mission accomplished . "
however , washington will know better than most how successful the british contribution to security in iraq has been while the british public would be unlikely to suddenly view the iraq adventure in a better light just because the troops are now coming home .
at best , blair will be seen in the uk as trying to rectify what is seen as the biggest mistake of his premiership and as trying to shake off the shackles of us loyalty before he departs the political arena .
it is unlikely that much will be changed in iraq 's situation by the british departure .
the main fear is that the shiite majority in the south will rise up against the occupying forces and that the united states , with enough on their plate in baghdad and the rest of the country , will then be over-stretched .
this would surely end blair 's dream of being inducted in the us hall of fame for honorable allies .
however there is little to suggest that any such uprising would happen .
the iraqi shiites have absolutely no interest in openly engaging the occupation forces , especially when they hold a majority of power in the iraqi government already .
there is no need to fight for something that has already been handed to them by a democratic process .
the only conceivable danger would be a confrontation between the united states and iran .

dw 's peter philipp believes blair is playing a dangerous game . despite not being able to influence events in iraq through his actions , british prime minister tony blair can at least use the situation there for his own domestic purposes .
news that blair intends to withdraw almost a quarter of the british occupation force in iraq - 1,600 of some 7,000 soldiers stationed there - can not be seen in any other light .
it is no coincidence that public opinion back in the uk is in favor of a withdrawal , while the fact that blair has already announced his resignation means he may not be around to face the consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair finds himself in a very difficult position .
up until now , the prime minister was the united states ' most dependable ally in iraq but now he appears to be jumping ship just at the moment when president george w. bush is looking to strengthen the troop deployment in the country .
blair could face the wrath of a president betrayed .
while there is certainly a difference between the operations of the us forces in their crackdown on insurgents and criminal gangs in baghdad and the british occupation of the relatively less volatile southern city of basra , a withdrawal of the british contingent at a time when more not fewer troops is the message from washington is certainly a risk .
one way in which blair could avoid the rapprochement of the americans while scoring a domestic success would be to declare " mission accomplished . "
however , washington will know better than most how successful the british contribution to security in iraq has been while the british public would be unlikely to suddenly view the iraq adventure in a better light just because the troops are now coming home .
at best , blair will be seen in the uk as trying to rectify what is seen as the biggest mistake of his premiership and as trying to shake off the shackles of us loyalty before he departs the political arena .
it is unlikely that much will be changed in iraq 's situation by the british departure .
the main fear is that the shiite majority in the south will rise up against the occupying forces and that the united states , with enough on their plate in baghdad and the rest of the country , will then be over-stretched .
this would surely end blair 's dream of being inducted in the us hall of fame for honorable allies .
however there is little to suggest that any such uprising would happen .
the iraqi shiites have absolutely no interest in openly engaging the occupation forces , especially when they hold a majority of power in the iraqi government already .
there is no need to fight for something that has already been handed to them by a democratic process .
the only conceivable danger would be a confrontation between the united states and iran .

but critics say germany is n't doing enough to promote linguistic diversity and multilingual education . the integration debate in germany has included a strong focus on immigrant children 's language skills .
both politicians and educators agree that it 's especially important to speak the language of the country you live in - and speak it well in order to get a good education and find a job . in germany , though , children from immigrant families often have problems at school .
their german just is n't good enough .
as a result , some german states are giving fewer lessons in these kids ' native tongues - a move not all teachers and linguists agree with . ruprecht baur , professor for german as a foreign language at duisburg-essen university , said several questions always come up in discussions on integration .
does the fact that a child comes from an immigrant family and speaks a different language prevent him or her from learning german and doing well at school ?
should the parents speak german at home , and avoid their native tongue ?
and is being exposed to two languages the reason some children here , notably with an italian or turkish background , fail in school ? according to baur , these questions arise despite multilingualism being the rule almost everywhere in the world . " international studies show that the mother tongue is no distraction , " baur said .
" the majority of people all over the world speak several languages .
they 're born with a mother language , and often know two more . " germany lacking interest in linguistic heritage the european union has repeatedly stressed the importance and its support of linguistic pluralism .
eu guidelines even commit member states to promote language classes in the children 's mother tongues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some turkish children perfect their mother tongue in germany that 's the case in germany as well - in theory .
in practice , north rhine-westphalia for example has cut back on native language teaching positions .
neighboring hesse has discontinued these classes altogether . the western german states reasoned that learning german at an early age was more important .
but vassilios fthenakis , professor for development psychology at italy 's bozen university , is critical of germany 's educational policies . " it 's an ongoing german problem : not taking a serious interest in the importance of a child 's mother language and culture , but pushing forward integration that is n't working , " fthenakis said .
" it 's a fundamental problem that germany does n't first strengthen a child 's mother language and culture , and then push learning german from that point on . " immigrant parents should n't speak german at home cultural and linguistic diversity is a richness that should be used for the individual and collective learning experience , the greek-born fthenakis said .
germany though did n't have policies like sweden , england or france do .
he said german guidelines could only be called disoriented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some grade schools offer language training for immigrant children according to fthenakis , the role that the family and their educational level play should not be underestimated .
young students will quickly learn german if they can speak and write in their mother language , fthenakis said . he said he is convinced that the language learning process should start before kids enter the school system .
in germany , that would be before the age of six .
every child is open to any language in the world before its first birthday - learning a second language is no problem at all , fthenakis said . critics of the multilingual approach said immigrant parents should speak german with their children at home .
but this was counterproductive , said duisburg-essen university 's baur . " if the parents do n't speak german well , they should n't speak it with their children , " baur said .
" at some point , the children 's german language abilities will be better than the parents ' , and then they 'll make fun of them and say , you ca n't even speak the language properly that you 're trying to speak with me .

" it is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings , including hospitals , have been artificially bloated by these cartels , " competition commissioner neelie kroes said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes says the damage caused by the cartel will last for many years " the national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong , but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway , " she said .
" the damage caused by this cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and elevators - for these companies the memory of this fine should last just as long , " she added . german firm gets stiffest fine german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the heaviest fine ever imposed by eu regulators on a single company in a cartel case because it was a repeated offender .
the german group was fined 480 million euros . otis , a unit of us conglomerate united technologies corporation , was given a fine of 225 million euros for its role , followed by schindler with a penalty of 144 million euros and kone with 142 million euros . eu antitrust investigators conducted so-called " dawn raids " on lift and escalator makers across europe in january 2004 after getting a tip off about the cartel .
after the raids , the companies handed over more evidence in the hope of winning leniency or reduced fines . the european commission said that high-ranking national-level management ran the cartel by holding secret meetings in bars and restaurants .
they also visited the countryside and traveled abroad and used pre-paid mobile phone cards to avoid regulators ' scrutiny . eu campaign against illegal cartels kroes , europe 's top antitrust regulator , is leading a campaign against illegal cartels and has been chalking up record fines against companies targeted by her crackdown . after bumper fines in 2006 , eu regulators in january ordered 10 companies to pay 750 million euros for fixing prices and carving up the market in electrical generation equipment .
after the lift makers case , that fine is now the third biggest ever against a cartel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the stiffest penalty until wednesday , the biggest fine in a european cartel case was 855 million euros in penalties imposed on eight vitamin makers in 2001 .
the vitamin makers ' fine was later reduced to 790 million euros by an eu court . despite the record fine on the lift makers , higher penalties are likely in future cases after the commission tightened its rules for calculating fines , making them heavier for repeat offenders and long-lasting cartels .
the reform could potentially cost guilty companies up to 10 times more than before . the commission was also given a boost in its anti-cartel campaign earlier this month with a ruling from the european court of justice that gave regulators more freedom to fix fines , especially how far back regulators can take previous offences into account . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission slaps huge fine on siemens for price fixing the eu has fined power equipment manufacturers for their roles in a price-fixing scheme .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 21.02.2007 opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost a quarter of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .
dw 's peter philipp believes blair is playing a dangerous game . despite not being able to influence events in iraq through his actions , british prime minister tony blair can at least use the situation there for his own domestic purposes .
news that blair intends to withdraw almost a quarter of the british occupation force in iraq - 1,600 of some 7,000 soldiers stationed there - can not be seen in any other light .
it is no coincidence that public opinion back in the uk is in favor of a withdrawal , while the fact that blair has already announced his resignation means he may not be around to face the consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair finds himself in a very difficult position .
up until now , the prime minister was the united states ' most dependable ally in iraq but now he appears to be jumping ship just at the moment when president george w. bush is looking to strengthen the troop deployment in the country .
blair could face the wrath of a president betrayed .
while there is certainly a difference between the operations of the us forces in their crackdown on insurgents and criminal gangs in baghdad and the british occupation of the relatively less volatile southern city of basra , a withdrawal of the british contingent at a time when more not fewer troops is the message from washington is certainly a risk .
one way in which blair could avoid the rapprochement of the americans while scoring a domestic success would be to declare " mission accomplished . "
however , washington will know better than most how successful the british contribution to security in iraq has been while the british public would be unlikely to suddenly view the iraq adventure in a better light just because the troops are now coming home .
at best , blair will be seen in the uk as trying to rectify what is seen as the biggest mistake of his premiership and as trying to shake off the shackles of us loyalty before he departs the political arena .
it is unlikely that much will be changed in iraq 's situation by the british departure .
the main fear is that the shiite majority in the south will rise up against the occupying forces and that the united states , with enough on their plate in baghdad and the rest of the country , will then be over-stretched .
this would surely end blair 's dream of being inducted in the us hall of fame for honorable allies .
however there is little to suggest that any such uprising would happen .
the iraqi shiites have absolutely no interest in openly engaging the occupation forces , especially when they hold a majority of power in the iraqi government already .
there is no need to fight for something that has already been handed to them by a democratic process .
the only conceivable danger would be a confrontation between the united states and iran .
tehran could activate allies in iraq to make life very complicated for the americans and where better to ferment unrest than in southern iraq , an area of the country which would have been weakened by a partial british withdrawal ? peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and a middle east expert -lrb- nda -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe says saddam 's execution solves no problems for iraq as european nations criticized the execution of saddam hussein out of opposition to the death penalty , sunday newspapers across the continent were pessimistic as to whether the hanging would solve any of iraq 's problems .

however , the fat lads from the fatherland would have to move fast to secure a date as competition for the super-size lovers from the island would be fierce .
the new report shows that 66.8 percent of men in germany are overweight , with 18.8 percent of those hitting levels of obesity .
that 's almost twice as many as their prospective partners in the uk .
the eurostat figures show that 33.6 percent of english women are fat .

the statistics office uses the " body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- " to determine what being fat means .

" it is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings , including hospitals , have been artificially bloated by these cartels , " competition commissioner neelie kroes said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes says the damage caused by the cartel will last for many years " the national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong , but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway , " she said .
" the damage caused by this cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and elevators - for these companies the memory of this fine should last just as long , " she added . german firm gets stiffest fine german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the heaviest fine ever imposed by eu regulators on a single company in a cartel case because it was a repeated offender .
the german group was fined 480 million euros . otis , a unit of us conglomerate united technologies corporation , was given a fine of 225 million euros for its role , followed by schindler with a penalty of 144 million euros and kone with 142 million euros . eu antitrust investigators conducted so-called " dawn raids " on lift and escalator makers across europe in january 2004 after getting a tip off about the cartel .
after the raids , the companies handed over more evidence in the hope of winning leniency or reduced fines . the european commission said that high-ranking national-level management ran the cartel by holding secret meetings in bars and restaurants .
they also visited the countryside and traveled abroad and used pre-paid mobile phone cards to avoid regulators ' scrutiny . eu campaign against illegal cartels kroes , europe 's top antitrust regulator , is leading a campaign against illegal cartels and has been chalking up record fines against companies targeted by her crackdown . after bumper fines in 2006 , eu regulators in january ordered 10 companies to pay 750 million euros for fixing prices and carving up the market in electrical generation equipment .
after the lift makers case , that fine is now the third biggest ever against a cartel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the stiffest penalty until wednesday , the biggest fine in a european cartel case was 855 million euros in penalties imposed on eight vitamin makers in 2001 .
the vitamin makers ' fine was later reduced to 790 million euros by an eu court . despite the record fine on the lift makers , higher penalties are likely in future cases after the commission tightened its rules for calculating fines , making them heavier for repeat offenders and long-lasting cartels .
the reform could potentially cost guilty companies up to 10 times more than before . the commission was also given a boost in its anti-cartel campaign earlier this month with a ruling from the european court of justice that gave regulators more freedom to fix fines , especially how far back regulators can take previous offences into account . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission slaps huge fine on siemens for price fixing the eu has fined power equipment manufacturers for their roles in a price-fixing scheme .

but critics say germany is n't doing enough to promote linguistic diversity and multilingual education . the integration debate in germany has included a strong focus on immigrant children 's language skills .
both politicians and educators agree that it 's especially important to speak the language of the country you live in - and speak it well in order to get a good education and find a job . in germany , though , children from immigrant families often have problems at school .
their german just is n't good enough .
as a result , some german states are giving fewer lessons in these kids ' native tongues - a move not all teachers and linguists agree with . ruprecht baur , professor for german as a foreign language at duisburg-essen university , said several questions always come up in discussions on integration .
does the fact that a child comes from an immigrant family and speaks a different language prevent him or her from learning german and doing well at school ?
should the parents speak german at home , and avoid their native tongue ?
and is being exposed to two languages the reason some children here , notably with an italian or turkish background , fail in school ? according to baur , these questions arise despite multilingualism being the rule almost everywhere in the world . " international studies show that the mother tongue is no distraction , " baur said .
" the majority of people all over the world speak several languages .
they 're born with a mother language , and often know two more . " germany lacking interest in linguistic heritage the european union has repeatedly stressed the importance and its support of linguistic pluralism .
eu guidelines even commit member states to promote language classes in the children 's mother tongues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some turkish children perfect their mother tongue in germany that 's the case in germany as well - in theory .
in practice , north rhine-westphalia for example has cut back on native language teaching positions .
neighboring hesse has discontinued these classes altogether . the western german states reasoned that learning german at an early age was more important .
but vassilios fthenakis , professor for development psychology at italy 's bozen university , is critical of germany 's educational policies . " it 's an ongoing german problem : not taking a serious interest in the importance of a child 's mother language and culture , but pushing forward integration that is n't working , " fthenakis said .
" it 's a fundamental problem that germany does n't first strengthen a child 's mother language and culture , and then push learning german from that point on . " immigrant parents should n't speak german at home cultural and linguistic diversity is a richness that should be used for the individual and collective learning experience , the greek-born fthenakis said .
germany though did n't have policies like sweden , england or france do .
he said german guidelines could only be called disoriented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some grade schools offer language training for immigrant children according to fthenakis , the role that the family and their educational level play should not be underestimated .
young students will quickly learn german if they can speak and write in their mother language , fthenakis said . he said he is convinced that the language learning process should start before kids enter the school system .
in germany , that would be before the age of six .
every child is open to any language in the world before its first birthday - learning a second language is no problem at all , fthenakis said . critics of the multilingual approach said immigrant parents should speak german with their children at home .
but this was counterproductive , said duisburg-essen university 's baur . " if the parents do n't speak german well , they should n't speak it with their children , " baur said .
" at some point , the children 's german language abilities will be better than the parents ' , and then they 'll make fun of them and say , you ca n't even speak the language properly that you 're trying to speak with me .

it is seeking the ministers ' approval of the plan in order to get backing from eu leaders at a march 8-9 summit in brussels . details of how eu nations - especially eu newcomers from central and eastern europe - would share-out the emission reductions still had to be worked out , gabriel said . earlier , several eu states including finland , hungary and poland had argued against binding targets on reducing co2 emission levels after 2012 . however , calls for firmer action had come , among others , from slovenia , spain and britain which said all eu states must stand up and commit to serious climate action or lose their " leadership role " on the issue . germany , which currently holds the european union 's six-month rotating presidency as well heads the g8 , has made tackling climate change a key priority .

" he also urged the eu to forge a strategy to mobilise resources and engage other countries for the period after the 2012 expiry of the current kyoto protocol on climate change . climate change and the switch to a low-carbon economy are expected to be key issues to be discussed by eu leaders at their summit in brussels on march 8-9 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german plan to tax cars on emissions gets wary nod plans by the german government to tax cars based on emissions instead of engine size in a bid to encourage carmakers to design " greener " cars have met with a cautious welcome .

the most eye-opening statistic is the new shared interest german guys and british girls have in common : being fat . the union of german men and british women would probably not be the first european match-making success to spring to mind when asked to imagine the continent 's most compatible couples .
the religiously trimmed tracy may not be hairy horst 's cup of tea while klaus and his allotment obsession may also not be what binge-drinking brenda is looking for in her man .

however , the fat lads from the fatherland would have to move fast to secure a date as competition for the super-size lovers from the island would be fierce .
the new report shows that 66.8 percent of men in germany are overweight , with 18.8 percent of those hitting levels of obesity .
that 's almost twice as many as their prospective partners in the uk .
the eurostat figures show that 33.6 percent of english women are fat .
eu women keeping trim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in the eu are statistically slimmer than men from the data , it seems that european women on the whole look after themselves a lot better than the men .
" in all member states , the percentage of overweight men was higher than that of overweight women , " the report states .
the statistics office uses the " body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- " to determine what being fat means .
bmi is defined as the individual 's body weight divided by the square of their height .

de vries said that the abduction of terror suspects to third-party countries where torture is used in interrogation , the holding of so-called " enemy combatants " without trial at the prison camp in the us naval base in guantanamo , cuba and the widely-publicized abuse of prisoners at abu ghraib prison in iraq had all undermined the fight against islamist extremism .
image tarnished by scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gijs de vries hopes for a us return to human rights norms " the cia renditions , together with abu ghraib , guantanamo bay , and the military commissions act , unfortunately have tarnished the image of the united states in the fight against terrorism , among muslims and non-muslims , " de vries told reuters news service .
" i hope the united states , now that there is a new political dynamic in the us congress , can return to a mainstream interpretation of international human rights . "
the issue of rendition has added resonance in europe after the european parliament announced last week that a number of eu governments - including italy and germany - knew about the secret cia flights transporting suspects through europe but chose to look the other way .
de vries , the man charged with overseeing and coordinating the eu 's fight against terror , was himself strongly criticized by the european parliament for not providing answers on the allegations of complicity by eu governments in cia rendition .
national responsibility for secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu states are accused of turning a blind eye to cia flights however , de vries responded by saying that there had been no hard evidence to substantiate the accusations made against the eu countries by european lawmakers and that judgment should be reserved until the authorities in member states had carried out and completed their own investigations into the allegations of collusion .
he insisted that secret intelligence services remained under national control and that neither the eu as a whole nor he as anti-terrorism coordinator had much power to change that .
de vries told the european parliament that member states should exercise more parliamentary control on the activities of their secret services .
rebuild trust , work for peace de vries , who steps in march after three years in the job , said that a change in approach by the us and the eu to regain trust from the islamic world was essential in the battle of ideas with radical islamists . " ultimately that 's the long-term approach we need , " he said , adding that a concerted effort to bring peace to the middle east would also help .
until these objectives can be achieved , de fries said , the terrorism threat in the eu would remain at its current high level and would remain so for a number of years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does not rule out another attack on madrid 's scale " we can not exclude that attacks on the scale of london or madrid could be repeated .
meanwhile we see that other types of threats are also materializing , " he said , referring to a recent alleged plot to kidnap and behead a british muslim soldier in the uk .
de vries calls for eu streamlining he also called for a streamlining of decision-making on cooperation against terrorism and organized crime within the eu and for the introduction of majority votes instead of insisting on unanimity among all 27 countries .
" unanimous decisions simply take too long , " he said , blaming them for the eu 's failure to coordinate cross border operations between national police forces when tracking international criminals .
de fries became the european union 's first anti-terrorism coordinator just days after the bomb attacks in madrid in march 2004 , which killed 191 people . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia agents to stand trial for kidnapping in italy an italian judge ordered 26 americans , most of them thought to be cia agents , and the former head of italy 's military intelligence to stand trial over the 2003 kidnapping of an egyptian imam .

de vries said that the abduction of terror suspects to third-party countries where torture is used in interrogation , the holding of so-called " enemy combatants " without trial at the prison camp in the us naval base in guantanamo , cuba and the widely-publicized abuse of prisoners at abu ghraib prison in iraq had all undermined the fight against islamist extremism .
image tarnished by scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gijs de vries hopes for a us return to human rights norms " the cia renditions , together with abu ghraib , guantanamo bay , and the military commissions act , unfortunately have tarnished the image of the united states in the fight against terrorism , among muslims and non-muslims , " de vries told reuters news service .
" i hope the united states , now that there is a new political dynamic in the us congress , can return to a mainstream interpretation of international human rights . "
the issue of rendition has added resonance in europe after the european parliament announced last week that a number of eu governments - including italy and germany - knew about the secret cia flights transporting suspects through europe but chose to look the other way .
de vries , the man charged with overseeing and coordinating the eu 's fight against terror , was himself strongly criticized by the european parliament for not providing answers on the allegations of complicity by eu governments in cia rendition .
national responsibility for secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu states are accused of turning a blind eye to cia flights however , de vries responded by saying that there had been no hard evidence to substantiate the accusations made against the eu countries by european lawmakers and that judgment should be reserved until the authorities in member states had carried out and completed their own investigations into the allegations of collusion .
he insisted that secret intelligence services remained under national control and that neither the eu as a whole nor he as anti-terrorism coordinator had much power to change that .
de vries told the european parliament that member states should exercise more parliamentary control on the activities of their secret services .
rebuild trust , work for peace de vries , who steps in march after three years in the job , said that a change in approach by the us and the eu to regain trust from the islamic world was essential in the battle of ideas with radical islamists . " ultimately that 's the long-term approach we need , " he said , adding that a concerted effort to bring peace to the middle east would also help .
until these objectives can be achieved , de fries said , the terrorism threat in the eu would remain at its current high level and would remain so for a number of years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does not rule out another attack on madrid 's scale " we can not exclude that attacks on the scale of london or madrid could be repeated .
meanwhile we see that other types of threats are also materializing , " he said , referring to a recent alleged plot to kidnap and behead a british muslim soldier in the uk .
de vries calls for eu streamlining he also called for a streamlining of decision-making on cooperation against terrorism and organized crime within the eu and for the introduction of majority votes instead of insisting on unanimity among all 27 countries .
" unanimous decisions simply take too long , " he said , blaming them for the eu 's failure to coordinate cross border operations between national police forces when tracking international criminals .
de fries became the european union 's first anti-terrorism coordinator just days after the bomb attacks in madrid in march 2004 , which killed 191 people . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia agents to stand trial for kidnapping in italy an italian judge ordered 26 americans , most of them thought to be cia agents , and the former head of italy 's military intelligence to stand trial over the 2003 kidnapping of an egyptian imam .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de peacekeeping -pipe- 21.02.2007 britain , denmark to pull out troops from iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has over 7,000 soldiers in iraq britain , along with denmark , confirmed it would begin a major troop withdrawal from iraq in coming months and lithuania too has indicated it may follow suit .
washington however denies its coalition is crumbling . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday the british force in southern iraq would drop from 7,100 to 5,500 in coming months and could fall below 5,000 this year . blair , who has seen his popularity erode at home over his decision to go to war , said that soldiers however would remain into 2008 to provide support and training if iraq wanted . following britain 's lead , denmark and lithuania said they would withdraw most of their troops by august . denmark said its 430 ground troops would leave by august this year .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said the decision to withdraw troops was " taken together with our coalition allies , namely britain . " lithuanian defence minister juozas olekas told the baltic news service -lrb- bns -rrb- agency it was a " realistic possibility " that lithuania would not replace its 50 troops when their mission in iraq ends in august . the lithuanians are serving with a danish battalion near the southern city of basra , within the british-led multinational division .
like fellow baltic states latvia and estonia , lithuania joined nato in 2004 , and has been a staunch supporter of the united states in iraq . a string of other countries which sent troops either from the outset or later have already withdrawn from iraq , and others are planning to do so in the coming months . south korea and poland , with the largest contingents after the us and britain , have said they will leave by the end of the year . " next chapter can be written by iraqis " britain 's move was particularly important for washington as it is the second largest part of the us-led force in iraq after the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair said the peacekeeping reins had to be gradually handed over to the iraqis blair has faced huge domestic pressure over the unpopular war but he would not give a timetable for a complete british withdrawal . " the uk military presence will continue into 2008 for as long as we are wanted and have a job to do , " the prime minister told the british parliament on wednesday . british , danish and other multinational troops have been concentrated around the southern city of basra , which blair said remains " dangerous " but had improved enough for security to be handed over to iraqi forces . " what all this means is not that basra is how we want it to be , but it does mean that the next chapter in basra 's history can be written by iraqis , " blair said .
" increasingly our role will be supporting training and our numbers will be able to reduce accordingly , " he said . blair said british forces that remain would train iraqi troops , secure the iraq-iran border and supply routes and boost the ability of iraqi forces to conduct operations against extremist groups . blair 's unwavering support for president george w. bush over the us-led invasion in march 2003 has undermined his support at home .
britain put 40,000 troops into the invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six danish soldiers have been killed since 2003 in the violence in iraq in denmark , the government has been under increasing pressure to withdraw from iraq , and in january rasmussen voiced hopes that troop numbers could be reduced during 2007 .
six danish soldiers have been killed in iraq since 2003 . a poll published in early february showed that 64 percent of danes were " opposed " or " vehemently opposed " to the troop presence . meanwhile , bulgaria 's parliament voted on wednesday to extend the presence of the 155 bulgarian troops in iraq by a year . us denies coalition is crumbling britain 's announcement threw the spotlight on the us strategy in iraq , which has heightened bush 's unpopularity with the us public . us secretary of state condoleezza rice denied that the us-led coalition was crumbling . " the coalition remains intact and in fact the british still have thousands of soldiers deployed in iraq , in the south , " rice said in berlin .
she said the british pullout was part of the coalition strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said in berlin wednesday that the us-led coalition was not crumbling " it is the plan that as it is possible to transfer responsibilities to the iraqis , coalition forces would no longer be needed in those circumstances . " blair telephoned the us president on tuesday to warn him of the announcement , the white house said . " president bush sees this as a sign of success and what is possible for us once we help the iraqis deal with the sectarian violence in baghdad , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe . vice president dick cheney said the british drawdown was justified given the situation in basra , but stressed there could be no retreat from iraq . " i want you to know that the american people will not support a policy of retreat , " cheney said on the uss kitty hawk aircraft carrier while on a trip to japan .
" we want to complete the mission , we want to get it done right , and we want to return with honor , " he said . australian prime minister john howard , another strong backer of the us-led invasion , said he would not reduce australia 's 550 combat troops in iraq , part of a 1,400-strong force in the country . the united states has about 138,000 troops in iraq and has started sending another 21,500 to baghdad and surrounding provinces where the insurgency and sectarian violence has worsened in recent months . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost half of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .
dw 's peter philipp believes blair is playing a dangerous game .

it is seeking the ministers ' approval of the plan in order to get backing from eu leaders at a march 8-9 summit in brussels . details of how eu nations - especially eu newcomers from central and eastern europe - would share-out the emission reductions still had to be worked out , gabriel said . earlier , several eu states including finland , hungary and poland had argued against binding targets on reducing co2 emission levels after 2012 . however , calls for firmer action had come , among others , from slovenia , spain and britain which said all eu states must stand up and commit to serious climate action or lose their " leadership role " on the issue . germany , which currently holds the european union 's six-month rotating presidency as well heads the g8 , has made tackling climate change a key priority .
the counry 's car industry however is up in arms over various proposals to cut car emissions for fear that it would hurt business . green groups welcome agreement environmental groups , including the wwf , welcomed the eu agreement , saying they now wanted eu leaders who meet in brussels next month to endorse the 30 per cent target . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is expected to cause extreme weather conditions in europe stephan singer , head of wwf 's european climate and energy unit , said the eu must " immediately put in place concrete measures to achieve such targets . " he also urged the eu to forge a strategy to mobilise resources and engage other countries for the period after the 2012 expiry of the current kyoto protocol on climate change . climate change and the switch to a low-carbon economy are expected to be key issues to be discussed by eu leaders at their summit in brussels on march 8-9 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german plan to tax cars on emissions gets wary nod plans by the german government to tax cars based on emissions instead of engine size in a bid to encourage carmakers to design " greener " cars have met with a cautious welcome .

dw 's peter philipp believes blair is playing a dangerous game . despite not being able to influence events in iraq through his actions , british prime minister tony blair can at least use the situation there for his own domestic purposes .
news that blair intends to withdraw almost a quarter of the british occupation force in iraq - 1,600 of some 7,000 soldiers stationed there - can not be seen in any other light .
it is no coincidence that public opinion back in the uk is in favor of a withdrawal , while the fact that blair has already announced his resignation means he may not be around to face the consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair finds himself in a very difficult position .
up until now , the prime minister was the united states ' most dependable ally in iraq but now he appears to be jumping ship just at the moment when president george w. bush is looking to strengthen the troop deployment in the country .
blair could face the wrath of a president betrayed .
while there is certainly a difference between the operations of the us forces in their crackdown on insurgents and criminal gangs in baghdad and the british occupation of the relatively less volatile southern city of basra , a withdrawal of the british contingent at a time when more not fewer troops is the message from washington is certainly a risk .
one way in which blair could avoid the rapprochement of the americans while scoring a domestic success would be to declare " mission accomplished . "
however , washington will know better than most how successful the british contribution to security in iraq has been while the british public would be unlikely to suddenly view the iraq adventure in a better light just because the troops are now coming home .
at best , blair will be seen in the uk as trying to rectify what is seen as the biggest mistake of his premiership and as trying to shake off the shackles of us loyalty before he departs the political arena .
it is unlikely that much will be changed in iraq 's situation by the british departure .
the main fear is that the shiite majority in the south will rise up against the occupying forces and that the united states , with enough on their plate in baghdad and the rest of the country , will then be over-stretched .
this would surely end blair 's dream of being inducted in the us hall of fame for honorable allies .
however there is little to suggest that any such uprising would happen .
the iraqi shiites have absolutely no interest in openly engaging the occupation forces , especially when they hold a majority of power in the iraqi government already .
there is no need to fight for something that has already been handed to them by a democratic process .
the only conceivable danger would be a confrontation between the united states and iran .

but critics say germany is n't doing enough to promote linguistic diversity and multilingual education . the integration debate in germany has included a strong focus on immigrant children 's language skills .
both politicians and educators agree that it 's especially important to speak the language of the country you live in - and speak it well in order to get a good education and find a job . in germany , though , children from immigrant families often have problems at school .
their german just is n't good enough .
as a result , some german states are giving fewer lessons in these kids ' native tongues - a move not all teachers and linguists agree with . ruprecht baur , professor for german as a foreign language at duisburg-essen university , said several questions always come up in discussions on integration .
does the fact that a child comes from an immigrant family and speaks a different language prevent him or her from learning german and doing well at school ?
should the parents speak german at home , and avoid their native tongue ?
and is being exposed to two languages the reason some children here , notably with an italian or turkish background , fail in school ? according to baur , these questions arise despite multilingualism being the rule almost everywhere in the world . " international studies show that the mother tongue is no distraction , " baur said .
" the majority of people all over the world speak several languages .
they 're born with a mother language , and often know two more . " germany lacking interest in linguistic heritage the european union has repeatedly stressed the importance and its support of linguistic pluralism .
eu guidelines even commit member states to promote language classes in the children 's mother tongues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some turkish children perfect their mother tongue in germany that 's the case in germany as well - in theory .
in practice , north rhine-westphalia for example has cut back on native language teaching positions .

but critics say germany is n't doing enough to promote linguistic diversity and multilingual education . the integration debate in germany has included a strong focus on immigrant children 's language skills .
both politicians and educators agree that it 's especially important to speak the language of the country you live in - and speak it well in order to get a good education and find a job . in germany , though , children from immigrant families often have problems at school .
their german just is n't good enough .
as a result , some german states are giving fewer lessons in these kids ' native tongues - a move not all teachers and linguists agree with . ruprecht baur , professor for german as a foreign language at duisburg-essen university , said several questions always come up in discussions on integration .
does the fact that a child comes from an immigrant family and speaks a different language prevent him or her from learning german and doing well at school ?
should the parents speak german at home , and avoid their native tongue ?
and is being exposed to two languages the reason some children here , notably with an italian or turkish background , fail in school ? according to baur , these questions arise despite multilingualism being the rule almost everywhere in the world . " international studies show that the mother tongue is no distraction , " baur said .
" the majority of people all over the world speak several languages .
they 're born with a mother language , and often know two more . " germany lacking interest in linguistic heritage the european union has repeatedly stressed the importance and its support of linguistic pluralism .
eu guidelines even commit member states to promote language classes in the children 's mother tongues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some turkish children perfect their mother tongue in germany that 's the case in germany as well - in theory .
in practice , north rhine-westphalia for example has cut back on native language teaching positions .
neighboring hesse has discontinued these classes altogether . the western german states reasoned that learning german at an early age was more important .
but vassilios fthenakis , professor for development psychology at italy 's bozen university , is critical of germany 's educational policies . " it 's an ongoing german problem : not taking a serious interest in the importance of a child 's mother language and culture , but pushing forward integration that is n't working , " fthenakis said .
" it 's a fundamental problem that germany does n't first strengthen a child 's mother language and culture , and then push learning german from that point on . " immigrant parents should n't speak german at home cultural and linguistic diversity is a richness that should be used for the individual and collective learning experience , the greek-born fthenakis said .
germany though did n't have policies like sweden , england or france do .
he said german guidelines could only be called disoriented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some grade schools offer language training for immigrant children according to fthenakis , the role that the family and their educational level play should not be underestimated .
young students will quickly learn german if they can speak and write in their mother language , fthenakis said . he said he is convinced that the language learning process should start before kids enter the school system .
in germany , that would be before the age of six .
every child is open to any language in the world before its first birthday - learning a second language is no problem at all , fthenakis said . critics of the multilingual approach said immigrant parents should speak german with their children at home .
but this was counterproductive , said duisburg-essen university 's baur . " if the parents do n't speak german well , they should n't speak it with their children , " baur said .
" at some point , the children 's german language abilities will be better than the parents ' , and then they 'll make fun of them and say , you ca n't even speak the language properly that you 're trying to speak with me .

de vries said that the abduction of terror suspects to third-party countries where torture is used in interrogation , the holding of so-called " enemy combatants " without trial at the prison camp in the us naval base in guantanamo , cuba and the widely-publicized abuse of prisoners at abu ghraib prison in iraq had all undermined the fight against islamist extremism .
image tarnished by scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gijs de vries hopes for a us return to human rights norms " the cia renditions , together with abu ghraib , guantanamo bay , and the military commissions act , unfortunately have tarnished the image of the united states in the fight against terrorism , among muslims and non-muslims , " de vries told reuters news service .
" i hope the united states , now that there is a new political dynamic in the us congress , can return to a mainstream interpretation of international human rights . "
the issue of rendition has added resonance in europe after the european parliament announced last week that a number of eu governments - including italy and germany - knew about the secret cia flights transporting suspects through europe but chose to look the other way .
de vries , the man charged with overseeing and coordinating the eu 's fight against terror , was himself strongly criticized by the european parliament for not providing answers on the allegations of complicity by eu governments in cia rendition .
national responsibility for secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu states are accused of turning a blind eye to cia flights however , de vries responded by saying that there had been no hard evidence to substantiate the accusations made against the eu countries by european lawmakers and that judgment should be reserved until the authorities in member states had carried out and completed their own investigations into the allegations of collusion .
he insisted that secret intelligence services remained under national control and that neither the eu as a whole nor he as anti-terrorism coordinator had much power to change that .
de vries told the european parliament that member states should exercise more parliamentary control on the activities of their secret services .
rebuild trust , work for peace de vries , who steps in march after three years in the job , said that a change in approach by the us and the eu to regain trust from the islamic world was essential in the battle of ideas with radical islamists . " ultimately that 's the long-term approach we need , " he said , adding that a concerted effort to bring peace to the middle east would also help .
until these objectives can be achieved , de fries said , the terrorism threat in the eu would remain at its current high level and would remain so for a number of years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does not rule out another attack on madrid 's scale " we can not exclude that attacks on the scale of london or madrid could be repeated .
meanwhile we see that other types of threats are also materializing , " he said , referring to a recent alleged plot to kidnap and behead a british muslim soldier in the uk .
de vries calls for eu streamlining he also called for a streamlining of decision-making on cooperation against terrorism and organized crime within the eu and for the introduction of majority votes instead of insisting on unanimity among all 27 countries .
" unanimous decisions simply take too long , " he said , blaming them for the eu 's failure to coordinate cross border operations between national police forces when tracking international criminals .

de vries said that the abduction of terror suspects to third-party countries where torture is used in interrogation , the holding of so-called " enemy combatants " without trial at the prison camp in the us naval base in guantanamo , cuba and the widely-publicized abuse of prisoners at abu ghraib prison in iraq had all undermined the fight against islamist extremism .
image tarnished by scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gijs de vries hopes for a us return to human rights norms " the cia renditions , together with abu ghraib , guantanamo bay , and the military commissions act , unfortunately have tarnished the image of the united states in the fight against terrorism , among muslims and non-muslims , " de vries told reuters news service .
" i hope the united states , now that there is a new political dynamic in the us congress , can return to a mainstream interpretation of international human rights . "
the issue of rendition has added resonance in europe after the european parliament announced last week that a number of eu governments - including italy and germany - knew about the secret cia flights transporting suspects through europe but chose to look the other way .
de vries , the man charged with overseeing and coordinating the eu 's fight against terror , was himself strongly criticized by the european parliament for not providing answers on the allegations of complicity by eu governments in cia rendition .
national responsibility for secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu states are accused of turning a blind eye to cia flights however , de vries responded by saying that there had been no hard evidence to substantiate the accusations made against the eu countries by european lawmakers and that judgment should be reserved until the authorities in member states had carried out and completed their own investigations into the allegations of collusion .
he insisted that secret intelligence services remained under national control and that neither the eu as a whole nor he as anti-terrorism coordinator had much power to change that .
de vries told the european parliament that member states should exercise more parliamentary control on the activities of their secret services .
rebuild trust , work for peace de vries , who steps in march after three years in the job , said that a change in approach by the us and the eu to regain trust from the islamic world was essential in the battle of ideas with radical islamists . " ultimately that 's the long-term approach we need , " he said , adding that a concerted effort to bring peace to the middle east would also help .
until these objectives can be achieved , de fries said , the terrorism threat in the eu would remain at its current high level and would remain so for a number of years .

meanwhile we see that other types of threats are also materializing , " he said , referring to a recent alleged plot to kidnap and behead a british muslim soldier in the uk .
de vries calls for eu streamlining he also called for a streamlining of decision-making on cooperation against terrorism and organized crime within the eu and for the introduction of majority votes instead of insisting on unanimity among all 27 countries .
" unanimous decisions simply take too long , " he said , blaming them for the eu 's failure to coordinate cross border operations between national police forces when tracking international criminals .

editorialists warned that national interests were overriding economic priorities at the airplane maker . airbus parent eads must proceed with restructuring its subsidiary , the financial times commented .
" a house divided against itself can not stand , " the london-based business daily wrote in its wednesday edition .
" the past days have shown how the group 's dysfunctional structure hampers its effectiveness .
so long as the group is run in the interests of franco-german balance instead of purely commercially , then its performance will continue to suffer - to the detriment of shareholders and staff alike . " zurich 's tages-anzeiger remarked that the franco-german dispute about who will carry the brunt of airbus ' restructuring is hurting the company 's competitiveness .
" economic criteria are on the verge of going under on account of regional-political considerations , selfishness and petty jealousies , " the swiss paper noted .
" but time is too short for pointing the finger .
if airbus does n't want to lose more ground against its archrival boeing , a decision has to be taken soon . " the french daily le monde struck similar tones that the company should change its structure if it wants to succeed .
" the power 8 restructuring plan is very painful , with cutbacks of over 10,000 jobs , but it is essential , " the paris paper wrote .
" airbus is in danger of going under due to an anachronistic national battle .
if the company wants to continue playing in the same category as boeing , it must change its industrial model and give up the german-french double leadership , which shows today how much it disables things .
germany has a right to a normal share , but berlin has to realize that airbus above all has to be freed from nationalism . " the nordwest-zeitung in oldenburg observed that the one-time model group for pan-european cooperation eads with its subsidiary airbus had emerged as a battleground of national interests .
" practically every hour , authoritative sources and lesser sources are speaking out , " the german daily wrote .
" the seal of quality is still undamaged , just the masquerade of a german-french partnership which functions over all hierarchical steps has fallen .
the influence from paris has been too massive for years - and more recently also from berlin - to let the management act according to economic considerations alone . " the political components are much more dangerous to airbus than economic factors , remarked the fuldaer zeitung .
" the french appear to follow a tough position not least because of the upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections , clearly at the expense of german sites , " the paper commented .
" chancellor angela merkel is therefore well advised to give top priority to the cutbacks of 10,000 jobs in question and defend vested german interests against its neighboring country 's greediness .

nine eu countries currently have a registration fee or motor vehicle tax contingent on co2 emissions , according to the association of european car-makers . austria , the netherlands and portugal reward owners of environmentally friendly cars with sliding registration fees .
in denmark , sweden and great britain , the vehicle tax is determined by the level of co2 emissions . car-owners with low-emission vehicles are given break on both the one-time registration fee and the annual vehicle tax in belgium , france and cyprus . in great britain , owners of vehicles that emit less that 100 grams of co2 per kilometer pay no tax at all , whereas the annual rate for diesel vehicles emitting more than 225 grams per kilometer is a hefty 320 euros -lrb- $ 421 -rrb- .
france has a similar system for company cars . in sweden , drivers pay 1.62 euros for every gram of co2 over 100 grams per kilometer that their vehicle emits . reaping the benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the us be the next to reward drivers for choosing planet-friendly vehicles ?
" changing the tax in england has already had an effect on which new cars people buy , " said uwe kunert , transportation expert from the german institute for economic research .
sweden is experiencing the same effect . in the netherlands , tax revenues fell so dramatically that the government had to alter the tax reforms .
kunert is cautious not to count any chickens before they hatch , however . " it 's still difficult for most countries , " he said .
" there 's has n't been any overwhelming successes yet . " the price tag on the planet in germany , the success of reforms will depend on the affordability of environmentally friendly motors . low-emission models like volkswagen three-liter lupo disappeared from the market because they were too expensive - but also because not enough advertising was done .
instead , german carmakers tend to advertise the massive gas-guzzlers , many of which are produced domestically . as far as environmentally-friendly automobiles are concerned , the foreign competition is leagues ahead of the german carmakers .
according to the german association for environmental and natural protection -lrb- bund -rrb- , german auto producers will have to reduce co2 emissions by seven grams to fulfill the eu requirements by 2012 , french producers by only three grams . torsten schäfer -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu backs plans for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions eu environment ministers gave unanimous support to plans for cuts in greenhouse gases of as much as 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels .

languishing in fourth place in their respective national leagues , both bayern and real were looking to restore some pride in tuesday 's match at bernabeu .
and both teams got some of what they wanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern had trouble coping with real 's pace real showed they meant business from the opening whistle and had their home fans cheering in the 10th minute , when raul muscled his way past a furiously sliding bayern keeper oliver kahn in the box .
the veteran striker slotted home to put the hosts up 1-0 . munich had trouble putting together combinations , but thanks to a set piece they got the equalizer thirteen minutes later .
bayern oldie-but-goodie willy sagnol blasted a free kick from around 40 meters out , and defender lucio headed beyond reach real keeper iker casillas . last hurrahs before hollywood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham is a no-go in munich after getting injured the rest of the first half was all madrid .
surprisingly the main motor of their impressive run was much-maligned midfielder david beckham , who is headed for los angeles in the summer and who had recently been left out of the squad . beckham was clearly out to prove he 's not washed up .
in the 28th minute , he fired a corner across the mouth of the goal .
defender ivan helguera headed the ball into the upper right corner , brushing raul 's hair in the process .
real were back in the lead . six minutes later , beckham pushed the ball forward , where it eventually found a criminally unmarked ruud van nistelrooy .
the dutchman fired home from five meters to give madrid a 3-1 advantage . real 's first half showed a return to the fluid attacking style that gained them the champions league title in 2002 .
meanwhile bayern were plagued by the midfield sluggishness and defensive lapses that have characterized their mediocre season . a familiar face comes up big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thanks to kahn , bayern avoided disaster the match could have turned into a debacle for munich in the second half , were it not for a sterling play by their 37-year-old keeper .
beckham curled a lethal-looking free kick toward the upper-left-hand corner of goal , but kahn acrobatically parried it to keep the visitors in the game . after that , real curiously chose to pack it in at the back - never a madrid strong point even in the club 's best years . for half an hour , it looked as though real might be able to hold their two-goal advantage .
bayern 's lack of true playmaker was all too apparent as they seldom created open shots on goal . but in 79th minute , substitute bayern striker claudio pizarro was narrowly denied by casillas from 10 meters .
two minutes from time , midfielder mark van bommel drop-kicked a short real clearance into the back of the net for the final 3-2 scoreline . glass half-full or half-empty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel flexed his muscles late in the match the result was a bit of balsam for the wounded pride of these two former titans .
speaking after the match , kahn said " this is one of those losses that feels like a victory . " indeed , both sides played to a higher standard than their critics thought them capable of , treating fans to one of the better matches of this champions league season . but the game also showed that bayern - despite van bommel 's late goal - still need a creative director in midfield .
and real 's late weakness suggested that the squad is perhaps too old to pile on pressure over 90 minutes .
plus , beckham is out with injury for the return match . that sets the stage for a tough battle when the two teams play their return leg in munich on march 7 .
a 1-0 win for bayern would be enough to send them through to the tournament 's next round and force real to question why they failed to seal this encounter when they had the chance . whichever team comes up short in munich will be in for some harsh scrutiny from media and fans .
real and bayern are accustomed to silverware .

and both teams got some of what they wanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern had trouble coping with real 's pace real showed they meant business from the opening whistle and had their home fans cheering in the 10th minute , when raul muscled his way past a furiously sliding bayern keeper oliver kahn in the box .
the veteran striker slotted home to put the hosts up 1-0 . munich had trouble putting together combinations , but thanks to a set piece they got the equalizer thirteen minutes later .
bayern oldie-but-goodie willy sagnol blasted a free kick from around 40 meters out , and defender lucio headed beyond reach real keeper iker casillas . last hurrahs before hollywood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham is a no-go in munich after getting injured the rest of the first half was all madrid .
surprisingly the main motor of their impressive run was much-maligned midfielder david beckham , who is headed for los angeles in the summer and who had recently been left out of the squad . beckham was clearly out to prove he 's not washed up .
in the 28th minute , he fired a corner across the mouth of the goal .
defender ivan helguera headed the ball into the upper right corner , brushing raul 's hair in the process .
real were back in the lead . six minutes later , beckham pushed the ball forward , where it eventually found a criminally unmarked ruud van nistelrooy .
the dutchman fired home from five meters to give madrid a 3-1 advantage . real 's first half showed a return to the fluid attacking style that gained them the champions league title in 2002 .
meanwhile bayern were plagued by the midfield sluggishness and defensive lapses that have characterized their mediocre season . a familiar face comes up big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thanks to kahn , bayern avoided disaster the match could have turned into a debacle for munich in the second half , were it not for a sterling play by their 37-year-old keeper .
beckham curled a lethal-looking free kick toward the upper-left-hand corner of goal , but kahn acrobatically parried it to keep the visitors in the game . after that , real curiously chose to pack it in at the back - never a madrid strong point even in the club 's best years . for half an hour , it looked as though real might be able to hold their two-goal advantage .
bayern 's lack of true playmaker was all too apparent as they seldom created open shots on goal . but in 79th minute , substitute bayern striker claudio pizarro was narrowly denied by casillas from 10 meters .
two minutes from time , midfielder mark van bommel drop-kicked a short real clearance into the back of the net for the final 3-2 scoreline . glass half-full or half-empty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel flexed his muscles late in the match the result was a bit of balsam for the wounded pride of these two former titans .
speaking after the match , kahn said " this is one of those losses that feels like a victory . " indeed , both sides played to a higher standard than their critics thought them capable of , treating fans to one of the better matches of this champions league season . but the game also showed that bayern - despite van bommel 's late goal - still need a creative director in midfield .
and real 's late weakness suggested that the squad is perhaps too old to pile on pressure over 90 minutes .
plus , beckham is out with injury for the return match . that sets the stage for a tough battle when the two teams play their return leg in munich on march 7 .
a 1-0 win for bayern would be enough to send them through to the tournament 's next round and force real to question why they failed to seal this encounter when they had the chance . whichever team comes up short in munich will be in for some harsh scrutiny from media and fans .

dw 's peter philipp believes blair is playing a dangerous game . despite not being able to influence events in iraq through his actions , british prime minister tony blair can at least use the situation there for his own domestic purposes .
news that blair intends to withdraw almost a quarter of the british occupation force in iraq - 1,600 of some 7,000 soldiers stationed there - can not be seen in any other light .
it is no coincidence that public opinion back in the uk is in favor of a withdrawal , while the fact that blair has already announced his resignation means he may not be around to face the consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair finds himself in a very difficult position .
up until now , the prime minister was the united states ' most dependable ally in iraq but now he appears to be jumping ship just at the moment when president george w. bush is looking to strengthen the troop deployment in the country .
blair could face the wrath of a president betrayed .
while there is certainly a difference between the operations of the us forces in their crackdown on insurgents and criminal gangs in baghdad and the british occupation of the relatively less volatile southern city of basra , a withdrawal of the british contingent at a time when more not fewer troops is the message from washington is certainly a risk .
one way in which blair could avoid the rapprochement of the americans while scoring a domestic success would be to declare " mission accomplished . "
however , washington will know better than most how successful the british contribution to security in iraq has been while the british public would be unlikely to suddenly view the iraq adventure in a better light just because the troops are now coming home .
at best , blair will be seen in the uk as trying to rectify what is seen as the biggest mistake of his premiership and as trying to shake off the shackles of us loyalty before he departs the political arena .
it is unlikely that much will be changed in iraq 's situation by the british departure .
the main fear is that the shiite majority in the south will rise up against the occupying forces and that the united states , with enough on their plate in baghdad and the rest of the country , will then be over-stretched .
this would surely end blair 's dream of being inducted in the us hall of fame for honorable allies .
however there is little to suggest that any such uprising would happen .
the iraqi shiites have absolutely no interest in openly engaging the occupation forces , especially when they hold a majority of power in the iraqi government already .
there is no need to fight for something that has already been handed to them by a democratic process .
the only conceivable danger would be a confrontation between the united states and iran .

nine eu countries currently have a registration fee or motor vehicle tax contingent on co2 emissions , according to the association of european car-makers . austria , the netherlands and portugal reward owners of environmentally friendly cars with sliding registration fees .
in denmark , sweden and great britain , the vehicle tax is determined by the level of co2 emissions . car-owners with low-emission vehicles are given break on both the one-time registration fee and the annual vehicle tax in belgium , france and cyprus . in great britain , owners of vehicles that emit less that 100 grams of co2 per kilometer pay no tax at all , whereas the annual rate for diesel vehicles emitting more than 225 grams per kilometer is a hefty 320 euros -lrb- $ 421 -rrb- .
france has a similar system for company cars . in sweden , drivers pay 1.62 euros for every gram of co2 over 100 grams per kilometer that their vehicle emits . reaping the benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the us be the next to reward drivers for choosing planet-friendly vehicles ?
" changing the tax in england has already had an effect on which new cars people buy , " said uwe kunert , transportation expert from the german institute for economic research .
sweden is experiencing the same effect . in the netherlands , tax revenues fell so dramatically that the government had to alter the tax reforms .
kunert is cautious not to count any chickens before they hatch , however . " it 's still difficult for most countries , " he said .
" there 's has n't been any overwhelming successes yet . " the price tag on the planet in germany , the success of reforms will depend on the affordability of environmentally friendly motors . low-emission models like volkswagen three-liter lupo disappeared from the market because they were too expensive - but also because not enough advertising was done .
instead , german carmakers tend to advertise the massive gas-guzzlers , many of which are produced domestically . as far as environmentally-friendly automobiles are concerned , the foreign competition is leagues ahead of the german carmakers .
according to the german association for environmental and natural protection -lrb- bund -rrb- , german auto producers will have to reduce co2 emissions by seven grams to fulfill the eu requirements by 2012 , french producers by only three grams . torsten schäfer -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu backs plans for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions eu environment ministers gave unanimous support to plans for cuts in greenhouse gases of as much as 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels .

in the first leg real won 3-2 at home , but bayern hope things will be different in munich . the first leg two weeks ago was a bit like a battle between bruce springsteen and prince : the bavarians who used to be boss against the artists formerly known as the galacticos .
languishing in fourth place in their respective national leagues , both bayern and real were looking to restore some pride in tuesday 's match at bernabeu .
and both teams got some of what they wanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern had trouble coping with real 's pace real showed they meant business from the opening whistle and had their home fans cheering in the 10th minute , when raul muscled his way past a furiously sliding bayern keeper oliver kahn in the box .

surprisingly the main motor of their impressive run was much-maligned midfielder david beckham , who is headed for los angeles in the summer and who had recently been left out of the squad . beckham was clearly out to prove he 's not washed up .
in the 28th minute , he fired a corner across the mouth of the goal .
defender ivan helguera headed the ball into the upper right corner , brushing raul 's hair in the process .
real were back in the lead . six minutes later , beckham pushed the ball forward , where it eventually found a criminally unmarked ruud van nistelrooy .
the dutchman fired home from five meters to give madrid a 3-1 advantage . real 's first half showed a return to the fluid attacking style that gained them the champions league title in 2002 .

beckham curled a lethal-looking free kick toward the upper-left-hand corner of goal , but kahn acrobatically parried it to keep the visitors in the game . after that , real curiously chose to pack it in at the back - never a madrid strong point even in the club 's best years . for half an hour , it looked as though real might be able to hold their two-goal advantage .
bayern 's lack of true playmaker was all too apparent as they seldom created open shots on goal . but in 79th minute , substitute bayern striker claudio pizarro was narrowly denied by casillas from 10 meters .

speaking after the match , kahn said " this is one of those losses that feels like a victory . " indeed , both sides played to a higher standard than their critics thought them capable of , treating fans to one of the better matches of this champions league season . but the game also showed that bayern - despite van bommel 's late goal - still need a creative director in midfield .
and real 's late weakness suggested that the squad is perhaps too old to pile on pressure over 90 minutes .
plus , beckham is out with injury for the return match . that sets the stage for a tough battle when the two teams play their return leg in munich on march 7 .
a 1-0 win for bayern would be enough to send them through to the tournament 's next round and force real to question why they failed to seal this encounter when they had the chance . whichever team comes up short in munich will be in for some harsh scrutiny from media and fans .

in the first leg real won 3-2 at home , but bayern hope things will be different in munich . the first leg two weeks ago was a bit like a battle between bruce springsteen and prince : the bavarians who used to be boss against the artists formerly known as the galacticos .
languishing in fourth place in their respective national leagues , both bayern and real were looking to restore some pride in tuesday 's match at bernabeu .
and both teams got some of what they wanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern had trouble coping with real 's pace real showed they meant business from the opening whistle and had their home fans cheering in the 10th minute , when raul muscled his way past a furiously sliding bayern keeper oliver kahn in the box .
the veteran striker slotted home to put the hosts up 1-0 . munich had trouble putting together combinations , but thanks to a set piece they got the equalizer thirteen minutes later .
bayern oldie-but-goodie willy sagnol blasted a free kick from around 40 meters out , and defender lucio headed beyond reach real keeper iker casillas . last hurrahs before hollywood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham is a no-go in munich after getting injured the rest of the first half was all madrid .
surprisingly the main motor of their impressive run was much-maligned midfielder david beckham , who is headed for los angeles in the summer and who had recently been left out of the squad . beckham was clearly out to prove he 's not washed up .
in the 28th minute , he fired a corner across the mouth of the goal .
defender ivan helguera headed the ball into the upper right corner , brushing raul 's hair in the process .
real were back in the lead . six minutes later , beckham pushed the ball forward , where it eventually found a criminally unmarked ruud van nistelrooy .
the dutchman fired home from five meters to give madrid a 3-1 advantage . real 's first half showed a return to the fluid attacking style that gained them the champions league title in 2002 .
meanwhile bayern were plagued by the midfield sluggishness and defensive lapses that have characterized their mediocre season . a familiar face comes up big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thanks to kahn , bayern avoided disaster the match could have turned into a debacle for munich in the second half , were it not for a sterling play by their 37-year-old keeper .
beckham curled a lethal-looking free kick toward the upper-left-hand corner of goal , but kahn acrobatically parried it to keep the visitors in the game . after that , real curiously chose to pack it in at the back - never a madrid strong point even in the club 's best years . for half an hour , it looked as though real might be able to hold their two-goal advantage .
bayern 's lack of true playmaker was all too apparent as they seldom created open shots on goal . but in 79th minute , substitute bayern striker claudio pizarro was narrowly denied by casillas from 10 meters .
two minutes from time , midfielder mark van bommel drop-kicked a short real clearance into the back of the net for the final 3-2 scoreline . glass half-full or half-empty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel flexed his muscles late in the match the result was a bit of balsam for the wounded pride of these two former titans .
speaking after the match , kahn said " this is one of those losses that feels like a victory . " indeed , both sides played to a higher standard than their critics thought them capable of , treating fans to one of the better matches of this champions league season . but the game also showed that bayern - despite van bommel 's late goal - still need a creative director in midfield .
and real 's late weakness suggested that the squad is perhaps too old to pile on pressure over 90 minutes .
plus , beckham is out with injury for the return match . that sets the stage for a tough battle when the two teams play their return leg in munich on march 7 .
a 1-0 win for bayern would be enough to send them through to the tournament 's next round and force real to question why they failed to seal this encounter when they had the chance . whichever team comes up short in munich will be in for some harsh scrutiny from media and fans .

washington however denies its coalition is crumbling . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday the british force in southern iraq would drop from 7,100 to 5,500 in coming months and could fall below 5,000 this year . blair , who has seen his popularity erode at home over his decision to go to war , said that soldiers however would remain into 2008 to provide support and training if iraq wanted . following britain 's lead , denmark and lithuania said they would withdraw most of their troops by august . denmark said its 430 ground troops would leave by august this year .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said the decision to withdraw troops was " taken together with our coalition allies , namely britain . " lithuanian defence minister juozas olekas told the baltic news service -lrb- bns -rrb- agency it was a " realistic possibility " that lithuania would not replace its 50 troops when their mission in iraq ends in august . the lithuanians are serving with a danish battalion near the southern city of basra , within the british-led multinational division .
like fellow baltic states latvia and estonia , lithuania joined nato in 2004 , and has been a staunch supporter of the united states in iraq . a string of other countries which sent troops either from the outset or later have already withdrawn from iraq , and others are planning to do so in the coming months . south korea and poland , with the largest contingents after the us and britain , have said they will leave by the end of the year . " next chapter can be written by iraqis " britain 's move was particularly important for washington as it is the second largest part of the us-led force in iraq after the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair said the peacekeeping reins had to be gradually handed over to the iraqis blair has faced huge domestic pressure over the unpopular war but he would not give a timetable for a complete british withdrawal . " the uk military presence will continue into 2008 for as long as we are wanted and have a job to do , " the prime minister told the british parliament on wednesday . british , danish and other multinational troops have been concentrated around the southern city of basra , which blair said remains " dangerous " but had improved enough for security to be handed over to iraqi forces . " what all this means is not that basra is how we want it to be , but it does mean that the next chapter in basra 's history can be written by iraqis , " blair said .
" increasingly our role will be supporting training and our numbers will be able to reduce accordingly , " he said . blair said british forces that remain would train iraqi troops , secure the iraq-iran border and supply routes and boost the ability of iraqi forces to conduct operations against extremist groups . blair 's unwavering support for president george w. bush over the us-led invasion in march 2003 has undermined his support at home .
britain put 40,000 troops into the invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six danish soldiers have been killed since 2003 in the violence in iraq in denmark , the government has been under increasing pressure to withdraw from iraq , and in january rasmussen voiced hopes that troop numbers could be reduced during 2007 .
six danish soldiers have been killed in iraq since 2003 . a poll published in early february showed that 64 percent of danes were " opposed " or " vehemently opposed " to the troop presence . meanwhile , bulgaria 's parliament voted on wednesday to extend the presence of the 155 bulgarian troops in iraq by a year . us denies coalition is crumbling britain 's announcement threw the spotlight on the us strategy in iraq , which has heightened bush 's unpopularity with the us public . us secretary of state condoleezza rice denied that the us-led coalition was crumbling . " the coalition remains intact and in fact the british still have thousands of soldiers deployed in iraq , in the south , " rice said in berlin .
she said the british pullout was part of the coalition strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said in berlin wednesday that the us-led coalition was not crumbling " it is the plan that as it is possible to transfer responsibilities to the iraqis , coalition forces would no longer be needed in those circumstances . " blair telephoned the us president on tuesday to warn him of the announcement , the white house said . " president bush sees this as a sign of success and what is possible for us once we help the iraqis deal with the sectarian violence in baghdad , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe . vice president dick cheney said the british drawdown was justified given the situation in basra , but stressed there could be no retreat from iraq . " i want you to know that the american people will not support a policy of retreat , " cheney said on the uss kitty hawk aircraft carrier while on a trip to japan .
" we want to complete the mission , we want to get it done right , and we want to return with honor , " he said . australian prime minister john howard , another strong backer of the us-led invasion , said he would not reduce australia 's 550 combat troops in iraq , part of a 1,400-strong force in the country . the united states has about 138,000 troops in iraq and has started sending another 21,500 to baghdad and surrounding provinces where the insurgency and sectarian violence has worsened in recent months . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost half of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .

washington however denies its coalition is crumbling . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday the british force in southern iraq would drop from 7,100 to 5,500 in coming months and could fall below 5,000 this year . blair , who has seen his popularity erode at home over his decision to go to war , said that soldiers however would remain into 2008 to provide support and training if iraq wanted . following britain 's lead , denmark and lithuania said they would withdraw most of their troops by august . denmark said its 430 ground troops would leave by august this year .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said the decision to withdraw troops was " taken together with our coalition allies , namely britain . " lithuanian defence minister juozas olekas told the baltic news service -lrb- bns -rrb- agency it was a " realistic possibility " that lithuania would not replace its 50 troops when their mission in iraq ends in august . the lithuanians are serving with a danish battalion near the southern city of basra , within the british-led multinational division .
like fellow baltic states latvia and estonia , lithuania joined nato in 2004 , and has been a staunch supporter of the united states in iraq . a string of other countries which sent troops either from the outset or later have already withdrawn from iraq , and others are planning to do so in the coming months . south korea and poland , with the largest contingents after the us and britain , have said they will leave by the end of the year . " next chapter can be written by iraqis " britain 's move was particularly important for washington as it is the second largest part of the us-led force in iraq after the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair said the peacekeeping reins had to be gradually handed over to the iraqis blair has faced huge domestic pressure over the unpopular war but he would not give a timetable for a complete british withdrawal . " the uk military presence will continue into 2008 for as long as we are wanted and have a job to do , " the prime minister told the british parliament on wednesday . british , danish and other multinational troops have been concentrated around the southern city of basra , which blair said remains " dangerous " but had improved enough for security to be handed over to iraqi forces . " what all this means is not that basra is how we want it to be , but it does mean that the next chapter in basra 's history can be written by iraqis , " blair said .
" increasingly our role will be supporting training and our numbers will be able to reduce accordingly , " he said . blair said british forces that remain would train iraqi troops , secure the iraq-iran border and supply routes and boost the ability of iraqi forces to conduct operations against extremist groups . blair 's unwavering support for president george w. bush over the us-led invasion in march 2003 has undermined his support at home .
britain put 40,000 troops into the invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six danish soldiers have been killed since 2003 in the violence in iraq in denmark , the government has been under increasing pressure to withdraw from iraq , and in january rasmussen voiced hopes that troop numbers could be reduced during 2007 .
six danish soldiers have been killed in iraq since 2003 . a poll published in early february showed that 64 percent of danes were " opposed " or " vehemently opposed " to the troop presence . meanwhile , bulgaria 's parliament voted on wednesday to extend the presence of the 155 bulgarian troops in iraq by a year . us denies coalition is crumbling britain 's announcement threw the spotlight on the us strategy in iraq , which has heightened bush 's unpopularity with the us public . us secretary of state condoleezza rice denied that the us-led coalition was crumbling . " the coalition remains intact and in fact the british still have thousands of soldiers deployed in iraq , in the south , " rice said in berlin .
she said the british pullout was part of the coalition strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said in berlin wednesday that the us-led coalition was not crumbling " it is the plan that as it is possible to transfer responsibilities to the iraqis , coalition forces would no longer be needed in those circumstances . " blair telephoned the us president on tuesday to warn him of the announcement , the white house said . " president bush sees this as a sign of success and what is possible for us once we help the iraqis deal with the sectarian violence in baghdad , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe . vice president dick cheney said the british drawdown was justified given the situation in basra , but stressed there could be no retreat from iraq . " i want you to know that the american people will not support a policy of retreat , " cheney said on the uss kitty hawk aircraft carrier while on a trip to japan .
" we want to complete the mission , we want to get it done right , and we want to return with honor , " he said . australian prime minister john howard , another strong backer of the us-led invasion , said he would not reduce australia 's 550 combat troops in iraq , part of a 1,400-strong force in the country . the united states has about 138,000 troops in iraq and has started sending another 21,500 to baghdad and surrounding provinces where the insurgency and sectarian violence has worsened in recent months . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost half of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .

" those are not principles put there to be an obstacle , they are put there because they 're foundational for peace , " she said . " it 's very difficult to imagine a circumstance where you have peace talks but one party does n't recognize the existence of the other , " rice said . hamas , which the us , european union and israel consider a terrorist organization , has not yet clearly agreed to the west 's conditions of recognizing israel , renouncing violence and honoring past agreements with the jewish state . rice also emphasized the importance of continuing to support abbas in his power struggle with iranian-backed hamas . inconclusive summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ehud olmert -lrb- r -rrb- , rice and palestinian president mahmoud abbas -lrb- l -rrb- at talsk in jerusalem on monday rice held an inconclusive summit monday in jerusalem with abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert . steinmeier , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called the meeting " a first step " but noted that hopes for peace were complicated by the fraught negotiations on the formation of a palestinian government . " that is why we need to be particularly realistic going into these talks , " he said , referring to the quartet gathering .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 21.02.2007 eu slaps record near billion-euro fine on lift cartel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's back to the ground floor for the companies involved in the lift cartel eu competition regulators imposed their biggest fine ever on wednesday , hitting lift makers otis , schindler , thyssenkrupp and kone with a penalty of nearly a billion euros for running an illegal cartel . the european commission accused the companies of operating a cartel for the installation and maintenance of lifts and escalators in belgium , germany , luxembourg and the netherlands between at least 1995 and 2004 . the european union 's antitrust watchdog said it was fining them a combined 992 million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- for rigging bids for procurement contracts , fixing prices , sharing out projects , carving up markets and exchanging sensitive information . the total fine also included a 1.8-million-euro penalty against japanese company mitsubishi for a role in the cartel limited to the netherlands . " it is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings , including hospitals , have been artificially bloated by these cartels , " competition commissioner neelie kroes said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes says the damage caused by the cartel will last for many years " the national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong , but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway , " she said .
" the damage caused by this cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and elevators - for these companies the memory of this fine should last just as long , " she added . german firm gets stiffest fine german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the heaviest fine ever imposed by eu regulators on a single company in a cartel case because it was a repeated offender .
the german group was fined 480 million euros . otis , a unit of us conglomerate united technologies corporation , was given a fine of 225 million euros for its role , followed by schindler with a penalty of 144 million euros and kone with 142 million euros . eu antitrust investigators conducted so-called " dawn raids " on lift and escalator makers across europe in january 2004 after getting a tip off about the cartel .
after the raids , the companies handed over more evidence in the hope of winning leniency or reduced fines . the european commission said that high-ranking national-level management ran the cartel by holding secret meetings in bars and restaurants .
they also visited the countryside and traveled abroad and used pre-paid mobile phone cards to avoid regulators ' scrutiny . eu campaign against illegal cartels kroes , europe 's top antitrust regulator , is leading a campaign against illegal cartels and has been chalking up record fines against companies targeted by her crackdown . after bumper fines in 2006 , eu regulators in january ordered 10 companies to pay 750 million euros for fixing prices and carving up the market in electrical generation equipment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 21.02.2007 opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost a quarter of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .
dw 's peter philipp believes blair is playing a dangerous game . despite not being able to influence events in iraq through his actions , british prime minister tony blair can at least use the situation there for his own domestic purposes .
news that blair intends to withdraw almost a quarter of the british occupation force in iraq - 1,600 of some 7,000 soldiers stationed there - can not be seen in any other light .
it is no coincidence that public opinion back in the uk is in favor of a withdrawal , while the fact that blair has already announced his resignation means he may not be around to face the consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair finds himself in a very difficult position .
up until now , the prime minister was the united states ' most dependable ally in iraq but now he appears to be jumping ship just at the moment when president george w. bush is looking to strengthen the troop deployment in the country .
blair could face the wrath of a president betrayed .
while there is certainly a difference between the operations of the us forces in their crackdown on insurgents and criminal gangs in baghdad and the british occupation of the relatively less volatile southern city of basra , a withdrawal of the british contingent at a time when more not fewer troops is the message from washington is certainly a risk .
one way in which blair could avoid the rapprochement of the americans while scoring a domestic success would be to declare " mission accomplished . "
however , washington will know better than most how successful the british contribution to security in iraq has been while the british public would be unlikely to suddenly view the iraq adventure in a better light just because the troops are now coming home .
at best , blair will be seen in the uk as trying to rectify what is seen as the biggest mistake of his premiership and as trying to shake off the shackles of us loyalty before he departs the political arena .
it is unlikely that much will be changed in iraq 's situation by the british departure .
the main fear is that the shiite majority in the south will rise up against the occupying forces and that the united states , with enough on their plate in baghdad and the rest of the country , will then be over-stretched .
this would surely end blair 's dream of being inducted in the us hall of fame for honorable allies .
however there is little to suggest that any such uprising would happen .
the iraqi shiites have absolutely no interest in openly engaging the occupation forces , especially when they hold a majority of power in the iraqi government already .
there is no need to fight for something that has already been handed to them by a democratic process .

dw 's peter philipp believes blair is playing a dangerous game . despite not being able to influence events in iraq through his actions , british prime minister tony blair can at least use the situation there for his own domestic purposes .
news that blair intends to withdraw almost a quarter of the british occupation force in iraq - 1,600 of some 7,000 soldiers stationed there - can not be seen in any other light .
it is no coincidence that public opinion back in the uk is in favor of a withdrawal , while the fact that blair has already announced his resignation means he may not be around to face the consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair finds himself in a very difficult position .
up until now , the prime minister was the united states ' most dependable ally in iraq but now he appears to be jumping ship just at the moment when president george w. bush is looking to strengthen the troop deployment in the country .
blair could face the wrath of a president betrayed .
while there is certainly a difference between the operations of the us forces in their crackdown on insurgents and criminal gangs in baghdad and the british occupation of the relatively less volatile southern city of basra , a withdrawal of the british contingent at a time when more not fewer troops is the message from washington is certainly a risk .
one way in which blair could avoid the rapprochement of the americans while scoring a domestic success would be to declare " mission accomplished . "
however , washington will know better than most how successful the british contribution to security in iraq has been while the british public would be unlikely to suddenly view the iraq adventure in a better light just because the troops are now coming home .
at best , blair will be seen in the uk as trying to rectify what is seen as the biggest mistake of his premiership and as trying to shake off the shackles of us loyalty before he departs the political arena .
it is unlikely that much will be changed in iraq 's situation by the british departure .
the main fear is that the shiite majority in the south will rise up against the occupying forces and that the united states , with enough on their plate in baghdad and the rest of the country , will then be over-stretched .
this would surely end blair 's dream of being inducted in the us hall of fame for honorable allies .
however there is little to suggest that any such uprising would happen .
the iraqi shiites have absolutely no interest in openly engaging the occupation forces , especially when they hold a majority of power in the iraqi government already .
there is no need to fight for something that has already been handed to them by a democratic process .

but critics say germany is n't doing enough to promote linguistic diversity and multilingual education . the integration debate in germany has included a strong focus on immigrant children 's language skills .
both politicians and educators agree that it 's especially important to speak the language of the country you live in - and speak it well in order to get a good education and find a job . in germany , though , children from immigrant families often have problems at school .
their german just is n't good enough .
as a result , some german states are giving fewer lessons in these kids ' native tongues - a move not all teachers and linguists agree with . ruprecht baur , professor for german as a foreign language at duisburg-essen university , said several questions always come up in discussions on integration .
does the fact that a child comes from an immigrant family and speaks a different language prevent him or her from learning german and doing well at school ?
should the parents speak german at home , and avoid their native tongue ?
and is being exposed to two languages the reason some children here , notably with an italian or turkish background , fail in school ? according to baur , these questions arise despite multilingualism being the rule almost everywhere in the world . " international studies show that the mother tongue is no distraction , " baur said .
" the majority of people all over the world speak several languages .
they 're born with a mother language , and often know two more . " germany lacking interest in linguistic heritage the european union has repeatedly stressed the importance and its support of linguistic pluralism .
eu guidelines even commit member states to promote language classes in the children 's mother tongues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some turkish children perfect their mother tongue in germany that 's the case in germany as well - in theory .
in practice , north rhine-westphalia for example has cut back on native language teaching positions .
neighboring hesse has discontinued these classes altogether . the western german states reasoned that learning german at an early age was more important .
but vassilios fthenakis , professor for development psychology at italy 's bozen university , is critical of germany 's educational policies . " it 's an ongoing german problem : not taking a serious interest in the importance of a child 's mother language and culture , but pushing forward integration that is n't working , " fthenakis said .
" it 's a fundamental problem that germany does n't first strengthen a child 's mother language and culture , and then push learning german from that point on . " immigrant parents should n't speak german at home cultural and linguistic diversity is a richness that should be used for the individual and collective learning experience , the greek-born fthenakis said .
germany though did n't have policies like sweden , england or france do .
he said german guidelines could only be called disoriented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some grade schools offer language training for immigrant children according to fthenakis , the role that the family and their educational level play should not be underestimated .
young students will quickly learn german if they can speak and write in their mother language , fthenakis said . he said he is convinced that the language learning process should start before kids enter the school system .
in germany , that would be before the age of six .

but critics say germany is n't doing enough to promote linguistic diversity and multilingual education . the integration debate in germany has included a strong focus on immigrant children 's language skills .
both politicians and educators agree that it 's especially important to speak the language of the country you live in - and speak it well in order to get a good education and find a job . in germany , though , children from immigrant families often have problems at school .
their german just is n't good enough .
as a result , some german states are giving fewer lessons in these kids ' native tongues - a move not all teachers and linguists agree with . ruprecht baur , professor for german as a foreign language at duisburg-essen university , said several questions always come up in discussions on integration .
does the fact that a child comes from an immigrant family and speaks a different language prevent him or her from learning german and doing well at school ?
should the parents speak german at home , and avoid their native tongue ?
and is being exposed to two languages the reason some children here , notably with an italian or turkish background , fail in school ? according to baur , these questions arise despite multilingualism being the rule almost everywhere in the world . " international studies show that the mother tongue is no distraction , " baur said .
" the majority of people all over the world speak several languages .
they 're born with a mother language , and often know two more . " germany lacking interest in linguistic heritage the european union has repeatedly stressed the importance and its support of linguistic pluralism .
eu guidelines even commit member states to promote language classes in the children 's mother tongues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some turkish children perfect their mother tongue in germany that 's the case in germany as well - in theory .
in practice , north rhine-westphalia for example has cut back on native language teaching positions .
neighboring hesse has discontinued these classes altogether . the western german states reasoned that learning german at an early age was more important .
but vassilios fthenakis , professor for development psychology at italy 's bozen university , is critical of germany 's educational policies . " it 's an ongoing german problem : not taking a serious interest in the importance of a child 's mother language and culture , but pushing forward integration that is n't working , " fthenakis said .
" it 's a fundamental problem that germany does n't first strengthen a child 's mother language and culture , and then push learning german from that point on . " immigrant parents should n't speak german at home cultural and linguistic diversity is a richness that should be used for the individual and collective learning experience , the greek-born fthenakis said .
germany though did n't have policies like sweden , england or france do .
he said german guidelines could only be called disoriented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some grade schools offer language training for immigrant children according to fthenakis , the role that the family and their educational level play should not be underestimated .
young students will quickly learn german if they can speak and write in their mother language , fthenakis said . he said he is convinced that the language learning process should start before kids enter the school system .

de vries said that the abduction of terror suspects to third-party countries where torture is used in interrogation , the holding of so-called " enemy combatants " without trial at the prison camp in the us naval base in guantanamo , cuba and the widely-publicized abuse of prisoners at abu ghraib prison in iraq had all undermined the fight against islamist extremism .
image tarnished by scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gijs de vries hopes for a us return to human rights norms " the cia renditions , together with abu ghraib , guantanamo bay , and the military commissions act , unfortunately have tarnished the image of the united states in the fight against terrorism , among muslims and non-muslims , " de vries told reuters news service .
" i hope the united states , now that there is a new political dynamic in the us congress , can return to a mainstream interpretation of international human rights . "
the issue of rendition has added resonance in europe after the european parliament announced last week that a number of eu governments - including italy and germany - knew about the secret cia flights transporting suspects through europe but chose to look the other way .
de vries , the man charged with overseeing and coordinating the eu 's fight against terror , was himself strongly criticized by the european parliament for not providing answers on the allegations of complicity by eu governments in cia rendition .
national responsibility for secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu states are accused of turning a blind eye to cia flights however , de vries responded by saying that there had been no hard evidence to substantiate the accusations made against the eu countries by european lawmakers and that judgment should be reserved until the authorities in member states had carried out and completed their own investigations into the allegations of collusion .
he insisted that secret intelligence services remained under national control and that neither the eu as a whole nor he as anti-terrorism coordinator had much power to change that .
de vries told the european parliament that member states should exercise more parliamentary control on the activities of their secret services .
rebuild trust , work for peace de vries , who steps in march after three years in the job , said that a change in approach by the us and the eu to regain trust from the islamic world was essential in the battle of ideas with radical islamists . " ultimately that 's the long-term approach we need , " he said , adding that a concerted effort to bring peace to the middle east would also help .
until these objectives can be achieved , de fries said , the terrorism threat in the eu would remain at its current high level and would remain so for a number of years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does not rule out another attack on madrid 's scale " we can not exclude that attacks on the scale of london or madrid could be repeated .
meanwhile we see that other types of threats are also materializing , " he said , referring to a recent alleged plot to kidnap and behead a british muslim soldier in the uk .
de vries calls for eu streamlining he also called for a streamlining of decision-making on cooperation against terrorism and organized crime within the eu and for the introduction of majority votes instead of insisting on unanimity among all 27 countries .
" unanimous decisions simply take too long , " he said , blaming them for the eu 's failure to coordinate cross border operations between national police forces when tracking international criminals .

de vries calls for eu streamlining he also called for a streamlining of decision-making on cooperation against terrorism and organized crime within the eu and for the introduction of majority votes instead of insisting on unanimity among all 27 countries .
" unanimous decisions simply take too long , " he said , blaming them for the eu 's failure to coordinate cross border operations between national police forces when tracking international criminals .

editorialists warned that national interests were overriding economic priorities at the airplane maker . airbus parent eads must proceed with restructuring its subsidiary , the financial times commented .
" a house divided against itself can not stand , " the london-based business daily wrote in its wednesday edition .
" the past days have shown how the group 's dysfunctional structure hampers its effectiveness .
so long as the group is run in the interests of franco-german balance instead of purely commercially , then its performance will continue to suffer - to the detriment of shareholders and staff alike . " zurich 's tages-anzeiger remarked that the franco-german dispute about who will carry the brunt of airbus ' restructuring is hurting the company 's competitiveness .
" economic criteria are on the verge of going under on account of regional-political considerations , selfishness and petty jealousies , " the swiss paper noted .
" but time is too short for pointing the finger .
if airbus does n't want to lose more ground against its archrival boeing , a decision has to be taken soon . " the french daily le monde struck similar tones that the company should change its structure if it wants to succeed .
" the power 8 restructuring plan is very painful , with cutbacks of over 10,000 jobs , but it is essential , " the paris paper wrote .
" airbus is in danger of going under due to an anachronistic national battle .
if the company wants to continue playing in the same category as boeing , it must change its industrial model and give up the german-french double leadership , which shows today how much it disables things .
germany has a right to a normal share , but berlin has to realize that airbus above all has to be freed from nationalism . " the nordwest-zeitung in oldenburg observed that the one-time model group for pan-european cooperation eads with its subsidiary airbus had emerged as a battleground of national interests .
" practically every hour , authoritative sources and lesser sources are speaking out , " the german daily wrote .
" the seal of quality is still undamaged , just the masquerade of a german-french partnership which functions over all hierarchical steps has fallen .
the influence from paris has been too massive for years - and more recently also from berlin - to let the management act according to economic considerations alone . " the political components are much more dangerous to airbus than economic factors , remarked the fuldaer zeitung .
" the french appear to follow a tough position not least because of the upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections , clearly at the expense of german sites , " the paper commented .
" chancellor angela merkel is therefore well advised to give top priority to the cutbacks of 10,000 jobs in question and defend vested german interests against its neighboring country 's greediness .
on top of everything , the fact that france wants to pull a fast one on germany does n't exactly strengthen the political side 's negotiating power vis-à-vis private investors .

nine eu countries currently have a registration fee or motor vehicle tax contingent on co2 emissions , according to the association of european car-makers . austria , the netherlands and portugal reward owners of environmentally friendly cars with sliding registration fees .
in denmark , sweden and great britain , the vehicle tax is determined by the level of co2 emissions . car-owners with low-emission vehicles are given break on both the one-time registration fee and the annual vehicle tax in belgium , france and cyprus . in great britain , owners of vehicles that emit less that 100 grams of co2 per kilometer pay no tax at all , whereas the annual rate for diesel vehicles emitting more than 225 grams per kilometer is a hefty 320 euros -lrb- $ 421 -rrb- .
france has a similar system for company cars . in sweden , drivers pay 1.62 euros for every gram of co2 over 100 grams per kilometer that their vehicle emits . reaping the benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the us be the next to reward drivers for choosing planet-friendly vehicles ?
" changing the tax in england has already had an effect on which new cars people buy , " said uwe kunert , transportation expert from the german institute for economic research .
sweden is experiencing the same effect . in the netherlands , tax revenues fell so dramatically that the government had to alter the tax reforms .
kunert is cautious not to count any chickens before they hatch , however . " it 's still difficult for most countries , " he said .
" there 's has n't been any overwhelming successes yet . " the price tag on the planet in germany , the success of reforms will depend on the affordability of environmentally friendly motors . low-emission models like volkswagen three-liter lupo disappeared from the market because they were too expensive - but also because not enough advertising was done .
instead , german carmakers tend to advertise the massive gas-guzzlers , many of which are produced domestically . as far as environmentally-friendly automobiles are concerned , the foreign competition is leagues ahead of the german carmakers .
according to the german association for environmental and natural protection -lrb- bund -rrb- , german auto producers will have to reduce co2 emissions by seven grams to fulfill the eu requirements by 2012 , french producers by only three grams . torsten schäfer -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu backs plans for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions eu environment ministers gave unanimous support to plans for cuts in greenhouse gases of as much as 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels .

editorialists warned that national interests were overriding economic priorities at the airplane maker . airbus parent eads must proceed with restructuring its subsidiary , the financial times commented .
" a house divided against itself can not stand , " the london-based business daily wrote in its wednesday edition .
" the past days have shown how the group 's dysfunctional structure hampers its effectiveness .
so long as the group is run in the interests of franco-german balance instead of purely commercially , then its performance will continue to suffer - to the detriment of shareholders and staff alike . " zurich 's tages-anzeiger remarked that the franco-german dispute about who will carry the brunt of airbus ' restructuring is hurting the company 's competitiveness .
" economic criteria are on the verge of going under on account of regional-political considerations , selfishness and petty jealousies , " the swiss paper noted .
" but time is too short for pointing the finger .
if airbus does n't want to lose more ground against its archrival boeing , a decision has to be taken soon . " the french daily le monde struck similar tones that the company should change its structure if it wants to succeed .
" the power 8 restructuring plan is very painful , with cutbacks of over 10,000 jobs , but it is essential , " the paris paper wrote .
" airbus is in danger of going under due to an anachronistic national battle .
if the company wants to continue playing in the same category as boeing , it must change its industrial model and give up the german-french double leadership , which shows today how much it disables things .
germany has a right to a normal share , but berlin has to realize that airbus above all has to be freed from nationalism . " the nordwest-zeitung in oldenburg observed that the one-time model group for pan-european cooperation eads with its subsidiary airbus had emerged as a battleground of national interests .
" practically every hour , authoritative sources and lesser sources are speaking out , " the german daily wrote .
" the seal of quality is still undamaged , just the masquerade of a german-french partnership which functions over all hierarchical steps has fallen .
the influence from paris has been too massive for years - and more recently also from berlin - to let the management act according to economic considerations alone . " the political components are much more dangerous to airbus than economic factors , remarked the fuldaer zeitung .
" the french appear to follow a tough position not least because of the upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections , clearly at the expense of german sites , " the paper commented .
" chancellor angela merkel is therefore well advised to give top priority to the cutbacks of 10,000 jobs in question and defend vested german interests against its neighboring country 's greediness .

" a house divided against itself can not stand , " the london-based business daily wrote in its wednesday edition .
" the past days have shown how the group 's dysfunctional structure hampers its effectiveness .
so long as the group is run in the interests of franco-german balance instead of purely commercially , then its performance will continue to suffer - to the detriment of shareholders and staff alike . " zurich 's tages-anzeiger remarked that the franco-german dispute about who will carry the brunt of airbus ' restructuring is hurting the company 's competitiveness .
" economic criteria are on the verge of going under on account of regional-political considerations , selfishness and petty jealousies , " the swiss paper noted .
" but time is too short for pointing the finger .
if airbus does n't want to lose more ground against its archrival boeing , a decision has to be taken soon . " the french daily le monde struck similar tones that the company should change its structure if it wants to succeed .
" the power 8 restructuring plan is very painful , with cutbacks of over 10,000 jobs , but it is essential , " the paris paper wrote .
" airbus is in danger of going under due to an anachronistic national battle .
if the company wants to continue playing in the same category as boeing , it must change its industrial model and give up the german-french double leadership , which shows today how much it disables things .
germany has a right to a normal share , but berlin has to realize that airbus above all has to be freed from nationalism . " the nordwest-zeitung in oldenburg observed that the one-time model group for pan-european cooperation eads with its subsidiary airbus had emerged as a battleground of national interests .
" practically every hour , authoritative sources and lesser sources are speaking out , " the german daily wrote .
" the seal of quality is still undamaged , just the masquerade of a german-french partnership which functions over all hierarchical steps has fallen .
the influence from paris has been too massive for years - and more recently also from berlin - to let the management act according to economic considerations alone . " the political components are much more dangerous to airbus than economic factors , remarked the fuldaer zeitung .
" the french appear to follow a tough position not least because of the upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections , clearly at the expense of german sites , " the paper commented .
" chancellor angela merkel is therefore well advised to give top priority to the cutbacks of 10,000 jobs in question and defend vested german interests against its neighboring country 's greediness .

de vries said that the abduction of terror suspects to third-party countries where torture is used in interrogation , the holding of so-called " enemy combatants " without trial at the prison camp in the us naval base in guantanamo , cuba and the widely-publicized abuse of prisoners at abu ghraib prison in iraq had all undermined the fight against islamist extremism .
image tarnished by scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gijs de vries hopes for a us return to human rights norms " the cia renditions , together with abu ghraib , guantanamo bay , and the military commissions act , unfortunately have tarnished the image of the united states in the fight against terrorism , among muslims and non-muslims , " de vries told reuters news service .
" i hope the united states , now that there is a new political dynamic in the us congress , can return to a mainstream interpretation of international human rights . "
the issue of rendition has added resonance in europe after the european parliament announced last week that a number of eu governments - including italy and germany - knew about the secret cia flights transporting suspects through europe but chose to look the other way .
de vries , the man charged with overseeing and coordinating the eu 's fight against terror , was himself strongly criticized by the european parliament for not providing answers on the allegations of complicity by eu governments in cia rendition .
national responsibility for secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu states are accused of turning a blind eye to cia flights however , de vries responded by saying that there had been no hard evidence to substantiate the accusations made against the eu countries by european lawmakers and that judgment should be reserved until the authorities in member states had carried out and completed their own investigations into the allegations of collusion .
he insisted that secret intelligence services remained under national control and that neither the eu as a whole nor he as anti-terrorism coordinator had much power to change that .
de vries told the european parliament that member states should exercise more parliamentary control on the activities of their secret services .
rebuild trust , work for peace de vries , who steps in march after three years in the job , said that a change in approach by the us and the eu to regain trust from the islamic world was essential in the battle of ideas with radical islamists . " ultimately that 's the long-term approach we need , " he said , adding that a concerted effort to bring peace to the middle east would also help .
until these objectives can be achieved , de fries said , the terrorism threat in the eu would remain at its current high level and would remain so for a number of years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does not rule out another attack on madrid 's scale " we can not exclude that attacks on the scale of london or madrid could be repeated .
meanwhile we see that other types of threats are also materializing , " he said , referring to a recent alleged plot to kidnap and behead a british muslim soldier in the uk .
de vries calls for eu streamlining he also called for a streamlining of decision-making on cooperation against terrorism and organized crime within the eu and for the introduction of majority votes instead of insisting on unanimity among all 27 countries .
" unanimous decisions simply take too long , " he said , blaming them for the eu 's failure to coordinate cross border operations between national police forces when tracking international criminals .

de vries said that the abduction of terror suspects to third-party countries where torture is used in interrogation , the holding of so-called " enemy combatants " without trial at the prison camp in the us naval base in guantanamo , cuba and the widely-publicized abuse of prisoners at abu ghraib prison in iraq had all undermined the fight against islamist extremism .
image tarnished by scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gijs de vries hopes for a us return to human rights norms " the cia renditions , together with abu ghraib , guantanamo bay , and the military commissions act , unfortunately have tarnished the image of the united states in the fight against terrorism , among muslims and non-muslims , " de vries told reuters news service .
" i hope the united states , now that there is a new political dynamic in the us congress , can return to a mainstream interpretation of international human rights . "
the issue of rendition has added resonance in europe after the european parliament announced last week that a number of eu governments - including italy and germany - knew about the secret cia flights transporting suspects through europe but chose to look the other way .
de vries , the man charged with overseeing and coordinating the eu 's fight against terror , was himself strongly criticized by the european parliament for not providing answers on the allegations of complicity by eu governments in cia rendition .
national responsibility for secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu states are accused of turning a blind eye to cia flights however , de vries responded by saying that there had been no hard evidence to substantiate the accusations made against the eu countries by european lawmakers and that judgment should be reserved until the authorities in member states had carried out and completed their own investigations into the allegations of collusion .
he insisted that secret intelligence services remained under national control and that neither the eu as a whole nor he as anti-terrorism coordinator had much power to change that .
de vries told the european parliament that member states should exercise more parliamentary control on the activities of their secret services .
rebuild trust , work for peace de vries , who steps in march after three years in the job , said that a change in approach by the us and the eu to regain trust from the islamic world was essential in the battle of ideas with radical islamists . " ultimately that 's the long-term approach we need , " he said , adding that a concerted effort to bring peace to the middle east would also help .
until these objectives can be achieved , de fries said , the terrorism threat in the eu would remain at its current high level and would remain so for a number of years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does not rule out another attack on madrid 's scale " we can not exclude that attacks on the scale of london or madrid could be repeated .
meanwhile we see that other types of threats are also materializing , " he said , referring to a recent alleged plot to kidnap and behead a british muslim soldier in the uk .
de vries calls for eu streamlining he also called for a streamlining of decision-making on cooperation against terrorism and organized crime within the eu and for the introduction of majority votes instead of insisting on unanimity among all 27 countries .
" unanimous decisions simply take too long , " he said , blaming them for the eu 's failure to coordinate cross border operations between national police forces when tracking international criminals .

de vries said that the abduction of terror suspects to third-party countries where torture is used in interrogation , the holding of so-called " enemy combatants " without trial at the prison camp in the us naval base in guantanamo , cuba and the widely-publicized abuse of prisoners at abu ghraib prison in iraq had all undermined the fight against islamist extremism .
image tarnished by scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gijs de vries hopes for a us return to human rights norms " the cia renditions , together with abu ghraib , guantanamo bay , and the military commissions act , unfortunately have tarnished the image of the united states in the fight against terrorism , among muslims and non-muslims , " de vries told reuters news service .
" i hope the united states , now that there is a new political dynamic in the us congress , can return to a mainstream interpretation of international human rights . "
the issue of rendition has added resonance in europe after the european parliament announced last week that a number of eu governments - including italy and germany - knew about the secret cia flights transporting suspects through europe but chose to look the other way .
de vries , the man charged with overseeing and coordinating the eu 's fight against terror , was himself strongly criticized by the european parliament for not providing answers on the allegations of complicity by eu governments in cia rendition .
national responsibility for secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu states are accused of turning a blind eye to cia flights however , de vries responded by saying that there had been no hard evidence to substantiate the accusations made against the eu countries by european lawmakers and that judgment should be reserved until the authorities in member states had carried out and completed their own investigations into the allegations of collusion .
he insisted that secret intelligence services remained under national control and that neither the eu as a whole nor he as anti-terrorism coordinator had much power to change that .
de vries told the european parliament that member states should exercise more parliamentary control on the activities of their secret services .
rebuild trust , work for peace de vries , who steps in march after three years in the job , said that a change in approach by the us and the eu to regain trust from the islamic world was essential in the battle of ideas with radical islamists . " ultimately that 's the long-term approach we need , " he said , adding that a concerted effort to bring peace to the middle east would also help .
until these objectives can be achieved , de fries said , the terrorism threat in the eu would remain at its current high level and would remain so for a number of years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does not rule out another attack on madrid 's scale " we can not exclude that attacks on the scale of london or madrid could be repeated .
meanwhile we see that other types of threats are also materializing , " he said , referring to a recent alleged plot to kidnap and behead a british muslim soldier in the uk .
de vries calls for eu streamlining he also called for a streamlining of decision-making on cooperation against terrorism and organized crime within the eu and for the introduction of majority votes instead of insisting on unanimity among all 27 countries .
" unanimous decisions simply take too long , " he said , blaming them for the eu 's failure to coordinate cross border operations between national police forces when tracking international criminals .
de fries became the european union 's first anti-terrorism coordinator just days after the bomb attacks in madrid in march 2004 , which killed 191 people . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia agents to stand trial for kidnapping in italy an italian judge ordered 26 americans , most of them thought to be cia agents , and the former head of italy 's military intelligence to stand trial over the 2003 kidnapping of an egyptian imam .

but critics say germany is n't doing enough to promote linguistic diversity and multilingual education . the integration debate in germany has included a strong focus on immigrant children 's language skills .
both politicians and educators agree that it 's especially important to speak the language of the country you live in - and speak it well in order to get a good education and find a job . in germany , though , children from immigrant families often have problems at school .
their german just is n't good enough .
as a result , some german states are giving fewer lessons in these kids ' native tongues - a move not all teachers and linguists agree with . ruprecht baur , professor for german as a foreign language at duisburg-essen university , said several questions always come up in discussions on integration .
does the fact that a child comes from an immigrant family and speaks a different language prevent him or her from learning german and doing well at school ?
should the parents speak german at home , and avoid their native tongue ?
and is being exposed to two languages the reason some children here , notably with an italian or turkish background , fail in school ? according to baur , these questions arise despite multilingualism being the rule almost everywhere in the world . " international studies show that the mother tongue is no distraction , " baur said .
" the majority of people all over the world speak several languages .
they 're born with a mother language , and often know two more . " germany lacking interest in linguistic heritage the european union has repeatedly stressed the importance and its support of linguistic pluralism .

in practice , north rhine-westphalia for example has cut back on native language teaching positions .
neighboring hesse has discontinued these classes altogether . the western german states reasoned that learning german at an early age was more important .
but vassilios fthenakis , professor for development psychology at italy 's bozen university , is critical of germany 's educational policies . " it 's an ongoing german problem : not taking a serious interest in the importance of a child 's mother language and culture , but pushing forward integration that is n't working , " fthenakis said .
" it 's a fundamental problem that germany does n't first strengthen a child 's mother language and culture , and then push learning german from that point on . " immigrant parents should n't speak german at home cultural and linguistic diversity is a richness that should be used for the individual and collective learning experience , the greek-born fthenakis said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 21.02.2007 opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost a quarter of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .
dw 's peter philipp believes blair is playing a dangerous game . despite not being able to influence events in iraq through his actions , british prime minister tony blair can at least use the situation there for his own domestic purposes .
news that blair intends to withdraw almost a quarter of the british occupation force in iraq - 1,600 of some 7,000 soldiers stationed there - can not be seen in any other light .
it is no coincidence that public opinion back in the uk is in favor of a withdrawal , while the fact that blair has already announced his resignation means he may not be around to face the consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair finds himself in a very difficult position .
up until now , the prime minister was the united states ' most dependable ally in iraq but now he appears to be jumping ship just at the moment when president george w. bush is looking to strengthen the troop deployment in the country .
blair could face the wrath of a president betrayed .
while there is certainly a difference between the operations of the us forces in their crackdown on insurgents and criminal gangs in baghdad and the british occupation of the relatively less volatile southern city of basra , a withdrawal of the british contingent at a time when more not fewer troops is the message from washington is certainly a risk .
one way in which blair could avoid the rapprochement of the americans while scoring a domestic success would be to declare " mission accomplished . "
however , washington will know better than most how successful the british contribution to security in iraq has been while the british public would be unlikely to suddenly view the iraq adventure in a better light just because the troops are now coming home .
at best , blair will be seen in the uk as trying to rectify what is seen as the biggest mistake of his premiership and as trying to shake off the shackles of us loyalty before he departs the political arena .
it is unlikely that much will be changed in iraq 's situation by the british departure .
the main fear is that the shiite majority in the south will rise up against the occupying forces and that the united states , with enough on their plate in baghdad and the rest of the country , will then be over-stretched .
this would surely end blair 's dream of being inducted in the us hall of fame for honorable allies .
however there is little to suggest that any such uprising would happen .
the iraqi shiites have absolutely no interest in openly engaging the occupation forces , especially when they hold a majority of power in the iraqi government already .
there is no need to fight for something that has already been handed to them by a democratic process .
the only conceivable danger would be a confrontation between the united states and iran .
tehran could activate allies in iraq to make life very complicated for the americans and where better to ferment unrest than in southern iraq , an area of the country which would have been weakened by a partial british withdrawal ? peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and a middle east expert -lrb- nda -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe says saddam 's execution solves no problems for iraq as european nations criticized the execution of saddam hussein out of opposition to the death penalty , sunday newspapers across the continent were pessimistic as to whether the hanging would solve any of iraq 's problems .

dw 's peter philipp believes blair is playing a dangerous game . despite not being able to influence events in iraq through his actions , british prime minister tony blair can at least use the situation there for his own domestic purposes .
news that blair intends to withdraw almost a quarter of the british occupation force in iraq - 1,600 of some 7,000 soldiers stationed there - can not be seen in any other light .
it is no coincidence that public opinion back in the uk is in favor of a withdrawal , while the fact that blair has already announced his resignation means he may not be around to face the consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair finds himself in a very difficult position .
up until now , the prime minister was the united states ' most dependable ally in iraq but now he appears to be jumping ship just at the moment when president george w. bush is looking to strengthen the troop deployment in the country .
blair could face the wrath of a president betrayed .
while there is certainly a difference between the operations of the us forces in their crackdown on insurgents and criminal gangs in baghdad and the british occupation of the relatively less volatile southern city of basra , a withdrawal of the british contingent at a time when more not fewer troops is the message from washington is certainly a risk .
one way in which blair could avoid the rapprochement of the americans while scoring a domestic success would be to declare " mission accomplished . "
however , washington will know better than most how successful the british contribution to security in iraq has been while the british public would be unlikely to suddenly view the iraq adventure in a better light just because the troops are now coming home .
at best , blair will be seen in the uk as trying to rectify what is seen as the biggest mistake of his premiership and as trying to shake off the shackles of us loyalty before he departs the political arena .
it is unlikely that much will be changed in iraq 's situation by the british departure .
the main fear is that the shiite majority in the south will rise up against the occupying forces and that the united states , with enough on their plate in baghdad and the rest of the country , will then be over-stretched .
this would surely end blair 's dream of being inducted in the us hall of fame for honorable allies .
however there is little to suggest that any such uprising would happen .
the iraqi shiites have absolutely no interest in openly engaging the occupation forces , especially when they hold a majority of power in the iraqi government already .
there is no need to fight for something that has already been handed to them by a democratic process .
the only conceivable danger would be a confrontation between the united states and iran .

" it is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings , including hospitals , have been artificially bloated by these cartels , " competition commissioner neelie kroes said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes says the damage caused by the cartel will last for many years " the national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong , but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway , " she said .
" the damage caused by this cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and elevators - for these companies the memory of this fine should last just as long , " she added . german firm gets stiffest fine german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the heaviest fine ever imposed by eu regulators on a single company in a cartel case because it was a repeated offender .
the german group was fined 480 million euros . otis , a unit of us conglomerate united technologies corporation , was given a fine of 225 million euros for its role , followed by schindler with a penalty of 144 million euros and kone with 142 million euros . eu antitrust investigators conducted so-called " dawn raids " on lift and escalator makers across europe in january 2004 after getting a tip off about the cartel .
after the raids , the companies handed over more evidence in the hope of winning leniency or reduced fines . the european commission said that high-ranking national-level management ran the cartel by holding secret meetings in bars and restaurants .
they also visited the countryside and traveled abroad and used pre-paid mobile phone cards to avoid regulators ' scrutiny . eu campaign against illegal cartels kroes , europe 's top antitrust regulator , is leading a campaign against illegal cartels and has been chalking up record fines against companies targeted by her crackdown . after bumper fines in 2006 , eu regulators in january ordered 10 companies to pay 750 million euros for fixing prices and carving up the market in electrical generation equipment .
after the lift makers case , that fine is now the third biggest ever against a cartel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the stiffest penalty until wednesday , the biggest fine in a european cartel case was 855 million euros in penalties imposed on eight vitamin makers in 2001 .
the vitamin makers ' fine was later reduced to 790 million euros by an eu court . despite the record fine on the lift makers , higher penalties are likely in future cases after the commission tightened its rules for calculating fines , making them heavier for repeat offenders and long-lasting cartels .
the reform could potentially cost guilty companies up to 10 times more than before . the commission was also given a boost in its anti-cartel campaign earlier this month with a ruling from the european court of justice that gave regulators more freedom to fix fines , especially how far back regulators can take previous offences into account . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission slaps huge fine on siemens for price fixing the eu has fined power equipment manufacturers for their roles in a price-fixing scheme .

" those are not principles put there to be an obstacle , they are put there because they 're foundational for peace , " she said . " it 's very difficult to imagine a circumstance where you have peace talks but one party does n't recognize the existence of the other , " rice said . hamas , which the us , european union and israel consider a terrorist organization , has not yet clearly agreed to the west 's conditions of recognizing israel , renouncing violence and honoring past agreements with the jewish state . rice also emphasized the importance of continuing to support abbas in his power struggle with iranian-backed hamas . inconclusive summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ehud olmert -lrb- r -rrb- , rice and palestinian president mahmoud abbas -lrb- l -rrb- at talsk in jerusalem on monday rice held an inconclusive summit monday in jerusalem with abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert . steinmeier , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called the meeting " a first step " but noted that hopes for peace were complicated by the fraught negotiations on the formation of a palestinian government . " that is why we need to be particularly realistic going into these talks , " he said , referring to the quartet gathering . " we are nevertheless determined to seize this opportunity , " he said . russia and the un said they would use the berlin meeting to push for the unity government to be recognized .
moscow said it would call for the removal of aid and diplomatic boycotts imposed on the palestinian government after it fell under hamas ' control following january 2006 elections . growing unease the embargo imposed by the quartet after the 2006 elections has caused widespread economic hardship in the palestinian areas and there is growing unease in europe over the measures . the spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , cristina gallach , said that palestinian unity was a crucial step forward but indicated it was too early to consider lifting the embargo . " obviously one can not put everything on the table because they are still in negotiations - we have not yet seen the composition of the government , " she said . un chief ban ki-moon said in berlin ahead of the quartet talks that he was " encouraged " by the power-sharing deal between fatah and hamas . bildunterschrift : quartet members at a washington meeting defending the unity government abbas , long portrayed by washington as the best " partner for peace " with israel , has embarked on a diplomatic offensive of his own .
he is touring europe to defend the unity government deal . he insists the agreement reached between his fatah party and hamas should satisfy the quartet principles since it obliges the new unity government to respect international resolutions and agreements signed by the fatah-led palestine liberation organisation - meaning deals with the jewish state . palestinians urged the quartet powers to give their incoming government a chance . " we hope the quartet will take a positive approach towards the government and not resort to pressure and boycott , " said ghazi hamad , spokesman for the hamas-led government . israel has ruled out dealing with any government that includes hamas . it reiterated its hope that the quartet will stick to the conditions imposed on the palestinian government for the aid boycott to be lifted . " it is important and critical that the international community continues to respect these conditions , which are not negotiable , " israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said in a radio interview . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel in the ascendency as blair 's star fades tony blair has pursued many issues in search of a lasting positive legacy ; mideast peace , strong eu-us ties and climate change .

washington however denies its coalition is crumbling . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday the british force in southern iraq would drop from 7,100 to 5,500 in coming months and could fall below 5,000 this year . blair , who has seen his popularity erode at home over his decision to go to war , said that soldiers however would remain into 2008 to provide support and training if iraq wanted . following britain 's lead , denmark and lithuania said they would withdraw most of their troops by august . denmark said its 430 ground troops would leave by august this year .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said the decision to withdraw troops was " taken together with our coalition allies , namely britain .

" increasingly our role will be supporting training and our numbers will be able to reduce accordingly , " he said . blair said british forces that remain would train iraqi troops , secure the iraq-iran border and supply routes and boost the ability of iraqi forces to conduct operations against extremist groups . blair 's unwavering support for president george w. bush over the us-led invasion in march 2003 has undermined his support at home .

washington however denies its coalition is crumbling . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday the british force in southern iraq would drop from 7,100 to 5,500 in coming months and could fall below 5,000 this year . blair , who has seen his popularity erode at home over his decision to go to war , said that soldiers however would remain into 2008 to provide support and training if iraq wanted . following britain 's lead , denmark and lithuania said they would withdraw most of their troops by august . denmark said its 430 ground troops would leave by august this year .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said the decision to withdraw troops was " taken together with our coalition allies , namely britain . " lithuanian defence minister juozas olekas told the baltic news service -lrb- bns -rrb- agency it was a " realistic possibility " that lithuania would not replace its 50 troops when their mission in iraq ends in august . the lithuanians are serving with a danish battalion near the southern city of basra , within the british-led multinational division .
like fellow baltic states latvia and estonia , lithuania joined nato in 2004 , and has been a staunch supporter of the united states in iraq . a string of other countries which sent troops either from the outset or later have already withdrawn from iraq , and others are planning to do so in the coming months . south korea and poland , with the largest contingents after the us and britain , have said they will leave by the end of the year . " next chapter can be written by iraqis " britain 's move was particularly important for washington as it is the second largest part of the us-led force in iraq after the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair said the peacekeeping reins had to be gradually handed over to the iraqis blair has faced huge domestic pressure over the unpopular war but he would not give a timetable for a complete british withdrawal . " the uk military presence will continue into 2008 for as long as we are wanted and have a job to do , " the prime minister told the british parliament on wednesday . british , danish and other multinational troops have been concentrated around the southern city of basra , which blair said remains " dangerous " but had improved enough for security to be handed over to iraqi forces . " what all this means is not that basra is how we want it to be , but it does mean that the next chapter in basra 's history can be written by iraqis , " blair said .
" increasingly our role will be supporting training and our numbers will be able to reduce accordingly , " he said . blair said british forces that remain would train iraqi troops , secure the iraq-iran border and supply routes and boost the ability of iraqi forces to conduct operations against extremist groups . blair 's unwavering support for president george w. bush over the us-led invasion in march 2003 has undermined his support at home .
britain put 40,000 troops into the invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six danish soldiers have been killed since 2003 in the violence in iraq in denmark , the government has been under increasing pressure to withdraw from iraq , and in january rasmussen voiced hopes that troop numbers could be reduced during 2007 .
six danish soldiers have been killed in iraq since 2003 . a poll published in early february showed that 64 percent of danes were " opposed " or " vehemently opposed " to the troop presence . meanwhile , bulgaria 's parliament voted on wednesday to extend the presence of the 155 bulgarian troops in iraq by a year . us denies coalition is crumbling britain 's announcement threw the spotlight on the us strategy in iraq , which has heightened bush 's unpopularity with the us public . us secretary of state condoleezza rice denied that the us-led coalition was crumbling . " the coalition remains intact and in fact the british still have thousands of soldiers deployed in iraq , in the south , " rice said in berlin .
she said the british pullout was part of the coalition strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said in berlin wednesday that the us-led coalition was not crumbling " it is the plan that as it is possible to transfer responsibilities to the iraqis , coalition forces would no longer be needed in those circumstances . " blair telephoned the us president on tuesday to warn him of the announcement , the white house said . " president bush sees this as a sign of success and what is possible for us once we help the iraqis deal with the sectarian violence in baghdad , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe . vice president dick cheney said the british drawdown was justified given the situation in basra , but stressed there could be no retreat from iraq . " i want you to know that the american people will not support a policy of retreat , " cheney said on the uss kitty hawk aircraft carrier while on a trip to japan .
" we want to complete the mission , we want to get it done right , and we want to return with honor , " he said . australian prime minister john howard , another strong backer of the us-led invasion , said he would not reduce australia 's 550 combat troops in iraq , part of a 1,400-strong force in the country . the united states has about 138,000 troops in iraq and has started sending another 21,500 to baghdad and surrounding provinces where the insurgency and sectarian violence has worsened in recent months . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost half of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .

" what all this means is not that basra is how we want it to be , but it does mean that the next chapter in basra 's history can be written by iraqis , " blair said .
" increasingly our role will be supporting training and our numbers will be able to reduce accordingly , " he said . blair said british forces that remain would train iraqi troops , secure the iraq-iran border and supply routes and boost the ability of iraqi forces to conduct operations against extremist groups . blair 's unwavering support for president george w. bush over the us-led invasion in march 2003 has undermined his support at home .
britain put 40,000 troops into the invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six danish soldiers have been killed since 2003 in the violence in iraq in denmark , the government has been under increasing pressure to withdraw from iraq , and in january rasmussen voiced hopes that troop numbers could be reduced during 2007 .
six danish soldiers have been killed in iraq since 2003 . a poll published in early february showed that 64 percent of danes were " opposed " or " vehemently opposed " to the troop presence . meanwhile , bulgaria 's parliament voted on wednesday to extend the presence of the 155 bulgarian troops in iraq by a year . us denies coalition is crumbling britain 's announcement threw the spotlight on the us strategy in iraq , which has heightened bush 's unpopularity with the us public . us secretary of state condoleezza rice denied that the us-led coalition was crumbling . " the coalition remains intact and in fact the british still have thousands of soldiers deployed in iraq , in the south , " rice said in berlin .
she said the british pullout was part of the coalition strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said in berlin wednesday that the us-led coalition was not crumbling " it is the plan that as it is possible to transfer responsibilities to the iraqis , coalition forces would no longer be needed in those circumstances . " blair telephoned the us president on tuesday to warn him of the announcement , the white house said . " president bush sees this as a sign of success and what is possible for us once we help the iraqis deal with the sectarian violence in baghdad , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe . vice president dick cheney said the british drawdown was justified given the situation in basra , but stressed there could be no retreat from iraq . " i want you to know that the american people will not support a policy of retreat , " cheney said on the uss kitty hawk aircraft carrier while on a trip to japan .
" we want to complete the mission , we want to get it done right , and we want to return with honor , " he said . australian prime minister john howard , another strong backer of the us-led invasion , said he would not reduce australia 's 550 combat troops in iraq , part of a 1,400-strong force in the country . the united states has about 138,000 troops in iraq and has started sending another 21,500 to baghdad and surrounding provinces where the insurgency and sectarian violence has worsened in recent months . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost half of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .

de vries said that the abduction of terror suspects to third-party countries where torture is used in interrogation , the holding of so-called " enemy combatants " without trial at the prison camp in the us naval base in guantanamo , cuba and the widely-publicized abuse of prisoners at abu ghraib prison in iraq had all undermined the fight against islamist extremism .
image tarnished by scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gijs de vries hopes for a us return to human rights norms " the cia renditions , together with abu ghraib , guantanamo bay , and the military commissions act , unfortunately have tarnished the image of the united states in the fight against terrorism , among muslims and non-muslims , " de vries told reuters news service .
" i hope the united states , now that there is a new political dynamic in the us congress , can return to a mainstream interpretation of international human rights . "
the issue of rendition has added resonance in europe after the european parliament announced last week that a number of eu governments - including italy and germany - knew about the secret cia flights transporting suspects through europe but chose to look the other way .
de vries , the man charged with overseeing and coordinating the eu 's fight against terror , was himself strongly criticized by the european parliament for not providing answers on the allegations of complicity by eu governments in cia rendition .
national responsibility for secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu states are accused of turning a blind eye to cia flights however , de vries responded by saying that there had been no hard evidence to substantiate the accusations made against the eu countries by european lawmakers and that judgment should be reserved until the authorities in member states had carried out and completed their own investigations into the allegations of collusion .
he insisted that secret intelligence services remained under national control and that neither the eu as a whole nor he as anti-terrorism coordinator had much power to change that .
de vries told the european parliament that member states should exercise more parliamentary control on the activities of their secret services .
rebuild trust , work for peace de vries , who steps in march after three years in the job , said that a change in approach by the us and the eu to regain trust from the islamic world was essential in the battle of ideas with radical islamists . " ultimately that 's the long-term approach we need , " he said , adding that a concerted effort to bring peace to the middle east would also help .
until these objectives can be achieved , de fries said , the terrorism threat in the eu would remain at its current high level and would remain so for a number of years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does not rule out another attack on madrid 's scale " we can not exclude that attacks on the scale of london or madrid could be repeated .
meanwhile we see that other types of threats are also materializing , " he said , referring to a recent alleged plot to kidnap and behead a british muslim soldier in the uk .
de vries calls for eu streamlining he also called for a streamlining of decision-making on cooperation against terrorism and organized crime within the eu and for the introduction of majority votes instead of insisting on unanimity among all 27 countries .
" unanimous decisions simply take too long , " he said , blaming them for the eu 's failure to coordinate cross border operations between national police forces when tracking international criminals .

" it is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings , including hospitals , have been artificially bloated by these cartels , " competition commissioner neelie kroes said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes says the damage caused by the cartel will last for many years " the national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong , but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway , " she said .
" the damage caused by this cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and elevators - for these companies the memory of this fine should last just as long , " she added . german firm gets stiffest fine german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the heaviest fine ever imposed by eu regulators on a single company in a cartel case because it was a repeated offender .
the german group was fined 480 million euros . otis , a unit of us conglomerate united technologies corporation , was given a fine of 225 million euros for its role , followed by schindler with a penalty of 144 million euros and kone with 142 million euros . eu antitrust investigators conducted so-called " dawn raids " on lift and escalator makers across europe in january 2004 after getting a tip off about the cartel .
after the raids , the companies handed over more evidence in the hope of winning leniency or reduced fines . the european commission said that high-ranking national-level management ran the cartel by holding secret meetings in bars and restaurants .
they also visited the countryside and traveled abroad and used pre-paid mobile phone cards to avoid regulators ' scrutiny . eu campaign against illegal cartels kroes , europe 's top antitrust regulator , is leading a campaign against illegal cartels and has been chalking up record fines against companies targeted by her crackdown . after bumper fines in 2006 , eu regulators in january ordered 10 companies to pay 750 million euros for fixing prices and carving up the market in electrical generation equipment .
after the lift makers case , that fine is now the third biggest ever against a cartel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the stiffest penalty until wednesday , the biggest fine in a european cartel case was 855 million euros in penalties imposed on eight vitamin makers in 2001 .
the vitamin makers ' fine was later reduced to 790 million euros by an eu court . despite the record fine on the lift makers , higher penalties are likely in future cases after the commission tightened its rules for calculating fines , making them heavier for repeat offenders and long-lasting cartels .
the reform could potentially cost guilty companies up to 10 times more than before . the commission was also given a boost in its anti-cartel campaign earlier this month with a ruling from the european court of justice that gave regulators more freedom to fix fines , especially how far back regulators can take previous offences into account . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission slaps huge fine on siemens for price fixing the eu has fined power equipment manufacturers for their roles in a price-fixing scheme .

nine eu countries currently have a registration fee or motor vehicle tax contingent on co2 emissions , according to the association of european car-makers . austria , the netherlands and portugal reward owners of environmentally friendly cars with sliding registration fees .
in denmark , sweden and great britain , the vehicle tax is determined by the level of co2 emissions . car-owners with low-emission vehicles are given break on both the one-time registration fee and the annual vehicle tax in belgium , france and cyprus . in great britain , owners of vehicles that emit less that 100 grams of co2 per kilometer pay no tax at all , whereas the annual rate for diesel vehicles emitting more than 225 grams per kilometer is a hefty 320 euros -lrb- $ 421 -rrb- .
france has a similar system for company cars . in sweden , drivers pay 1.62 euros for every gram of co2 over 100 grams per kilometer that their vehicle emits . reaping the benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the us be the next to reward drivers for choosing planet-friendly vehicles ?
" changing the tax in england has already had an effect on which new cars people buy , " said uwe kunert , transportation expert from the german institute for economic research .
sweden is experiencing the same effect . in the netherlands , tax revenues fell so dramatically that the government had to alter the tax reforms .
kunert is cautious not to count any chickens before they hatch , however . " it 's still difficult for most countries , " he said .
" there 's has n't been any overwhelming successes yet . " the price tag on the planet in germany , the success of reforms will depend on the affordability of environmentally friendly motors . low-emission models like volkswagen three-liter lupo disappeared from the market because they were too expensive - but also because not enough advertising was done .

it is seeking the ministers ' approval of the plan in order to get backing from eu leaders at a march 8-9 summit in brussels . details of how eu nations - especially eu newcomers from central and eastern europe - would share-out the emission reductions still had to be worked out , gabriel said . earlier , several eu states including finland , hungary and poland had argued against binding targets on reducing co2 emission levels after 2012 . however , calls for firmer action had come , among others , from slovenia , spain and britain which said all eu states must stand up and commit to serious climate action or lose their " leadership role " on the issue . germany , which currently holds the european union 's six-month rotating presidency as well heads the g8 , has made tackling climate change a key priority .
the counry 's car industry however is up in arms over various proposals to cut car emissions for fear that it would hurt business . green groups welcome agreement environmental groups , including the wwf , welcomed the eu agreement , saying they now wanted eu leaders who meet in brussels next month to endorse the 30 per cent target . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is expected to cause extreme weather conditions in europe stephan singer , head of wwf 's european climate and energy unit , said the eu must " immediately put in place concrete measures to achieve such targets . " he also urged the eu to forge a strategy to mobilise resources and engage other countries for the period after the 2012 expiry of the current kyoto protocol on climate change . climate change and the switch to a low-carbon economy are expected to be key issues to be discussed by eu leaders at their summit in brussels on march 8-9 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german plan to tax cars on emissions gets wary nod plans by the german government to tax cars based on emissions instead of engine size in a bid to encourage carmakers to design " greener " cars have met with a cautious welcome .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 21.02.2007 mother tongues neglected as integration tool in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany should do more to promote multilingual children , critics say international mother language day is being observed across the globe on wednesday .
but critics say germany is n't doing enough to promote linguistic diversity and multilingual education . the integration debate in germany has included a strong focus on immigrant children 's language skills .
both politicians and educators agree that it 's especially important to speak the language of the country you live in - and speak it well in order to get a good education and find a job . in germany , though , children from immigrant families often have problems at school .
their german just is n't good enough .
as a result , some german states are giving fewer lessons in these kids ' native tongues - a move not all teachers and linguists agree with . ruprecht baur , professor for german as a foreign language at duisburg-essen university , said several questions always come up in discussions on integration .
does the fact that a child comes from an immigrant family and speaks a different language prevent him or her from learning german and doing well at school ?
should the parents speak german at home , and avoid their native tongue ?
and is being exposed to two languages the reason some children here , notably with an italian or turkish background , fail in school ? according to baur , these questions arise despite multilingualism being the rule almost everywhere in the world . " international studies show that the mother tongue is no distraction , " baur said .
" the majority of people all over the world speak several languages .
they 're born with a mother language , and often know two more . " germany lacking interest in linguistic heritage the european union has repeatedly stressed the importance and its support of linguistic pluralism .
eu guidelines even commit member states to promote language classes in the children 's mother tongues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some turkish children perfect their mother tongue in germany that 's the case in germany as well - in theory .
in practice , north rhine-westphalia for example has cut back on native language teaching positions .
neighboring hesse has discontinued these classes altogether . the western german states reasoned that learning german at an early age was more important .
but vassilios fthenakis , professor for development psychology at italy 's bozen university , is critical of germany 's educational policies . " it 's an ongoing german problem : not taking a serious interest in the importance of a child 's mother language and culture , but pushing forward integration that is n't working , " fthenakis said .
" it 's a fundamental problem that germany does n't first strengthen a child 's mother language and culture , and then push learning german from that point on . " immigrant parents should n't speak german at home cultural and linguistic diversity is a richness that should be used for the individual and collective learning experience , the greek-born fthenakis said .
germany though did n't have policies like sweden , england or france do .
he said german guidelines could only be called disoriented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some grade schools offer language training for immigrant children according to fthenakis , the role that the family and their educational level play should not be underestimated .
young students will quickly learn german if they can speak and write in their mother language , fthenakis said . he said he is convinced that the language learning process should start before kids enter the school system .
in germany , that would be before the age of six .
every child is open to any language in the world before its first birthday - learning a second language is no problem at all , fthenakis said . critics of the multilingual approach said immigrant parents should speak german with their children at home .
but this was counterproductive , said duisburg-essen university 's baur . " if the parents do n't speak german well , they should n't speak it with their children , " baur said .
" at some point , the children 's german language abilities will be better than the parents ' , and then they 'll make fun of them and say , you ca n't even speak the language properly that you 're trying to speak with me .

" … blair will hardly be able to improve his image in history books , " the paper wrote .
" he said himself that he had wanted to lead great britain into the euro zone , into the heart of europe , but what he 's ended up doing is turning the united kingdom into an aircraft carrier for the united states , " the paper wrote .
it also pointed out that british voters will punish blair 's labour party just like american voters did with the republicans in congressional elections in november .
" democracies sometimes need a long time for their self-purification processes , but it 's amazing to see that the democratic process works in the end . " the obermain-tagblatt got right to the point : " the signal from london could n't be more embarrassing for washington - tony blair , the us ' closest ally , disentangles himself from the circle of unity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis listen to us president bush promise more troops to iraq in january berlin 's tagesspiegel pondered the dilemma : " … sir richard dannatt , the new , unusually upfront british supreme commander of the armed forces , even believes that the mere presence of his soldiers in basra triggers more violence than they prevent , " the paper wrote . " … .the brits and war-weary danes are sending out a signal of resignation with their announcement that they would withdraw troops . "
the paper said the us ' most loyal allies were following on the heels of the tens of thousands of iraqis who have fled their country .
" and that during a time when the us is trying to make one last attempt to turn the tide . " braunschweiger zeitung said withdrawing troops from iraq is the right thing to do .
the west has lost .
that should be openly acknowledged , " the paper opined .
" the war against saddam hussein was based on lies , and the war is ending with lies , " the paper continued .
" blair wants to go down in the history books as the prime minister who brought troops home .
he does n't want to leave that to his successor , gordon brown .
bush is going to end up doing the same .

" those are not principles put there to be an obstacle , they are put there because they 're foundational for peace , " she said . " it 's very difficult to imagine a circumstance where you have peace talks but one party does n't recognize the existence of the other , " rice said . hamas , which the us , european union and israel consider a terrorist organization , has not yet clearly agreed to the west 's conditions of recognizing israel , renouncing violence and honoring past agreements with the jewish state . rice also emphasized the importance of continuing to support abbas in his power struggle with iranian-backed hamas . inconclusive summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ehud olmert -lrb- r -rrb- , rice and palestinian president mahmoud abbas -lrb- l -rrb- at talsk in jerusalem on monday rice held an inconclusive summit monday in jerusalem with abbas and israeli prime minister ehud olmert . steinmeier , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , called the meeting " a first step " but noted that hopes for peace were complicated by the fraught negotiations on the formation of a palestinian government . " that is why we need to be particularly realistic going into these talks , " he said , referring to the quartet gathering . " we are nevertheless determined to seize this opportunity , " he said . russia and the un said they would use the berlin meeting to push for the unity government to be recognized .
moscow said it would call for the removal of aid and diplomatic boycotts imposed on the palestinian government after it fell under hamas ' control following january 2006 elections . growing unease the embargo imposed by the quartet after the 2006 elections has caused widespread economic hardship in the palestinian areas and there is growing unease in europe over the measures . the spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , cristina gallach , said that palestinian unity was a crucial step forward but indicated it was too early to consider lifting the embargo . " obviously one can not put everything on the table because they are still in negotiations - we have not yet seen the composition of the government , " she said . un chief ban ki-moon said in berlin ahead of the quartet talks that he was " encouraged " by the power-sharing deal between fatah and hamas . bildunterschrift : quartet members at a washington meeting defending the unity government abbas , long portrayed by washington as the best " partner for peace " with israel , has embarked on a diplomatic offensive of his own .
he is touring europe to defend the unity government deal . he insists the agreement reached between his fatah party and hamas should satisfy the quartet principles since it obliges the new unity government to respect international resolutions and agreements signed by the fatah-led palestine liberation organisation - meaning deals with the jewish state . palestinians urged the quartet powers to give their incoming government a chance . " we hope the quartet will take a positive approach towards the government and not resort to pressure and boycott , " said ghazi hamad , spokesman for the hamas-led government . israel has ruled out dealing with any government that includes hamas . it reiterated its hope that the quartet will stick to the conditions imposed on the palestinian government for the aid boycott to be lifted . " it is important and critical that the international community continues to respect these conditions , which are not negotiable , " israeli foreign minister tzipi livni said in a radio interview . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel in the ascendency as blair 's star fades tony blair has pursued many issues in search of a lasting positive legacy ; mideast peace , strong eu-us ties and climate change .

washington however denies its coalition is crumbling . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday the british force in southern iraq would drop from 7,100 to 5,500 in coming months and could fall below 5,000 this year . blair , who has seen his popularity erode at home over his decision to go to war , said that soldiers however would remain into 2008 to provide support and training if iraq wanted . following britain 's lead , denmark and lithuania said they would withdraw most of their troops by august . denmark said its 430 ground troops would leave by august this year .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said the decision to withdraw troops was " taken together with our coalition allies , namely britain . " lithuanian defence minister juozas olekas told the baltic news service -lrb- bns -rrb- agency it was a " realistic possibility " that lithuania would not replace its 50 troops when their mission in iraq ends in august . the lithuanians are serving with a danish battalion near the southern city of basra , within the british-led multinational division .
like fellow baltic states latvia and estonia , lithuania joined nato in 2004 , and has been a staunch supporter of the united states in iraq . a string of other countries which sent troops either from the outset or later have already withdrawn from iraq , and others are planning to do so in the coming months . south korea and poland , with the largest contingents after the us and britain , have said they will leave by the end of the year . " next chapter can be written by iraqis " britain 's move was particularly important for washington as it is the second largest part of the us-led force in iraq after the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair said the peacekeeping reins had to be gradually handed over to the iraqis blair has faced huge domestic pressure over the unpopular war but he would not give a timetable for a complete british withdrawal . " the uk military presence will continue into 2008 for as long as we are wanted and have a job to do , " the prime minister told the british parliament on wednesday . british , danish and other multinational troops have been concentrated around the southern city of basra , which blair said remains " dangerous " but had improved enough for security to be handed over to iraqi forces . " what all this means is not that basra is how we want it to be , but it does mean that the next chapter in basra 's history can be written by iraqis , " blair said .
" increasingly our role will be supporting training and our numbers will be able to reduce accordingly , " he said . blair said british forces that remain would train iraqi troops , secure the iraq-iran border and supply routes and boost the ability of iraqi forces to conduct operations against extremist groups . blair 's unwavering support for president george w. bush over the us-led invasion in march 2003 has undermined his support at home .
britain put 40,000 troops into the invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six danish soldiers have been killed since 2003 in the violence in iraq in denmark , the government has been under increasing pressure to withdraw from iraq , and in january rasmussen voiced hopes that troop numbers could be reduced during 2007 .
six danish soldiers have been killed in iraq since 2003 . a poll published in early february showed that 64 percent of danes were " opposed " or " vehemently opposed " to the troop presence . meanwhile , bulgaria 's parliament voted on wednesday to extend the presence of the 155 bulgarian troops in iraq by a year . us denies coalition is crumbling britain 's announcement threw the spotlight on the us strategy in iraq , which has heightened bush 's unpopularity with the us public . us secretary of state condoleezza rice denied that the us-led coalition was crumbling . " the coalition remains intact and in fact the british still have thousands of soldiers deployed in iraq , in the south , " rice said in berlin .
she said the british pullout was part of the coalition strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said in berlin wednesday that the us-led coalition was not crumbling " it is the plan that as it is possible to transfer responsibilities to the iraqis , coalition forces would no longer be needed in those circumstances . " blair telephoned the us president on tuesday to warn him of the announcement , the white house said . " president bush sees this as a sign of success and what is possible for us once we help the iraqis deal with the sectarian violence in baghdad , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe . vice president dick cheney said the british drawdown was justified given the situation in basra , but stressed there could be no retreat from iraq . " i want you to know that the american people will not support a policy of retreat , " cheney said on the uss kitty hawk aircraft carrier while on a trip to japan .
" we want to complete the mission , we want to get it done right , and we want to return with honor , " he said . australian prime minister john howard , another strong backer of the us-led invasion , said he would not reduce australia 's 550 combat troops in iraq , part of a 1,400-strong force in the country . the united states has about 138,000 troops in iraq and has started sending another 21,500 to baghdad and surrounding provinces where the insurgency and sectarian violence has worsened in recent months . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost half of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .

washington however denies its coalition is crumbling . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday the british force in southern iraq would drop from 7,100 to 5,500 in coming months and could fall below 5,000 this year . blair , who has seen his popularity erode at home over his decision to go to war , said that soldiers however would remain into 2008 to provide support and training if iraq wanted . following britain 's lead , denmark and lithuania said they would withdraw most of their troops by august . denmark said its 430 ground troops would leave by august this year .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said the decision to withdraw troops was " taken together with our coalition allies , namely britain . " lithuanian defence minister juozas olekas told the baltic news service -lrb- bns -rrb- agency it was a " realistic possibility " that lithuania would not replace its 50 troops when their mission in iraq ends in august . the lithuanians are serving with a danish battalion near the southern city of basra , within the british-led multinational division .
like fellow baltic states latvia and estonia , lithuania joined nato in 2004 , and has been a staunch supporter of the united states in iraq . a string of other countries which sent troops either from the outset or later have already withdrawn from iraq , and others are planning to do so in the coming months . south korea and poland , with the largest contingents after the us and britain , have said they will leave by the end of the year . " next chapter can be written by iraqis " britain 's move was particularly important for washington as it is the second largest part of the us-led force in iraq after the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair said the peacekeeping reins had to be gradually handed over to the iraqis blair has faced huge domestic pressure over the unpopular war but he would not give a timetable for a complete british withdrawal . " the uk military presence will continue into 2008 for as long as we are wanted and have a job to do , " the prime minister told the british parliament on wednesday . british , danish and other multinational troops have been concentrated around the southern city of basra , which blair said remains " dangerous " but had improved enough for security to be handed over to iraqi forces . " what all this means is not that basra is how we want it to be , but it does mean that the next chapter in basra 's history can be written by iraqis , " blair said .
" increasingly our role will be supporting training and our numbers will be able to reduce accordingly , " he said . blair said british forces that remain would train iraqi troops , secure the iraq-iran border and supply routes and boost the ability of iraqi forces to conduct operations against extremist groups . blair 's unwavering support for president george w. bush over the us-led invasion in march 2003 has undermined his support at home .
britain put 40,000 troops into the invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six danish soldiers have been killed since 2003 in the violence in iraq in denmark , the government has been under increasing pressure to withdraw from iraq , and in january rasmussen voiced hopes that troop numbers could be reduced during 2007 .
six danish soldiers have been killed in iraq since 2003 . a poll published in early february showed that 64 percent of danes were " opposed " or " vehemently opposed " to the troop presence . meanwhile , bulgaria 's parliament voted on wednesday to extend the presence of the 155 bulgarian troops in iraq by a year . us denies coalition is crumbling britain 's announcement threw the spotlight on the us strategy in iraq , which has heightened bush 's unpopularity with the us public . us secretary of state condoleezza rice denied that the us-led coalition was crumbling . " the coalition remains intact and in fact the british still have thousands of soldiers deployed in iraq , in the south , " rice said in berlin .
she said the british pullout was part of the coalition strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said in berlin wednesday that the us-led coalition was not crumbling " it is the plan that as it is possible to transfer responsibilities to the iraqis , coalition forces would no longer be needed in those circumstances . " blair telephoned the us president on tuesday to warn him of the announcement , the white house said . " president bush sees this as a sign of success and what is possible for us once we help the iraqis deal with the sectarian violence in baghdad , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe . vice president dick cheney said the british drawdown was justified given the situation in basra , but stressed there could be no retreat from iraq . " i want you to know that the american people will not support a policy of retreat , " cheney said on the uss kitty hawk aircraft carrier while on a trip to japan .
" we want to complete the mission , we want to get it done right , and we want to return with honor , " he said . australian prime minister john howard , another strong backer of the us-led invasion , said he would not reduce australia 's 550 combat troops in iraq , part of a 1,400-strong force in the country . the united states has about 138,000 troops in iraq and has started sending another 21,500 to baghdad and surrounding provinces where the insurgency and sectarian violence has worsened in recent months . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost half of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .

" it is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings , including hospitals , have been artificially bloated by these cartels , " competition commissioner neelie kroes said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes says the damage caused by the cartel will last for many years " the national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong , but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway , " she said .
" the damage caused by this cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and elevators - for these companies the memory of this fine should last just as long , " she added . german firm gets stiffest fine german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the heaviest fine ever imposed by eu regulators on a single company in a cartel case because it was a repeated offender .
the german group was fined 480 million euros . otis , a unit of us conglomerate united technologies corporation , was given a fine of 225 million euros for its role , followed by schindler with a penalty of 144 million euros and kone with 142 million euros . eu antitrust investigators conducted so-called " dawn raids " on lift and escalator makers across europe in january 2004 after getting a tip off about the cartel .
after the raids , the companies handed over more evidence in the hope of winning leniency or reduced fines . the european commission said that high-ranking national-level management ran the cartel by holding secret meetings in bars and restaurants .
they also visited the countryside and traveled abroad and used pre-paid mobile phone cards to avoid regulators ' scrutiny . eu campaign against illegal cartels kroes , europe 's top antitrust regulator , is leading a campaign against illegal cartels and has been chalking up record fines against companies targeted by her crackdown . after bumper fines in 2006 , eu regulators in january ordered 10 companies to pay 750 million euros for fixing prices and carving up the market in electrical generation equipment .
after the lift makers case , that fine is now the third biggest ever against a cartel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the stiffest penalty until wednesday , the biggest fine in a european cartel case was 855 million euros in penalties imposed on eight vitamin makers in 2001 .
the vitamin makers ' fine was later reduced to 790 million euros by an eu court . despite the record fine on the lift makers , higher penalties are likely in future cases after the commission tightened its rules for calculating fines , making them heavier for repeat offenders and long-lasting cartels .
the reform could potentially cost guilty companies up to 10 times more than before . the commission was also given a boost in its anti-cartel campaign earlier this month with a ruling from the european court of justice that gave regulators more freedom to fix fines , especially how far back regulators can take previous offences into account . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission slaps huge fine on siemens for price fixing the eu has fined power equipment manufacturers for their roles in a price-fixing scheme .

it is seeking the ministers ' approval of the plan in order to get backing from eu leaders at a march 8-9 summit in brussels . details of how eu nations - especially eu newcomers from central and eastern europe - would share-out the emission reductions still had to be worked out , gabriel said . earlier , several eu states including finland , hungary and poland had argued against binding targets on reducing co2 emission levels after 2012 . however , calls for firmer action had come , among others , from slovenia , spain and britain which said all eu states must stand up and commit to serious climate action or lose their " leadership role " on the issue . germany , which currently holds the european union 's six-month rotating presidency as well heads the g8 , has made tackling climate change a key priority .

de vries said that the abduction of terror suspects to third-party countries where torture is used in interrogation , the holding of so-called " enemy combatants " without trial at the prison camp in the us naval base in guantanamo , cuba and the widely-publicized abuse of prisoners at abu ghraib prison in iraq had all undermined the fight against islamist extremism .

" i hope the united states , now that there is a new political dynamic in the us congress , can return to a mainstream interpretation of international human rights . "
the issue of rendition has added resonance in europe after the european parliament announced last week that a number of eu governments - including italy and germany - knew about the secret cia flights transporting suspects through europe but chose to look the other way .
de vries , the man charged with overseeing and coordinating the eu 's fight against terror , was himself strongly criticized by the european parliament for not providing answers on the allegations of complicity by eu governments in cia rendition .
national responsibility for secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu states are accused of turning a blind eye to cia flights however , de vries responded by saying that there had been no hard evidence to substantiate the accusations made against the eu countries by european lawmakers and that judgment should be reserved until the authorities in member states had carried out and completed their own investigations into the allegations of collusion .
he insisted that secret intelligence services remained under national control and that neither the eu as a whole nor he as anti-terrorism coordinator had much power to change that .
de vries told the european parliament that member states should exercise more parliamentary control on the activities of their secret services .
rebuild trust , work for peace de vries , who steps in march after three years in the job , said that a change in approach by the us and the eu to regain trust from the islamic world was essential in the battle of ideas with radical islamists . " ultimately that 's the long-term approach we need , " he said , adding that a concerted effort to bring peace to the middle east would also help .
until these objectives can be achieved , de fries said , the terrorism threat in the eu would remain at its current high level and would remain so for a number of years .

de vries calls for eu streamlining he also called for a streamlining of decision-making on cooperation against terrorism and organized crime within the eu and for the introduction of majority votes instead of insisting on unanimity among all 27 countries .
" unanimous decisions simply take too long , " he said , blaming them for the eu 's failure to coordinate cross border operations between national police forces when tracking international criminals .

but critics say germany is n't doing enough to promote linguistic diversity and multilingual education . the integration debate in germany has included a strong focus on immigrant children 's language skills .
both politicians and educators agree that it 's especially important to speak the language of the country you live in - and speak it well in order to get a good education and find a job . in germany , though , children from immigrant families often have problems at school .
their german just is n't good enough .
as a result , some german states are giving fewer lessons in these kids ' native tongues - a move not all teachers and linguists agree with . ruprecht baur , professor for german as a foreign language at duisburg-essen university , said several questions always come up in discussions on integration .
does the fact that a child comes from an immigrant family and speaks a different language prevent him or her from learning german and doing well at school ?
should the parents speak german at home , and avoid their native tongue ?
and is being exposed to two languages the reason some children here , notably with an italian or turkish background , fail in school ? according to baur , these questions arise despite multilingualism being the rule almost everywhere in the world . " international studies show that the mother tongue is no distraction , " baur said .
" the majority of people all over the world speak several languages .
they 're born with a mother language , and often know two more . " germany lacking interest in linguistic heritage the european union has repeatedly stressed the importance and its support of linguistic pluralism .
eu guidelines even commit member states to promote language classes in the children 's mother tongues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some turkish children perfect their mother tongue in germany that 's the case in germany as well - in theory .
in practice , north rhine-westphalia for example has cut back on native language teaching positions .
neighboring hesse has discontinued these classes altogether . the western german states reasoned that learning german at an early age was more important .
but vassilios fthenakis , professor for development psychology at italy 's bozen university , is critical of germany 's educational policies . " it 's an ongoing german problem : not taking a serious interest in the importance of a child 's mother language and culture , but pushing forward integration that is n't working , " fthenakis said .
" it 's a fundamental problem that germany does n't first strengthen a child 's mother language and culture , and then push learning german from that point on . " immigrant parents should n't speak german at home cultural and linguistic diversity is a richness that should be used for the individual and collective learning experience , the greek-born fthenakis said .
germany though did n't have policies like sweden , england or france do .
he said german guidelines could only be called disoriented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some grade schools offer language training for immigrant children according to fthenakis , the role that the family and their educational level play should not be underestimated .
young students will quickly learn german if they can speak and write in their mother language , fthenakis said . he said he is convinced that the language learning process should start before kids enter the school system .
in germany , that would be before the age of six .
every child is open to any language in the world before its first birthday - learning a second language is no problem at all , fthenakis said . critics of the multilingual approach said immigrant parents should speak german with their children at home .
but this was counterproductive , said duisburg-essen university 's baur . " if the parents do n't speak german well , they should n't speak it with their children , " baur said .
" at some point , the children 's german language abilities will be better than the parents ' , and then they 'll make fun of them and say , you ca n't even speak the language properly that you 're trying to speak with me .

" it is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings , including hospitals , have been artificially bloated by these cartels , " competition commissioner neelie kroes said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes says the damage caused by the cartel will last for many years " the national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong , but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway , " she said .
" the damage caused by this cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and elevators - for these companies the memory of this fine should last just as long , " she added . german firm gets stiffest fine german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the heaviest fine ever imposed by eu regulators on a single company in a cartel case because it was a repeated offender .
the german group was fined 480 million euros . otis , a unit of us conglomerate united technologies corporation , was given a fine of 225 million euros for its role , followed by schindler with a penalty of 144 million euros and kone with 142 million euros . eu antitrust investigators conducted so-called " dawn raids " on lift and escalator makers across europe in january 2004 after getting a tip off about the cartel .
after the raids , the companies handed over more evidence in the hope of winning leniency or reduced fines . the european commission said that high-ranking national-level management ran the cartel by holding secret meetings in bars and restaurants .
they also visited the countryside and traveled abroad and used pre-paid mobile phone cards to avoid regulators ' scrutiny . eu campaign against illegal cartels kroes , europe 's top antitrust regulator , is leading a campaign against illegal cartels and has been chalking up record fines against companies targeted by her crackdown . after bumper fines in 2006 , eu regulators in january ordered 10 companies to pay 750 million euros for fixing prices and carving up the market in electrical generation equipment .
after the lift makers case , that fine is now the third biggest ever against a cartel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the stiffest penalty until wednesday , the biggest fine in a european cartel case was 855 million euros in penalties imposed on eight vitamin makers in 2001 .
the vitamin makers ' fine was later reduced to 790 million euros by an eu court . despite the record fine on the lift makers , higher penalties are likely in future cases after the commission tightened its rules for calculating fines , making them heavier for repeat offenders and long-lasting cartels .
the reform could potentially cost guilty companies up to 10 times more than before . the commission was also given a boost in its anti-cartel campaign earlier this month with a ruling from the european court of justice that gave regulators more freedom to fix fines , especially how far back regulators can take previous offences into account . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission slaps huge fine on siemens for price fixing the eu has fined power equipment manufacturers for their roles in a price-fixing scheme .

" it is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings , including hospitals , have been artificially bloated by these cartels , " competition commissioner neelie kroes said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes says the damage caused by the cartel will last for many years " the national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong , but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway , " she said .
" the damage caused by this cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and elevators - for these companies the memory of this fine should last just as long , " she added . german firm gets stiffest fine german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the heaviest fine ever imposed by eu regulators on a single company in a cartel case because it was a repeated offender .
the german group was fined 480 million euros . otis , a unit of us conglomerate united technologies corporation , was given a fine of 225 million euros for its role , followed by schindler with a penalty of 144 million euros and kone with 142 million euros . eu antitrust investigators conducted so-called " dawn raids " on lift and escalator makers across europe in january 2004 after getting a tip off about the cartel .
after the raids , the companies handed over more evidence in the hope of winning leniency or reduced fines . the european commission said that high-ranking national-level management ran the cartel by holding secret meetings in bars and restaurants .
they also visited the countryside and traveled abroad and used pre-paid mobile phone cards to avoid regulators ' scrutiny . eu campaign against illegal cartels kroes , europe 's top antitrust regulator , is leading a campaign against illegal cartels and has been chalking up record fines against companies targeted by her crackdown . after bumper fines in 2006 , eu regulators in january ordered 10 companies to pay 750 million euros for fixing prices and carving up the market in electrical generation equipment .
after the lift makers case , that fine is now the third biggest ever against a cartel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the stiffest penalty until wednesday , the biggest fine in a european cartel case was 855 million euros in penalties imposed on eight vitamin makers in 2001 .
the vitamin makers ' fine was later reduced to 790 million euros by an eu court . despite the record fine on the lift makers , higher penalties are likely in future cases after the commission tightened its rules for calculating fines , making them heavier for repeat offenders and long-lasting cartels .
the reform could potentially cost guilty companies up to 10 times more than before . the commission was also given a boost in its anti-cartel campaign earlier this month with a ruling from the european court of justice that gave regulators more freedom to fix fines , especially how far back regulators can take previous offences into account . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission slaps huge fine on siemens for price fixing the eu has fined power equipment manufacturers for their roles in a price-fixing scheme .

but critics say germany is n't doing enough to promote linguistic diversity and multilingual education . the integration debate in germany has included a strong focus on immigrant children 's language skills .
both politicians and educators agree that it 's especially important to speak the language of the country you live in - and speak it well in order to get a good education and find a job . in germany , though , children from immigrant families often have problems at school .
their german just is n't good enough .
as a result , some german states are giving fewer lessons in these kids ' native tongues - a move not all teachers and linguists agree with . ruprecht baur , professor for german as a foreign language at duisburg-essen university , said several questions always come up in discussions on integration .
does the fact that a child comes from an immigrant family and speaks a different language prevent him or her from learning german and doing well at school ?
should the parents speak german at home , and avoid their native tongue ?
and is being exposed to two languages the reason some children here , notably with an italian or turkish background , fail in school ? according to baur , these questions arise despite multilingualism being the rule almost everywhere in the world . " international studies show that the mother tongue is no distraction , " baur said .
" the majority of people all over the world speak several languages .
they 're born with a mother language , and often know two more . " germany lacking interest in linguistic heritage the european union has repeatedly stressed the importance and its support of linguistic pluralism .
eu guidelines even commit member states to promote language classes in the children 's mother tongues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some turkish children perfect their mother tongue in germany that 's the case in germany as well - in theory .
in practice , north rhine-westphalia for example has cut back on native language teaching positions .
neighboring hesse has discontinued these classes altogether . the western german states reasoned that learning german at an early age was more important .
but vassilios fthenakis , professor for development psychology at italy 's bozen university , is critical of germany 's educational policies . " it 's an ongoing german problem : not taking a serious interest in the importance of a child 's mother language and culture , but pushing forward integration that is n't working , " fthenakis said .
" it 's a fundamental problem that germany does n't first strengthen a child 's mother language and culture , and then push learning german from that point on . " immigrant parents should n't speak german at home cultural and linguistic diversity is a richness that should be used for the individual and collective learning experience , the greek-born fthenakis said .
germany though did n't have policies like sweden , england or france do .
he said german guidelines could only be called disoriented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some grade schools offer language training for immigrant children according to fthenakis , the role that the family and their educational level play should not be underestimated .
young students will quickly learn german if they can speak and write in their mother language , fthenakis said . he said he is convinced that the language learning process should start before kids enter the school system .
in germany , that would be before the age of six .
every child is open to any language in the world before its first birthday - learning a second language is no problem at all , fthenakis said . critics of the multilingual approach said immigrant parents should speak german with their children at home .
but this was counterproductive , said duisburg-essen university 's baur . " if the parents do n't speak german well , they should n't speak it with their children , " baur said .
" at some point , the children 's german language abilities will be better than the parents ' , and then they 'll make fun of them and say , you ca n't even speak the language properly that you 're trying to speak with me .

dw 's peter philipp believes blair is playing a dangerous game . despite not being able to influence events in iraq through his actions , british prime minister tony blair can at least use the situation there for his own domestic purposes .
news that blair intends to withdraw almost a quarter of the british occupation force in iraq - 1,600 of some 7,000 soldiers stationed there - can not be seen in any other light .
it is no coincidence that public opinion back in the uk is in favor of a withdrawal , while the fact that blair has already announced his resignation means he may not be around to face the consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair finds himself in a very difficult position .
up until now , the prime minister was the united states ' most dependable ally in iraq but now he appears to be jumping ship just at the moment when president george w. bush is looking to strengthen the troop deployment in the country .
blair could face the wrath of a president betrayed .
while there is certainly a difference between the operations of the us forces in their crackdown on insurgents and criminal gangs in baghdad and the british occupation of the relatively less volatile southern city of basra , a withdrawal of the british contingent at a time when more not fewer troops is the message from washington is certainly a risk .
one way in which blair could avoid the rapprochement of the americans while scoring a domestic success would be to declare " mission accomplished . "
however , washington will know better than most how successful the british contribution to security in iraq has been while the british public would be unlikely to suddenly view the iraq adventure in a better light just because the troops are now coming home .
at best , blair will be seen in the uk as trying to rectify what is seen as the biggest mistake of his premiership and as trying to shake off the shackles of us loyalty before he departs the political arena .
it is unlikely that much will be changed in iraq 's situation by the british departure .
the main fear is that the shiite majority in the south will rise up against the occupying forces and that the united states , with enough on their plate in baghdad and the rest of the country , will then be over-stretched .
this would surely end blair 's dream of being inducted in the us hall of fame for honorable allies .
however there is little to suggest that any such uprising would happen .
the iraqi shiites have absolutely no interest in openly engaging the occupation forces , especially when they hold a majority of power in the iraqi government already .
there is no need to fight for something that has already been handed to them by a democratic process .
the only conceivable danger would be a confrontation between the united states and iran .
tehran could activate allies in iraq to make life very complicated for the americans and where better to ferment unrest than in southern iraq , an area of the country which would have been weakened by a partial british withdrawal ? peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and a middle east expert -lrb- nda -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe says saddam 's execution solves no problems for iraq as european nations criticized the execution of saddam hussein out of opposition to the death penalty , sunday newspapers across the continent were pessimistic as to whether the hanging would solve any of iraq 's problems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 21.02.2007 opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost a quarter of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .
dw 's peter philipp believes blair is playing a dangerous game . despite not being able to influence events in iraq through his actions , british prime minister tony blair can at least use the situation there for his own domestic purposes .
news that blair intends to withdraw almost a quarter of the british occupation force in iraq - 1,600 of some 7,000 soldiers stationed there - can not be seen in any other light .
it is no coincidence that public opinion back in the uk is in favor of a withdrawal , while the fact that blair has already announced his resignation means he may not be around to face the consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair finds himself in a very difficult position .
up until now , the prime minister was the united states ' most dependable ally in iraq but now he appears to be jumping ship just at the moment when president george w. bush is looking to strengthen the troop deployment in the country .
blair could face the wrath of a president betrayed .
while there is certainly a difference between the operations of the us forces in their crackdown on insurgents and criminal gangs in baghdad and the british occupation of the relatively less volatile southern city of basra , a withdrawal of the british contingent at a time when more not fewer troops is the message from washington is certainly a risk .
one way in which blair could avoid the rapprochement of the americans while scoring a domestic success would be to declare " mission accomplished . "
however , washington will know better than most how successful the british contribution to security in iraq has been while the british public would be unlikely to suddenly view the iraq adventure in a better light just because the troops are now coming home .
at best , blair will be seen in the uk as trying to rectify what is seen as the biggest mistake of his premiership and as trying to shake off the shackles of us loyalty before he departs the political arena .
it is unlikely that much will be changed in iraq 's situation by the british departure .
the main fear is that the shiite majority in the south will rise up against the occupying forces and that the united states , with enough on their plate in baghdad and the rest of the country , will then be over-stretched .
this would surely end blair 's dream of being inducted in the us hall of fame for honorable allies .
however there is little to suggest that any such uprising would happen .
the iraqi shiites have absolutely no interest in openly engaging the occupation forces , especially when they hold a majority of power in the iraqi government already .
there is no need to fight for something that has already been handed to them by a democratic process .
the only conceivable danger would be a confrontation between the united states and iran .
tehran could activate allies in iraq to make life very complicated for the americans and where better to ferment unrest than in southern iraq , an area of the country which would have been weakened by a partial british withdrawal ? peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and a middle east expert -lrb- nda -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe says saddam 's execution solves no problems for iraq as european nations criticized the execution of saddam hussein out of opposition to the death penalty , sunday newspapers across the continent were pessimistic as to whether the hanging would solve any of iraq 's problems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 21.02.2007 opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost a quarter of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .
dw 's peter philipp believes blair is playing a dangerous game . despite not being able to influence events in iraq through his actions , british prime minister tony blair can at least use the situation there for his own domestic purposes .
news that blair intends to withdraw almost a quarter of the british occupation force in iraq - 1,600 of some 7,000 soldiers stationed there - can not be seen in any other light .
it is no coincidence that public opinion back in the uk is in favor of a withdrawal , while the fact that blair has already announced his resignation means he may not be around to face the consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair finds himself in a very difficult position .
up until now , the prime minister was the united states ' most dependable ally in iraq but now he appears to be jumping ship just at the moment when president george w. bush is looking to strengthen the troop deployment in the country .
blair could face the wrath of a president betrayed .
while there is certainly a difference between the operations of the us forces in their crackdown on insurgents and criminal gangs in baghdad and the british occupation of the relatively less volatile southern city of basra , a withdrawal of the british contingent at a time when more not fewer troops is the message from washington is certainly a risk .
one way in which blair could avoid the rapprochement of the americans while scoring a domestic success would be to declare " mission accomplished . "
however , washington will know better than most how successful the british contribution to security in iraq has been while the british public would be unlikely to suddenly view the iraq adventure in a better light just because the troops are now coming home .
at best , blair will be seen in the uk as trying to rectify what is seen as the biggest mistake of his premiership and as trying to shake off the shackles of us loyalty before he departs the political arena .
it is unlikely that much will be changed in iraq 's situation by the british departure .
the main fear is that the shiite majority in the south will rise up against the occupying forces and that the united states , with enough on their plate in baghdad and the rest of the country , will then be over-stretched .
this would surely end blair 's dream of being inducted in the us hall of fame for honorable allies .
however there is little to suggest that any such uprising would happen .
the iraqi shiites have absolutely no interest in openly engaging the occupation forces , especially when they hold a majority of power in the iraqi government already .
there is no need to fight for something that has already been handed to them by a democratic process .
the only conceivable danger would be a confrontation between the united states and iran .
tehran could activate allies in iraq to make life very complicated for the americans and where better to ferment unrest than in southern iraq , an area of the country which would have been weakened by a partial british withdrawal ? peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and a middle east expert -lrb- nda -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe says saddam 's execution solves no problems for iraq as european nations criticized the execution of saddam hussein out of opposition to the death penalty , sunday newspapers across the continent were pessimistic as to whether the hanging would solve any of iraq 's problems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de peacekeeping -pipe- 21.02.2007 britain , denmark to pull out troops from iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has over 7,000 soldiers in iraq britain , along with denmark , confirmed it would begin a major troop withdrawal from iraq in coming months and lithuania too has indicated it may follow suit .
washington however denies its coalition is crumbling . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday the british force in southern iraq would drop from 7,100 to 5,500 in coming months and could fall below 5,000 this year . blair , who has seen his popularity erode at home over his decision to go to war , said that soldiers however would remain into 2008 to provide support and training if iraq wanted . following britain 's lead , denmark and lithuania said they would withdraw most of their troops by august . denmark said its 430 ground troops would leave by august this year .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said the decision to withdraw troops was " taken together with our coalition allies , namely britain . " lithuanian defence minister juozas olekas told the baltic news service -lrb- bns -rrb- agency it was a " realistic possibility " that lithuania would not replace its 50 troops when their mission in iraq ends in august . the lithuanians are serving with a danish battalion near the southern city of basra , within the british-led multinational division .
like fellow baltic states latvia and estonia , lithuania joined nato in 2004 , and has been a staunch supporter of the united states in iraq . a string of other countries which sent troops either from the outset or later have already withdrawn from iraq , and others are planning to do so in the coming months . south korea and poland , with the largest contingents after the us and britain , have said they will leave by the end of the year . " next chapter can be written by iraqis " britain 's move was particularly important for washington as it is the second largest part of the us-led force in iraq after the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair said the peacekeeping reins had to be gradually handed over to the iraqis blair has faced huge domestic pressure over the unpopular war but he would not give a timetable for a complete british withdrawal . " the uk military presence will continue into 2008 for as long as we are wanted and have a job to do , " the prime minister told the british parliament on wednesday . british , danish and other multinational troops have been concentrated around the southern city of basra , which blair said remains " dangerous " but had improved enough for security to be handed over to iraqi forces . " what all this means is not that basra is how we want it to be , but it does mean that the next chapter in basra 's history can be written by iraqis , " blair said .
" increasingly our role will be supporting training and our numbers will be able to reduce accordingly , " he said . blair said british forces that remain would train iraqi troops , secure the iraq-iran border and supply routes and boost the ability of iraqi forces to conduct operations against extremist groups . blair 's unwavering support for president george w. bush over the us-led invasion in march 2003 has undermined his support at home .
britain put 40,000 troops into the invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six danish soldiers have been killed since 2003 in the violence in iraq in denmark , the government has been under increasing pressure to withdraw from iraq , and in january rasmussen voiced hopes that troop numbers could be reduced during 2007 .
six danish soldiers have been killed in iraq since 2003 . a poll published in early february showed that 64 percent of danes were " opposed " or " vehemently opposed " to the troop presence . meanwhile , bulgaria 's parliament voted on wednesday to extend the presence of the 155 bulgarian troops in iraq by a year . us denies coalition is crumbling britain 's announcement threw the spotlight on the us strategy in iraq , which has heightened bush 's unpopularity with the us public . us secretary of state condoleezza rice denied that the us-led coalition was crumbling . " the coalition remains intact and in fact the british still have thousands of soldiers deployed in iraq , in the south , " rice said in berlin .
she said the british pullout was part of the coalition strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said in berlin wednesday that the us-led coalition was not crumbling " it is the plan that as it is possible to transfer responsibilities to the iraqis , coalition forces would no longer be needed in those circumstances . " blair telephoned the us president on tuesday to warn him of the announcement , the white house said . " president bush sees this as a sign of success and what is possible for us once we help the iraqis deal with the sectarian violence in baghdad , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe . vice president dick cheney said the british drawdown was justified given the situation in basra , but stressed there could be no retreat from iraq . " i want you to know that the american people will not support a policy of retreat , " cheney said on the uss kitty hawk aircraft carrier while on a trip to japan .
" we want to complete the mission , we want to get it done right , and we want to return with honor , " he said . australian prime minister john howard , another strong backer of the us-led invasion , said he would not reduce australia 's 550 combat troops in iraq , part of a 1,400-strong force in the country . the united states has about 138,000 troops in iraq and has started sending another 21,500 to baghdad and surrounding provinces where the insurgency and sectarian violence has worsened in recent months . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost half of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .

the statistics office uses the " body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- " to determine what being fat means .

in the first leg real won 3-2 at home , but bayern hope things will be different in munich . the first leg two weeks ago was a bit like a battle between bruce springsteen and prince : the bavarians who used to be boss against the artists formerly known as the galacticos .
languishing in fourth place in their respective national leagues , both bayern and real were looking to restore some pride in tuesday 's match at bernabeu .
and both teams got some of what they wanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern had trouble coping with real 's pace real showed they meant business from the opening whistle and had their home fans cheering in the 10th minute , when raul muscled his way past a furiously sliding bayern keeper oliver kahn in the box .
the veteran striker slotted home to put the hosts up 1-0 . munich had trouble putting together combinations , but thanks to a set piece they got the equalizer thirteen minutes later .
bayern oldie-but-goodie willy sagnol blasted a free kick from around 40 meters out , and defender lucio headed beyond reach real keeper iker casillas . last hurrahs before hollywood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham is a no-go in munich after getting injured the rest of the first half was all madrid .
surprisingly the main motor of their impressive run was much-maligned midfielder david beckham , who is headed for los angeles in the summer and who had recently been left out of the squad . beckham was clearly out to prove he 's not washed up .
in the 28th minute , he fired a corner across the mouth of the goal .
defender ivan helguera headed the ball into the upper right corner , brushing raul 's hair in the process .
real were back in the lead . six minutes later , beckham pushed the ball forward , where it eventually found a criminally unmarked ruud van nistelrooy .
the dutchman fired home from five meters to give madrid a 3-1 advantage . real 's first half showed a return to the fluid attacking style that gained them the champions league title in 2002 .
meanwhile bayern were plagued by the midfield sluggishness and defensive lapses that have characterized their mediocre season . a familiar face comes up big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thanks to kahn , bayern avoided disaster the match could have turned into a debacle for munich in the second half , were it not for a sterling play by their 37-year-old keeper .
beckham curled a lethal-looking free kick toward the upper-left-hand corner of goal , but kahn acrobatically parried it to keep the visitors in the game . after that , real curiously chose to pack it in at the back - never a madrid strong point even in the club 's best years . for half an hour , it looked as though real might be able to hold their two-goal advantage .
bayern 's lack of true playmaker was all too apparent as they seldom created open shots on goal . but in 79th minute , substitute bayern striker claudio pizarro was narrowly denied by casillas from 10 meters .
two minutes from time , midfielder mark van bommel drop-kicked a short real clearance into the back of the net for the final 3-2 scoreline . glass half-full or half-empty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel flexed his muscles late in the match the result was a bit of balsam for the wounded pride of these two former titans .
speaking after the match , kahn said " this is one of those losses that feels like a victory . " indeed , both sides played to a higher standard than their critics thought them capable of , treating fans to one of the better matches of this champions league season . but the game also showed that bayern - despite van bommel 's late goal - still need a creative director in midfield .
and real 's late weakness suggested that the squad is perhaps too old to pile on pressure over 90 minutes .
plus , beckham is out with injury for the return match . that sets the stage for a tough battle when the two teams play their return leg in munich on march 7 .
a 1-0 win for bayern would be enough to send them through to the tournament 's next round and force real to question why they failed to seal this encounter when they had the chance . whichever team comes up short in munich will be in for some harsh scrutiny from media and fans .
real and bayern are accustomed to silverware .

nine eu countries currently have a registration fee or motor vehicle tax contingent on co2 emissions , according to the association of european car-makers . austria , the netherlands and portugal reward owners of environmentally friendly cars with sliding registration fees .
in denmark , sweden and great britain , the vehicle tax is determined by the level of co2 emissions . car-owners with low-emission vehicles are given break on both the one-time registration fee and the annual vehicle tax in belgium , france and cyprus . in great britain , owners of vehicles that emit less that 100 grams of co2 per kilometer pay no tax at all , whereas the annual rate for diesel vehicles emitting more than 225 grams per kilometer is a hefty 320 euros -lrb- $ 421 -rrb- .
france has a similar system for company cars . in sweden , drivers pay 1.62 euros for every gram of co2 over 100 grams per kilometer that their vehicle emits . reaping the benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the us be the next to reward drivers for choosing planet-friendly vehicles ?
" changing the tax in england has already had an effect on which new cars people buy , " said uwe kunert , transportation expert from the german institute for economic research .
sweden is experiencing the same effect . in the netherlands , tax revenues fell so dramatically that the government had to alter the tax reforms .
kunert is cautious not to count any chickens before they hatch , however . " it 's still difficult for most countries , " he said .
" there 's has n't been any overwhelming successes yet . " the price tag on the planet in germany , the success of reforms will depend on the affordability of environmentally friendly motors . low-emission models like volkswagen three-liter lupo disappeared from the market because they were too expensive - but also because not enough advertising was done .
instead , german carmakers tend to advertise the massive gas-guzzlers , many of which are produced domestically . as far as environmentally-friendly automobiles are concerned , the foreign competition is leagues ahead of the german carmakers .
according to the german association for environmental and natural protection -lrb- bund -rrb- , german auto producers will have to reduce co2 emissions by seven grams to fulfill the eu requirements by 2012 , french producers by only three grams . torsten schäfer -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu backs plans for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions eu environment ministers gave unanimous support to plans for cuts in greenhouse gases of as much as 20 percent by 2020 from 1990 levels .

but critics say germany is n't doing enough to promote linguistic diversity and multilingual education . the integration debate in germany has included a strong focus on immigrant children 's language skills .
both politicians and educators agree that it 's especially important to speak the language of the country you live in - and speak it well in order to get a good education and find a job . in germany , though , children from immigrant families often have problems at school .
their german just is n't good enough .
as a result , some german states are giving fewer lessons in these kids ' native tongues - a move not all teachers and linguists agree with . ruprecht baur , professor for german as a foreign language at duisburg-essen university , said several questions always come up in discussions on integration .
does the fact that a child comes from an immigrant family and speaks a different language prevent him or her from learning german and doing well at school ?
should the parents speak german at home , and avoid their native tongue ?
and is being exposed to two languages the reason some children here , notably with an italian or turkish background , fail in school ? according to baur , these questions arise despite multilingualism being the rule almost everywhere in the world . " international studies show that the mother tongue is no distraction , " baur said .
" the majority of people all over the world speak several languages .
they 're born with a mother language , and often know two more . " germany lacking interest in linguistic heritage the european union has repeatedly stressed the importance and its support of linguistic pluralism .
eu guidelines even commit member states to promote language classes in the children 's mother tongues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some turkish children perfect their mother tongue in germany that 's the case in germany as well - in theory .
in practice , north rhine-westphalia for example has cut back on native language teaching positions .
neighboring hesse has discontinued these classes altogether . the western german states reasoned that learning german at an early age was more important .
but vassilios fthenakis , professor for development psychology at italy 's bozen university , is critical of germany 's educational policies . " it 's an ongoing german problem : not taking a serious interest in the importance of a child 's mother language and culture , but pushing forward integration that is n't working , " fthenakis said .
" it 's a fundamental problem that germany does n't first strengthen a child 's mother language and culture , and then push learning german from that point on . " immigrant parents should n't speak german at home cultural and linguistic diversity is a richness that should be used for the individual and collective learning experience , the greek-born fthenakis said .
germany though did n't have policies like sweden , england or france do .
he said german guidelines could only be called disoriented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some grade schools offer language training for immigrant children according to fthenakis , the role that the family and their educational level play should not be underestimated .
young students will quickly learn german if they can speak and write in their mother language , fthenakis said . he said he is convinced that the language learning process should start before kids enter the school system .
in germany , that would be before the age of six .
every child is open to any language in the world before its first birthday - learning a second language is no problem at all , fthenakis said . critics of the multilingual approach said immigrant parents should speak german with their children at home .
but this was counterproductive , said duisburg-essen university 's baur . " if the parents do n't speak german well , they should n't speak it with their children , " baur said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 21.02.2007 opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost a quarter of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .
dw 's peter philipp believes blair is playing a dangerous game . despite not being able to influence events in iraq through his actions , british prime minister tony blair can at least use the situation there for his own domestic purposes .
news that blair intends to withdraw almost a quarter of the british occupation force in iraq - 1,600 of some 7,000 soldiers stationed there - can not be seen in any other light .
it is no coincidence that public opinion back in the uk is in favor of a withdrawal , while the fact that blair has already announced his resignation means he may not be around to face the consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair finds himself in a very difficult position .
up until now , the prime minister was the united states ' most dependable ally in iraq but now he appears to be jumping ship just at the moment when president george w. bush is looking to strengthen the troop deployment in the country .
blair could face the wrath of a president betrayed .
while there is certainly a difference between the operations of the us forces in their crackdown on insurgents and criminal gangs in baghdad and the british occupation of the relatively less volatile southern city of basra , a withdrawal of the british contingent at a time when more not fewer troops is the message from washington is certainly a risk .
one way in which blair could avoid the rapprochement of the americans while scoring a domestic success would be to declare " mission accomplished . "
however , washington will know better than most how successful the british contribution to security in iraq has been while the british public would be unlikely to suddenly view the iraq adventure in a better light just because the troops are now coming home .
at best , blair will be seen in the uk as trying to rectify what is seen as the biggest mistake of his premiership and as trying to shake off the shackles of us loyalty before he departs the political arena .
it is unlikely that much will be changed in iraq 's situation by the british departure .
the main fear is that the shiite majority in the south will rise up against the occupying forces and that the united states , with enough on their plate in baghdad and the rest of the country , will then be over-stretched .
this would surely end blair 's dream of being inducted in the us hall of fame for honorable allies .
however there is little to suggest that any such uprising would happen .
the iraqi shiites have absolutely no interest in openly engaging the occupation forces , especially when they hold a majority of power in the iraqi government already .
there is no need to fight for something that has already been handed to them by a democratic process .
the only conceivable danger would be a confrontation between the united states and iran .
tehran could activate allies in iraq to make life very complicated for the americans and where better to ferment unrest than in southern iraq , an area of the country which would have been weakened by a partial british withdrawal ? peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and a middle east expert -lrb- nda -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe says saddam 's execution solves no problems for iraq as european nations criticized the execution of saddam hussein out of opposition to the death penalty , sunday newspapers across the continent were pessimistic as to whether the hanging would solve any of iraq 's problems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 21.02.2007 opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost a quarter of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .
dw 's peter philipp believes blair is playing a dangerous game . despite not being able to influence events in iraq through his actions , british prime minister tony blair can at least use the situation there for his own domestic purposes .
news that blair intends to withdraw almost a quarter of the british occupation force in iraq - 1,600 of some 7,000 soldiers stationed there - can not be seen in any other light .
it is no coincidence that public opinion back in the uk is in favor of a withdrawal , while the fact that blair has already announced his resignation means he may not be around to face the consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair finds himself in a very difficult position .
up until now , the prime minister was the united states ' most dependable ally in iraq but now he appears to be jumping ship just at the moment when president george w. bush is looking to strengthen the troop deployment in the country .
blair could face the wrath of a president betrayed .
while there is certainly a difference between the operations of the us forces in their crackdown on insurgents and criminal gangs in baghdad and the british occupation of the relatively less volatile southern city of basra , a withdrawal of the british contingent at a time when more not fewer troops is the message from washington is certainly a risk .
one way in which blair could avoid the rapprochement of the americans while scoring a domestic success would be to declare " mission accomplished . "
however , washington will know better than most how successful the british contribution to security in iraq has been while the british public would be unlikely to suddenly view the iraq adventure in a better light just because the troops are now coming home .
at best , blair will be seen in the uk as trying to rectify what is seen as the biggest mistake of his premiership and as trying to shake off the shackles of us loyalty before he departs the political arena .
it is unlikely that much will be changed in iraq 's situation by the british departure .
the main fear is that the shiite majority in the south will rise up against the occupying forces and that the united states , with enough on their plate in baghdad and the rest of the country , will then be over-stretched .
this would surely end blair 's dream of being inducted in the us hall of fame for honorable allies .
however there is little to suggest that any such uprising would happen .
the iraqi shiites have absolutely no interest in openly engaging the occupation forces , especially when they hold a majority of power in the iraqi government already .
there is no need to fight for something that has already been handed to them by a democratic process .
the only conceivable danger would be a confrontation between the united states and iran .
tehran could activate allies in iraq to make life very complicated for the americans and where better to ferment unrest than in southern iraq , an area of the country which would have been weakened by a partial british withdrawal ? peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent and a middle east expert -lrb- nda -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe says saddam 's execution solves no problems for iraq as european nations criticized the execution of saddam hussein out of opposition to the death penalty , sunday newspapers across the continent were pessimistic as to whether the hanging would solve any of iraq 's problems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 21.02.2007 eu slaps record near billion-euro fine on lift cartel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's back to the ground floor for the companies involved in the lift cartel eu competition regulators imposed their biggest fine ever on wednesday , hitting lift makers otis , schindler , thyssenkrupp and kone with a penalty of nearly a billion euros for running an illegal cartel . the european commission accused the companies of operating a cartel for the installation and maintenance of lifts and escalators in belgium , germany , luxembourg and the netherlands between at least 1995 and 2004 . the european union 's antitrust watchdog said it was fining them a combined 992 million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- for rigging bids for procurement contracts , fixing prices , sharing out projects , carving up markets and exchanging sensitive information . the total fine also included a 1.8-million-euro penalty against japanese company mitsubishi for a role in the cartel limited to the netherlands . " it is outrageous that the construction and maintenance costs of buildings , including hospitals , have been artificially bloated by these cartels , " competition commissioner neelie kroes said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neelie kroes says the damage caused by the cartel will last for many years " the national management of these companies knew what they were doing was wrong , but they tried to conceal their action and went ahead anyway , " she said .
" the damage caused by this cartel will last for many years because it covered not only the initial supply but also the subsequent maintenance of lifts and elevators - for these companies the memory of this fine should last just as long , " she added . german firm gets stiffest fine german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the heaviest fine ever imposed by eu regulators on a single company in a cartel case because it was a repeated offender .
the german group was fined 480 million euros . otis , a unit of us conglomerate united technologies corporation , was given a fine of 225 million euros for its role , followed by schindler with a penalty of 144 million euros and kone with 142 million euros . eu antitrust investigators conducted so-called " dawn raids " on lift and escalator makers across europe in january 2004 after getting a tip off about the cartel .
after the raids , the companies handed over more evidence in the hope of winning leniency or reduced fines . the european commission said that high-ranking national-level management ran the cartel by holding secret meetings in bars and restaurants .
they also visited the countryside and traveled abroad and used pre-paid mobile phone cards to avoid regulators ' scrutiny . eu campaign against illegal cartels kroes , europe 's top antitrust regulator , is leading a campaign against illegal cartels and has been chalking up record fines against companies targeted by her crackdown . after bumper fines in 2006 , eu regulators in january ordered 10 companies to pay 750 million euros for fixing prices and carving up the market in electrical generation equipment .
after the lift makers case , that fine is now the third biggest ever against a cartel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german steelmaker thyssenkrupp was handed the stiffest penalty until wednesday , the biggest fine in a european cartel case was 855 million euros in penalties imposed on eight vitamin makers in 2001 .
the vitamin makers ' fine was later reduced to 790 million euros by an eu court . despite the record fine on the lift makers , higher penalties are likely in future cases after the commission tightened its rules for calculating fines , making them heavier for repeat offenders and long-lasting cartels .
the reform could potentially cost guilty companies up to 10 times more than before . the commission was also given a boost in its anti-cartel campaign earlier this month with a ruling from the european court of justice that gave regulators more freedom to fix fines , especially how far back regulators can take previous offences into account . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission slaps huge fine on siemens for price fixing the eu has fined power equipment manufacturers for their roles in a price-fixing scheme .

editorialists warned that national interests were overriding economic priorities at the airplane maker . airbus parent eads must proceed with restructuring its subsidiary , the financial times commented .
" a house divided against itself can not stand , " the london-based business daily wrote in its wednesday edition .
" the past days have shown how the group 's dysfunctional structure hampers its effectiveness .
so long as the group is run in the interests of franco-german balance instead of purely commercially , then its performance will continue to suffer - to the detriment of shareholders and staff alike . " zurich 's tages-anzeiger remarked that the franco-german dispute about who will carry the brunt of airbus ' restructuring is hurting the company 's competitiveness .
" economic criteria are on the verge of going under on account of regional-political considerations , selfishness and petty jealousies , " the swiss paper noted .
" but time is too short for pointing the finger .
if airbus does n't want to lose more ground against its archrival boeing , a decision has to be taken soon . " the french daily le monde struck similar tones that the company should change its structure if it wants to succeed .
" the power 8 restructuring plan is very painful , with cutbacks of over 10,000 jobs , but it is essential , " the paris paper wrote .
" airbus is in danger of going under due to an anachronistic national battle .
if the company wants to continue playing in the same category as boeing , it must change its industrial model and give up the german-french double leadership , which shows today how much it disables things .
germany has a right to a normal share , but berlin has to realize that airbus above all has to be freed from nationalism . " the nordwest-zeitung in oldenburg observed that the one-time model group for pan-european cooperation eads with its subsidiary airbus had emerged as a battleground of national interests .
" practically every hour , authoritative sources and lesser sources are speaking out , " the german daily wrote .
" the seal of quality is still undamaged , just the masquerade of a german-french partnership which functions over all hierarchical steps has fallen .
the influence from paris has been too massive for years - and more recently also from berlin - to let the management act according to economic considerations alone . " the political components are much more dangerous to airbus than economic factors , remarked the fuldaer zeitung .
" the french appear to follow a tough position not least because of the upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections , clearly at the expense of german sites , " the paper commented .
" chancellor angela merkel is therefore well advised to give top priority to the cutbacks of 10,000 jobs in question and defend vested german interests against its neighboring country 's greediness .

however , the fat lads from the fatherland would have to move fast to secure a date as competition for the super-size lovers from the island would be fierce .
the new report shows that 66.8 percent of men in germany are overweight , with 18.8 percent of those hitting levels of obesity .
that 's almost twice as many as their prospective partners in the uk .
the eurostat figures show that 33.6 percent of english women are fat .
eu women keeping trim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in the eu are statistically slimmer than men from the data , it seems that european women on the whole look after themselves a lot better than the men .
" in all member states , the percentage of overweight men was higher than that of overweight women , " the report states .
the statistics office uses the " body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- " to determine what being fat means .
bmi is defined as the individual 's body weight divided by the square of their height .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de peacekeeping -pipe- 21.02.2007 britain , denmark to pull out troops from iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain has over 7,000 soldiers in iraq britain , along with denmark , confirmed it would begin a major troop withdrawal from iraq in coming months and lithuania too has indicated it may follow suit .
washington however denies its coalition is crumbling . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday the british force in southern iraq would drop from 7,100 to 5,500 in coming months and could fall below 5,000 this year . blair , who has seen his popularity erode at home over his decision to go to war , said that soldiers however would remain into 2008 to provide support and training if iraq wanted . following britain 's lead , denmark and lithuania said they would withdraw most of their troops by august . denmark said its 430 ground troops would leave by august this year .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said the decision to withdraw troops was " taken together with our coalition allies , namely britain . " lithuanian defence minister juozas olekas told the baltic news service -lrb- bns -rrb- agency it was a " realistic possibility " that lithuania would not replace its 50 troops when their mission in iraq ends in august . the lithuanians are serving with a danish battalion near the southern city of basra , within the british-led multinational division .
like fellow baltic states latvia and estonia , lithuania joined nato in 2004 , and has been a staunch supporter of the united states in iraq . a string of other countries which sent troops either from the outset or later have already withdrawn from iraq , and others are planning to do so in the coming months . south korea and poland , with the largest contingents after the us and britain , have said they will leave by the end of the year . " next chapter can be written by iraqis " britain 's move was particularly important for washington as it is the second largest part of the us-led force in iraq after the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair said the peacekeeping reins had to be gradually handed over to the iraqis blair has faced huge domestic pressure over the unpopular war but he would not give a timetable for a complete british withdrawal . " the uk military presence will continue into 2008 for as long as we are wanted and have a job to do , " the prime minister told the british parliament on wednesday . british , danish and other multinational troops have been concentrated around the southern city of basra , which blair said remains " dangerous " but had improved enough for security to be handed over to iraqi forces . " what all this means is not that basra is how we want it to be , but it does mean that the next chapter in basra 's history can be written by iraqis , " blair said .
" increasingly our role will be supporting training and our numbers will be able to reduce accordingly , " he said . blair said british forces that remain would train iraqi troops , secure the iraq-iran border and supply routes and boost the ability of iraqi forces to conduct operations against extremist groups . blair 's unwavering support for president george w. bush over the us-led invasion in march 2003 has undermined his support at home .
britain put 40,000 troops into the invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six danish soldiers have been killed since 2003 in the violence in iraq in denmark , the government has been under increasing pressure to withdraw from iraq , and in january rasmussen voiced hopes that troop numbers could be reduced during 2007 .
six danish soldiers have been killed in iraq since 2003 . a poll published in early february showed that 64 percent of danes were " opposed " or " vehemently opposed " to the troop presence . meanwhile , bulgaria 's parliament voted on wednesday to extend the presence of the 155 bulgarian troops in iraq by a year . us denies coalition is crumbling britain 's announcement threw the spotlight on the us strategy in iraq , which has heightened bush 's unpopularity with the us public . us secretary of state condoleezza rice denied that the us-led coalition was crumbling . " the coalition remains intact and in fact the british still have thousands of soldiers deployed in iraq , in the south , " rice said in berlin .
she said the british pullout was part of the coalition strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said in berlin wednesday that the us-led coalition was not crumbling " it is the plan that as it is possible to transfer responsibilities to the iraqis , coalition forces would no longer be needed in those circumstances . " blair telephoned the us president on tuesday to warn him of the announcement , the white house said . " president bush sees this as a sign of success and what is possible for us once we help the iraqis deal with the sectarian violence in baghdad , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe . vice president dick cheney said the british drawdown was justified given the situation in basra , but stressed there could be no retreat from iraq . " i want you to know that the american people will not support a policy of retreat , " cheney said on the uss kitty hawk aircraft carrier while on a trip to japan .
" we want to complete the mission , we want to get it done right , and we want to return with honor , " he said . australian prime minister john howard , another strong backer of the us-led invasion , said he would not reduce australia 's 550 combat troops in iraq , part of a 1,400-strong force in the country . the united states has about 138,000 troops in iraq and has started sending another 21,500 to baghdad and surrounding provinces where the insurgency and sectarian violence has worsened in recent months . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost half of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .

" those are not principles put there to be an obstacle , they are put there because they 're foundational for peace , " she said .

" … blair will hardly be able to improve his image in history books , " the paper wrote .
" he said himself that he had wanted to lead great britain into the euro zone , into the heart of europe , but what he 's ended up doing is turning the united kingdom into an aircraft carrier for the united states , " the paper wrote .

" democracies sometimes need a long time for their self-purification processes , but it 's amazing to see that the democratic process works in the end .

the paper said the us ' most loyal allies were following on the heels of the tens of thousands of iraqis who have fled their country .
" and that during a time when the us is trying to make one last attempt to turn the tide . " braunschweiger zeitung said withdrawing troops from iraq is the right thing to do .
the west has lost .

editorialists warned that national interests were overriding economic priorities at the airplane maker . airbus parent eads must proceed with restructuring its subsidiary , the financial times commented .
" a house divided against itself can not stand , " the london-based business daily wrote in its wednesday edition .
" the past days have shown how the group 's dysfunctional structure hampers its effectiveness .
so long as the group is run in the interests of franco-german balance instead of purely commercially , then its performance will continue to suffer - to the detriment of shareholders and staff alike . " zurich 's tages-anzeiger remarked that the franco-german dispute about who will carry the brunt of airbus ' restructuring is hurting the company 's competitiveness .
" economic criteria are on the verge of going under on account of regional-political considerations , selfishness and petty jealousies , " the swiss paper noted .
" but time is too short for pointing the finger .
if airbus does n't want to lose more ground against its archrival boeing , a decision has to be taken soon . " the french daily le monde struck similar tones that the company should change its structure if it wants to succeed .
" the power 8 restructuring plan is very painful , with cutbacks of over 10,000 jobs , but it is essential , " the paris paper wrote .
" airbus is in danger of going under due to an anachronistic national battle .
if the company wants to continue playing in the same category as boeing , it must change its industrial model and give up the german-french double leadership , which shows today how much it disables things .
germany has a right to a normal share , but berlin has to realize that airbus above all has to be freed from nationalism . " the nordwest-zeitung in oldenburg observed that the one-time model group for pan-european cooperation eads with its subsidiary airbus had emerged as a battleground of national interests .
" practically every hour , authoritative sources and lesser sources are speaking out , " the german daily wrote .
" the seal of quality is still undamaged , just the masquerade of a german-french partnership which functions over all hierarchical steps has fallen .
the influence from paris has been too massive for years - and more recently also from berlin - to let the management act according to economic considerations alone . " the political components are much more dangerous to airbus than economic factors , remarked the fuldaer zeitung .
" the french appear to follow a tough position not least because of the upcoming presidential and parliamentary elections , clearly at the expense of german sites , " the paper commented .
" chancellor angela merkel is therefore well advised to give top priority to the cutbacks of 10,000 jobs in question and defend vested german interests against its neighboring country 's greediness .
on top of everything , the fact that france wants to pull a fast one on germany does n't exactly strengthen the political side 's negotiating power vis-à-vis private investors . " dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus crisis deepens as france , germany fight over job cuts troubled european airplane maker airbus faced worsening problems tuesday as germany and france , who jointly control the company , wrangled over the distribution of thousands of job cuts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 21.02.2007 eu anti-terrorism chief urges us to change tactics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuses such as those at abu ghraib have undermined the west 's fight against terror the us needs to re-embrace basic human rights , abandon tactics such as rendition and rebuild trust with the islamic world if the west 's war against terrorism is to be successful , says the eu 's anti-terrorism coordinator . the european union 's anti-terrorism coordinator , gijs de vries , has criticized us tactics in the war in terror , saying that victory can only be achieved through a return to " mainstream " human rights norms and the abandonment of policies such as special rendition .
de vries said that the abduction of terror suspects to third-party countries where torture is used in interrogation , the holding of so-called " enemy combatants " without trial at the prison camp in the us naval base in guantanamo , cuba and the widely-publicized abuse of prisoners at abu ghraib prison in iraq had all undermined the fight against islamist extremism .
image tarnished by scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gijs de vries hopes for a us return to human rights norms " the cia renditions , together with abu ghraib , guantanamo bay , and the military commissions act , unfortunately have tarnished the image of the united states in the fight against terrorism , among muslims and non-muslims , " de vries told reuters news service .
" i hope the united states , now that there is a new political dynamic in the us congress , can return to a mainstream interpretation of international human rights . "
the issue of rendition has added resonance in europe after the european parliament announced last week that a number of eu governments - including italy and germany - knew about the secret cia flights transporting suspects through europe but chose to look the other way .
de vries , the man charged with overseeing and coordinating the eu 's fight against terror , was himself strongly criticized by the european parliament for not providing answers on the allegations of complicity by eu governments in cia rendition .
national responsibility for secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu states are accused of turning a blind eye to cia flights however , de vries responded by saying that there had been no hard evidence to substantiate the accusations made against the eu countries by european lawmakers and that judgment should be reserved until the authorities in member states had carried out and completed their own investigations into the allegations of collusion .
he insisted that secret intelligence services remained under national control and that neither the eu as a whole nor he as anti-terrorism coordinator had much power to change that .
de vries told the european parliament that member states should exercise more parliamentary control on the activities of their secret services .
rebuild trust , work for peace de vries , who steps in march after three years in the job , said that a change in approach by the us and the eu to regain trust from the islamic world was essential in the battle of ideas with radical islamists . " ultimately that 's the long-term approach we need , " he said , adding that a concerted effort to bring peace to the middle east would also help .
until these objectives can be achieved , de fries said , the terrorism threat in the eu would remain at its current high level and would remain so for a number of years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does not rule out another attack on madrid 's scale " we can not exclude that attacks on the scale of london or madrid could be repeated .
meanwhile we see that other types of threats are also materializing , " he said , referring to a recent alleged plot to kidnap and behead a british muslim soldier in the uk .
de vries calls for eu streamlining he also called for a streamlining of decision-making on cooperation against terrorism and organized crime within the eu and for the introduction of majority votes instead of insisting on unanimity among all 27 countries .
" unanimous decisions simply take too long , " he said , blaming them for the eu 's failure to coordinate cross border operations between national police forces when tracking international criminals .
de fries became the european union 's first anti-terrorism coordinator just days after the bomb attacks in madrid in march 2004 , which killed 191 people . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia agents to stand trial for kidnapping in italy an italian judge ordered 26 americans , most of them thought to be cia agents , and the former head of italy 's military intelligence to stand trial over the 2003 kidnapping of an egyptian imam .

washington however denies its coalition is crumbling . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday the british force in southern iraq would drop from 7,100 to 5,500 in coming months and could fall below 5,000 this year . blair , who has seen his popularity erode at home over his decision to go to war , said that soldiers however would remain into 2008 to provide support and training if iraq wanted . following britain 's lead , denmark and lithuania said they would withdraw most of their troops by august . denmark said its 430 ground troops would leave by august this year .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said the decision to withdraw troops was " taken together with our coalition allies , namely britain . " lithuanian defence minister juozas olekas told the baltic news service -lrb- bns -rrb- agency it was a " realistic possibility " that lithuania would not replace its 50 troops when their mission in iraq ends in august . the lithuanians are serving with a danish battalion near the southern city of basra , within the british-led multinational division .
like fellow baltic states latvia and estonia , lithuania joined nato in 2004 , and has been a staunch supporter of the united states in iraq . a string of other countries which sent troops either from the outset or later have already withdrawn from iraq , and others are planning to do so in the coming months . south korea and poland , with the largest contingents after the us and britain , have said they will leave by the end of the year . " next chapter can be written by iraqis " britain 's move was particularly important for washington as it is the second largest part of the us-led force in iraq after the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair said the peacekeeping reins had to be gradually handed over to the iraqis blair has faced huge domestic pressure over the unpopular war but he would not give a timetable for a complete british withdrawal . " the uk military presence will continue into 2008 for as long as we are wanted and have a job to do , " the prime minister told the british parliament on wednesday . british , danish and other multinational troops have been concentrated around the southern city of basra , which blair said remains " dangerous " but had improved enough for security to be handed over to iraqi forces . " what all this means is not that basra is how we want it to be , but it does mean that the next chapter in basra 's history can be written by iraqis , " blair said .
" increasingly our role will be supporting training and our numbers will be able to reduce accordingly , " he said . blair said british forces that remain would train iraqi troops , secure the iraq-iran border and supply routes and boost the ability of iraqi forces to conduct operations against extremist groups . blair 's unwavering support for president george w. bush over the us-led invasion in march 2003 has undermined his support at home .
britain put 40,000 troops into the invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six danish soldiers have been killed since 2003 in the violence in iraq in denmark , the government has been under increasing pressure to withdraw from iraq , and in january rasmussen voiced hopes that troop numbers could be reduced during 2007 .
six danish soldiers have been killed in iraq since 2003 . a poll published in early february showed that 64 percent of danes were " opposed " or " vehemently opposed " to the troop presence . meanwhile , bulgaria 's parliament voted on wednesday to extend the presence of the 155 bulgarian troops in iraq by a year . us denies coalition is crumbling britain 's announcement threw the spotlight on the us strategy in iraq , which has heightened bush 's unpopularity with the us public . us secretary of state condoleezza rice denied that the us-led coalition was crumbling . " the coalition remains intact and in fact the british still have thousands of soldiers deployed in iraq , in the south , " rice said in berlin .
she said the british pullout was part of the coalition strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said in berlin wednesday that the us-led coalition was not crumbling " it is the plan that as it is possible to transfer responsibilities to the iraqis , coalition forces would no longer be needed in those circumstances . " blair telephoned the us president on tuesday to warn him of the announcement , the white house said . " president bush sees this as a sign of success and what is possible for us once we help the iraqis deal with the sectarian violence in baghdad , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe . vice president dick cheney said the british drawdown was justified given the situation in basra , but stressed there could be no retreat from iraq . " i want you to know that the american people will not support a policy of retreat , " cheney said on the uss kitty hawk aircraft carrier while on a trip to japan .
" we want to complete the mission , we want to get it done right , and we want to return with honor , " he said . australian prime minister john howard , another strong backer of the us-led invasion , said he would not reduce australia 's 550 combat troops in iraq , part of a 1,400-strong force in the country . the united states has about 138,000 troops in iraq and has started sending another 21,500 to baghdad and surrounding provinces where the insurgency and sectarian violence has worsened in recent months . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost half of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .

washington however denies its coalition is crumbling . british prime minister tony blair said wednesday the british force in southern iraq would drop from 7,100 to 5,500 in coming months and could fall below 5,000 this year . blair , who has seen his popularity erode at home over his decision to go to war , said that soldiers however would remain into 2008 to provide support and training if iraq wanted . following britain 's lead , denmark and lithuania said they would withdraw most of their troops by august . denmark said its 430 ground troops would leave by august this year .
danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen said the decision to withdraw troops was " taken together with our coalition allies , namely britain . " lithuanian defence minister juozas olekas told the baltic news service -lrb- bns -rrb- agency it was a " realistic possibility " that lithuania would not replace its 50 troops when their mission in iraq ends in august . the lithuanians are serving with a danish battalion near the southern city of basra , within the british-led multinational division .
like fellow baltic states latvia and estonia , lithuania joined nato in 2004 , and has been a staunch supporter of the united states in iraq . a string of other countries which sent troops either from the outset or later have already withdrawn from iraq , and others are planning to do so in the coming months . south korea and poland , with the largest contingents after the us and britain , have said they will leave by the end of the year . " next chapter can be written by iraqis " britain 's move was particularly important for washington as it is the second largest part of the us-led force in iraq after the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair said the peacekeeping reins had to be gradually handed over to the iraqis blair has faced huge domestic pressure over the unpopular war but he would not give a timetable for a complete british withdrawal . " the uk military presence will continue into 2008 for as long as we are wanted and have a job to do , " the prime minister told the british parliament on wednesday . british , danish and other multinational troops have been concentrated around the southern city of basra , which blair said remains " dangerous " but had improved enough for security to be handed over to iraqi forces . " what all this means is not that basra is how we want it to be , but it does mean that the next chapter in basra 's history can be written by iraqis , " blair said .
" increasingly our role will be supporting training and our numbers will be able to reduce accordingly , " he said . blair said british forces that remain would train iraqi troops , secure the iraq-iran border and supply routes and boost the ability of iraqi forces to conduct operations against extremist groups . blair 's unwavering support for president george w. bush over the us-led invasion in march 2003 has undermined his support at home .
britain put 40,000 troops into the invasion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six danish soldiers have been killed since 2003 in the violence in iraq in denmark , the government has been under increasing pressure to withdraw from iraq , and in january rasmussen voiced hopes that troop numbers could be reduced during 2007 .
six danish soldiers have been killed in iraq since 2003 . a poll published in early february showed that 64 percent of danes were " opposed " or " vehemently opposed " to the troop presence . meanwhile , bulgaria 's parliament voted on wednesday to extend the presence of the 155 bulgarian troops in iraq by a year . us denies coalition is crumbling britain 's announcement threw the spotlight on the us strategy in iraq , which has heightened bush 's unpopularity with the us public . us secretary of state condoleezza rice denied that the us-led coalition was crumbling . " the coalition remains intact and in fact the british still have thousands of soldiers deployed in iraq , in the south , " rice said in berlin .
she said the british pullout was part of the coalition strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said in berlin wednesday that the us-led coalition was not crumbling " it is the plan that as it is possible to transfer responsibilities to the iraqis , coalition forces would no longer be needed in those circumstances . " blair telephoned the us president on tuesday to warn him of the announcement , the white house said . " president bush sees this as a sign of success and what is possible for us once we help the iraqis deal with the sectarian violence in baghdad , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe . vice president dick cheney said the british drawdown was justified given the situation in basra , but stressed there could be no retreat from iraq . " i want you to know that the american people will not support a policy of retreat , " cheney said on the uss kitty hawk aircraft carrier while on a trip to japan .
" we want to complete the mission , we want to get it done right , and we want to return with honor , " he said . australian prime minister john howard , another strong backer of the us-led invasion , said he would not reduce australia 's 550 combat troops in iraq , part of a 1,400-strong force in the country . the united states has about 138,000 troops in iraq and has started sending another 21,500 to baghdad and surrounding provinces where the insurgency and sectarian violence has worsened in recent months . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost half of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .

" blair telephoned the us president on tuesday to warn him of the announcement , the white house said . " president bush sees this as a sign of success and what is possible for us once we help the iraqis deal with the sectarian violence in baghdad , " said white house spokesman gordon johndroe . vice president dick cheney said the british drawdown was justified given the situation in basra , but stressed there could be no retreat from iraq . " i want you to know that the american people will not support a policy of retreat , " cheney said on the uss kitty hawk aircraft carrier while on a trip to japan .
" we want to complete the mission , we want to get it done right , and we want to return with honor , " he said . australian prime minister john howard , another strong backer of the us-led invasion , said he would not reduce australia 's 550 combat troops in iraq , part of a 1,400-strong force in the country . the united states has about 138,000 troops in iraq and has started sending another 21,500 to baghdad and surrounding provinces where the insurgency and sectarian violence has worsened in recent months . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : blair plays a dangerous game with withdrawal plans british prime minister tony blair announced tuesday that almost half of all british troops in iraq would be brought home by the end of the year .

de vries said that the abduction of terror suspects to third-party countries where torture is used in interrogation , the holding of so-called " enemy combatants " without trial at the prison camp in the us naval base in guantanamo , cuba and the widely-publicized abuse of prisoners at abu ghraib prison in iraq had all undermined the fight against islamist extremism .
image tarnished by scandals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gijs de vries hopes for a us return to human rights norms " the cia renditions , together with abu ghraib , guantanamo bay , and the military commissions act , unfortunately have tarnished the image of the united states in the fight against terrorism , among muslims and non-muslims , " de vries told reuters news service .
" i hope the united states , now that there is a new political dynamic in the us congress , can return to a mainstream interpretation of international human rights . "
the issue of rendition has added resonance in europe after the european parliament announced last week that a number of eu governments - including italy and germany - knew about the secret cia flights transporting suspects through europe but chose to look the other way .
de vries , the man charged with overseeing and coordinating the eu 's fight against terror , was himself strongly criticized by the european parliament for not providing answers on the allegations of complicity by eu governments in cia rendition .
national responsibility for secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu states are accused of turning a blind eye to cia flights however , de vries responded by saying that there had been no hard evidence to substantiate the accusations made against the eu countries by european lawmakers and that judgment should be reserved until the authorities in member states had carried out and completed their own investigations into the allegations of collusion .
he insisted that secret intelligence services remained under national control and that neither the eu as a whole nor he as anti-terrorism coordinator had much power to change that .
de vries told the european parliament that member states should exercise more parliamentary control on the activities of their secret services .
rebuild trust , work for peace de vries , who steps in march after three years in the job , said that a change in approach by the us and the eu to regain trust from the islamic world was essential in the battle of ideas with radical islamists . " ultimately that 's the long-term approach we need , " he said , adding that a concerted effort to bring peace to the middle east would also help .
until these objectives can be achieved , de fries said , the terrorism threat in the eu would remain at its current high level and would remain so for a number of years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu does not rule out another attack on madrid 's scale " we can not exclude that attacks on the scale of london or madrid could be repeated .
meanwhile we see that other types of threats are also materializing , " he said , referring to a recent alleged plot to kidnap and behead a british muslim soldier in the uk .
de vries calls for eu streamlining he also called for a streamlining of decision-making on cooperation against terrorism and organized crime within the eu and for the introduction of majority votes instead of insisting on unanimity among all 27 countries .
" unanimous decisions simply take too long , " he said , blaming them for the eu 's failure to coordinate cross border operations between national police forces when tracking international criminals .
de fries became the european union 's first anti-terrorism coordinator just days after the bomb attacks in madrid in march 2004 , which killed 191 people . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia agents to stand trial for kidnapping in italy an italian judge ordered 26 americans , most of them thought to be cia agents , and the former head of italy 's military intelligence to stand trial over the 2003 kidnapping of an egyptian imam .

in the first leg real won 3-2 at home , but bayern hope things will be different in munich . the first leg two weeks ago was a bit like a battle between bruce springsteen and prince : the bavarians who used to be boss against the artists formerly known as the galacticos .
languishing in fourth place in their respective national leagues , both bayern and real were looking to restore some pride in tuesday 's match at bernabeu .
and both teams got some of what they wanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern had trouble coping with real 's pace real showed they meant business from the opening whistle and had their home fans cheering in the 10th minute , when raul muscled his way past a furiously sliding bayern keeper oliver kahn in the box .
the veteran striker slotted home to put the hosts up 1-0 . munich had trouble putting together combinations , but thanks to a set piece they got the equalizer thirteen minutes later .

surprisingly the main motor of their impressive run was much-maligned midfielder david beckham , who is headed for los angeles in the summer and who had recently been left out of the squad . beckham was clearly out to prove he 's not washed up .
in the 28th minute , he fired a corner across the mouth of the goal .
defender ivan helguera headed the ball into the upper right corner , brushing raul 's hair in the process .
real were back in the lead . six minutes later , beckham pushed the ball forward , where it eventually found a criminally unmarked ruud van nistelrooy .
the dutchman fired home from five meters to give madrid a 3-1 advantage . real 's first half showed a return to the fluid attacking style that gained them the champions league title in 2002 .
meanwhile bayern were plagued by the midfield sluggishness and defensive lapses that have characterized their mediocre season . a familiar face comes up big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thanks to kahn , bayern avoided disaster the match could have turned into a debacle for munich in the second half , were it not for a sterling play by their 37-year-old keeper .
beckham curled a lethal-looking free kick toward the upper-left-hand corner of goal , but kahn acrobatically parried it to keep the visitors in the game . after that , real curiously chose to pack it in at the back - never a madrid strong point even in the club 's best years . for half an hour , it looked as though real might be able to hold their two-goal advantage .
bayern 's lack of true playmaker was all too apparent as they seldom created open shots on goal . but in 79th minute , substitute bayern striker claudio pizarro was narrowly denied by casillas from 10 meters .
two minutes from time , midfielder mark van bommel drop-kicked a short real clearance into the back of the net for the final 3-2 scoreline . glass half-full or half-empty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel flexed his muscles late in the match the result was a bit of balsam for the wounded pride of these two former titans .
speaking after the match , kahn said " this is one of those losses that feels like a victory . " indeed , both sides played to a higher standard than their critics thought them capable of , treating fans to one of the better matches of this champions league season . but the game also showed that bayern - despite van bommel 's late goal - still need a creative director in midfield .
and real 's late weakness suggested that the squad is perhaps too old to pile on pressure over 90 minutes .
plus , beckham is out with injury for the return match . that sets the stage for a tough battle when the two teams play their return leg in munich on march 7 .
a 1-0 win for bayern would be enough to send them through to the tournament 's next round and force real to question why they failed to seal this encounter when they had the chance . whichever team comes up short in munich will be in for some harsh scrutiny from media and fans .

in the first leg real won 3-2 at home , but bayern hope things will be different in munich . the first leg two weeks ago was a bit like a battle between bruce springsteen and prince : the bavarians who used to be boss against the artists formerly known as the galacticos .
languishing in fourth place in their respective national leagues , both bayern and real were looking to restore some pride in tuesday 's match at bernabeu .
and both teams got some of what they wanted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern had trouble coping with real 's pace real showed they meant business from the opening whistle and had their home fans cheering in the 10th minute , when raul muscled his way past a furiously sliding bayern keeper oliver kahn in the box .
the veteran striker slotted home to put the hosts up 1-0 . munich had trouble putting together combinations , but thanks to a set piece they got the equalizer thirteen minutes later .
bayern oldie-but-goodie willy sagnol blasted a free kick from around 40 meters out , and defender lucio headed beyond reach real keeper iker casillas . last hurrahs before hollywood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckham is a no-go in munich after getting injured the rest of the first half was all madrid .
surprisingly the main motor of their impressive run was much-maligned midfielder david beckham , who is headed for los angeles in the summer and who had recently been left out of the squad . beckham was clearly out to prove he 's not washed up .
in the 28th minute , he fired a corner across the mouth of the goal .
defender ivan helguera headed the ball into the upper right corner , brushing raul 's hair in the process .
real were back in the lead . six minutes later , beckham pushed the ball forward , where it eventually found a criminally unmarked ruud van nistelrooy .
the dutchman fired home from five meters to give madrid a 3-1 advantage . real 's first half showed a return to the fluid attacking style that gained them the champions league title in 2002 .
meanwhile bayern were plagued by the midfield sluggishness and defensive lapses that have characterized their mediocre season . a familiar face comes up big bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thanks to kahn , bayern avoided disaster the match could have turned into a debacle for munich in the second half , were it not for a sterling play by their 37-year-old keeper .
beckham curled a lethal-looking free kick toward the upper-left-hand corner of goal , but kahn acrobatically parried it to keep the visitors in the game . after that , real curiously chose to pack it in at the back - never a madrid strong point even in the club 's best years . for half an hour , it looked as though real might be able to hold their two-goal advantage .
bayern 's lack of true playmaker was all too apparent as they seldom created open shots on goal . but in 79th minute , substitute bayern striker claudio pizarro was narrowly denied by casillas from 10 meters .
two minutes from time , midfielder mark van bommel drop-kicked a short real clearance into the back of the net for the final 3-2 scoreline . glass half-full or half-empty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel flexed his muscles late in the match the result was a bit of balsam for the wounded pride of these two former titans .
speaking after the match , kahn said " this is one of those losses that feels like a victory . " indeed , both sides played to a higher standard than their critics thought them capable of , treating fans to one of the better matches of this champions league season . but the game also showed that bayern - despite van bommel 's late goal - still need a creative director in midfield .

but critics say germany is n't doing enough to promote linguistic diversity and multilingual education . the integration debate in germany has included a strong focus on immigrant children 's language skills .
both politicians and educators agree that it 's especially important to speak the language of the country you live in - and speak it well in order to get a good education and find a job . in germany , though , children from immigrant families often have problems at school .
their german just is n't good enough .
as a result , some german states are giving fewer lessons in these kids ' native tongues - a move not all teachers and linguists agree with . ruprecht baur , professor for german as a foreign language at duisburg-essen university , said several questions always come up in discussions on integration .
does the fact that a child comes from an immigrant family and speaks a different language prevent him or her from learning german and doing well at school ?
should the parents speak german at home , and avoid their native tongue ?
and is being exposed to two languages the reason some children here , notably with an italian or turkish background , fail in school ? according to baur , these questions arise despite multilingualism being the rule almost everywhere in the world . " international studies show that the mother tongue is no distraction , " baur said .
" the majority of people all over the world speak several languages .
they 're born with a mother language , and often know two more . " germany lacking interest in linguistic heritage the european union has repeatedly stressed the importance and its support of linguistic pluralism .
eu guidelines even commit member states to promote language classes in the children 's mother tongues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some turkish children perfect their mother tongue in germany that 's the case in germany as well - in theory .
in practice , north rhine-westphalia for example has cut back on native language teaching positions .
neighboring hesse has discontinued these classes altogether . the western german states reasoned that learning german at an early age was more important .
but vassilios fthenakis , professor for development psychology at italy 's bozen university , is critical of germany 's educational policies . " it 's an ongoing german problem : not taking a serious interest in the importance of a child 's mother language and culture , but pushing forward integration that is n't working , " fthenakis said .
" it 's a fundamental problem that germany does n't first strengthen a child 's mother language and culture , and then push learning german from that point on . " immigrant parents should n't speak german at home cultural and linguistic diversity is a richness that should be used for the individual and collective learning experience , the greek-born fthenakis said .
germany though did n't have policies like sweden , england or france do .
he said german guidelines could only be called disoriented . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some grade schools offer language training for immigrant children according to fthenakis , the role that the family and their educational level play should not be underestimated .
young students will quickly learn german if they can speak and write in their mother language , fthenakis said . he said he is convinced that the language learning process should start before kids enter the school system .
in germany , that would be before the age of six .
every child is open to any language in the world before its first birthday - learning a second language is no problem at all , fthenakis said . critics of the multilingual approach said immigrant parents should speak german with their children at home .
but this was counterproductive , said duisburg-essen university 's baur . " if the parents do n't speak german well , they should n't speak it with their children , " baur said .
" at some point , the children 's german language abilities will be better than the parents ' , and then they 'll make fun of them and say , you ca n't even speak the language properly that you 're trying to speak with me .

many of these killings have been " convincingly attributed to them " , said special rapporteur philip alston .
one human rights group says since president gloria arroyo took power in 2001 , 830 activists have been killed .
mr alston urged president arroyo to confront what he called a culture of virtual impunity in the legal system .
the philippines army , which has been battling communist rebels for almost four decades , has blamed rogue elements for some of the killings .
but mr alston said that such explanations were insufficient .
the army " needs to give us precise details and to indicate what investigations and prosecutions have been undertaken in response " .
rights group figures although critical of the president , the un rapporteur stressed that he did not believe that there was any political sanction for the killings .
" i do not believe that there 's a policy at the top designed to direct that these killings to take place , " said mr alston .
the human rights group karapatan says that 832 extra-judicial killings since 2001 can be blamed on the security forces .
of these , it says 356 are left-wing activists .
the philippines armed forces have been fighting a communist insurgency since 1969 , with an estimated 40,000 people killed , and in recent years they have also had to face attacks by muslim radicals .
but military chief general hermogenes esperon denied that extra-judicial killings were used , and said he would prosecute any soldier found doing this , reuters news agency reports .
philip alston has spent 10 days in the philippines investigating the killings , and is due to present a full report on his findings in three months ' time .

thank you for taking the time to register your views about road pricing on the downing street website .
tony blair was responding to people who backed an online petition this petition was posted shortly before we published the eddington study , an independent review of britain 's transport network .
this study set out long-term challenges and options for our transport network .
it made clear that congestion is a major problem to which there is no easy answer .
one aspect of the study was highlighting how road pricing could provide a solution to these problems and that advances in technology put these plans within our reach .
of course it would be 10 years or more before any national scheme was technologically , never mind politically , feasible .
we are not rushing headlong into a national road-pricing scheme tony blair no decision made , blair says that is the backdrop to this issue .
as my response makes clear , this is not about imposing " stealth taxes " or introducing " big brother " surveillance .
this is a complex subject , which can not be resolved without a thorough investigation of all the options , combined with a full and frank debate about the choices we face at a local and national level .
that 's why i hope this detailed response will address your concerns and set out how we intend to take this issue forward .
i see this e-mail as the beginning , not the end of the debate , and the links below provide an opportunity for you to take it further .
but let me be clear straight away : we have not made any decision about national road pricing .
indeed we are simply not yet in a position to do so .
we are , for now , working with some local authorities that are interested in establishing local schemes to help address local congestion problems .
pricing is not being forced on any area , but any schemes would teach us more about how road pricing would work and inform decisions on a national scheme .
and funds raised from these local schemes will be used to improve transport in those areas .
one thing i suspect we can all agree is that congestion is bad .
it 's bad for business because it disrupts the delivery of goods and services .
it affects people 's quality of life .
and it is bad for the environment .
that is why tackling congestion is a key priority for any government .
congestion is predicted to increase by 25 % by 2015 .
this is being driven by economic prosperity .
there are six million more vehicles on the road now than in 1997 , and predictions are that this trend will continue .
part of the solution is to improve public transport , and to make the most of the existing road network .
we have more than doubled investment since 1997 , spending £ 2.5bn this year on buses and over £ 4bn on trains - helping to explain why more people are using them than for decades .
and we 're committed to sustaining this investment , with over £ 140bn of investment planned between now and 2015 .
we 're also putting a great deal of effort into improving traffic flows - for example , over 1,000 highways agency traffic officers now help to keep motorway traffic moving .
but all the evidence shows that improving public transport and tackling traffic bottlenecks will not by themselves prevent congestion getting worse .
so we have a difficult choice to make about how we tackle the expected increase in congestion .
this is a challenge that all political leaders have to face up to , and not just in the uk .
for example , road-pricing schemes are already in operation in italy , norway and singapore , and others , such as the netherlands , are developing schemes .
towns and cities across the world are looking at road pricing as a means of addressing congestion .
one option would be to allow congestion to grow unchecked .
given the forecast growth in traffic , doing nothing would mean that journeys within and between cities would take longer , and be less reliable .
i think that would be bad for businesses , individuals and the environment .
and the costs on us all will be real - congestion could cost an extra £ 22bn in wasted time in england by 2025 , of which £ 10bn to £ 12bn would be the direct cost on businesses .
a second option would be to try to build our way out of congestion .
we could , of course , add new lanes to our motorways , widen roads in our congested city centres , and build new routes across the countryside .
certainly in some places new capacity will be part of the story .
that is why we are widening the m25 , m1 and m62 .
but i think people agree that we can not simply build more and more roads , particularly when the evidence suggests that traffic quickly grows to fill any new capacity .
tackling congestion in this way would also be extremely costly , requiring substantial sums to be diverted from other services such as education and health , or increases in taxes .
if i tell you that one mile of new motorway costs as much as £ 30m , you 'll have an idea of the sums this approach would entail .
that is why i believe that at least we need to explore the contribution road pricing can make to tackling congestion .
it would not be in anyone 's interests , especially those of motorists , to slam the door shut on road pricing without exploring it further .
it has been calculated that a national scheme - as part of a wider package of measures - could cut congestion significantly through small changes in our overall travel patterns .
but any technology used would have to give definite guarantees about privacy being protected - as it should be .
existing technologies , such as mobile phones and pay-as-you-drive insurance schemes , may well be able to play a role here , by ensuring that the government does n't hold information about where vehicles have been .
but there may also be opportunities presented by developments in new technology .
just as new medical technology is changing the nhs , so there will be changes in the transport sector .
our aim is to relieve traffic jams , not create a " big brother " society .
i know many people 's biggest worry about road pricing is that it will be a " stealth tax " on motorists .
it wo n't .
road pricing is about tackling congestion .
clearly if we decided to move towards a system of national road pricing , there could be a case for moving away from the current system of motoring taxation .
this could mean that those who use their car less , or can travel at less congested times , in less congested areas , for example in rural areas , would benefit from lower motoring costs overall .
those who travel longer distances at peak times and in more congested areas would pay more .
but those are decisions for the future .
at this stage , when no firm decision has been taken as to whether we will move towards a national scheme , stories about possible costs are simply not credible , since they depend on so many variables yet to be investigated , never mind decided .
before we take any decisions about a national pricing scheme , we know that we have to have a system that works .
a system that respects our privacy as individuals .
a system that is fair .
i fully accept that we do n't have all the answers yet .
that is why we are not rushing headlong into a national road-pricing scheme .
before we take any decisions there would be further consultations .
the public will , of course , have their say , as will parliament .
we want to continue this debate , so that we can build a consensus around the best way to reduce congestion , protect the environment and support our businesses .

but i think people agree that we can not simply build more and more roads , particularly when the evidence suggests that traffic quickly grows to fill any new capacity .
tackling congestion in this way would also be extremely costly , requiring substantial sums to be diverted from other services such as education and health , or increases in taxes .
if i tell you that one mile of new motorway costs as much as £ 30m , you 'll have an idea of the sums this approach would entail .
that is why i believe that at least we need to explore the contribution road pricing can make to tackling congestion .
it would not be in anyone 's interests , especially those of motorists , to slam the door shut on road pricing without exploring it further .
it has been calculated that a national scheme - as part of a wider package of measures - could cut congestion significantly through small changes in our overall travel patterns .
but any technology used would have to give definite guarantees about privacy being protected - as it should be .
existing technologies , such as mobile phones and pay-as-you-drive insurance schemes , may well be able to play a role here , by ensuring that the government does n't hold information about where vehicles have been .
but there may also be opportunities presented by developments in new technology .
just as new medical technology is changing the nhs , so there will be changes in the transport sector .
our aim is to relieve traffic jams , not create a " big brother " society .
i know many people 's biggest worry about road pricing is that it will be a " stealth tax " on motorists .
it wo n't .
road pricing is about tackling congestion .
clearly if we decided to move towards a system of national road pricing , there could be a case for moving away from the current system of motoring taxation .
this could mean that those who use their car less , or can travel at less congested times , in less congested areas , for example in rural areas , would benefit from lower motoring costs overall .
those who travel longer distances at peak times and in more congested areas would pay more .
but those are decisions for the future .
at this stage , when no firm decision has been taken as to whether we will move towards a national scheme , stories about possible costs are simply not credible , since they depend on so many variables yet to be investigated , never mind decided .
before we take any decisions about a national pricing scheme , we know that we have to have a system that works .
a system that respects our privacy as individuals .
a system that is fair .
i fully accept that we do n't have all the answers yet .
that is why we are not rushing headlong into a national road-pricing scheme .
before we take any decisions there would be further consultations .
the public will , of course , have their say , as will parliament .
we want to continue this debate , so that we can build a consensus around the best way to reduce congestion , protect the environment and support our businesses .

thank you for taking the time to register your views about road pricing on the downing street website .
tony blair was responding to people who backed an online petition this petition was posted shortly before we published the eddington study , an independent review of britain 's transport network .
this study set out long-term challenges and options for our transport network .
it made clear that congestion is a major problem to which there is no easy answer .
one aspect of the study was highlighting how road pricing could provide a solution to these problems and that advances in technology put these plans within our reach .
of course it would be 10 years or more before any national scheme was technologically , never mind politically , feasible .
we are not rushing headlong into a national road-pricing scheme tony blair no decision made , blair says that is the backdrop to this issue .
as my response makes clear , this is not about imposing " stealth taxes " or introducing " big brother " surveillance .
this is a complex subject , which can not be resolved without a thorough investigation of all the options , combined with a full and frank debate about the choices we face at a local and national level .
that 's why i hope this detailed response will address your concerns and set out how we intend to take this issue forward .
i see this e-mail as the beginning , not the end of the debate , and the links below provide an opportunity for you to take it further .
but let me be clear straight away : we have not made any decision about national road pricing .
indeed we are simply not yet in a position to do so .
we are , for now , working with some local authorities that are interested in establishing local schemes to help address local congestion problems .
pricing is not being forced on any area , but any schemes would teach us more about how road pricing would work and inform decisions on a national scheme .
and funds raised from these local schemes will be used to improve transport in those areas .
one thing i suspect we can all agree is that congestion is bad .
it 's bad for business because it disrupts the delivery of goods and services .
it affects people 's quality of life .
and it is bad for the environment .
that is why tackling congestion is a key priority for any government .
congestion is predicted to increase by 25 % by 2015 .
this is being driven by economic prosperity .
there are six million more vehicles on the road now than in 1997 , and predictions are that this trend will continue .
part of the solution is to improve public transport , and to make the most of the existing road network .
we have more than doubled investment since 1997 , spending £ 2.5bn this year on buses and over £ 4bn on trains - helping to explain why more people are using them than for decades .
and we 're committed to sustaining this investment , with over £ 140bn of investment planned between now and 2015 .
we 're also putting a great deal of effort into improving traffic flows - for example , over 1,000 highways agency traffic officers now help to keep motorway traffic moving .
but all the evidence shows that improving public transport and tackling traffic bottlenecks will not by themselves prevent congestion getting worse .
so we have a difficult choice to make about how we tackle the expected increase in congestion .
this is a challenge that all political leaders have to face up to , and not just in the uk .
for example , road-pricing schemes are already in operation in italy , norway and singapore , and others , such as the netherlands , are developing schemes .
towns and cities across the world are looking at road pricing as a means of addressing congestion .
one option would be to allow congestion to grow unchecked .
given the forecast growth in traffic , doing nothing would mean that journeys within and between cities would take longer , and be less reliable .
i think that would be bad for businesses , individuals and the environment .
and the costs on us all will be real - congestion could cost an extra £ 22bn in wasted time in england by 2025 , of which £ 10bn to £ 12bn would be the direct cost on businesses .
a second option would be to try to build our way out of congestion .
we could , of course , add new lanes to our motorways , widen roads in our congested city centres , and build new routes across the countryside .
certainly in some places new capacity will be part of the story .
that is why we are widening the m25 , m1 and m62 .
but i think people agree that we can not simply build more and more roads , particularly when the evidence suggests that traffic quickly grows to fill any new capacity .
tackling congestion in this way would also be extremely costly , requiring substantial sums to be diverted from other services such as education and health , or increases in taxes .

one aspect of the study was highlighting how road pricing could provide a solution to these problems and that advances in technology put these plans within our reach .
of course it would be 10 years or more before any national scheme was technologically , never mind politically , feasible .
we are not rushing headlong into a national road-pricing scheme tony blair no decision made , blair says that is the backdrop to this issue .
as my response makes clear , this is not about imposing " stealth taxes " or introducing " big brother " surveillance .
this is a complex subject , which can not be resolved without a thorough investigation of all the options , combined with a full and frank debate about the choices we face at a local and national level .
that 's why i hope this detailed response will address your concerns and set out how we intend to take this issue forward .
i see this e-mail as the beginning , not the end of the debate , and the links below provide an opportunity for you to take it further .
but let me be clear straight away : we have not made any decision about national road pricing .
indeed we are simply not yet in a position to do so .
we are , for now , working with some local authorities that are interested in establishing local schemes to help address local congestion problems .
pricing is not being forced on any area , but any schemes would teach us more about how road pricing would work and inform decisions on a national scheme .
and funds raised from these local schemes will be used to improve transport in those areas .
one thing i suspect we can all agree is that congestion is bad .
it 's bad for business because it disrupts the delivery of goods and services .
it affects people 's quality of life .
and it is bad for the environment .
that is why tackling congestion is a key priority for any government .
congestion is predicted to increase by 25 % by 2015 .
this is being driven by economic prosperity .
there are six million more vehicles on the road now than in 1997 , and predictions are that this trend will continue .
part of the solution is to improve public transport , and to make the most of the existing road network .
we have more than doubled investment since 1997 , spending £ 2.5bn this year on buses and over £ 4bn on trains - helping to explain why more people are using them than for decades .
and we 're committed to sustaining this investment , with over £ 140bn of investment planned between now and 2015 .
we 're also putting a great deal of effort into improving traffic flows - for example , over 1,000 highways agency traffic officers now help to keep motorway traffic moving .
but all the evidence shows that improving public transport and tackling traffic bottlenecks will not by themselves prevent congestion getting worse .
so we have a difficult choice to make about how we tackle the expected increase in congestion .
this is a challenge that all political leaders have to face up to , and not just in the uk .
for example , road-pricing schemes are already in operation in italy , norway and singapore , and others , such as the netherlands , are developing schemes .
towns and cities across the world are looking at road pricing as a means of addressing congestion .
one option would be to allow congestion to grow unchecked .
given the forecast growth in traffic , doing nothing would mean that journeys within and between cities would take longer , and be less reliable .
i think that would be bad for businesses , individuals and the environment .
and the costs on us all will be real - congestion could cost an extra £ 22bn in wasted time in england by 2025 , of which £ 10bn to £ 12bn would be the direct cost on businesses .
a second option would be to try to build our way out of congestion .
we could , of course , add new lanes to our motorways , widen roads in our congested city centres , and build new routes across the countryside .
certainly in some places new capacity will be part of the story .
that is why we are widening the m25 , m1 and m62 .
but i think people agree that we can not simply build more and more roads , particularly when the evidence suggests that traffic quickly grows to fill any new capacity .
tackling congestion in this way would also be extremely costly , requiring substantial sums to be diverted from other services such as education and health , or increases in taxes .
if i tell you that one mile of new motorway costs as much as £ 30m , you 'll have an idea of the sums this approach would entail .
that is why i believe that at least we need to explore the contribution road pricing can make to tackling congestion .
it would not be in anyone 's interests , especially those of motorists , to slam the door shut on road pricing without exploring it further .
it has been calculated that a national scheme - as part of a wider package of measures - could cut congestion significantly through small changes in our overall travel patterns .
but any technology used would have to give definite guarantees about privacy being protected - as it should be .
existing technologies , such as mobile phones and pay-as-you-drive insurance schemes , may well be able to play a role here , by ensuring that the government does n't hold information about where vehicles have been .
but there may also be opportunities presented by developments in new technology .
just as new medical technology is changing the nhs , so there will be changes in the transport sector .
our aim is to relieve traffic jams , not create a " big brother " society .
i know many people 's biggest worry about road pricing is that it will be a " stealth tax " on motorists .
it wo n't .
road pricing is about tackling congestion .
clearly if we decided to move towards a system of national road pricing , there could be a case for moving away from the current system of motoring taxation .
this could mean that those who use their car less , or can travel at less congested times , in less congested areas , for example in rural areas , would benefit from lower motoring costs overall .
those who travel longer distances at peak times and in more congested areas would pay more .
but those are decisions for the future .
at this stage , when no firm decision has been taken as to whether we will move towards a national scheme , stories about possible costs are simply not credible , since they depend on so many variables yet to be investigated , never mind decided .
before we take any decisions about a national pricing scheme , we know that we have to have a system that works .
a system that respects our privacy as individuals .
a system that is fair .
i fully accept that we do n't have all the answers yet .
that is why we are not rushing headlong into a national road-pricing scheme .
before we take any decisions there would be further consultations .
the public will , of course , have their say , as will parliament .
we want to continue this debate , so that we can build a consensus around the best way to reduce congestion , protect the environment and support our businesses .

thank you for taking the time to register your views about road pricing on the downing street website .
tony blair was responding to people who backed an online petition this petition was posted shortly before we published the eddington study , an independent review of britain 's transport network .
this study set out long-term challenges and options for our transport network .
it made clear that congestion is a major problem to which there is no easy answer .
one aspect of the study was highlighting how road pricing could provide a solution to these problems and that advances in technology put these plans within our reach .
of course it would be 10 years or more before any national scheme was technologically , never mind politically , feasible .
we are not rushing headlong into a national road-pricing scheme tony blair no decision made , blair says that is the backdrop to this issue .
as my response makes clear , this is not about imposing " stealth taxes " or introducing " big brother " surveillance .
this is a complex subject , which can not be resolved without a thorough investigation of all the options , combined with a full and frank debate about the choices we face at a local and national level .
that 's why i hope this detailed response will address your concerns and set out how we intend to take this issue forward .
i see this e-mail as the beginning , not the end of the debate , and the links below provide an opportunity for you to take it further .
but let me be clear straight away : we have not made any decision about national road pricing .
indeed we are simply not yet in a position to do so .
we are , for now , working with some local authorities that are interested in establishing local schemes to help address local congestion problems .
pricing is not being forced on any area , but any schemes would teach us more about how road pricing would work and inform decisions on a national scheme .
and funds raised from these local schemes will be used to improve transport in those areas .
one thing i suspect we can all agree is that congestion is bad .
it 's bad for business because it disrupts the delivery of goods and services .
it affects people 's quality of life .
and it is bad for the environment .
that is why tackling congestion is a key priority for any government .
congestion is predicted to increase by 25 % by 2015 .
this is being driven by economic prosperity .
there are six million more vehicles on the road now than in 1997 , and predictions are that this trend will continue .
part of the solution is to improve public transport , and to make the most of the existing road network .
we have more than doubled investment since 1997 , spending £ 2.5bn this year on buses and over £ 4bn on trains - helping to explain why more people are using them than for decades .
and we 're committed to sustaining this investment , with over £ 140bn of investment planned between now and 2015 .
we 're also putting a great deal of effort into improving traffic flows - for example , over 1,000 highways agency traffic officers now help to keep motorway traffic moving .
but all the evidence shows that improving public transport and tackling traffic bottlenecks will not by themselves prevent congestion getting worse .
so we have a difficult choice to make about how we tackle the expected increase in congestion .
this is a challenge that all political leaders have to face up to , and not just in the uk .
for example , road-pricing schemes are already in operation in italy , norway and singapore , and others , such as the netherlands , are developing schemes .
towns and cities across the world are looking at road pricing as a means of addressing congestion .
one option would be to allow congestion to grow unchecked .
given the forecast growth in traffic , doing nothing would mean that journeys within and between cities would take longer , and be less reliable .
i think that would be bad for businesses , individuals and the environment .
and the costs on us all will be real - congestion could cost an extra £ 22bn in wasted time in england by 2025 , of which £ 10bn to £ 12bn would be the direct cost on businesses .
a second option would be to try to build our way out of congestion .
we could , of course , add new lanes to our motorways , widen roads in our congested city centres , and build new routes across the countryside .
certainly in some places new capacity will be part of the story .
that is why we are widening the m25 , m1 and m62 .
but i think people agree that we can not simply build more and more roads , particularly when the evidence suggests that traffic quickly grows to fill any new capacity .
tackling congestion in this way would also be extremely costly , requiring substantial sums to be diverted from other services such as education and health , or increases in taxes .
if i tell you that one mile of new motorway costs as much as £ 30m , you 'll have an idea of the sums this approach would entail .
that is why i believe that at least we need to explore the contribution road pricing can make to tackling congestion .
it would not be in anyone 's interests , especially those of motorists , to slam the door shut on road pricing without exploring it further .
it has been calculated that a national scheme - as part of a wider package of measures - could cut congestion significantly through small changes in our overall travel patterns .
but any technology used would have to give definite guarantees about privacy being protected - as it should be .
existing technologies , such as mobile phones and pay-as-you-drive insurance schemes , may well be able to play a role here , by ensuring that the government does n't hold information about where vehicles have been .
but there may also be opportunities presented by developments in new technology .
just as new medical technology is changing the nhs , so there will be changes in the transport sector .
our aim is to relieve traffic jams , not create a " big brother " society .
i know many people 's biggest worry about road pricing is that it will be a " stealth tax " on motorists .
it wo n't .
road pricing is about tackling congestion .
clearly if we decided to move towards a system of national road pricing , there could be a case for moving away from the current system of motoring taxation .
this could mean that those who use their car less , or can travel at less congested times , in less congested areas , for example in rural areas , would benefit from lower motoring costs overall .
those who travel longer distances at peak times and in more congested areas would pay more .
but those are decisions for the future .
at this stage , when no firm decision has been taken as to whether we will move towards a national scheme , stories about possible costs are simply not credible , since they depend on so many variables yet to be investigated , never mind decided .
before we take any decisions about a national pricing scheme , we know that we have to have a system that works .
a system that respects our privacy as individuals .
a system that is fair .

we 're also putting a great deal of effort into improving traffic flows - for example , over 1,000 highways agency traffic officers now help to keep motorway traffic moving .
but all the evidence shows that improving public transport and tackling traffic bottlenecks will not by themselves prevent congestion getting worse .
so we have a difficult choice to make about how we tackle the expected increase in congestion .
this is a challenge that all political leaders have to face up to , and not just in the uk .
for example , road-pricing schemes are already in operation in italy , norway and singapore , and others , such as the netherlands , are developing schemes .
towns and cities across the world are looking at road pricing as a means of addressing congestion .
one option would be to allow congestion to grow unchecked .
given the forecast growth in traffic , doing nothing would mean that journeys within and between cities would take longer , and be less reliable .
i think that would be bad for businesses , individuals and the environment .
and the costs on us all will be real - congestion could cost an extra £ 22bn in wasted time in england by 2025 , of which £ 10bn to £ 12bn would be the direct cost on businesses .
a second option would be to try to build our way out of congestion .
we could , of course , add new lanes to our motorways , widen roads in our congested city centres , and build new routes across the countryside .
certainly in some places new capacity will be part of the story .
that is why we are widening the m25 , m1 and m62 .
but i think people agree that we can not simply build more and more roads , particularly when the evidence suggests that traffic quickly grows to fill any new capacity .
tackling congestion in this way would also be extremely costly , requiring substantial sums to be diverted from other services such as education and health , or increases in taxes .
if i tell you that one mile of new motorway costs as much as £ 30m , you 'll have an idea of the sums this approach would entail .
that is why i believe that at least we need to explore the contribution road pricing can make to tackling congestion .
it would not be in anyone 's interests , especially those of motorists , to slam the door shut on road pricing without exploring it further .
it has been calculated that a national scheme - as part of a wider package of measures - could cut congestion significantly through small changes in our overall travel patterns .
but any technology used would have to give definite guarantees about privacy being protected - as it should be .
existing technologies , such as mobile phones and pay-as-you-drive insurance schemes , may well be able to play a role here , by ensuring that the government does n't hold information about where vehicles have been .
but there may also be opportunities presented by developments in new technology .
just as new medical technology is changing the nhs , so there will be changes in the transport sector .
our aim is to relieve traffic jams , not create a " big brother " society .
i know many people 's biggest worry about road pricing is that it will be a " stealth tax " on motorists .
it wo n't .
road pricing is about tackling congestion .
clearly if we decided to move towards a system of national road pricing , there could be a case for moving away from the current system of motoring taxation .
this could mean that those who use their car less , or can travel at less congested times , in less congested areas , for example in rural areas , would benefit from lower motoring costs overall .
those who travel longer distances at peak times and in more congested areas would pay more .
but those are decisions for the future .
at this stage , when no firm decision has been taken as to whether we will move towards a national scheme , stories about possible costs are simply not credible , since they depend on so many variables yet to be investigated , never mind decided .
before we take any decisions about a national pricing scheme , we know that we have to have a system that works .
a system that respects our privacy as individuals .
a system that is fair .
i fully accept that we do n't have all the answers yet .
that is why we are not rushing headlong into a national road-pricing scheme .
before we take any decisions there would be further consultations .
the public will , of course , have their say , as will parliament .
we want to continue this debate , so that we can build a consensus around the best way to reduce congestion , protect the environment and support our businesses .

"
thank you for taking the time to register your views about road pricing on the downing street website .
this petition was posted shortly before we published the eddington study , an independent review of britain 's transport network .
this study set out long-term challenges and options for our transport network .
it made clear that congestion is a major problem to which there is no easy answer .
one aspect of the study was highlighting how road pricing could provide a solution to these problems and that advances in technology put these plans within our reach .
of course it would be 10 years or more before any national scheme was technologically , never mind politically , feasible . "
we are not rushing headlong into a national road-pricing scheme " tony blair no decision made , blair says that is the backdrop to this issue .
as my response makes clear , this is not about imposing " stealth taxes " or introducing " big brother " surveillance .
this is a complex subject , which can not be resolved without a thorough investigation of all the options , combined with a full and frank debate about the choices we face at a local and national level .
that 's why i hope this detailed response will address your concerns and set out how we intend to take this issue forward .
i see this e-mail as the beginning , not the end of the debate , and the links below provide an opportunity for you to take it further .
but let me be clear straight away : we have not made any decision about national road pricing .
indeed we are simply not yet in a position to do so .
we are , for now , working with some local authorities that are interested in establishing local schemes to help address local congestion problems .
pricing is not being forced on any area , but any schemes would teach us more about how road pricing would work and inform decisions on a national scheme .
and funds raised from these local schemes will be used to improve transport in those areas .
one thing i suspect we can all agree is that congestion is bad .
it 's bad for business because it disrupts the delivery of goods and services .
it affects people 's quality of life .
and it is bad for the environment .
that is why tackling congestion is a key priority for any government .
congestion is predicted to increase by 25 % by 2015 .
this is being driven by economic prosperity .
there are six million more vehicles on the road now than in 1997 , and predictions are that this trend will continue .
part of the solution is to improve public transport , and to make the most of the existing road network .
we have more than doubled investment since 1997 , spending £ 2.5bn this year on buses and over £ 4bn on trains - helping to explain why more people are using them than for decades .
and we 're committed to sustaining this investment , with over £ 140bn of investment planned between now and 2015 .
we 're also putting a great deal of effort into improving traffic flows - for example , over 1,000 highways agency traffic officers now help to keep motorway traffic moving .

the first option calls for 6,000 troops to be backed by helicopters , while the second envisages a more ground-based mission with 10,900 troops .
mr ban said he recommended the second option because it could respond to unforeseen events .
now the un security council must consider this report and decide what to do .
one factor that diplomats may dwell on is the fact that the un wants to send 20,000 peacekeepers to darfur but has not yet been able to because of resistance from the sudanese government .
this report points out that a un mission in chad and the central african republic could help to resolve the crisis in darfur .

even when other big companies like gm recognised the union after a bitter sit-down strike in 1937 , henry ford vowed to close his plant rather than give in - and his security staff beat up union organisers who came near the plant .
it was only in 1941 , when the federal government intervened - and his wife threatened to leave him - that henry ford finally recognised the union .
' meltdown ' now , that bitter legacy may come back to haunt ford as it enters a key round of contract negotiations with the unions , with a deadline of 15 september .
" ford is going through a meltdown and will ask the union for deep concessions in pay and benefits during contract talks set to begin this summer , " says sean mcalinden , chief economist for the center for automotive research .
ford , like gm and chrysler , has been losing market share to japanese companies such as toyota in the us market for three decades .
but recently its position has become critical .
ford lost $ 12.7bn last year , the largest annual loss in its history , and says it will not be profitable until 2010 - despite cutting 35,000 jobs .
mark fields , president of ford north america , says there is no longer any place to hide .
" we face competition in every segment and in every market , " he says .
legacy costs ford and gm are at a crucial disadvantage compared with toyota .
they are burdened with the extra costs of paying benefits to all of their retired workers , who now far outnumber those still working for the company .
these legacy costs , which include both pension and retirement health care plans , cost the companies billions of dollars a year .
health care costs alone could add an additional $ 1,700 to the cost of each vehicle they make , mr mcalinden estimates .
according to labour historian nelson licthenstein , when these contracts were first negotiated , uaw president walter reuther warned car companies in the 1940s that they were courting trouble by making long-term promises they might not be able to keep , and urged them to support national health insurance instead .
but in the end reuther signed the " treaty of detroit , " in which gm and ford gave workers health and pension benefits and cost-of-living wage adjustments in return for industrial peace .
now gm is down to 80,000 us workers , compared with 450,000 25 years ago .
and the companies say they can not afford to pay the pension and health care costs of their 500,000 retirees .
cuts in the workforce when ford and gm began to get into trouble in the 1980s and 1990s , the union signed away some of its gains in order to keep the companies afloat .
but with us workers having no right to state-financed health benefits until they reach 65 , there is considerable resistance from the rank-and-file workers to any more concessions .
jerry sullivan , the president of local 600 , reckons that this will be an even tougher sell than in 2003 - when earlier uaw health concessions were accepted by the workforce by a vote of only 51 % -49 % .
some rank-and-file activists , like ron lare , argue that the uaw actually lost the ford vote over these concessions , and are pursuing the matter with the union .
mr sullivan agrees that the workers are tired of " give , give , give " and says " it is no good cutting if you ca n't make cars people want " .
but he hopes that the commitment made by bill ford to build a new factory on the site of river rouge - with an on-site museum on ford 's history - will save his workers .
company break-up the financial community is closely watching the union battle with ford and gm .
mark oline , of fitch ratings , says that both companies need concessions on legacy costs if they are to survive the next two to three years .
his company now rates their corporate bonds as junk bonds , signalling to investors that there is a significant risk that they will default on their borrowings .
" it is going to be a difficult year for the big three automakers , " he says .
" they have to continue to cut costs , but they also need to invest in models to increase their revenues . "
the continuing battles over these huge , uncosted liabilities to pay health care costs far into the future may be one reason that so far , no private equity firm has tried to break up ford and gm - although both companies have assets worth 10 times their stock market price .
union blues however , some rank-and-file activists are not sure the union - or the workers - have the stomach for a fight .
see how the union 's membership has fallen the uaw is losing members fast , dropping from 1.6 million to 550,000 in the last two decades , and may be forced to merge with another union to survive .
and many activists , like ron lare , and dean braid , a former buick worker in flint who was laid off in 1999 , have taken the generous company redundancy buyouts .
dean , who was active in the rank-and-file movement in the 1980s and 1990s , says that such organisations are not as strong as they used to be - and says that the lack of union democracy has disillusioned workers .
alienated workers sociologist ruth milkman is not surprised by the workers ' attitudes .
when she studied the gm plant in linden , nj , in the 1980s , she was struck by the workers ' hostility to the company and to their jobs - and by the alacrity with which they accepted company buyouts .
gary cowger , gm global vice-president for manufacturing and labour , is confident that the company can reach a deal this year .
" we have to get more concessions , but we have been working constructively with the union over the past few years , and have already reached a deal to take $ 15bn out of our health care costs , " he says .
he is clear , however , that gm will continue to cut jobs in the us while it expands into asia .
so the uaw , once the most powerful , and most politically progressive union in the us , is now facing a choice of a continuing slow decline into impotence , or a confrontation that could destroy both the union and the companies it bargains with .

jerry sullivan , the president of local 600 , reckons that this will be an even tougher sell than in 2003 - when earlier uaw health concessions were accepted by the workforce by a vote of only 51 % -49 % .
some rank-and-file activists , like ron lare , argue that the uaw actually lost the ford vote over these concessions , and are pursuing the matter with the union .
toyota 's younger workforce costs less in benefits mr sullivan agrees that the workers are tired of " give , give , give " and says " it is no good cutting if you ca n't make cars people want " .
but he hopes that the commitment made by bill ford to build a new factory on the site of river rouge - with an on-site museum on ford 's history - will save his workers .
company break-up the financial community is closely watching the union battle with ford and gm .
mark oline , of fitch ratings , says that both companies need concessions on legacy costs if they are to survive the next two to three years .
dean braid says flint is now an industrial wasteland his company now rates their corporate bonds as junk bonds , signalling to investors that there is a significant risk that they will default on their borrowings .
" it is going to be a difficult year for the big three automakers , " he says .
" they have to continue to cut costs , but they also need to invest in models to increase their revenues . "
the continuing battles over these huge , uncosted liabilities to pay health care costs far into the future may be one reason that so far , no private equity firm has tried to break up ford and gm - although both companies have assets worth 10 times their stock market price .
union blues however , some rank-and-file activists are not sure the union - or the workers - have the stomach for a fight .
see how the union 's membership has fallen the uaw is losing members fast , dropping from 1.6 million to 550,000 in the last two decades , and may be forced to merge with another union to survive .
walter reuther won the battle for union recognition from gm in 1937 and many activists , like ron lare , and dean braid , a former buick worker in flint who was laid off in 1999 , have taken the generous company redundancy buyouts .
dean , who was active in the rank-and-file movement in the 1980s and 1990s , says that such organisations are not as strong as they used to be - and says that the lack of union democracy has disillusioned workers .
alienated workers sociologist ruth milkman is not surprised by the workers ' attitudes .
when she studied the gm plant in linden , nj , in the 1980s , she was struck by the workers ' hostility to the company and to their jobs - and by the alacrity with which they accepted company buyouts .
gary cowger , gm global vice-president for manufacturing and labour , is confident that the company can reach a deal this year .
" we have to get more concessions , but we have been working constructively with the union over the past few years , and have already reached a deal to take $ 15bn out of our health care costs , " he says .
he is clear , however , that gm will continue to cut jobs in the us while it expands into asia .
so the uaw , once the most powerful , and most politically progressive union in the us , is now facing a choice of a continuing slow decline into impotence , or a confrontation that could destroy both the union and the companies it bargains with .

located on a mile-long tributary of the detroit river , the rouge once employed 100,000 men who built every ford manufactured in the us when it opened in 1928 .
globalisation series how detroit lost its dominance in the global car industry friday : photo journal tuesday : lean production key facts : global car industry guide to globalisation henry ford , the inventor of mass production , aimed to control every aspect of the production process - and he did n't like unions .
even when other big companies like gm recognised the union after a bitter sit-down strike in 1937 , henry ford vowed to close his plant rather than give in - and his security staff beat up union organisers who came near the plant .
it was only in 1941 , when the federal government intervened - and his wife threatened to leave him - that henry ford finally recognised the union .
' meltdown ' now , that bitter legacy may come back to haunt ford as it enters a key round of contract negotiations with the unions , with a deadline of 15 september .
" ford is going through a meltdown and will ask the union for deep concessions in pay and benefits during contract talks set to begin this summer , " says sean mcalinden , chief economist for the center for automotive research .
ford workers at river rouge explain why they wo n't give up their benefits without a fight in pictures ford , like gm and chrysler , has been losing market share to japanese companies such as toyota in the us market for three decades .
but recently its position has become critical .
ford lost $ 12.7bn last year , the largest annual loss in its history , and says it will not be profitable until 2010 - despite cutting 35,000 jobs .
mark fields , president of ford north america , says there is no longer any place to hide .
" we face competition in every segment and in every market , " he says .
legacy costs ford and gm are at a crucial disadvantage compared with toyota .
they are burdened with the extra costs of paying benefits to all of their retired workers , who now far outnumber those still working for the company .
these legacy costs , which include both pension and retirement health care plans , cost the companies billions of dollars a year .
health care costs alone could add an additional $ 1,700 to the cost of each vehicle they make , mr mcalinden estimates .
according to labour historian nelson licthenstein , when these contracts were first negotiated , uaw president walter reuther warned car companies in the 1940s that they were courting trouble by making long-term promises they might not be able to keep , and urged them to support national health insurance instead .
japanese car imports undermined ford and gm but in the end reuther signed the " treaty of detroit , " in which gm and ford gave workers health and pension benefits and cost-of-living wage adjustments in return for industrial peace .
now gm is down to 80,000 us workers , compared with 450,000 25 years ago .
and the companies say they can not afford to pay the pension and health care costs of their 500,000 retirees .
cuts in the workforce when ford and gm began to get into trouble in the 1980s and 1990s , the union signed away some of its gains in order to keep the companies afloat .
but with us workers having no right to state-financed health benefits until they reach 65 , there is considerable resistance from the rank-and-file workers to any more concessions .

it also has the option to buy a further four planes - which each have a $ 201m list price - for the following year .
ba invited both airbus and boeing to bid for contracts but decided it would be easier to integrate the boeing jets into its fleet .
last year the uk airline said it was looking to buy at least 34 new planes .
at the same time it said it first had to cut its £ 2.1bn pension deficit before it started ordering the new aircraft .
negotiations negotiations are continuing to decide whether rolls-royce or general electric will supply the engines for the new planes .
the decision not to buy airbus a330s is a blow to the european plane maker which has faced major problems with its new a380 superjumbo .
however , ba said it was confident that both boeing and airbus would compete for future orders " as we move towards our major long-haul fleet renewal and expansion order later this year " .
last month , ba published a final version last month of its plan to narrow the pension deficit .
negotiators for the four unions at ba agreed to consult with their members over the plan , which will mean that they either work for longer or pay higher pension contributions , for service after april this year .
in return the company pledged to inject up to £ 950m into the fund in the next three years , and pay a further £ 280m in each of the next 10 years .
earlier this month the trustees of the ba pension scheme gave their formal agreement to the deal .

volunteer crews with the royal national lifeboat institution -lrb- rnli -rrb- in the region launched 1,147 times last year - the second busiest year on record .
the charity said longer summer seasons meant more people making use of coastal areas for leisure and recreation .
the busiest lifeboat station in the region was sunderland with 92 launches .
the figures show 74 % of rescues were carried out by inshore lifeboats , reflecting the continuing rise in people using the sea for leisure activities such as sailing , diving , kite surfing and jet skiing .
' more demanding ' only 15 % of rescues were to fishing or commercial vessels , while 44 % were to pleasure craft and 31 % were to people in difficulty in the water or on the shore .
andrew ashton , rnli divisional inspector , said : " saving lives at sea is becoming more and more demanding .
" traditionally , the rnli rescued mainly fishing boats and commercial vessels .
" but today the diversity of sea-based leisure activities means our crews must devote an increasing amount of time to training for a wide variety of rescue scenarios to ensure they can always operate safely and effectively . "
the rnli 's north division stretches from berwick-upon-tweed to skegness on the east coast and silloth in cumbria to west kirby on the west coast .
the division has 33 lifeboat stations operating 16 all-weather lifeboats , 36 inshore lifeboats and two inshore rescue hovercraft .

volunteer crews with the royal national lifeboat institution -lrb- rnli -rrb- in the region launched 1,147 times last year - the second busiest year on record .
the charity said longer summer seasons meant more people making use of coastal areas for leisure and recreation .
the busiest lifeboat station in the region was sunderland with 92 launches .
the figures show 74 % of rescues were carried out by inshore lifeboats , reflecting the continuing rise in people using the sea for leisure activities such as sailing , diving , kite surfing and jet skiing .
' more demanding ' only 15 % of rescues were to fishing or commercial vessels , while 44 % were to pleasure craft and 31 % were to people in difficulty in the water or on the shore .
andrew ashton , rnli divisional inspector , said : " saving lives at sea is becoming more and more demanding .
" traditionally , the rnli rescued mainly fishing boats and commercial vessels .
" but today the diversity of sea-based leisure activities means our crews must devote an increasing amount of time to training for a wide variety of rescue scenarios to ensure they can always operate safely and effectively . "
the rnli 's north division stretches from berwick-upon-tweed to skegness on the east coast and silloth in cumbria to west kirby on the west coast .
the division has 33 lifeboat stations operating 16 all-weather lifeboats , 36 inshore lifeboats and two inshore rescue hovercraft .

blackpool topped the poll with 5.7m visits , although numbers were down 4 % , said the association of leading visitor attractions -lrb- alva -rrb- .
alva director robin broke said visitor numbers fell dramatically following the 7 july 2005 bombings .
most london attractions saw visitor figures increase significantly in 2006 , according to the latest figures .
tate modern in london was the second most visited venue in the country with 4.9m visitors , a 21 % increase on 2005 .
the british museum , national gallery , natural history museum and science museum were among the nation 's favourite attractions .
' vibrant industry ' among the least visited attractions were the national museum of costume in scotland and the national wool museum in wales .
mr broke said the tourism industry was vibrant despite security alerts , punctual transport woes and a weak us dollar .
but he said britain 's attractions industry still needed financial support to help promote it " if this country is to compete globally " .
" the figures show a marked increase for several attractions compared to their 2005 performance .
" this is partly explained by the affect of the july bombings of that year . "
