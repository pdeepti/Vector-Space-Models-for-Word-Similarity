they speak of the " persian nuclear bomb " and try to measure just how close tehran is to reaching this goal . instead , a bit more sobriety and reserve are called for .
thus far , the " goal " of an iranian nuclear bomb has only existed in the minds of those who had always been suspicious of the regime in tehran and the revitalization of islam and politics that it embodied . how else can it be explained that , although iran has continually claimed that its atomic research is for peaceful purposes only and has belonged to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty for a long time already , it is still accused of having bad intentions ?
at the same time , not the slightest effort has been made to help the countries in the region that have not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty - israel , india and pakistan - to find the " right path .

starting wednesday , she is being tried for her involvement in two botched terrorist attacks . a suspected member of a german left-wing extremist group admitted in court wednesday to two failed bomb attacks in the 1980s as her trial began in berlin . the 58-year-old defendant , adrienne gerhäuser , presented a statement saying that she had " knowingly and willingly " attempted to bomb the berlin genetic technical institute in 1986 and a clothing factory in bavaria in 1987 on behalf of the far-left organization rote zora . she said the attacks were motivated by her political beliefs at the time , including a fierce opposition to genetic engineering and solidarity with striking female factory workers in south korea . gerhäuser said she had provided alarm clocks for two detonators .
but in both cases the devices failed to go off and no one was injured . she stands accused of belonging to a terrorist organization and attempting bombing . the berlin court said that because gerhäuser had turned herself in to the authorities late last year , the maximum penalty she would face would be two-year suspended sentence . rote zora was a women 's splinter group that claimed responsibility for 45 bombings and cases of arson between april 1977 and february 1988 with the aim of bringing about radical change in german society . the group was part of the so-called revolutionary cells network until 1986 . debate about a wave of attacks unleashed by the far-left in germany in the 1970s and 1980s resurfaced in recent months as two former guerrillas from the red army faction sought release from prison . brigitte mohnhaupt , who was convicted for her role in nine murders in the left-wing group 's campaign against the west german state in the 1970s , left jail last month after 24 years in detention . a german court granted the 57-year-old 's release because she served her minimum sentence and was no longer considered a threat .
but a court in february refused prison day releases for christian klar , 54 , who led the raf along with mohnhaupt . the families of the victims of the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , have bitterly opposed any clemency , partly because mohnhaupt and klar never expressed remorse for the murders . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's radical left confronts global issues and enemy within europe 's radical left-wing groups are at the forefront of demonstrations against international injustice .

some employees would like to see their working conditions improved . the world 's biggest food retailer , mcdonald 's has decided germany is ripe for the mccafe - a coffee shop integrated into mcdonald 's restaurants offering drinks from cappuccinos to lattes , as well as panini , cookies and cakes . around 240 of germany 's 1,276 mcdonalds have been renovated to incorporate the snazzier-looking mccafe , and at least another 100 are expected to follow this year . the dark brown leather chairs , sleek wood deco and shiny glass displays are a giant step away from the shrill yellow and red plastic traditionally associated with mcdonalds restaurants - and they are proving popular with customers . the turnover in the redesigned stores has increased by 10 percent to 15 percent . " we assumed that the mccafe would attract younger people , but surprisingly the over-50s , who otherwise never enter a mcdonalds , are coming , " said mcdonald 's germany chief , bane knezevic , in an interview with the german daily tagespiegel . gourmet coffee on the rise trendy coffee chains such as starbucks and balzac have been mushrooming in germany 's big cities - and mcdonald 's just was n't proving attractive to those who wanted to chill out and choose from a wide variety of coffees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's is giving many of its german restaurants a make-over " for a long time , we were n't modern enough for our customers , " knezevic said .
though it has also taken a while for the mccafe to come to germany - they were first introduced in australia in 1993 . knezevic also said mcdonald 's would introduce coffee beans certified by the rain forest alliance . although mcdonald 's might be moving in a socially responsible direction with its coffee , the chain reportedly still has room for improvement when it comes to its employees . accusations against mcdonald 's in a report on germany 's public zdf television broadcast on april 3 , former mcdonald 's employees listed a series of complaints against the food chain , including arbitrary firings and the bullying of works council representatives . former employees interviewed by zdf tell of attempts to buy off works council representatives .
they also accused mcdonald 's of having a policy of employing young people with immigrant backgrounds and firing anyone who complains . after asking for a pay rise , and saying she wanted to establish a works council , former mcdonald 's employee nicole wieseler was fired after seven years working for the company . " i was fired without notice just before the end of my holiday , and they also gave me a written order banning me from all mcdonald 's restaurants , " wieseler told zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's is under fire in china this week for allegedly paying below the minimum wage " they did n't give me a reason , and i just did n't understand it , " she added .

i felt like a murderer . " wieseler took case to court and won .
mcdonald 's maintains wieseler 's dismissal had nothing to do with her union activity . mcdonald 's in germany has more than 52,000 employers , but there are only 17 works councils - these are employee committees that give voice to workers ' concerns .

" these are very difficult times for the palestinian people , " he told reporters at a joint press conference with eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
the finance minister added that if the international community did not come to the aid of the palestinians , the outcome would be " devastating " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fayyad warns that lack of aid is devastating for the palestinians palestinian and european diplomats said the meeting itself was a sign that the eu was willing to give the new finance ministry a chance . the eu was the biggest aid donor to the palestinian government until the hamas militants came to power in march 2006 .
the quartet of middle east mediators - the european union , united states , united nations and russia - then suspended direct aid to the palestinian authority . eu bypasses unity government since then , the eu has redirected its funding , which reached 700 million euros in 2006 , through a special mechanism to help the neediest people while bypassing the government to avoid contact with hamas - which is considers a terrorist organization . at the brussels press conference , ferrero-waldner said this temporary mechanism would continue but offered fayyad technical assistance to get his finance ministry in order . she also repeated the international demands that the palestinian government renounce violence , formally recognize israel 's right to exist and abide by former agreements .
ferrero-waldner said until that happened the eu would only deal with what it considered to be western-friendly members of the new palestinian fatah-hamas unity government , which took power in march this year . bildunterschrift : lawmakers voted last month for a new unity government ferrero-waldner said she could " imagine informal exploratory talks " with foreign minister ziad abu amr , who , like fayyad , is an independent . fayyad , who as finance minister under the previous fatah government won praise for his reform of palestinian finances , said the unity government was committed to a platform to abide by " all the agreements entered into " . fayyad also met with the eu 's middle east peace envoy , marc otte , and european parliament leaders .
he is set to travel on to norway , which brokered an israeli-palestinian peace deal in 1993 , and then onto washington . dw staff / afp -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de seize the moment for peace , merkel urges middle east current eu president german chancellor angela merkel on sunday urged middle east states to seize the moment and revive the stalled peace process as she met israeli and palestinian leaders .

but it seems the 18m long strip of wall was n't nicked by souvenir hunters , it was hoisted off by the berlin government . erich stanke , who said he bought the chunk of wall back in 1990 from a border guard , is more than peeved .
he described the government 's action as a " cloak and dagger " affair . " people were shot here , and now this piece of human world heritage has simply been ripped up , " he said .
" it 's a disgrace . " stanke has lodged a complaint with the police because the contractors who removed the wall from potsdamer platz bored two holes in order to yank it out . " the wall is a protected monument and now it 's damaged , " stanke said . popular with tourists camera touting tourists regularly visited the piece of wall , which was brightly painted with graffiti and murals , such as a trabant , a typical east german car , bursting through the wall .
another mural carries the slogan " do n't destroy history " - a reference to attempts to preserve the berlin wall . the federal office for building and regional planning , who ordered the chunk 's removal , does n't know what all the fuss is about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potsdamer platz is now famous for its modern architecture " it 's been common knowledge for quite some time " that piece would have to make way for a new environment office building , spokesperson andreas kübler told the berliner zeitung . according to kübler , contrary to stanke 's claims , the city owned the piece of wall .
once the project is completed at the end of 2008 , the strip of wall will be on display inside the building and tourists will still be able to see it through a window . wider debate but the exchange of words over this one piece of wall is part of a much bigger debate .
for some berliners , the wall is a despised symbol of a totalitarian regime and should be completely destroyed .
for others , it 's a cultural artifact that should be kept for future generations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans called the wall souvenir hunters " mauerspecht " or " wallpeckers " only a few pieces of the berlin wall survived opening up of eastern germany on november 19 , 1989 and the resulting souvenir-hunting frenzy .
five months after the event , there were only six sections in the inner-city left standing . several of these remnants were in potsdamer platz , which lies in the center of berlin .
in the 1990s , the square underwent a massive rebuilding campaign - and in 1999 of chunks of wall were removed to make way for glittering modern skyscrapers . now , a rather inconspicuous line of cobblestone set in the pavement is otherwise the only mark of the former barrier between east and west germany . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans celebrate unity day with mixed emotions as germans celebrate the 16th anniversary of reunification tuesday , there 's no masking a sense of disillusionment at the failure to tackle the country 's economic and demographic woes resulting from the tumultuous event .

but it seems the 18m long strip of wall was n't nicked by souvenir hunters , it was hoisted off by the berlin government . erich stanke , who said he bought the chunk of wall back in 1990 from a border guard , is more than peeved .
he described the government 's action as a " cloak and dagger " affair . " people were shot here , and now this piece of human world heritage has simply been ripped up , " he said .
" it 's a disgrace . " stanke has lodged a complaint with the police because the contractors who removed the wall from potsdamer platz bored two holes in order to yank it out . " the wall is a protected monument and now it 's damaged , " stanke said . popular with tourists camera touting tourists regularly visited the piece of wall , which was brightly painted with graffiti and murals , such as a trabant , a typical east german car , bursting through the wall .
another mural carries the slogan " do n't destroy history " - a reference to attempts to preserve the berlin wall . the federal office for building and regional planning , who ordered the chunk 's removal , does n't know what all the fuss is about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potsdamer platz is now famous for its modern architecture " it 's been common knowledge for quite some time " that piece would have to make way for a new environment office building , spokesperson andreas kübler told the berliner zeitung . according to kübler , contrary to stanke 's claims , the city owned the piece of wall .
once the project is completed at the end of 2008 , the strip of wall will be on display inside the building and tourists will still be able to see it through a window . wider debate but the exchange of words over this one piece of wall is part of a much bigger debate .
for some berliners , the wall is a despised symbol of a totalitarian regime and should be completely destroyed .
for others , it 's a cultural artifact that should be kept for future generations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans called the wall souvenir hunters " mauerspecht " or " wallpeckers " only a few pieces of the berlin wall survived opening up of eastern germany on november 19 , 1989 and the resulting souvenir-hunting frenzy .
five months after the event , there were only six sections in the inner-city left standing . several of these remnants were in potsdamer platz , which lies in the center of berlin .
in the 1990s , the square underwent a massive rebuilding campaign - and in 1999 of chunks of wall were removed to make way for glittering modern skyscrapers . now , a rather inconspicuous line of cobblestone set in the pavement is otherwise the only mark of the former barrier between east and west germany . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans celebrate unity day with mixed emotions as germans celebrate the 16th anniversary of reunification tuesday , there 's no masking a sense of disillusionment at the failure to tackle the country 's economic and demographic woes resulting from the tumultuous event .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.04.2007 eu member bulgaria still bears signs of its communist past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria became a member of the european union on jan .
1 , 2007 bulgaria now marks the european union 's new eastern border .
although the country still bears the signs of its communist past , there is also evidence of a move toward european standards . at sofia 's new international airport terminal , new signs welcome visitors to " the eu country , bulgaria , " and the passport control boasts new counters - one for eu and the other for non-eu citizens . outside the terminal , shiny new taxis wait to ferry customers into the city .
next to the meter , a sticker tells people their ride will cost them some two leva per kilometer - about one euro -lrb- $ 1.33 -rrb- . many of the taxis in sofia 's capital are also new , but a ride in one of them costs about 75 percent less than the taxis at the international terminal .
this price difference is completely legal , but it does beg the question of why the cheap taxis have n't managed to find their way out to the airport ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why are the taxis in town cheaper than at the airport ?
the reason ca n't be because the taxi drivers get lost - sofia 's roads and freeways are now signposted to european standards . the mafia ? in the past few years , there have been spectacular headlines about former communist functionaries and secret service officers who managed to privatize - in their own creative ways - the state 's treasuries and meet the challenges of the market economy with gold-stuffed suitcases in their hands . according to dimitar ludzhev , who was deputy-prime minister in bulgaria 's first non-communist government , the secret service played a key roll in this .
those working in bulgaria 's 300 foreign-based firms gathered intelligence and carried out economic espionage , while the domestic secret service was in charge of the smuggling routes and the illegal transfers of luxury goods . many observers say this was the birth of organized crime in bulgaria .
after the fall of communism in 1989 , those who had worked for the secret police used their knowledge to stay in business - but this time in the private " shadow " economy . no kickbacks ? bulgaria 's border with non-eu member serbia lies just 60 km -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- away from its capital city sofia .
but there 's not much traffic heading out of bulgaria towards its western neighbor these days along the route which used to be heavily used as part of the highway system running from turkey over sofia to belgrade and budapest and then to western europe . some trucks and busses are waiting at the kalotina border crossing , with turkish , bulgarian and german plates .
everything seems to be working smoothly and efficiently - the police and customers officers are friendly and do n't mind us observing their work . bildunterschrift : former secret service members are allegedly still involved in border smuggling there are also new signs on the border : " no payments here , only passport control . "
this has a clear meaning - bribery has no place here .
well not any more , as the officers at the border explain with a degree of pride . but even if kickbacks are no longer expected at kalotin , it 's a different story in other parts of eastern europe according to one of the bus drivers . " well , in serbia , five euros are expected unless you want to wait two or three hours , " he said .
" and it 's the same in hungary , that is if you do n't want to have your whole luggage searched . " not the same everywhere europe 's new eastern border is long and winds from kalotina south to the strumica river , where it meets the greek and macedonian borders .
here , just near the border lies blagoevgrad - earlier a well-known smuggling town and today infamous as the gangster capital of bulgaria . peter ivanov , 26 , from blagoevgrad 's radio station , joked that nowhere else in europe are there so many limousines as here .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.04.2007 europol seeks broader mandate amid growing terror threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol says it requires extended powers to meet the challenges of the new threat eu police arrested over 700 terror suspects last year , according to a report released tuesday .
half of the arrests involved islamist extremism - the most dangerous variety of terrorism , the report says . the cross-border police agency europol released the report as eu politicians debated proposals to expand the powers of european law enforcement .
presenting the report to the european parliament in brussels on tuesday , europol chief max-peter ratzel made the case for a broader mandate for his organization . “ the mandate is currently limited to organized crime , which means that in each individual case we have to demonstrate a link or connection to local structures before we pass on the data , ” ratzel explained to a parliamentary committee .
“ in the fields of serial murder , online child pornography or travelling hooligans , local structures are generally not affected , but that is precisely the added value for -lrb- eu -rrb- member states . ” the eu commission has already proposed a reform bill to expand europol ’ s mandate , and the german presidency of the european union has also endorsed the proposal .
ratzel said terrorism is a situation that affects europe as a whole , and that it was important to share information among the member states in order to “ recognize the signs early on and act pre-emptively on dangers . ” but this also earned the europol chief some criticism from parliamentarians concerned about privacy rights .
agustín díaz de mera of the conservative evp told ratzel his agency needed to adopt more “ democratic transparency . ” separatists responsible for bulk of eu terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eta bomb at madrid 's barajas international airport ratzel expressed concern about what the europol report says is a growing threat of terrorism in europe .
nearly 500 terrorism-related offences were carried out in the 27-nation bloc last year , the report says ; however , most of them were carried out by separatists on the french island of corsica and in the spanish basque region . with 343 arrests last year , france saw the largest amount of terrorist activity .
most attacks took place on the mediterranean island of corsica , where separatists opposed to french rule have waged a low-intensity war of independence for over three decades . most of these attacks only caused property damage , with the notable exception of basque separatist group eta ’ s december 30th bombing of a parking garage at madrid barajas international airport , which killed two people and wounded several dozen more .
it was one of 145 attacks in spain last year , and the group ’ s first fatal attack since 2003 . europol says eta has “ rebuilt its capabilities ” despite a march 2006 truce with the spanish government , and is prepared to “ strike with well-prepared , organized and coordinated attacks against high-profile targets . ”
eta on sunday stood by the 2006 ceasefire , but said it would resume its armed struggle for basque independence if spain did not allow eta ’ s banned political wing to participate in local elections in may . 156 people were arrested on terrorism charges in britain .
europol did not list any terror-related offences for the 10 newest member states , most of them eastern european , that joined the eu in 2004 . islamist extremism called greatest danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic terrorism is the most dangerous , the report says the report says that acts of terrorism motivated by radical islamic ideologies pose the greatest threat to european security , in part because they aim to maximize human casualties .
as examples of islamic extremism in europe , the report cites the failed plot to bomb two regional trains in western germany . that plot was foiled by fate rather than by the police , as the crude suitcase bombs did not go off due to a technical malfunction .
ratzel also mentions last year ’ s attempted attack on transatlantic flights from british airports , which was foiled by the authorities at the last minute . the report says half of the total number of arrests was related to islamist militants .
as examples of terrorist crimes , the police agency lists disseminating terrorist propaganda , financing terrorism , forging documents or providing safe houses for illegal operatives , among others . “ we have to take care that these things don ’ t further escalate , ” ratzel told the parliamentary committee . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany determined to strengthen european police agency germany 's security policy during its eu presidency aims to give europol additional powers in order to better fight international terrorism and cross-border crime .
it also calls for improved police cooperation .
-lrb- 04.01.2007 -rrb- germans warned to be vigilant against terror threat in her weekly video podcast , the german chancellor has urged germans to help police combat terrorism .
but she warned that measures such as video surveillance were n't enough .

half of the arrests involved islamist extremism - the most dangerous variety of terrorism , the report says . the cross-border police agency europol released the report as eu politicians debated proposals to expand the powers of european law enforcement .
presenting the report to the european parliament in brussels on tuesday , europol chief max-peter ratzel made the case for a broader mandate for his organization . “ the mandate is currently limited to organized crime , which means that in each individual case we have to demonstrate a link or connection to local structures before we pass on the data , ” ratzel explained to a parliamentary committee .
“ in the fields of serial murder , online child pornography or travelling hooligans , local structures are generally not affected , but that is precisely the added value for -lrb- eu -rrb- member states . ” the eu commission has already proposed a reform bill to expand europol ’ s mandate , and the german presidency of the european union has also endorsed the proposal .
ratzel said terrorism is a situation that affects europe as a whole , and that it was important to share information among the member states in order to “ recognize the signs early on and act pre-emptively on dangers . ” but this also earned the europol chief some criticism from parliamentarians concerned about privacy rights .
agustín díaz de mera of the conservative evp told ratzel his agency needed to adopt more “ democratic transparency . ” separatists responsible for bulk of eu terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eta bomb at madrid 's barajas international airport ratzel expressed concern about what the europol report says is a growing threat of terrorism in europe .
nearly 500 terrorism-related offences were carried out in the 27-nation bloc last year , the report says ; however , most of them were carried out by separatists on the french island of corsica and in the spanish basque region . with 343 arrests last year , france saw the largest amount of terrorist activity .
most attacks took place on the mediterranean island of corsica , where separatists opposed to french rule have waged a low-intensity war of independence for over three decades . most of these attacks only caused property damage , with the notable exception of basque separatist group eta ’ s december 30th bombing of a parking garage at madrid barajas international airport , which killed two people and wounded several dozen more .
it was one of 145 attacks in spain last year , and the group ’ s first fatal attack since 2003 . europol says eta has “ rebuilt its capabilities ” despite a march 2006 truce with the spanish government , and is prepared to “ strike with well-prepared , organized and coordinated attacks against high-profile targets . ”
eta on sunday stood by the 2006 ceasefire , but said it would resume its armed struggle for basque independence if spain did not allow eta ’ s banned political wing to participate in local elections in may . 156 people were arrested on terrorism charges in britain .
europol did not list any terror-related offences for the 10 newest member states , most of them eastern european , that joined the eu in 2004 . islamist extremism called greatest danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic terrorism is the most dangerous , the report says the report says that acts of terrorism motivated by radical islamic ideologies pose the greatest threat to european security , in part because they aim to maximize human casualties .
as examples of islamic extremism in europe , the report cites the failed plot to bomb two regional trains in western germany . that plot was foiled by fate rather than by the police , as the crude suitcase bombs did not go off due to a technical malfunction .
ratzel also mentions last year ’ s attempted attack on transatlantic flights from british airports , which was foiled by the authorities at the last minute . the report says half of the total number of arrests was related to islamist militants .
as examples of terrorist crimes , the police agency lists disseminating terrorist propaganda , financing terrorism , forging documents or providing safe houses for illegal operatives , among others . “ we have to take care that these things don ’ t further escalate , ” ratzel told the parliamentary committee . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany determined to strengthen european police agency germany 's security policy during its eu presidency aims to give europol additional powers in order to better fight international terrorism and cross-border crime .

half of the arrests involved islamist extremism - the most dangerous variety of terrorism , the report says . the cross-border police agency europol released the report as eu politicians debated proposals to expand the powers of european law enforcement .
presenting the report to the european parliament in brussels on tuesday , europol chief max-peter ratzel made the case for a broader mandate for his organization . “ the mandate is currently limited to organized crime , which means that in each individual case we have to demonstrate a link or connection to local structures before we pass on the data , ” ratzel explained to a parliamentary committee .
“ in the fields of serial murder , online child pornography or travelling hooligans , local structures are generally not affected , but that is precisely the added value for -lrb- eu -rrb- member states . ” the eu commission has already proposed a reform bill to expand europol ’ s mandate , and the german presidency of the european union has also endorsed the proposal .
ratzel said terrorism is a situation that affects europe as a whole , and that it was important to share information among the member states in order to “ recognize the signs early on and act pre-emptively on dangers . ” but this also earned the europol chief some criticism from parliamentarians concerned about privacy rights .
agustín díaz de mera of the conservative evp told ratzel his agency needed to adopt more “ democratic transparency . ” separatists responsible for bulk of eu terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eta bomb at madrid 's barajas international airport ratzel expressed concern about what the europol report says is a growing threat of terrorism in europe .
nearly 500 terrorism-related offences were carried out in the 27-nation bloc last year , the report says ; however , most of them were carried out by separatists on the french island of corsica and in the spanish basque region . with 343 arrests last year , france saw the largest amount of terrorist activity .
most attacks took place on the mediterranean island of corsica , where separatists opposed to french rule have waged a low-intensity war of independence for over three decades . most of these attacks only caused property damage , with the notable exception of basque separatist group eta ’ s december 30th bombing of a parking garage at madrid barajas international airport , which killed two people and wounded several dozen more .
it was one of 145 attacks in spain last year , and the group ’ s first fatal attack since 2003 . europol says eta has “ rebuilt its capabilities ” despite a march 2006 truce with the spanish government , and is prepared to “ strike with well-prepared , organized and coordinated attacks against high-profile targets . ”
eta on sunday stood by the 2006 ceasefire , but said it would resume its armed struggle for basque independence if spain did not allow eta ’ s banned political wing to participate in local elections in may . 156 people were arrested on terrorism charges in britain .
europol did not list any terror-related offences for the 10 newest member states , most of them eastern european , that joined the eu in 2004 . islamist extremism called greatest danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic terrorism is the most dangerous , the report says the report says that acts of terrorism motivated by radical islamic ideologies pose the greatest threat to european security , in part because they aim to maximize human casualties .
as examples of islamic extremism in europe , the report cites the failed plot to bomb two regional trains in western germany . that plot was foiled by fate rather than by the police , as the crude suitcase bombs did not go off due to a technical malfunction .
ratzel also mentions last year ’ s attempted attack on transatlantic flights from british airports , which was foiled by the authorities at the last minute . the report says half of the total number of arrests was related to islamist militants .
as examples of terrorist crimes , the police agency lists disseminating terrorist propaganda , financing terrorism , forging documents or providing safe houses for illegal operatives , among others . “ we have to take care that these things don ’ t further escalate , ” ratzel told the parliamentary committee . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany determined to strengthen european police agency germany 's security policy during its eu presidency aims to give europol additional powers in order to better fight international terrorism and cross-border crime .

next to the meter , a sticker tells people their ride will cost them some two leva per kilometer - about one euro -lrb- $ 1.33 -rrb- . many of the taxis in sofia 's capital are also new , but a ride in one of them costs about 75 percent less than the taxis at the international terminal .
this price difference is completely legal , but it does beg the question of why the cheap taxis have n't managed to find their way out to the airport ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why are the taxis in town cheaper than at the airport ?
the reason ca n't be because the taxi drivers get lost - sofia 's roads and freeways are now signposted to european standards . the mafia ? in the past few years , there have been spectacular headlines about former communist functionaries and secret service officers who managed to privatize - in their own creative ways - the state 's treasuries and meet the challenges of the market economy with gold-stuffed suitcases in their hands . according to dimitar ludzhev , who was deputy-prime minister in bulgaria 's first non-communist government , the secret service played a key roll in this .
those working in bulgaria 's 300 foreign-based firms gathered intelligence and carried out economic espionage , while the domestic secret service was in charge of the smuggling routes and the illegal transfers of luxury goods . many observers say this was the birth of organized crime in bulgaria .
after the fall of communism in 1989 , those who had worked for the secret police used their knowledge to stay in business - but this time in the private " shadow " economy . no kickbacks ? bulgaria 's border with non-eu member serbia lies just 60 km -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- away from its capital city sofia .
but there 's not much traffic heading out of bulgaria towards its western neighbor these days along the route which used to be heavily used as part of the highway system running from turkey over sofia to belgrade and budapest and then to western europe . some trucks and busses are waiting at the kalotina border crossing , with turkish , bulgarian and german plates .

" well , in serbia , five euros are expected unless you want to wait two or three hours , " he said .
" and it 's the same in hungary , that is if you do n't want to have your whole luggage searched . " not the same everywhere europe 's new eastern border is long and winds from kalotina south to the strumica river , where it meets the greek and macedonian borders .
here , just near the border lies blagoevgrad - earlier a well-known smuggling town and today infamous as the gangster capital of bulgaria . peter ivanov , 26 , from blagoevgrad 's radio station , joked that nowhere else in europe are there so many limousines as here .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.04.2007 opinion : the world does n't know how to deal with iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some see one provocation after another coming from iran , while others do n't take president ahmedinejad seriously .
what 's missing , wrote dw ’ s peter philipp , is mutual trust . " what else is new ? " one could have asked when iran 's president mahmud ahmedinejad announced last weekend that his country is capable of industrially enriching uranium and now belongs to the nuclear club . but no one said that . instead , some saw the announcement as a new " provocation " of the west and began to speculate about when iran 's first nuclear bomb would be finished .
they also started to get used to the americans ' missile shield plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others , on the other hand , scoffed at the announcement .
they said iran really was n't that far along and ahmedinejad 's speech only proved that he is a good actor . as varied and contradictory as the reactions may be , they demonstrate yet again that the world does n't know how to deal with iran .
even competent experts all too often fall back on generalizations when it comes to the " iran issue . "
they speak of the " persian nuclear bomb " and try to measure just how close tehran is to reaching this goal . instead , a bit more sobriety and reserve are called for .
thus far , the " goal " of an iranian nuclear bomb has only existed in the minds of those who had always been suspicious of the regime in tehran and the revitalization of islam and politics that it embodied . how else can it be explained that , although iran has continually claimed that its atomic research is for peaceful purposes only and has belonged to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty for a long time already , it is still accused of having bad intentions ?
at the same time , not the slightest effort has been made to help the countries in the region that have not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty - israel , india and pakistan - to find the " right path . " the imbalance of the situation becomes even more apparent when we consider that legitimate circles of experts are not even blaming iran for enriching uranium , which is permitted under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
instead , iran is accused of not following the resolutions of the un security council , which is demanding precisely that which can not be demanded from iran - the suspension of its uranium enrichment program . nevertheless , it is indeed a good thing that there are those who are now appealing for negotiations with tehran .

what 's missing , wrote dw ’ s peter philipp , is mutual trust . " what else is new ? " one could have asked when iran 's president mahmud ahmedinejad announced last weekend that his country is capable of industrially enriching uranium and now belongs to the nuclear club . but no one said that . instead , some saw the announcement as a new " provocation " of the west and began to speculate about when iran 's first nuclear bomb would be finished .
they also started to get used to the americans ' missile shield plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others , on the other hand , scoffed at the announcement .
they said iran really was n't that far along and ahmedinejad 's speech only proved that he is a good actor . as varied and contradictory as the reactions may be , they demonstrate yet again that the world does n't know how to deal with iran .
even competent experts all too often fall back on generalizations when it comes to the " iran issue . "
they speak of the " persian nuclear bomb " and try to measure just how close tehran is to reaching this goal . instead , a bit more sobriety and reserve are called for .
thus far , the " goal " of an iranian nuclear bomb has only existed in the minds of those who had always been suspicious of the regime in tehran and the revitalization of islam and politics that it embodied . how else can it be explained that , although iran has continually claimed that its atomic research is for peaceful purposes only and has belonged to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty for a long time already , it is still accused of having bad intentions ?
at the same time , not the slightest effort has been made to help the countries in the region that have not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty - israel , india and pakistan - to find the " right path . " the imbalance of the situation becomes even more apparent when we consider that legitimate circles of experts are not even blaming iran for enriching uranium , which is permitted under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
instead , iran is accused of not following the resolutions of the un security council , which is demanding precisely that which can not be demanded from iran - the suspension of its uranium enrichment program . nevertheless , it is indeed a good thing that there are those who are now appealing for negotiations with tehran .
without reciprocation , such negotiations are useless and it is unacceptable that governments are negotiating with tehran while at the same time enforcing sanctions . only when the west opens up to iran and drops its unjustified prerequisites can the tension ease .

1 , 2007 bulgaria now marks the european union 's new eastern border .
although the country still bears the signs of its communist past , there is also evidence of a move toward european standards . at sofia 's new international airport terminal , new signs welcome visitors to " the eu country , bulgaria , " and the passport control boasts new counters - one for eu and the other for non-eu citizens . outside the terminal , shiny new taxis wait to ferry customers into the city .
next to the meter , a sticker tells people their ride will cost them some two leva per kilometer - about one euro -lrb- $ 1.33 -rrb- . many of the taxis in sofia 's capital are also new , but a ride in one of them costs about 75 percent less than the taxis at the international terminal .
this price difference is completely legal , but it does beg the question of why the cheap taxis have n't managed to find their way out to the airport ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why are the taxis in town cheaper than at the airport ?
the reason ca n't be because the taxi drivers get lost - sofia 's roads and freeways are now signposted to european standards . the mafia ? in the past few years , there have been spectacular headlines about former communist functionaries and secret service officers who managed to privatize - in their own creative ways - the state 's treasuries and meet the challenges of the market economy with gold-stuffed suitcases in their hands . according to dimitar ludzhev , who was deputy-prime minister in bulgaria 's first non-communist government , the secret service played a key roll in this .
those working in bulgaria 's 300 foreign-based firms gathered intelligence and carried out economic espionage , while the domestic secret service was in charge of the smuggling routes and the illegal transfers of luxury goods . many observers say this was the birth of organized crime in bulgaria .
after the fall of communism in 1989 , those who had worked for the secret police used their knowledge to stay in business - but this time in the private " shadow " economy . no kickbacks ? bulgaria 's border with non-eu member serbia lies just 60 km -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- away from its capital city sofia .
but there 's not much traffic heading out of bulgaria towards its western neighbor these days along the route which used to be heavily used as part of the highway system running from turkey over sofia to belgrade and budapest and then to western europe . some trucks and busses are waiting at the kalotina border crossing , with turkish , bulgarian and german plates .
everything seems to be working smoothly and efficiently - the police and customers officers are friendly and do n't mind us observing their work . bildunterschrift : former secret service members are allegedly still involved in border smuggling there are also new signs on the border : " no payments here , only passport control . "
this has a clear meaning - bribery has no place here .
well not any more , as the officers at the border explain with a degree of pride . but even if kickbacks are no longer expected at kalotin , it 's a different story in other parts of eastern europe according to one of the bus drivers . " well , in serbia , five euros are expected unless you want to wait two or three hours , " he said .
" and it 's the same in hungary , that is if you do n't want to have your whole luggage searched . " not the same everywhere europe 's new eastern border is long and winds from kalotina south to the strumica river , where it meets the greek and macedonian borders .
here , just near the border lies blagoevgrad - earlier a well-known smuggling town and today infamous as the gangster capital of bulgaria . peter ivanov , 26 , from blagoevgrad 's radio station , joked that nowhere else in europe are there so many limousines as here .
his reason for blagoevgrad 's popularity with crime syndicates - its proximity to three borders . but dimitar ivanov -lrb- not related to peter ivanov -rrb- , a businessman , who used to work for bulgaria 's secret service , is adamant that former members of the service have nothing to do with the bulgarian mafia . " it 's a propaganda theory , " dimitar ivanov said .
" it 's propaganda from the right . " his former colleague in the secrete service zvetko zvetkov , however , would beg to differ . " you could very well establish a link -lrb- between the mafia -rrb- and the former secret service and the former regime , " zvetkov said . zvetkov , who in communist times was in charge of spying on the intellectuals , has been trying for years to shed light on the links between the bulgarian secret service and the criminal underworld . hartmut lüning and alexander andreev -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bulgaria : building a controversial eu transit route european union funds are financing a conflict-ridden highway on the outskirts of sofia .

the reason ca n't be because the taxi drivers get lost - sofia 's roads and freeways are now signposted to european standards . the mafia ? in the past few years , there have been spectacular headlines about former communist functionaries and secret service officers who managed to privatize - in their own creative ways - the state 's treasuries and meet the challenges of the market economy with gold-stuffed suitcases in their hands . according to dimitar ludzhev , who was deputy-prime minister in bulgaria 's first non-communist government , the secret service played a key roll in this .
those working in bulgaria 's 300 foreign-based firms gathered intelligence and carried out economic espionage , while the domestic secret service was in charge of the smuggling routes and the illegal transfers of luxury goods . many observers say this was the birth of organized crime in bulgaria .
after the fall of communism in 1989 , those who had worked for the secret police used their knowledge to stay in business - but this time in the private " shadow " economy . no kickbacks ? bulgaria 's border with non-eu member serbia lies just 60 km -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- away from its capital city sofia .
but there 's not much traffic heading out of bulgaria towards its western neighbor these days along the route which used to be heavily used as part of the highway system running from turkey over sofia to belgrade and budapest and then to western europe . some trucks and busses are waiting at the kalotina border crossing , with turkish , bulgarian and german plates .
everything seems to be working smoothly and efficiently - the police and customers officers are friendly and do n't mind us observing their work . bildunterschrift : former secret service members are allegedly still involved in border smuggling there are also new signs on the border : " no payments here , only passport control . "
this has a clear meaning - bribery has no place here .
well not any more , as the officers at the border explain with a degree of pride . but even if kickbacks are no longer expected at kalotin , it 's a different story in other parts of eastern europe according to one of the bus drivers . " well , in serbia , five euros are expected unless you want to wait two or three hours , " he said .
" and it 's the same in hungary , that is if you do n't want to have your whole luggage searched . " not the same everywhere europe 's new eastern border is long and winds from kalotina south to the strumica river , where it meets the greek and macedonian borders .
here , just near the border lies blagoevgrad - earlier a well-known smuggling town and today infamous as the gangster capital of bulgaria . peter ivanov , 26 , from blagoevgrad 's radio station , joked that nowhere else in europe are there so many limousines as here .
his reason for blagoevgrad 's popularity with crime syndicates - its proximity to three borders . but dimitar ivanov -lrb- not related to peter ivanov -rrb- , a businessman , who used to work for bulgaria 's secret service , is adamant that former members of the service have nothing to do with the bulgarian mafia . " it 's a propaganda theory , " dimitar ivanov said .
" it 's propaganda from the right . " his former colleague in the secrete service zvetko zvetkov , however , would beg to differ . " you could very well establish a link -lrb- between the mafia -rrb- and the former secret service and the former regime , " zvetkov said . zvetkov , who in communist times was in charge of spying on the intellectuals , has been trying for years to shed light on the links between the bulgarian secret service and the criminal underworld . hartmut lüning and alexander andreev -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bulgaria : building a controversial eu transit route european union funds are financing a conflict-ridden highway on the outskirts of sofia .
but bulgarian environmental groups claim the new road will do little to alleviate the capital 's traffic nightmare .
-lrb- 21.03.2007 -rrb- european papers give cool reception to new eu members european commentators on tuesday had mixed reactions about bulgaria and romania 's entry into the european union .
-lrb- 02.01.2007 -rrb- will eu entry shrink bulgaria 's population even more ?
bulgarian towns are shrinking , and the birth rate is falling rapidly .
now bulgarians are worried that even more of their young people will leave after the country joins the eu on jan 1 .

but it seems the 18m long strip of wall was n't nicked by souvenir hunters , it was hoisted off by the berlin government . erich stanke , who said he bought the chunk of wall back in 1990 from a border guard , is more than peeved .
he described the government 's action as a " cloak and dagger " affair . " people were shot here , and now this piece of human world heritage has simply been ripped up , " he said .
" it 's a disgrace . " stanke has lodged a complaint with the police because the contractors who removed the wall from potsdamer platz bored two holes in order to yank it out . " the wall is a protected monument and now it 's damaged , " stanke said . popular with tourists camera touting tourists regularly visited the piece of wall , which was brightly painted with graffiti and murals , such as a trabant , a typical east german car , bursting through the wall .
another mural carries the slogan " do n't destroy history " - a reference to attempts to preserve the berlin wall . the federal office for building and regional planning , who ordered the chunk 's removal , does n't know what all the fuss is about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potsdamer platz is now famous for its modern architecture " it 's been common knowledge for quite some time " that piece would have to make way for a new environment office building , spokesperson andreas kübler told the berliner zeitung . according to kübler , contrary to stanke 's claims , the city owned the piece of wall .
once the project is completed at the end of 2008 , the strip of wall will be on display inside the building and tourists will still be able to see it through a window . wider debate but the exchange of words over this one piece of wall is part of a much bigger debate .
for some berliners , the wall is a despised symbol of a totalitarian regime and should be completely destroyed .
for others , it 's a cultural artifact that should be kept for future generations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans called the wall souvenir hunters " mauerspecht " or " wallpeckers " only a few pieces of the berlin wall survived opening up of eastern germany on november 19 , 1989 and the resulting souvenir-hunting frenzy .
five months after the event , there were only six sections in the inner-city left standing . several of these remnants were in potsdamer platz , which lies in the center of berlin .
in the 1990s , the square underwent a massive rebuilding campaign - and in 1999 of chunks of wall were removed to make way for glittering modern skyscrapers . now , a rather inconspicuous line of cobblestone set in the pavement is otherwise the only mark of the former barrier between east and west germany . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans celebrate unity day with mixed emotions as germans celebrate the 16th anniversary of reunification tuesday , there 's no masking a sense of disillusionment at the failure to tackle the country 's economic and demographic woes resulting from the tumultuous event .

the first leg in italy ended in a draw .
so who 's more likely to progress ? no one is more qualified to answer a question about bayern munich versus ac milan than giovanni trapattoni , who has coached both clubs during his storied career .
he told dw-world.de to expect a close match on wednesday . " it 's still wide open , " trapattoni said .
" of course , bayern are the slight favorites , but 2-all is a difficult first-leg result .
they ca n't just go full bore offensively at home , because milan - with players like kaká , gilardino or inzaghi - are very dangerous on the counter-attack .
a waiting game would also be risky .
but if bayern play the same way they did in milan they 'll get through . " munich clawed out a draw in san siro last week , thanks to a pair of goals by defender daniel van buyten , so in fact they 'll be looking to hold milan to fewer than two goals . bayern 's main worries are midfielder bastian schweinsteiger , who 's touch-and-go with a banged-up knee , and milan 's filippo inzaghi .
no one has scored more often against bayern in the champions league than the crafty striker .
still , bayern have no reason to be quaking in their boots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milan up-ended bayern last year in the champions league " this year , " trapattoni said , " milan are n't showing anything like their past form , and not all their players at their best .
they went all out to win their home leg .
they tried to score goals , and in the end , it did n't turn out well . " wednesday 's other semi-final should be a far more relaxed affair , with liverpool taking a 3-nil advantage over psv eindhoven into anfield .
the dutch guests , who are focusing on their domestic league , have already indicated they 'll rest some key players for the match . man u steamroll rome , chelsea pip valencia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cristiano ronaldo booted a pair of goals past rome in the rout whoever prevails in munich may wish they had n't , as their semi-final opponents will be manchester united .
the red devils progressed on tuesday after flattening as rome 7-1 in old trafford . man u clearly wanted to send a message after an away leg marred by violence against their supporters and some controversial refereeing decisions .
michael carrick scored the opener in the 11th minute , and in the barrage that followed , rome could hardly have been more shocked , had george best returned from the dead , pint glass in hand , to knock one past luckless keeper doni . meanwhile , manchester 's premiership rivals were doing what they do best against valencia - getting a narrow , and somewhat fortunate result . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea just managed to push their way past well-organized valencia the blues traveled to spain needing to make up for a disappointing 1-all draw in the first leg , and things did n't look good when the hosts took a 1-nil lead into the break . but much-criticized striker andriy shevchenko knotted things up in the 52nd minute .
and michael essian sent chelsea through just before time after a crucial blunder by valencia keeper santiago canizares . chelsea will now most likely have a date with liverpool later this month . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chelsea draw ; man u lose in rome english sides chelsea and manchester did not impress on wednesday evening .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.04.2007 europol seeks broader mandate amid growing terror threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol says it requires extended powers to meet the challenges of the new threat eu police arrested over 700 terror suspects last year , according to a report released tuesday .
half of the arrests involved islamist extremism - the most dangerous variety of terrorism , the report says . the cross-border police agency europol released the report as eu politicians debated proposals to expand the powers of european law enforcement .
presenting the report to the european parliament in brussels on tuesday , europol chief max-peter ratzel made the case for a broader mandate for his organization . “ the mandate is currently limited to organized crime , which means that in each individual case we have to demonstrate a link or connection to local structures before we pass on the data , ” ratzel explained to a parliamentary committee .
“ in the fields of serial murder , online child pornography or travelling hooligans , local structures are generally not affected , but that is precisely the added value for -lrb- eu -rrb- member states . ” the eu commission has already proposed a reform bill to expand europol ’ s mandate , and the german presidency of the european union has also endorsed the proposal .
ratzel said terrorism is a situation that affects europe as a whole , and that it was important to share information among the member states in order to “ recognize the signs early on and act pre-emptively on dangers . ” but this also earned the europol chief some criticism from parliamentarians concerned about privacy rights .
agustín díaz de mera of the conservative evp told ratzel his agency needed to adopt more “ democratic transparency . ” separatists responsible for bulk of eu terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eta bomb at madrid 's barajas international airport ratzel expressed concern about what the europol report says is a growing threat of terrorism in europe .
nearly 500 terrorism-related offences were carried out in the 27-nation bloc last year , the report says ; however , most of them were carried out by separatists on the french island of corsica and in the spanish basque region . with 343 arrests last year , france saw the largest amount of terrorist activity .
most attacks took place on the mediterranean island of corsica , where separatists opposed to french rule have waged a low-intensity war of independence for over three decades . most of these attacks only caused property damage , with the notable exception of basque separatist group eta ’ s december 30th bombing of a parking garage at madrid barajas international airport , which killed two people and wounded several dozen more .
it was one of 145 attacks in spain last year , and the group ’ s first fatal attack since 2003 . europol says eta has “ rebuilt its capabilities ” despite a march 2006 truce with the spanish government , and is prepared to “ strike with well-prepared , organized and coordinated attacks against high-profile targets . ”
eta on sunday stood by the 2006 ceasefire , but said it would resume its armed struggle for basque independence if spain did not allow eta ’ s banned political wing to participate in local elections in may . 156 people were arrested on terrorism charges in britain .
europol did not list any terror-related offences for the 10 newest member states , most of them eastern european , that joined the eu in 2004 . islamist extremism called greatest danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic terrorism is the most dangerous , the report says the report says that acts of terrorism motivated by radical islamic ideologies pose the greatest threat to european security , in part because they aim to maximize human casualties .
as examples of islamic extremism in europe , the report cites the failed plot to bomb two regional trains in western germany . that plot was foiled by fate rather than by the police , as the crude suitcase bombs did not go off due to a technical malfunction .
ratzel also mentions last year ’ s attempted attack on transatlantic flights from british airports , which was foiled by the authorities at the last minute . the report says half of the total number of arrests was related to islamist militants .
as examples of terrorist crimes , the police agency lists disseminating terrorist propaganda , financing terrorism , forging documents or providing safe houses for illegal operatives , among others . “ we have to take care that these things don ’ t further escalate , ” ratzel told the parliamentary committee . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany determined to strengthen european police agency germany 's security policy during its eu presidency aims to give europol additional powers in order to better fight international terrorism and cross-border crime .

what 's missing , wrote dw ’ s peter philipp , is mutual trust . " what else is new ? " one could have asked when iran 's president mahmud ahmedinejad announced last weekend that his country is capable of industrially enriching uranium and now belongs to the nuclear club . but no one said that . instead , some saw the announcement as a new " provocation " of the west and began to speculate about when iran 's first nuclear bomb would be finished .
they also started to get used to the americans ' missile shield plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others , on the other hand , scoffed at the announcement .
they said iran really was n't that far along and ahmedinejad 's speech only proved that he is a good actor . as varied and contradictory as the reactions may be , they demonstrate yet again that the world does n't know how to deal with iran .
even competent experts all too often fall back on generalizations when it comes to the " iran issue . "
they speak of the " persian nuclear bomb " and try to measure just how close tehran is to reaching this goal . instead , a bit more sobriety and reserve are called for .
thus far , the " goal " of an iranian nuclear bomb has only existed in the minds of those who had always been suspicious of the regime in tehran and the revitalization of islam and politics that it embodied . how else can it be explained that , although iran has continually claimed that its atomic research is for peaceful purposes only and has belonged to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty for a long time already , it is still accused of having bad intentions ?
at the same time , not the slightest effort has been made to help the countries in the region that have not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty - israel , india and pakistan - to find the " right path . " the imbalance of the situation becomes even more apparent when we consider that legitimate circles of experts are not even blaming iran for enriching uranium , which is permitted under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
instead , iran is accused of not following the resolutions of the un security council , which is demanding precisely that which can not be demanded from iran - the suspension of its uranium enrichment program . nevertheless , it is indeed a good thing that there are those who are now appealing for negotiations with tehran .
without reciprocation , such negotiations are useless and it is unacceptable that governments are negotiating with tehran while at the same time enforcing sanctions . only when the west opens up to iran and drops its unjustified prerequisites can the tension ease .
of course , iran may still be charged with building nuclear weapons , but it has to be granted the rights that are matter of course for other countries . there 's no guarantee that iran wo n't build a nuclear bomb .
but mutual trust would be a valuable contribution to detente . peter philipp is a middle east ex per t and deutsche welle 's chief correspondent . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe warns iran not to defy un further in nuclear standoff the eu on tuesday urged tehran not to defy the united nations , increasing international diplomatic pressure on iran after it claimed to be able to enrich uranium on an industrial scale .

they said iran really was n't that far along and ahmedinejad 's speech only proved that he is a good actor . as varied and contradictory as the reactions may be , they demonstrate yet again that the world does n't know how to deal with iran .
even competent experts all too often fall back on generalizations when it comes to the " iran issue . "
they speak of the " persian nuclear bomb " and try to measure just how close tehran is to reaching this goal . instead , a bit more sobriety and reserve are called for .
thus far , the " goal " of an iranian nuclear bomb has only existed in the minds of those who had always been suspicious of the regime in tehran and the revitalization of islam and politics that it embodied . how else can it be explained that , although iran has continually claimed that its atomic research is for peaceful purposes only and has belonged to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty for a long time already , it is still accused of having bad intentions ?
at the same time , not the slightest effort has been made to help the countries in the region that have not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty - israel , india and pakistan - to find the " right path . " the imbalance of the situation becomes even more apparent when we consider that legitimate circles of experts are not even blaming iran for enriching uranium , which is permitted under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
instead , iran is accused of not following the resolutions of the un security council , which is demanding precisely that which can not be demanded from iran - the suspension of its uranium enrichment program . nevertheless , it is indeed a good thing that there are those who are now appealing for negotiations with tehran .
without reciprocation , such negotiations are useless and it is unacceptable that governments are negotiating with tehran while at the same time enforcing sanctions . only when the west opens up to iran and drops its unjustified prerequisites can the tension ease .
of course , iran may still be charged with building nuclear weapons , but it has to be granted the rights that are matter of course for other countries . there 's no guarantee that iran wo n't build a nuclear bomb .

what 's missing , wrote dw ’ s peter philipp , is mutual trust . " what else is new ? " one could have asked when iran 's president mahmud ahmedinejad announced last weekend that his country is capable of industrially enriching uranium and now belongs to the nuclear club . but no one said that . instead , some saw the announcement as a new " provocation " of the west and began to speculate about when iran 's first nuclear bomb would be finished .
they also started to get used to the americans ' missile shield plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others , on the other hand , scoffed at the announcement .
they said iran really was n't that far along and ahmedinejad 's speech only proved that he is a good actor . as varied and contradictory as the reactions may be , they demonstrate yet again that the world does n't know how to deal with iran .
even competent experts all too often fall back on generalizations when it comes to the " iran issue . "
they speak of the " persian nuclear bomb " and try to measure just how close tehran is to reaching this goal . instead , a bit more sobriety and reserve are called for .
thus far , the " goal " of an iranian nuclear bomb has only existed in the minds of those who had always been suspicious of the regime in tehran and the revitalization of islam and politics that it embodied . how else can it be explained that , although iran has continually claimed that its atomic research is for peaceful purposes only and has belonged to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty for a long time already , it is still accused of having bad intentions ?
at the same time , not the slightest effort has been made to help the countries in the region that have not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty - israel , india and pakistan - to find the " right path . " the imbalance of the situation becomes even more apparent when we consider that legitimate circles of experts are not even blaming iran for enriching uranium , which is permitted under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
instead , iran is accused of not following the resolutions of the un security council , which is demanding precisely that which can not be demanded from iran - the suspension of its uranium enrichment program . nevertheless , it is indeed a good thing that there are those who are now appealing for negotiations with tehran .
without reciprocation , such negotiations are useless and it is unacceptable that governments are negotiating with tehran while at the same time enforcing sanctions . only when the west opens up to iran and drops its unjustified prerequisites can the tension ease .
of course , iran may still be charged with building nuclear weapons , but it has to be granted the rights that are matter of course for other countries . there 's no guarantee that iran wo n't build a nuclear bomb .

starting wednesday , she is being tried for her involvement in two botched terrorist attacks . a suspected member of a german left-wing extremist group admitted in court wednesday to two failed bomb attacks in the 1980s as her trial began in berlin . the 58-year-old defendant , adrienne gerhäuser , presented a statement saying that she had " knowingly and willingly " attempted to bomb the berlin genetic technical institute in 1986 and a clothing factory in bavaria in 1987 on behalf of the far-left organization rote zora . she said the attacks were motivated by her political beliefs at the time , including a fierce opposition to genetic engineering and solidarity with striking female factory workers in south korea . gerhäuser said she had provided alarm clocks for two detonators .

but a court in february refused prison day releases for christian klar , 54 , who led the raf along with mohnhaupt . the families of the victims of the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , have bitterly opposed any clemency , partly because mohnhaupt and klar never expressed remorse for the murders . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's radical left confronts global issues and enemy within europe 's radical left-wing groups are at the forefront of demonstrations against international injustice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.04.2007 europol seeks broader mandate amid growing terror threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol says it requires extended powers to meet the challenges of the new threat eu police arrested over 700 terror suspects last year , according to a report released tuesday .
half of the arrests involved islamist extremism - the most dangerous variety of terrorism , the report says . the cross-border police agency europol released the report as eu politicians debated proposals to expand the powers of european law enforcement .
presenting the report to the european parliament in brussels on tuesday , europol chief max-peter ratzel made the case for a broader mandate for his organization . “ the mandate is currently limited to organized crime , which means that in each individual case we have to demonstrate a link or connection to local structures before we pass on the data , ” ratzel explained to a parliamentary committee .
“ in the fields of serial murder , online child pornography or travelling hooligans , local structures are generally not affected , but that is precisely the added value for -lrb- eu -rrb- member states . ” the eu commission has already proposed a reform bill to expand europol ’ s mandate , and the german presidency of the european union has also endorsed the proposal .
ratzel said terrorism is a situation that affects europe as a whole , and that it was important to share information among the member states in order to “ recognize the signs early on and act pre-emptively on dangers . ” but this also earned the europol chief some criticism from parliamentarians concerned about privacy rights .
agustín díaz de mera of the conservative evp told ratzel his agency needed to adopt more “ democratic transparency . ” separatists responsible for bulk of eu terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eta bomb at madrid 's barajas international airport ratzel expressed concern about what the europol report says is a growing threat of terrorism in europe .
nearly 500 terrorism-related offences were carried out in the 27-nation bloc last year , the report says ; however , most of them were carried out by separatists on the french island of corsica and in the spanish basque region . with 343 arrests last year , france saw the largest amount of terrorist activity .
most attacks took place on the mediterranean island of corsica , where separatists opposed to french rule have waged a low-intensity war of independence for over three decades . most of these attacks only caused property damage , with the notable exception of basque separatist group eta ’ s december 30th bombing of a parking garage at madrid barajas international airport , which killed two people and wounded several dozen more .
it was one of 145 attacks in spain last year , and the group ’ s first fatal attack since 2003 . europol says eta has “ rebuilt its capabilities ” despite a march 2006 truce with the spanish government , and is prepared to “ strike with well-prepared , organized and coordinated attacks against high-profile targets . ”
eta on sunday stood by the 2006 ceasefire , but said it would resume its armed struggle for basque independence if spain did not allow eta ’ s banned political wing to participate in local elections in may . 156 people were arrested on terrorism charges in britain .
europol did not list any terror-related offences for the 10 newest member states , most of them eastern european , that joined the eu in 2004 . islamist extremism called greatest danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic terrorism is the most dangerous , the report says the report says that acts of terrorism motivated by radical islamic ideologies pose the greatest threat to european security , in part because they aim to maximize human casualties .
as examples of islamic extremism in europe , the report cites the failed plot to bomb two regional trains in western germany . that plot was foiled by fate rather than by the police , as the crude suitcase bombs did not go off due to a technical malfunction .
ratzel also mentions last year ’ s attempted attack on transatlantic flights from british airports , which was foiled by the authorities at the last minute . the report says half of the total number of arrests was related to islamist militants .
as examples of terrorist crimes , the police agency lists disseminating terrorist propaganda , financing terrorism , forging documents or providing safe houses for illegal operatives , among others . “ we have to take care that these things don ’ t further escalate , ” ratzel told the parliamentary committee . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany determined to strengthen european police agency germany 's security policy during its eu presidency aims to give europol additional powers in order to better fight international terrorism and cross-border crime .

some employees would like to see their working conditions improved . the world 's biggest food retailer , mcdonald 's has decided germany is ripe for the mccafe - a coffee shop integrated into mcdonald 's restaurants offering drinks from cappuccinos to lattes , as well as panini , cookies and cakes . around 240 of germany 's 1,276 mcdonalds have been renovated to incorporate the snazzier-looking mccafe , and at least another 100 are expected to follow this year . the dark brown leather chairs , sleek wood deco and shiny glass displays are a giant step away from the shrill yellow and red plastic traditionally associated with mcdonalds restaurants - and they are proving popular with customers . the turnover in the redesigned stores has increased by 10 percent to 15 percent . " we assumed that the mccafe would attract younger people , but surprisingly the over-50s , who otherwise never enter a mcdonalds , are coming , " said mcdonald 's germany chief , bane knezevic , in an interview with the german daily tagespiegel . gourmet coffee on the rise trendy coffee chains such as starbucks and balzac have been mushrooming in germany 's big cities - and mcdonald 's just was n't proving attractive to those who wanted to chill out and choose from a wide variety of coffees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's is giving many of its german restaurants a make-over " for a long time , we were n't modern enough for our customers , " knezevic said .
though it has also taken a while for the mccafe to come to germany - they were first introduced in australia in 1993 . knezevic also said mcdonald 's would introduce coffee beans certified by the rain forest alliance . although mcdonald 's might be moving in a socially responsible direction with its coffee , the chain reportedly still has room for improvement when it comes to its employees . accusations against mcdonald 's in a report on germany 's public zdf television broadcast on april 3 , former mcdonald 's employees listed a series of complaints against the food chain , including arbitrary firings and the bullying of works council representatives . former employees interviewed by zdf tell of attempts to buy off works council representatives .
they also accused mcdonald 's of having a policy of employing young people with immigrant backgrounds and firing anyone who complains . after asking for a pay rise , and saying she wanted to establish a works council , former mcdonald 's employee nicole wieseler was fired after seven years working for the company . " i was fired without notice just before the end of my holiday , and they also gave me a written order banning me from all mcdonald 's restaurants , " wieseler told zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's is under fire in china this week for allegedly paying below the minimum wage " they did n't give me a reason , and i just did n't understand it , " she added .
" i found the ban pretty harsh - it was hung up in all restaurants .
i felt like a murderer . " wieseler took case to court and won .
mcdonald 's maintains wieseler 's dismissal had nothing to do with her union activity . mcdonald 's in germany has more than 52,000 employers , but there are only 17 works councils - these are employee committees that give voice to workers ' concerns . " we do n't have anything against unions , " stefan fehr , the head of mcdonald 's ' personal department in germany , told zdf .

but it seems the 18m long strip of wall was n't nicked by souvenir hunters , it was hoisted off by the berlin government . erich stanke , who said he bought the chunk of wall back in 1990 from a border guard , is more than peeved .
he described the government 's action as a " cloak and dagger " affair . " people were shot here , and now this piece of human world heritage has simply been ripped up , " he said .
" it 's a disgrace . " stanke has lodged a complaint with the police because the contractors who removed the wall from potsdamer platz bored two holes in order to yank it out . " the wall is a protected monument and now it 's damaged , " stanke said . popular with tourists camera touting tourists regularly visited the piece of wall , which was brightly painted with graffiti and murals , such as a trabant , a typical east german car , bursting through the wall .
another mural carries the slogan " do n't destroy history " - a reference to attempts to preserve the berlin wall . the federal office for building and regional planning , who ordered the chunk 's removal , does n't know what all the fuss is about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potsdamer platz is now famous for its modern architecture " it 's been common knowledge for quite some time " that piece would have to make way for a new environment office building , spokesperson andreas kübler told the berliner zeitung . according to kübler , contrary to stanke 's claims , the city owned the piece of wall .
once the project is completed at the end of 2008 , the strip of wall will be on display inside the building and tourists will still be able to see it through a window . wider debate but the exchange of words over this one piece of wall is part of a much bigger debate .
for some berliners , the wall is a despised symbol of a totalitarian regime and should be completely destroyed .
for others , it 's a cultural artifact that should be kept for future generations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans called the wall souvenir hunters " mauerspecht " or " wallpeckers " only a few pieces of the berlin wall survived opening up of eastern germany on november 19 , 1989 and the resulting souvenir-hunting frenzy .
five months after the event , there were only six sections in the inner-city left standing . several of these remnants were in potsdamer platz , which lies in the center of berlin .
in the 1990s , the square underwent a massive rebuilding campaign - and in 1999 of chunks of wall were removed to make way for glittering modern skyscrapers . now , a rather inconspicuous line of cobblestone set in the pavement is otherwise the only mark of the former barrier between east and west germany . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans celebrate unity day with mixed emotions as germans celebrate the 16th anniversary of reunification tuesday , there 's no masking a sense of disillusionment at the failure to tackle the country 's economic and demographic woes resulting from the tumultuous event .

half of the arrests involved islamist extremism - the most dangerous variety of terrorism , the report says . the cross-border police agency europol released the report as eu politicians debated proposals to expand the powers of european law enforcement .
presenting the report to the european parliament in brussels on tuesday , europol chief max-peter ratzel made the case for a broader mandate for his organization . “ the mandate is currently limited to organized crime , which means that in each individual case we have to demonstrate a link or connection to local structures before we pass on the data , ” ratzel explained to a parliamentary committee .
“ in the fields of serial murder , online child pornography or travelling hooligans , local structures are generally not affected , but that is precisely the added value for -lrb- eu -rrb- member states . ” the eu commission has already proposed a reform bill to expand europol ’ s mandate , and the german presidency of the european union has also endorsed the proposal .
ratzel said terrorism is a situation that affects europe as a whole , and that it was important to share information among the member states in order to “ recognize the signs early on and act pre-emptively on dangers . ” but this also earned the europol chief some criticism from parliamentarians concerned about privacy rights .
agustín díaz de mera of the conservative evp told ratzel his agency needed to adopt more “ democratic transparency . ” separatists responsible for bulk of eu terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eta bomb at madrid 's barajas international airport ratzel expressed concern about what the europol report says is a growing threat of terrorism in europe .
nearly 500 terrorism-related offences were carried out in the 27-nation bloc last year , the report says ; however , most of them were carried out by separatists on the french island of corsica and in the spanish basque region . with 343 arrests last year , france saw the largest amount of terrorist activity .
most attacks took place on the mediterranean island of corsica , where separatists opposed to french rule have waged a low-intensity war of independence for over three decades . most of these attacks only caused property damage , with the notable exception of basque separatist group eta ’ s december 30th bombing of a parking garage at madrid barajas international airport , which killed two people and wounded several dozen more .
it was one of 145 attacks in spain last year , and the group ’ s first fatal attack since 2003 . europol says eta has “ rebuilt its capabilities ” despite a march 2006 truce with the spanish government , and is prepared to “ strike with well-prepared , organized and coordinated attacks against high-profile targets . ”
eta on sunday stood by the 2006 ceasefire , but said it would resume its armed struggle for basque independence if spain did not allow eta ’ s banned political wing to participate in local elections in may . 156 people were arrested on terrorism charges in britain .
europol did not list any terror-related offences for the 10 newest member states , most of them eastern european , that joined the eu in 2004 . islamist extremism called greatest danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic terrorism is the most dangerous , the report says the report says that acts of terrorism motivated by radical islamic ideologies pose the greatest threat to european security , in part because they aim to maximize human casualties .
as examples of islamic extremism in europe , the report cites the failed plot to bomb two regional trains in western germany . that plot was foiled by fate rather than by the police , as the crude suitcase bombs did not go off due to a technical malfunction .
ratzel also mentions last year ’ s attempted attack on transatlantic flights from british airports , which was foiled by the authorities at the last minute . the report says half of the total number of arrests was related to islamist militants .
as examples of terrorist crimes , the police agency lists disseminating terrorist propaganda , financing terrorism , forging documents or providing safe houses for illegal operatives , among others . “ we have to take care that these things don ’ t further escalate , ” ratzel told the parliamentary committee . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany determined to strengthen european police agency germany 's security policy during its eu presidency aims to give europol additional powers in order to better fight international terrorism and cross-border crime .

some employees would like to see their working conditions improved . the world 's biggest food retailer , mcdonald 's has decided germany is ripe for the mccafe - a coffee shop integrated into mcdonald 's restaurants offering drinks from cappuccinos to lattes , as well as panini , cookies and cakes . around 240 of germany 's 1,276 mcdonalds have been renovated to incorporate the snazzier-looking mccafe , and at least another 100 are expected to follow this year . the dark brown leather chairs , sleek wood deco and shiny glass displays are a giant step away from the shrill yellow and red plastic traditionally associated with mcdonalds restaurants - and they are proving popular with customers . the turnover in the redesigned stores has increased by 10 percent to 15 percent . " we assumed that the mccafe would attract younger people , but surprisingly the over-50s , who otherwise never enter a mcdonalds , are coming , " said mcdonald 's germany chief , bane knezevic , in an interview with the german daily tagespiegel . gourmet coffee on the rise trendy coffee chains such as starbucks and balzac have been mushrooming in germany 's big cities - and mcdonald 's just was n't proving attractive to those who wanted to chill out and choose from a wide variety of coffees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's is giving many of its german restaurants a make-over " for a long time , we were n't modern enough for our customers , " knezevic said .
though it has also taken a while for the mccafe to come to germany - they were first introduced in australia in 1993 . knezevic also said mcdonald 's would introduce coffee beans certified by the rain forest alliance . although mcdonald 's might be moving in a socially responsible direction with its coffee , the chain reportedly still has room for improvement when it comes to its employees . accusations against mcdonald 's in a report on germany 's public zdf television broadcast on april 3 , former mcdonald 's employees listed a series of complaints against the food chain , including arbitrary firings and the bullying of works council representatives . former employees interviewed by zdf tell of attempts to buy off works council representatives .
they also accused mcdonald 's of having a policy of employing young people with immigrant backgrounds and firing anyone who complains . after asking for a pay rise , and saying she wanted to establish a works council , former mcdonald 's employee nicole wieseler was fired after seven years working for the company . " i was fired without notice just before the end of my holiday , and they also gave me a written order banning me from all mcdonald 's restaurants , " wieseler told zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's is under fire in china this week for allegedly paying below the minimum wage " they did n't give me a reason , and i just did n't understand it , " she added .
" i found the ban pretty harsh - it was hung up in all restaurants .
i felt like a murderer . " wieseler took case to court and won .
mcdonald 's maintains wieseler 's dismissal had nothing to do with her union activity . mcdonald 's in germany has more than 52,000 employers , but there are only 17 works councils - these are employee committees that give voice to workers ' concerns . " we do n't have anything against unions , " stefan fehr , the head of mcdonald 's ' personal department in germany , told zdf .
" it 's up to our workers to start up works councils and not us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 11.04.2007 fight for the final spot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this time around a goalless draw would be enough for bayern with the champions league semi-finals looking very english , bayern and ac milan battle on wednesday for an invitation to the tea party .
the first leg in italy ended in a draw .
so who 's more likely to progress ? no one is more qualified to answer a question about bayern munich versus ac milan than giovanni trapattoni , who has coached both clubs during his storied career .
he told dw-world.de to expect a close match on wednesday . " it 's still wide open , " trapattoni said .
" of course , bayern are the slight favorites , but 2-all is a difficult first-leg result .
they ca n't just go full bore offensively at home , because milan - with players like kaká , gilardino or inzaghi - are very dangerous on the counter-attack .
a waiting game would also be risky .
but if bayern play the same way they did in milan they 'll get through . " munich clawed out a draw in san siro last week , thanks to a pair of goals by defender daniel van buyten , so in fact they 'll be looking to hold milan to fewer than two goals . bayern 's main worries are midfielder bastian schweinsteiger , who 's touch-and-go with a banged-up knee , and milan 's filippo inzaghi .
no one has scored more often against bayern in the champions league than the crafty striker .
still , bayern have no reason to be quaking in their boots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milan up-ended bayern last year in the champions league " this year , " trapattoni said , " milan are n't showing anything like their past form , and not all their players at their best .
they went all out to win their home leg .
they tried to score goals , and in the end , it did n't turn out well . " wednesday 's other semi-final should be a far more relaxed affair , with liverpool taking a 3-nil advantage over psv eindhoven into anfield .
the dutch guests , who are focusing on their domestic league , have already indicated they 'll rest some key players for the match . man u steamroll rome , chelsea pip valencia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cristiano ronaldo booted a pair of goals past rome in the rout whoever prevails in munich may wish they had n't , as their semi-final opponents will be manchester united .
the red devils progressed on tuesday after flattening as rome 7-1 in old trafford . man u clearly wanted to send a message after an away leg marred by violence against their supporters and some controversial refereeing decisions .
michael carrick scored the opener in the 11th minute , and in the barrage that followed , rome could hardly have been more shocked , had george best returned from the dead , pint glass in hand , to knock one past luckless keeper doni . meanwhile , manchester 's premiership rivals were doing what they do best against valencia - getting a narrow , and somewhat fortunate result . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea just managed to push their way past well-organized valencia the blues traveled to spain needing to make up for a disappointing 1-all draw in the first leg , and things did n't look good when the hosts took a 1-nil lead into the break . but much-criticized striker andriy shevchenko knotted things up in the 52nd minute .
and michael essian sent chelsea through just before time after a crucial blunder by valencia keeper santiago canizares . chelsea will now most likely have a date with liverpool later this month . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chelsea draw ; man u lose in rome english sides chelsea and manchester did not impress on wednesday evening .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.04.2007 europol seeks broader mandate amid growing terror threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol says it requires extended powers to meet the challenges of the new threat eu police arrested over 700 terror suspects last year , according to a report released tuesday .
half of the arrests involved islamist extremism - the most dangerous variety of terrorism , the report says . the cross-border police agency europol released the report as eu politicians debated proposals to expand the powers of european law enforcement .
presenting the report to the european parliament in brussels on tuesday , europol chief max-peter ratzel made the case for a broader mandate for his organization . “ the mandate is currently limited to organized crime , which means that in each individual case we have to demonstrate a link or connection to local structures before we pass on the data , ” ratzel explained to a parliamentary committee .
“ in the fields of serial murder , online child pornography or travelling hooligans , local structures are generally not affected , but that is precisely the added value for -lrb- eu -rrb- member states . ” the eu commission has already proposed a reform bill to expand europol ’ s mandate , and the german presidency of the european union has also endorsed the proposal .
ratzel said terrorism is a situation that affects europe as a whole , and that it was important to share information among the member states in order to “ recognize the signs early on and act pre-emptively on dangers . ” but this also earned the europol chief some criticism from parliamentarians concerned about privacy rights .
agustín díaz de mera of the conservative evp told ratzel his agency needed to adopt more “ democratic transparency . ” separatists responsible for bulk of eu terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eta bomb at madrid 's barajas international airport ratzel expressed concern about what the europol report says is a growing threat of terrorism in europe .
nearly 500 terrorism-related offences were carried out in the 27-nation bloc last year , the report says ; however , most of them were carried out by separatists on the french island of corsica and in the spanish basque region . with 343 arrests last year , france saw the largest amount of terrorist activity .
most attacks took place on the mediterranean island of corsica , where separatists opposed to french rule have waged a low-intensity war of independence for over three decades . most of these attacks only caused property damage , with the notable exception of basque separatist group eta ’ s december 30th bombing of a parking garage at madrid barajas international airport , which killed two people and wounded several dozen more .
it was one of 145 attacks in spain last year , and the group ’ s first fatal attack since 2003 . europol says eta has “ rebuilt its capabilities ” despite a march 2006 truce with the spanish government , and is prepared to “ strike with well-prepared , organized and coordinated attacks against high-profile targets . ”
eta on sunday stood by the 2006 ceasefire , but said it would resume its armed struggle for basque independence if spain did not allow eta ’ s banned political wing to participate in local elections in may . 156 people were arrested on terrorism charges in britain .
europol did not list any terror-related offences for the 10 newest member states , most of them eastern european , that joined the eu in 2004 . islamist extremism called greatest danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic terrorism is the most dangerous , the report says the report says that acts of terrorism motivated by radical islamic ideologies pose the greatest threat to european security , in part because they aim to maximize human casualties .
as examples of islamic extremism in europe , the report cites the failed plot to bomb two regional trains in western germany . that plot was foiled by fate rather than by the police , as the crude suitcase bombs did not go off due to a technical malfunction .
ratzel also mentions last year ’ s attempted attack on transatlantic flights from british airports , which was foiled by the authorities at the last minute . the report says half of the total number of arrests was related to islamist militants .
as examples of terrorist crimes , the police agency lists disseminating terrorist propaganda , financing terrorism , forging documents or providing safe houses for illegal operatives , among others . “ we have to take care that these things don ’ t further escalate , ” ratzel told the parliamentary committee . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany determined to strengthen european police agency germany 's security policy during its eu presidency aims to give europol additional powers in order to better fight international terrorism and cross-border crime .
it also calls for improved police cooperation .

1 , 2007 bulgaria now marks the european union 's new eastern border .
although the country still bears the signs of its communist past , there is also evidence of a move toward european standards . at sofia 's new international airport terminal , new signs welcome visitors to " the eu country , bulgaria , " and the passport control boasts new counters - one for eu and the other for non-eu citizens . outside the terminal , shiny new taxis wait to ferry customers into the city .
next to the meter , a sticker tells people their ride will cost them some two leva per kilometer - about one euro -lrb- $ 1.33 -rrb- . many of the taxis in sofia 's capital are also new , but a ride in one of them costs about 75 percent less than the taxis at the international terminal .
this price difference is completely legal , but it does beg the question of why the cheap taxis have n't managed to find their way out to the airport ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why are the taxis in town cheaper than at the airport ?
the reason ca n't be because the taxi drivers get lost - sofia 's roads and freeways are now signposted to european standards . the mafia ? in the past few years , there have been spectacular headlines about former communist functionaries and secret service officers who managed to privatize - in their own creative ways - the state 's treasuries and meet the challenges of the market economy with gold-stuffed suitcases in their hands . according to dimitar ludzhev , who was deputy-prime minister in bulgaria 's first non-communist government , the secret service played a key roll in this .
those working in bulgaria 's 300 foreign-based firms gathered intelligence and carried out economic espionage , while the domestic secret service was in charge of the smuggling routes and the illegal transfers of luxury goods . many observers say this was the birth of organized crime in bulgaria .
after the fall of communism in 1989 , those who had worked for the secret police used their knowledge to stay in business - but this time in the private " shadow " economy . no kickbacks ? bulgaria 's border with non-eu member serbia lies just 60 km -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- away from its capital city sofia .
but there 's not much traffic heading out of bulgaria towards its western neighbor these days along the route which used to be heavily used as part of the highway system running from turkey over sofia to belgrade and budapest and then to western europe . some trucks and busses are waiting at the kalotina border crossing , with turkish , bulgarian and german plates .
everything seems to be working smoothly and efficiently - the police and customers officers are friendly and do n't mind us observing their work . bildunterschrift : former secret service members are allegedly still involved in border smuggling there are also new signs on the border : " no payments here , only passport control . "
this has a clear meaning - bribery has no place here .
well not any more , as the officers at the border explain with a degree of pride . but even if kickbacks are no longer expected at kalotin , it 's a different story in other parts of eastern europe according to one of the bus drivers . " well , in serbia , five euros are expected unless you want to wait two or three hours , " he said .
" and it 's the same in hungary , that is if you do n't want to have your whole luggage searched . " not the same everywhere europe 's new eastern border is long and winds from kalotina south to the strumica river , where it meets the greek and macedonian borders .
here , just near the border lies blagoevgrad - earlier a well-known smuggling town and today infamous as the gangster capital of bulgaria . peter ivanov , 26 , from blagoevgrad 's radio station , joked that nowhere else in europe are there so many limousines as here .
his reason for blagoevgrad 's popularity with crime syndicates - its proximity to three borders . but dimitar ivanov -lrb- not related to peter ivanov -rrb- , a businessman , who used to work for bulgaria 's secret service , is adamant that former members of the service have nothing to do with the bulgarian mafia . " it 's a propaganda theory , " dimitar ivanov said .
" it 's propaganda from the right . " his former colleague in the secrete service zvetko zvetkov , however , would beg to differ . " you could very well establish a link -lrb- between the mafia -rrb- and the former secret service and the former regime , " zvetkov said . zvetkov , who in communist times was in charge of spying on the intellectuals , has been trying for years to shed light on the links between the bulgarian secret service and the criminal underworld . hartmut lüning and alexander andreev -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bulgaria : building a controversial eu transit route european union funds are financing a conflict-ridden highway on the outskirts of sofia .

" these are very difficult times for the palestinian people , " he told reporters at a joint press conference with eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
the finance minister added that if the international community did not come to the aid of the palestinians , the outcome would be " devastating " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fayyad warns that lack of aid is devastating for the palestinians palestinian and european diplomats said the meeting itself was a sign that the eu was willing to give the new finance ministry a chance . the eu was the biggest aid donor to the palestinian government until the hamas militants came to power in march 2006 .
the quartet of middle east mediators - the european union , united states , united nations and russia - then suspended direct aid to the palestinian authority . eu bypasses unity government since then , the eu has redirected its funding , which reached 700 million euros in 2006 , through a special mechanism to help the neediest people while bypassing the government to avoid contact with hamas - which is considers a terrorist organization . at the brussels press conference , ferrero-waldner said this temporary mechanism would continue but offered fayyad technical assistance to get his finance ministry in order . she also repeated the international demands that the palestinian government renounce violence , formally recognize israel 's right to exist and abide by former agreements .
ferrero-waldner said until that happened the eu would only deal with what it considered to be western-friendly members of the new palestinian fatah-hamas unity government , which took power in march this year . bildunterschrift : lawmakers voted last month for a new unity government ferrero-waldner said she could " imagine informal exploratory talks " with foreign minister ziad abu amr , who , like fayyad , is an independent . fayyad , who as finance minister under the previous fatah government won praise for his reform of palestinian finances , said the unity government was committed to a platform to abide by " all the agreements entered into " . fayyad also met with the eu 's middle east peace envoy , marc otte , and european parliament leaders .
he is set to travel on to norway , which brokered an israeli-palestinian peace deal in 1993 , and then onto washington . dw staff / afp -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de seize the moment for peace , merkel urges middle east current eu president german chancellor angela merkel on sunday urged middle east states to seize the moment and revive the stalled peace process as she met israeli and palestinian leaders .

the first leg in italy ended in a draw .
so who 's more likely to progress ? no one is more qualified to answer a question about bayern munich versus ac milan than giovanni trapattoni , who has coached both clubs during his storied career .
he told dw-world.de to expect a close match on wednesday . " it 's still wide open , " trapattoni said .
" of course , bayern are the slight favorites , but 2-all is a difficult first-leg result .
they ca n't just go full bore offensively at home , because milan - with players like kaká , gilardino or inzaghi - are very dangerous on the counter-attack .
a waiting game would also be risky .
but if bayern play the same way they did in milan they 'll get through . " munich clawed out a draw in san siro last week , thanks to a pair of goals by defender daniel van buyten , so in fact they 'll be looking to hold milan to fewer than two goals . bayern 's main worries are midfielder bastian schweinsteiger , who 's touch-and-go with a banged-up knee , and milan 's filippo inzaghi .
no one has scored more often against bayern in the champions league than the crafty striker .
still , bayern have no reason to be quaking in their boots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milan up-ended bayern last year in the champions league " this year , " trapattoni said , " milan are n't showing anything like their past form , and not all their players at their best .
they went all out to win their home leg .
they tried to score goals , and in the end , it did n't turn out well . " wednesday 's other semi-final should be a far more relaxed affair , with liverpool taking a 3-nil advantage over psv eindhoven into anfield .
the dutch guests , who are focusing on their domestic league , have already indicated they 'll rest some key players for the match . man u steamroll rome , chelsea pip valencia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cristiano ronaldo booted a pair of goals past rome in the rout whoever prevails in munich may wish they had n't , as their semi-final opponents will be manchester united .
the red devils progressed on tuesday after flattening as rome 7-1 in old trafford . man u clearly wanted to send a message after an away leg marred by violence against their supporters and some controversial refereeing decisions .
michael carrick scored the opener in the 11th minute , and in the barrage that followed , rome could hardly have been more shocked , had george best returned from the dead , pint glass in hand , to knock one past luckless keeper doni . meanwhile , manchester 's premiership rivals were doing what they do best against valencia - getting a narrow , and somewhat fortunate result . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea just managed to push their way past well-organized valencia the blues traveled to spain needing to make up for a disappointing 1-all draw in the first leg , and things did n't look good when the hosts took a 1-nil lead into the break . but much-criticized striker andriy shevchenko knotted things up in the 52nd minute .
and michael essian sent chelsea through just before time after a crucial blunder by valencia keeper santiago canizares . chelsea will now most likely have a date with liverpool later this month . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chelsea draw ; man u lose in rome english sides chelsea and manchester did not impress on wednesday evening .

the first leg in italy ended in a draw .
so who 's more likely to progress ? no one is more qualified to answer a question about bayern munich versus ac milan than giovanni trapattoni , who has coached both clubs during his storied career .
he told dw-world.de to expect a close match on wednesday . " it 's still wide open , " trapattoni said .
" of course , bayern are the slight favorites , but 2-all is a difficult first-leg result .
they ca n't just go full bore offensively at home , because milan - with players like kaká , gilardino or inzaghi - are very dangerous on the counter-attack .
a waiting game would also be risky .
but if bayern play the same way they did in milan they 'll get through . " munich clawed out a draw in san siro last week , thanks to a pair of goals by defender daniel van buyten , so in fact they 'll be looking to hold milan to fewer than two goals . bayern 's main worries are midfielder bastian schweinsteiger , who 's touch-and-go with a banged-up knee , and milan 's filippo inzaghi .
no one has scored more often against bayern in the champions league than the crafty striker .
still , bayern have no reason to be quaking in their boots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milan up-ended bayern last year in the champions league " this year , " trapattoni said , " milan are n't showing anything like their past form , and not all their players at their best .
they went all out to win their home leg .
they tried to score goals , and in the end , it did n't turn out well . " wednesday 's other semi-final should be a far more relaxed affair , with liverpool taking a 3-nil advantage over psv eindhoven into anfield .
the dutch guests , who are focusing on their domestic league , have already indicated they 'll rest some key players for the match . man u steamroll rome , chelsea pip valencia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cristiano ronaldo booted a pair of goals past rome in the rout whoever prevails in munich may wish they had n't , as their semi-final opponents will be manchester united .
the red devils progressed on tuesday after flattening as rome 7-1 in old trafford . man u clearly wanted to send a message after an away leg marred by violence against their supporters and some controversial refereeing decisions .
michael carrick scored the opener in the 11th minute , and in the barrage that followed , rome could hardly have been more shocked , had george best returned from the dead , pint glass in hand , to knock one past luckless keeper doni . meanwhile , manchester 's premiership rivals were doing what they do best against valencia - getting a narrow , and somewhat fortunate result . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea just managed to push their way past well-organized valencia the blues traveled to spain needing to make up for a disappointing 1-all draw in the first leg , and things did n't look good when the hosts took a 1-nil lead into the break . but much-criticized striker andriy shevchenko knotted things up in the 52nd minute .

but it seems the 18m long strip of wall was n't nicked by souvenir hunters , it was hoisted off by the berlin government . erich stanke , who said he bought the chunk of wall back in 1990 from a border guard , is more than peeved .
he described the government 's action as a " cloak and dagger " affair . " people were shot here , and now this piece of human world heritage has simply been ripped up , " he said .
" it 's a disgrace . " stanke has lodged a complaint with the police because the contractors who removed the wall from potsdamer platz bored two holes in order to yank it out . " the wall is a protected monument and now it 's damaged , " stanke said . popular with tourists camera touting tourists regularly visited the piece of wall , which was brightly painted with graffiti and murals , such as a trabant , a typical east german car , bursting through the wall .
another mural carries the slogan " do n't destroy history " - a reference to attempts to preserve the berlin wall . the federal office for building and regional planning , who ordered the chunk 's removal , does n't know what all the fuss is about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potsdamer platz is now famous for its modern architecture " it 's been common knowledge for quite some time " that piece would have to make way for a new environment office building , spokesperson andreas kübler told the berliner zeitung . according to kübler , contrary to stanke 's claims , the city owned the piece of wall .
once the project is completed at the end of 2008 , the strip of wall will be on display inside the building and tourists will still be able to see it through a window . wider debate but the exchange of words over this one piece of wall is part of a much bigger debate .
for some berliners , the wall is a despised symbol of a totalitarian regime and should be completely destroyed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 11.04.2007 europol seeks broader mandate amid growing terror threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol says it requires extended powers to meet the challenges of the new threat eu police arrested over 700 terror suspects last year , according to a report released tuesday .
half of the arrests involved islamist extremism - the most dangerous variety of terrorism , the report says . the cross-border police agency europol released the report as eu politicians debated proposals to expand the powers of european law enforcement .
presenting the report to the european parliament in brussels on tuesday , europol chief max-peter ratzel made the case for a broader mandate for his organization . “ the mandate is currently limited to organized crime , which means that in each individual case we have to demonstrate a link or connection to local structures before we pass on the data , ” ratzel explained to a parliamentary committee .
“ in the fields of serial murder , online child pornography or travelling hooligans , local structures are generally not affected , but that is precisely the added value for -lrb- eu -rrb- member states . ” the eu commission has already proposed a reform bill to expand europol ’ s mandate , and the german presidency of the european union has also endorsed the proposal .
ratzel said terrorism is a situation that affects europe as a whole , and that it was important to share information among the member states in order to “ recognize the signs early on and act pre-emptively on dangers . ” but this also earned the europol chief some criticism from parliamentarians concerned about privacy rights .
agustín díaz de mera of the conservative evp told ratzel his agency needed to adopt more “ democratic transparency . ” separatists responsible for bulk of eu terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eta bomb at madrid 's barajas international airport ratzel expressed concern about what the europol report says is a growing threat of terrorism in europe .
nearly 500 terrorism-related offences were carried out in the 27-nation bloc last year , the report says ; however , most of them were carried out by separatists on the french island of corsica and in the spanish basque region . with 343 arrests last year , france saw the largest amount of terrorist activity .
most attacks took place on the mediterranean island of corsica , where separatists opposed to french rule have waged a low-intensity war of independence for over three decades . most of these attacks only caused property damage , with the notable exception of basque separatist group eta ’ s december 30th bombing of a parking garage at madrid barajas international airport , which killed two people and wounded several dozen more .
it was one of 145 attacks in spain last year , and the group ’ s first fatal attack since 2003 . europol says eta has “ rebuilt its capabilities ” despite a march 2006 truce with the spanish government , and is prepared to “ strike with well-prepared , organized and coordinated attacks against high-profile targets . ”
eta on sunday stood by the 2006 ceasefire , but said it would resume its armed struggle for basque independence if spain did not allow eta ’ s banned political wing to participate in local elections in may . 156 people were arrested on terrorism charges in britain .
europol did not list any terror-related offences for the 10 newest member states , most of them eastern european , that joined the eu in 2004 . islamist extremism called greatest danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic terrorism is the most dangerous , the report says the report says that acts of terrorism motivated by radical islamic ideologies pose the greatest threat to european security , in part because they aim to maximize human casualties .
as examples of islamic extremism in europe , the report cites the failed plot to bomb two regional trains in western germany . that plot was foiled by fate rather than by the police , as the crude suitcase bombs did not go off due to a technical malfunction .
ratzel also mentions last year ’ s attempted attack on transatlantic flights from british airports , which was foiled by the authorities at the last minute . the report says half of the total number of arrests was related to islamist militants .
as examples of terrorist crimes , the police agency lists disseminating terrorist propaganda , financing terrorism , forging documents or providing safe houses for illegal operatives , among others . “ we have to take care that these things don ’ t further escalate , ” ratzel told the parliamentary committee . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany determined to strengthen european police agency germany 's security policy during its eu presidency aims to give europol additional powers in order to better fight international terrorism and cross-border crime .

1 , 2007 bulgaria now marks the european union 's new eastern border .
although the country still bears the signs of its communist past , there is also evidence of a move toward european standards . at sofia 's new international airport terminal , new signs welcome visitors to " the eu country , bulgaria , " and the passport control boasts new counters - one for eu and the other for non-eu citizens . outside the terminal , shiny new taxis wait to ferry customers into the city .
next to the meter , a sticker tells people their ride will cost them some two leva per kilometer - about one euro -lrb- $ 1.33 -rrb- . many of the taxis in sofia 's capital are also new , but a ride in one of them costs about 75 percent less than the taxis at the international terminal .
this price difference is completely legal , but it does beg the question of why the cheap taxis have n't managed to find their way out to the airport ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why are the taxis in town cheaper than at the airport ?
the reason ca n't be because the taxi drivers get lost - sofia 's roads and freeways are now signposted to european standards . the mafia ? in the past few years , there have been spectacular headlines about former communist functionaries and secret service officers who managed to privatize - in their own creative ways - the state 's treasuries and meet the challenges of the market economy with gold-stuffed suitcases in their hands . according to dimitar ludzhev , who was deputy-prime minister in bulgaria 's first non-communist government , the secret service played a key roll in this .
those working in bulgaria 's 300 foreign-based firms gathered intelligence and carried out economic espionage , while the domestic secret service was in charge of the smuggling routes and the illegal transfers of luxury goods . many observers say this was the birth of organized crime in bulgaria .
after the fall of communism in 1989 , those who had worked for the secret police used their knowledge to stay in business - but this time in the private " shadow " economy . no kickbacks ? bulgaria 's border with non-eu member serbia lies just 60 km -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- away from its capital city sofia .
but there 's not much traffic heading out of bulgaria towards its western neighbor these days along the route which used to be heavily used as part of the highway system running from turkey over sofia to belgrade and budapest and then to western europe . some trucks and busses are waiting at the kalotina border crossing , with turkish , bulgarian and german plates .
everything seems to be working smoothly and efficiently - the police and customers officers are friendly and do n't mind us observing their work . bildunterschrift : former secret service members are allegedly still involved in border smuggling there are also new signs on the border : " no payments here , only passport control . "
this has a clear meaning - bribery has no place here .
well not any more , as the officers at the border explain with a degree of pride . but even if kickbacks are no longer expected at kalotin , it 's a different story in other parts of eastern europe according to one of the bus drivers . " well , in serbia , five euros are expected unless you want to wait two or three hours , " he said .
" and it 's the same in hungary , that is if you do n't want to have your whole luggage searched . " not the same everywhere europe 's new eastern border is long and winds from kalotina south to the strumica river , where it meets the greek and macedonian borders .
here , just near the border lies blagoevgrad - earlier a well-known smuggling town and today infamous as the gangster capital of bulgaria . peter ivanov , 26 , from blagoevgrad 's radio station , joked that nowhere else in europe are there so many limousines as here .
his reason for blagoevgrad 's popularity with crime syndicates - its proximity to three borders . but dimitar ivanov -lrb- not related to peter ivanov -rrb- , a businessman , who used to work for bulgaria 's secret service , is adamant that former members of the service have nothing to do with the bulgarian mafia . " it 's a propaganda theory , " dimitar ivanov said .
" it 's propaganda from the right . " his former colleague in the secrete service zvetko zvetkov , however , would beg to differ . " you could very well establish a link -lrb- between the mafia -rrb- and the former secret service and the former regime , " zvetkov said . zvetkov , who in communist times was in charge of spying on the intellectuals , has been trying for years to shed light on the links between the bulgarian secret service and the criminal underworld . hartmut lüning and alexander andreev -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bulgaria : building a controversial eu transit route european union funds are financing a conflict-ridden highway on the outskirts of sofia .
but bulgarian environmental groups claim the new road will do little to alleviate the capital 's traffic nightmare .

here , just near the border lies blagoevgrad - earlier a well-known smuggling town and today infamous as the gangster capital of bulgaria . peter ivanov , 26 , from blagoevgrad 's radio station , joked that nowhere else in europe are there so many limousines as here .
his reason for blagoevgrad 's popularity with crime syndicates - its proximity to three borders . but dimitar ivanov -lrb- not related to peter ivanov -rrb- , a businessman , who used to work for bulgaria 's secret service , is adamant that former members of the service have nothing to do with the bulgarian mafia . " it 's a propaganda theory , " dimitar ivanov said .
" it 's propaganda from the right . " his former colleague in the secrete service zvetko zvetkov , however , would beg to differ . " you could very well establish a link -lrb- between the mafia -rrb- and the former secret service and the former regime , " zvetkov said . zvetkov , who in communist times was in charge of spying on the intellectuals , has been trying for years to shed light on the links between the bulgarian secret service and the criminal underworld . hartmut lüning and alexander andreev -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bulgaria : building a controversial eu transit route european union funds are financing a conflict-ridden highway on the outskirts of sofia .

half of the arrests involved islamist extremism - the most dangerous variety of terrorism , the report says . the cross-border police agency europol released the report as eu politicians debated proposals to expand the powers of european law enforcement .
presenting the report to the european parliament in brussels on tuesday , europol chief max-peter ratzel made the case for a broader mandate for his organization . “ the mandate is currently limited to organized crime , which means that in each individual case we have to demonstrate a link or connection to local structures before we pass on the data , ” ratzel explained to a parliamentary committee .
“ in the fields of serial murder , online child pornography or travelling hooligans , local structures are generally not affected , but that is precisely the added value for -lrb- eu -rrb- member states . ” the eu commission has already proposed a reform bill to expand europol ’ s mandate , and the german presidency of the european union has also endorsed the proposal .
ratzel said terrorism is a situation that affects europe as a whole , and that it was important to share information among the member states in order to “ recognize the signs early on and act pre-emptively on dangers . ” but this also earned the europol chief some criticism from parliamentarians concerned about privacy rights .
agustín díaz de mera of the conservative evp told ratzel his agency needed to adopt more “ democratic transparency . ” separatists responsible for bulk of eu terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eta bomb at madrid 's barajas international airport ratzel expressed concern about what the europol report says is a growing threat of terrorism in europe .
nearly 500 terrorism-related offences were carried out in the 27-nation bloc last year , the report says ; however , most of them were carried out by separatists on the french island of corsica and in the spanish basque region . with 343 arrests last year , france saw the largest amount of terrorist activity .
most attacks took place on the mediterranean island of corsica , where separatists opposed to french rule have waged a low-intensity war of independence for over three decades . most of these attacks only caused property damage , with the notable exception of basque separatist group eta ’ s december 30th bombing of a parking garage at madrid barajas international airport , which killed two people and wounded several dozen more .
it was one of 145 attacks in spain last year , and the group ’ s first fatal attack since 2003 . europol says eta has “ rebuilt its capabilities ” despite a march 2006 truce with the spanish government , and is prepared to “ strike with well-prepared , organized and coordinated attacks against high-profile targets . ”
eta on sunday stood by the 2006 ceasefire , but said it would resume its armed struggle for basque independence if spain did not allow eta ’ s banned political wing to participate in local elections in may . 156 people were arrested on terrorism charges in britain .
europol did not list any terror-related offences for the 10 newest member states , most of them eastern european , that joined the eu in 2004 . islamist extremism called greatest danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic terrorism is the most dangerous , the report says the report says that acts of terrorism motivated by radical islamic ideologies pose the greatest threat to european security , in part because they aim to maximize human casualties .
as examples of islamic extremism in europe , the report cites the failed plot to bomb two regional trains in western germany . that plot was foiled by fate rather than by the police , as the crude suitcase bombs did not go off due to a technical malfunction .
ratzel also mentions last year ’ s attempted attack on transatlantic flights from british airports , which was foiled by the authorities at the last minute . the report says half of the total number of arrests was related to islamist militants .
as examples of terrorist crimes , the police agency lists disseminating terrorist propaganda , financing terrorism , forging documents or providing safe houses for illegal operatives , among others . “ we have to take care that these things don ’ t further escalate , ” ratzel told the parliamentary committee . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany determined to strengthen european police agency germany 's security policy during its eu presidency aims to give europol additional powers in order to better fight international terrorism and cross-border crime .

half of the arrests involved islamist extremism - the most dangerous variety of terrorism , the report says . the cross-border police agency europol released the report as eu politicians debated proposals to expand the powers of european law enforcement .
presenting the report to the european parliament in brussels on tuesday , europol chief max-peter ratzel made the case for a broader mandate for his organization . “ the mandate is currently limited to organized crime , which means that in each individual case we have to demonstrate a link or connection to local structures before we pass on the data , ” ratzel explained to a parliamentary committee .
“ in the fields of serial murder , online child pornography or travelling hooligans , local structures are generally not affected , but that is precisely the added value for -lrb- eu -rrb- member states . ” the eu commission has already proposed a reform bill to expand europol ’ s mandate , and the german presidency of the european union has also endorsed the proposal .
ratzel said terrorism is a situation that affects europe as a whole , and that it was important to share information among the member states in order to “ recognize the signs early on and act pre-emptively on dangers . ” but this also earned the europol chief some criticism from parliamentarians concerned about privacy rights .
agustín díaz de mera of the conservative evp told ratzel his agency needed to adopt more “ democratic transparency . ” separatists responsible for bulk of eu terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eta bomb at madrid 's barajas international airport ratzel expressed concern about what the europol report says is a growing threat of terrorism in europe .
nearly 500 terrorism-related offences were carried out in the 27-nation bloc last year , the report says ; however , most of them were carried out by separatists on the french island of corsica and in the spanish basque region . with 343 arrests last year , france saw the largest amount of terrorist activity .
most attacks took place on the mediterranean island of corsica , where separatists opposed to french rule have waged a low-intensity war of independence for over three decades . most of these attacks only caused property damage , with the notable exception of basque separatist group eta ’ s december 30th bombing of a parking garage at madrid barajas international airport , which killed two people and wounded several dozen more .
it was one of 145 attacks in spain last year , and the group ’ s first fatal attack since 2003 . europol says eta has “ rebuilt its capabilities ” despite a march 2006 truce with the spanish government , and is prepared to “ strike with well-prepared , organized and coordinated attacks against high-profile targets . ”
eta on sunday stood by the 2006 ceasefire , but said it would resume its armed struggle for basque independence if spain did not allow eta ’ s banned political wing to participate in local elections in may . 156 people were arrested on terrorism charges in britain .
europol did not list any terror-related offences for the 10 newest member states , most of them eastern european , that joined the eu in 2004 . islamist extremism called greatest danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic terrorism is the most dangerous , the report says the report says that acts of terrorism motivated by radical islamic ideologies pose the greatest threat to european security , in part because they aim to maximize human casualties .
as examples of islamic extremism in europe , the report cites the failed plot to bomb two regional trains in western germany . that plot was foiled by fate rather than by the police , as the crude suitcase bombs did not go off due to a technical malfunction .
ratzel also mentions last year ’ s attempted attack on transatlantic flights from british airports , which was foiled by the authorities at the last minute . the report says half of the total number of arrests was related to islamist militants .
as examples of terrorist crimes , the police agency lists disseminating terrorist propaganda , financing terrorism , forging documents or providing safe houses for illegal operatives , among others . “ we have to take care that these things don ’ t further escalate , ” ratzel told the parliamentary committee . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany determined to strengthen european police agency germany 's security policy during its eu presidency aims to give europol additional powers in order to better fight international terrorism and cross-border crime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.04.2007 eu member bulgaria still bears signs of its communist past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria became a member of the european union on jan .
1 , 2007 bulgaria now marks the european union 's new eastern border .
although the country still bears the signs of its communist past , there is also evidence of a move toward european standards . at sofia 's new international airport terminal , new signs welcome visitors to " the eu country , bulgaria , " and the passport control boasts new counters - one for eu and the other for non-eu citizens . outside the terminal , shiny new taxis wait to ferry customers into the city .
next to the meter , a sticker tells people their ride will cost them some two leva per kilometer - about one euro -lrb- $ 1.33 -rrb- . many of the taxis in sofia 's capital are also new , but a ride in one of them costs about 75 percent less than the taxis at the international terminal .
this price difference is completely legal , but it does beg the question of why the cheap taxis have n't managed to find their way out to the airport ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why are the taxis in town cheaper than at the airport ?
the reason ca n't be because the taxi drivers get lost - sofia 's roads and freeways are now signposted to european standards . the mafia ? in the past few years , there have been spectacular headlines about former communist functionaries and secret service officers who managed to privatize - in their own creative ways - the state 's treasuries and meet the challenges of the market economy with gold-stuffed suitcases in their hands . according to dimitar ludzhev , who was deputy-prime minister in bulgaria 's first non-communist government , the secret service played a key roll in this .
those working in bulgaria 's 300 foreign-based firms gathered intelligence and carried out economic espionage , while the domestic secret service was in charge of the smuggling routes and the illegal transfers of luxury goods . many observers say this was the birth of organized crime in bulgaria .
after the fall of communism in 1989 , those who had worked for the secret police used their knowledge to stay in business - but this time in the private " shadow " economy . no kickbacks ? bulgaria 's border with non-eu member serbia lies just 60 km -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- away from its capital city sofia .
but there 's not much traffic heading out of bulgaria towards its western neighbor these days along the route which used to be heavily used as part of the highway system running from turkey over sofia to belgrade and budapest and then to western europe . some trucks and busses are waiting at the kalotina border crossing , with turkish , bulgarian and german plates .
everything seems to be working smoothly and efficiently - the police and customers officers are friendly and do n't mind us observing their work . bildunterschrift : former secret service members are allegedly still involved in border smuggling there are also new signs on the border : " no payments here , only passport control . "
this has a clear meaning - bribery has no place here .
well not any more , as the officers at the border explain with a degree of pride . but even if kickbacks are no longer expected at kalotin , it 's a different story in other parts of eastern europe according to one of the bus drivers . " well , in serbia , five euros are expected unless you want to wait two or three hours , " he said .
" and it 's the same in hungary , that is if you do n't want to have your whole luggage searched . " not the same everywhere europe 's new eastern border is long and winds from kalotina south to the strumica river , where it meets the greek and macedonian borders .
here , just near the border lies blagoevgrad - earlier a well-known smuggling town and today infamous as the gangster capital of bulgaria . peter ivanov , 26 , from blagoevgrad 's radio station , joked that nowhere else in europe are there so many limousines as here .
his reason for blagoevgrad 's popularity with crime syndicates - its proximity to three borders . but dimitar ivanov -lrb- not related to peter ivanov -rrb- , a businessman , who used to work for bulgaria 's secret service , is adamant that former members of the service have nothing to do with the bulgarian mafia . " it 's a propaganda theory , " dimitar ivanov said .
" it 's propaganda from the right . " his former colleague in the secrete service zvetko zvetkov , however , would beg to differ . " you could very well establish a link -lrb- between the mafia -rrb- and the former secret service and the former regime , " zvetkov said . zvetkov , who in communist times was in charge of spying on the intellectuals , has been trying for years to shed light on the links between the bulgarian secret service and the criminal underworld . hartmut lüning and alexander andreev -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bulgaria : building a controversial eu transit route european union funds are financing a conflict-ridden highway on the outskirts of sofia .
but bulgarian environmental groups claim the new road will do little to alleviate the capital 's traffic nightmare .
-lrb- 21.03.2007 -rrb- european papers give cool reception to new eu members european commentators on tuesday had mixed reactions about bulgaria and romania 's entry into the european union .
-lrb- 02.01.2007 -rrb- will eu entry shrink bulgaria 's population even more ?
bulgarian towns are shrinking , and the birth rate is falling rapidly .
now bulgarians are worried that even more of their young people will leave after the country joins the eu on jan 1 .

but it seems the 18m long strip of wall was n't nicked by souvenir hunters , it was hoisted off by the berlin government . erich stanke , who said he bought the chunk of wall back in 1990 from a border guard , is more than peeved .
he described the government 's action as a " cloak and dagger " affair . " people were shot here , and now this piece of human world heritage has simply been ripped up , " he said .
" it 's a disgrace . " stanke has lodged a complaint with the police because the contractors who removed the wall from potsdamer platz bored two holes in order to yank it out . " the wall is a protected monument and now it 's damaged , " stanke said . popular with tourists camera touting tourists regularly visited the piece of wall , which was brightly painted with graffiti and murals , such as a trabant , a typical east german car , bursting through the wall .
another mural carries the slogan " do n't destroy history " - a reference to attempts to preserve the berlin wall . the federal office for building and regional planning , who ordered the chunk 's removal , does n't know what all the fuss is about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potsdamer platz is now famous for its modern architecture " it 's been common knowledge for quite some time " that piece would have to make way for a new environment office building , spokesperson andreas kübler told the berliner zeitung . according to kübler , contrary to stanke 's claims , the city owned the piece of wall .
once the project is completed at the end of 2008 , the strip of wall will be on display inside the building and tourists will still be able to see it through a window . wider debate but the exchange of words over this one piece of wall is part of a much bigger debate .
for some berliners , the wall is a despised symbol of a totalitarian regime and should be completely destroyed .
for others , it 's a cultural artifact that should be kept for future generations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans called the wall souvenir hunters " mauerspecht " or " wallpeckers " only a few pieces of the berlin wall survived opening up of eastern germany on november 19 , 1989 and the resulting souvenir-hunting frenzy .
five months after the event , there were only six sections in the inner-city left standing . several of these remnants were in potsdamer platz , which lies in the center of berlin .
in the 1990s , the square underwent a massive rebuilding campaign - and in 1999 of chunks of wall were removed to make way for glittering modern skyscrapers . now , a rather inconspicuous line of cobblestone set in the pavement is otherwise the only mark of the former barrier between east and west germany . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans celebrate unity day with mixed emotions as germans celebrate the 16th anniversary of reunification tuesday , there 's no masking a sense of disillusionment at the failure to tackle the country 's economic and demographic woes resulting from the tumultuous event .

" these are very difficult times for the palestinian people , " he told reporters at a joint press conference with eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
the finance minister added that if the international community did not come to the aid of the palestinians , the outcome would be " devastating " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fayyad warns that lack of aid is devastating for the palestinians palestinian and european diplomats said the meeting itself was a sign that the eu was willing to give the new finance ministry a chance . the eu was the biggest aid donor to the palestinian government until the hamas militants came to power in march 2006 .
the quartet of middle east mediators - the european union , united states , united nations and russia - then suspended direct aid to the palestinian authority . eu bypasses unity government since then , the eu has redirected its funding , which reached 700 million euros in 2006 , through a special mechanism to help the neediest people while bypassing the government to avoid contact with hamas - which is considers a terrorist organization . at the brussels press conference , ferrero-waldner said this temporary mechanism would continue but offered fayyad technical assistance to get his finance ministry in order . she also repeated the international demands that the palestinian government renounce violence , formally recognize israel 's right to exist and abide by former agreements .
ferrero-waldner said until that happened the eu would only deal with what it considered to be western-friendly members of the new palestinian fatah-hamas unity government , which took power in march this year . bildunterschrift : lawmakers voted last month for a new unity government ferrero-waldner said she could " imagine informal exploratory talks " with foreign minister ziad abu amr , who , like fayyad , is an independent . fayyad , who as finance minister under the previous fatah government won praise for his reform of palestinian finances , said the unity government was committed to a platform to abide by " all the agreements entered into " . fayyad also met with the eu 's middle east peace envoy , marc otte , and european parliament leaders .

" these are very difficult times for the palestinian people , " he told reporters at a joint press conference with eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
the finance minister added that if the international community did not come to the aid of the palestinians , the outcome would be " devastating " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fayyad warns that lack of aid is devastating for the palestinians palestinian and european diplomats said the meeting itself was a sign that the eu was willing to give the new finance ministry a chance . the eu was the biggest aid donor to the palestinian government until the hamas militants came to power in march 2006 .
the quartet of middle east mediators - the european union , united states , united nations and russia - then suspended direct aid to the palestinian authority . eu bypasses unity government since then , the eu has redirected its funding , which reached 700 million euros in 2006 , through a special mechanism to help the neediest people while bypassing the government to avoid contact with hamas - which is considers a terrorist organization . at the brussels press conference , ferrero-waldner said this temporary mechanism would continue but offered fayyad technical assistance to get his finance ministry in order . she also repeated the international demands that the palestinian government renounce violence , formally recognize israel 's right to exist and abide by former agreements .
ferrero-waldner said until that happened the eu would only deal with what it considered to be western-friendly members of the new palestinian fatah-hamas unity government , which took power in march this year . bildunterschrift : lawmakers voted last month for a new unity government ferrero-waldner said she could " imagine informal exploratory talks " with foreign minister ziad abu amr , who , like fayyad , is an independent . fayyad , who as finance minister under the previous fatah government won praise for his reform of palestinian finances , said the unity government was committed to a platform to abide by " all the agreements entered into " . fayyad also met with the eu 's middle east peace envoy , marc otte , and european parliament leaders .

but it seems the 18m long strip of wall was n't nicked by souvenir hunters , it was hoisted off by the berlin government . erich stanke , who said he bought the chunk of wall back in 1990 from a border guard , is more than peeved .
he described the government 's action as a " cloak and dagger " affair . " people were shot here , and now this piece of human world heritage has simply been ripped up , " he said .
" it 's a disgrace . " stanke has lodged a complaint with the police because the contractors who removed the wall from potsdamer platz bored two holes in order to yank it out . " the wall is a protected monument and now it 's damaged , " stanke said . popular with tourists camera touting tourists regularly visited the piece of wall , which was brightly painted with graffiti and murals , such as a trabant , a typical east german car , bursting through the wall .
another mural carries the slogan " do n't destroy history " - a reference to attempts to preserve the berlin wall . the federal office for building and regional planning , who ordered the chunk 's removal , does n't know what all the fuss is about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potsdamer platz is now famous for its modern architecture " it 's been common knowledge for quite some time " that piece would have to make way for a new environment office building , spokesperson andreas kübler told the berliner zeitung . according to kübler , contrary to stanke 's claims , the city owned the piece of wall .

but in both cases the devices failed to go off and no one was injured . she stands accused of belonging to a terrorist organization and attempting bombing . the berlin court said that because gerhäuser had turned herself in to the authorities late last year , the maximum penalty she would face would be two-year suspended sentence . rote zora was a women 's splinter group that claimed responsibility for 45 bombings and cases of arson between april 1977 and february 1988 with the aim of bringing about radical change in german society . the group was part of the so-called revolutionary cells network until 1986 . debate about a wave of attacks unleashed by the far-left in germany in the 1970s and 1980s resurfaced in recent months as two former guerrillas from the red army faction sought release from prison . brigitte mohnhaupt , who was convicted for her role in nine murders in the left-wing group 's campaign against the west german state in the 1970s , left jail last month after 24 years in detention . a german court granted the 57-year-old 's release because she served her minimum sentence and was no longer considered a threat .
but a court in february refused prison day releases for christian klar , 54 , who led the raf along with mohnhaupt . the families of the victims of the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , have bitterly opposed any clemency , partly because mohnhaupt and klar never expressed remorse for the murders . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's radical left confronts global issues and enemy within europe 's radical left-wing groups are at the forefront of demonstrations against international injustice .

starting wednesday , she is being tried for her involvement in two botched terrorist attacks . a suspected member of a german left-wing extremist group admitted in court wednesday to two failed bomb attacks in the 1980s as her trial began in berlin . the 58-year-old defendant , adrienne gerhäuser , presented a statement saying that she had " knowingly and willingly " attempted to bomb the berlin genetic technical institute in 1986 and a clothing factory in bavaria in 1987 on behalf of the far-left organization rote zora . she said the attacks were motivated by her political beliefs at the time , including a fierce opposition to genetic engineering and solidarity with striking female factory workers in south korea . gerhäuser said she had provided alarm clocks for two detonators .
but in both cases the devices failed to go off and no one was injured . she stands accused of belonging to a terrorist organization and attempting bombing . the berlin court said that because gerhäuser had turned herself in to the authorities late last year , the maximum penalty she would face would be two-year suspended sentence . rote zora was a women 's splinter group that claimed responsibility for 45 bombings and cases of arson between april 1977 and february 1988 with the aim of bringing about radical change in german society . the group was part of the so-called revolutionary cells network until 1986 . debate about a wave of attacks unleashed by the far-left in germany in the 1970s and 1980s resurfaced in recent months as two former guerrillas from the red army faction sought release from prison . brigitte mohnhaupt , who was convicted for her role in nine murders in the left-wing group 's campaign against the west german state in the 1970s , left jail last month after 24 years in detention . a german court granted the 57-year-old 's release because she served her minimum sentence and was no longer considered a threat .
but a court in february refused prison day releases for christian klar , 54 , who led the raf along with mohnhaupt . the families of the victims of the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , have bitterly opposed any clemency , partly because mohnhaupt and klar never expressed remorse for the murders . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's radical left confronts global issues and enemy within europe 's radical left-wing groups are at the forefront of demonstrations against international injustice .

what 's missing , wrote dw ’ s peter philipp , is mutual trust . " what else is new ? " one could have asked when iran 's president mahmud ahmedinejad announced last weekend that his country is capable of industrially enriching uranium and now belongs to the nuclear club . but no one said that . instead , some saw the announcement as a new " provocation " of the west and began to speculate about when iran 's first nuclear bomb would be finished .
they also started to get used to the americans ' missile shield plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others , on the other hand , scoffed at the announcement .
they said iran really was n't that far along and ahmedinejad 's speech only proved that he is a good actor . as varied and contradictory as the reactions may be , they demonstrate yet again that the world does n't know how to deal with iran .
even competent experts all too often fall back on generalizations when it comes to the " iran issue . "
they speak of the " persian nuclear bomb " and try to measure just how close tehran is to reaching this goal . instead , a bit more sobriety and reserve are called for .
thus far , the " goal " of an iranian nuclear bomb has only existed in the minds of those who had always been suspicious of the regime in tehran and the revitalization of islam and politics that it embodied . how else can it be explained that , although iran has continually claimed that its atomic research is for peaceful purposes only and has belonged to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty for a long time already , it is still accused of having bad intentions ?
at the same time , not the slightest effort has been made to help the countries in the region that have not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty - israel , india and pakistan - to find the " right path . " the imbalance of the situation becomes even more apparent when we consider that legitimate circles of experts are not even blaming iran for enriching uranium , which is permitted under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
instead , iran is accused of not following the resolutions of the un security council , which is demanding precisely that which can not be demanded from iran - the suspension of its uranium enrichment program . nevertheless , it is indeed a good thing that there are those who are now appealing for negotiations with tehran .
without reciprocation , such negotiations are useless and it is unacceptable that governments are negotiating with tehran while at the same time enforcing sanctions . only when the west opens up to iran and drops its unjustified prerequisites can the tension ease .
of course , iran may still be charged with building nuclear weapons , but it has to be granted the rights that are matter of course for other countries . there 's no guarantee that iran wo n't build a nuclear bomb .

but it seems the 18m long strip of wall was n't nicked by souvenir hunters , it was hoisted off by the berlin government . erich stanke , who said he bought the chunk of wall back in 1990 from a border guard , is more than peeved .
he described the government 's action as a " cloak and dagger " affair . " people were shot here , and now this piece of human world heritage has simply been ripped up , " he said .
" it 's a disgrace . " stanke has lodged a complaint with the police because the contractors who removed the wall from potsdamer platz bored two holes in order to yank it out . " the wall is a protected monument and now it 's damaged , " stanke said . popular with tourists camera touting tourists regularly visited the piece of wall , which was brightly painted with graffiti and murals , such as a trabant , a typical east german car , bursting through the wall .
another mural carries the slogan " do n't destroy history " - a reference to attempts to preserve the berlin wall . the federal office for building and regional planning , who ordered the chunk 's removal , does n't know what all the fuss is about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potsdamer platz is now famous for its modern architecture " it 's been common knowledge for quite some time " that piece would have to make way for a new environment office building , spokesperson andreas kübler told the berliner zeitung . according to kübler , contrary to stanke 's claims , the city owned the piece of wall .
once the project is completed at the end of 2008 , the strip of wall will be on display inside the building and tourists will still be able to see it through a window . wider debate but the exchange of words over this one piece of wall is part of a much bigger debate .
for some berliners , the wall is a despised symbol of a totalitarian regime and should be completely destroyed .
for others , it 's a cultural artifact that should be kept for future generations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans called the wall souvenir hunters " mauerspecht " or " wallpeckers " only a few pieces of the berlin wall survived opening up of eastern germany on november 19 , 1989 and the resulting souvenir-hunting frenzy .
five months after the event , there were only six sections in the inner-city left standing . several of these remnants were in potsdamer platz , which lies in the center of berlin .
in the 1990s , the square underwent a massive rebuilding campaign - and in 1999 of chunks of wall were removed to make way for glittering modern skyscrapers . now , a rather inconspicuous line of cobblestone set in the pavement is otherwise the only mark of the former barrier between east and west germany . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans celebrate unity day with mixed emotions as germans celebrate the 16th anniversary of reunification tuesday , there 's no masking a sense of disillusionment at the failure to tackle the country 's economic and demographic woes resulting from the tumultuous event .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.04.2007 eu member bulgaria still bears signs of its communist past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria became a member of the european union on jan .
1 , 2007 bulgaria now marks the european union 's new eastern border .
although the country still bears the signs of its communist past , there is also evidence of a move toward european standards . at sofia 's new international airport terminal , new signs welcome visitors to " the eu country , bulgaria , " and the passport control boasts new counters - one for eu and the other for non-eu citizens . outside the terminal , shiny new taxis wait to ferry customers into the city .
next to the meter , a sticker tells people their ride will cost them some two leva per kilometer - about one euro -lrb- $ 1.33 -rrb- . many of the taxis in sofia 's capital are also new , but a ride in one of them costs about 75 percent less than the taxis at the international terminal .
this price difference is completely legal , but it does beg the question of why the cheap taxis have n't managed to find their way out to the airport ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why are the taxis in town cheaper than at the airport ?
the reason ca n't be because the taxi drivers get lost - sofia 's roads and freeways are now signposted to european standards . the mafia ? in the past few years , there have been spectacular headlines about former communist functionaries and secret service officers who managed to privatize - in their own creative ways - the state 's treasuries and meet the challenges of the market economy with gold-stuffed suitcases in their hands . according to dimitar ludzhev , who was deputy-prime minister in bulgaria 's first non-communist government , the secret service played a key roll in this .
those working in bulgaria 's 300 foreign-based firms gathered intelligence and carried out economic espionage , while the domestic secret service was in charge of the smuggling routes and the illegal transfers of luxury goods . many observers say this was the birth of organized crime in bulgaria .
after the fall of communism in 1989 , those who had worked for the secret police used their knowledge to stay in business - but this time in the private " shadow " economy . no kickbacks ? bulgaria 's border with non-eu member serbia lies just 60 km -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- away from its capital city sofia .
but there 's not much traffic heading out of bulgaria towards its western neighbor these days along the route which used to be heavily used as part of the highway system running from turkey over sofia to belgrade and budapest and then to western europe . some trucks and busses are waiting at the kalotina border crossing , with turkish , bulgarian and german plates .
everything seems to be working smoothly and efficiently - the police and customers officers are friendly and do n't mind us observing their work . bildunterschrift : former secret service members are allegedly still involved in border smuggling there are also new signs on the border : " no payments here , only passport control . "
this has a clear meaning - bribery has no place here .
well not any more , as the officers at the border explain with a degree of pride . but even if kickbacks are no longer expected at kalotin , it 's a different story in other parts of eastern europe according to one of the bus drivers . " well , in serbia , five euros are expected unless you want to wait two or three hours , " he said .
" and it 's the same in hungary , that is if you do n't want to have your whole luggage searched . " not the same everywhere europe 's new eastern border is long and winds from kalotina south to the strumica river , where it meets the greek and macedonian borders .
here , just near the border lies blagoevgrad - earlier a well-known smuggling town and today infamous as the gangster capital of bulgaria . peter ivanov , 26 , from blagoevgrad 's radio station , joked that nowhere else in europe are there so many limousines as here .
his reason for blagoevgrad 's popularity with crime syndicates - its proximity to three borders . but dimitar ivanov -lrb- not related to peter ivanov -rrb- , a businessman , who used to work for bulgaria 's secret service , is adamant that former members of the service have nothing to do with the bulgarian mafia . " it 's a propaganda theory , " dimitar ivanov said .
" it 's propaganda from the right . " his former colleague in the secrete service zvetko zvetkov , however , would beg to differ . " you could very well establish a link -lrb- between the mafia -rrb- and the former secret service and the former regime , " zvetkov said . zvetkov , who in communist times was in charge of spying on the intellectuals , has been trying for years to shed light on the links between the bulgarian secret service and the criminal underworld . hartmut lüning and alexander andreev -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bulgaria : building a controversial eu transit route european union funds are financing a conflict-ridden highway on the outskirts of sofia .

but it seems the 18m long strip of wall was n't nicked by souvenir hunters , it was hoisted off by the berlin government . erich stanke , who said he bought the chunk of wall back in 1990 from a border guard , is more than peeved .
he described the government 's action as a " cloak and dagger " affair . " people were shot here , and now this piece of human world heritage has simply been ripped up , " he said .
" it 's a disgrace . " stanke has lodged a complaint with the police because the contractors who removed the wall from potsdamer platz bored two holes in order to yank it out . " the wall is a protected monument and now it 's damaged , " stanke said . popular with tourists camera touting tourists regularly visited the piece of wall , which was brightly painted with graffiti and murals , such as a trabant , a typical east german car , bursting through the wall .
another mural carries the slogan " do n't destroy history " - a reference to attempts to preserve the berlin wall . the federal office for building and regional planning , who ordered the chunk 's removal , does n't know what all the fuss is about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potsdamer platz is now famous for its modern architecture " it 's been common knowledge for quite some time " that piece would have to make way for a new environment office building , spokesperson andreas kübler told the berliner zeitung . according to kübler , contrary to stanke 's claims , the city owned the piece of wall .
once the project is completed at the end of 2008 , the strip of wall will be on display inside the building and tourists will still be able to see it through a window . wider debate but the exchange of words over this one piece of wall is part of a much bigger debate .
for some berliners , the wall is a despised symbol of a totalitarian regime and should be completely destroyed .
for others , it 's a cultural artifact that should be kept for future generations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans called the wall souvenir hunters " mauerspecht " or " wallpeckers " only a few pieces of the berlin wall survived opening up of eastern germany on november 19 , 1989 and the resulting souvenir-hunting frenzy .
five months after the event , there were only six sections in the inner-city left standing . several of these remnants were in potsdamer platz , which lies in the center of berlin .
in the 1990s , the square underwent a massive rebuilding campaign - and in 1999 of chunks of wall were removed to make way for glittering modern skyscrapers . now , a rather inconspicuous line of cobblestone set in the pavement is otherwise the only mark of the former barrier between east and west germany . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans celebrate unity day with mixed emotions as germans celebrate the 16th anniversary of reunification tuesday , there 's no masking a sense of disillusionment at the failure to tackle the country 's economic and demographic woes resulting from the tumultuous event .

some employees would like to see their working conditions improved . the world 's biggest food retailer , mcdonald 's has decided germany is ripe for the mccafe - a coffee shop integrated into mcdonald 's restaurants offering drinks from cappuccinos to lattes , as well as panini , cookies and cakes . around 240 of germany 's 1,276 mcdonalds have been renovated to incorporate the snazzier-looking mccafe , and at least another 100 are expected to follow this year . the dark brown leather chairs , sleek wood deco and shiny glass displays are a giant step away from the shrill yellow and red plastic traditionally associated with mcdonalds restaurants - and they are proving popular with customers . the turnover in the redesigned stores has increased by 10 percent to 15 percent . " we assumed that the mccafe would attract younger people , but surprisingly the over-50s , who otherwise never enter a mcdonalds , are coming , " said mcdonald 's germany chief , bane knezevic , in an interview with the german daily tagespiegel . gourmet coffee on the rise trendy coffee chains such as starbucks and balzac have been mushrooming in germany 's big cities - and mcdonald 's just was n't proving attractive to those who wanted to chill out and choose from a wide variety of coffees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's is giving many of its german restaurants a make-over " for a long time , we were n't modern enough for our customers , " knezevic said .
though it has also taken a while for the mccafe to come to germany - they were first introduced in australia in 1993 . knezevic also said mcdonald 's would introduce coffee beans certified by the rain forest alliance . although mcdonald 's might be moving in a socially responsible direction with its coffee , the chain reportedly still has room for improvement when it comes to its employees . accusations against mcdonald 's in a report on germany 's public zdf television broadcast on april 3 , former mcdonald 's employees listed a series of complaints against the food chain , including arbitrary firings and the bullying of works council representatives . former employees interviewed by zdf tell of attempts to buy off works council representatives .
they also accused mcdonald 's of having a policy of employing young people with immigrant backgrounds and firing anyone who complains . after asking for a pay rise , and saying she wanted to establish a works council , former mcdonald 's employee nicole wieseler was fired after seven years working for the company . " i was fired without notice just before the end of my holiday , and they also gave me a written order banning me from all mcdonald 's restaurants , " wieseler told zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's is under fire in china this week for allegedly paying below the minimum wage " they did n't give me a reason , and i just did n't understand it , " she added .
" i found the ban pretty harsh - it was hung up in all restaurants .
i felt like a murderer . " wieseler took case to court and won .
mcdonald 's maintains wieseler 's dismissal had nothing to do with her union activity . mcdonald 's in germany has more than 52,000 employers , but there are only 17 works councils - these are employee committees that give voice to workers ' concerns .

what 's missing , wrote dw ’ s peter philipp , is mutual trust . " what else is new ? " one could have asked when iran 's president mahmud ahmedinejad announced last weekend that his country is capable of industrially enriching uranium and now belongs to the nuclear club . but no one said that . instead , some saw the announcement as a new " provocation " of the west and began to speculate about when iran 's first nuclear bomb would be finished .
they also started to get used to the americans ' missile shield plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others , on the other hand , scoffed at the announcement .
they said iran really was n't that far along and ahmedinejad 's speech only proved that he is a good actor . as varied and contradictory as the reactions may be , they demonstrate yet again that the world does n't know how to deal with iran .
even competent experts all too often fall back on generalizations when it comes to the " iran issue . "
they speak of the " persian nuclear bomb " and try to measure just how close tehran is to reaching this goal . instead , a bit more sobriety and reserve are called for .
thus far , the " goal " of an iranian nuclear bomb has only existed in the minds of those who had always been suspicious of the regime in tehran and the revitalization of islam and politics that it embodied . how else can it be explained that , although iran has continually claimed that its atomic research is for peaceful purposes only and has belonged to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty for a long time already , it is still accused of having bad intentions ?
at the same time , not the slightest effort has been made to help the countries in the region that have not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty - israel , india and pakistan - to find the " right path . " the imbalance of the situation becomes even more apparent when we consider that legitimate circles of experts are not even blaming iran for enriching uranium , which is permitted under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
instead , iran is accused of not following the resolutions of the un security council , which is demanding precisely that which can not be demanded from iran - the suspension of its uranium enrichment program . nevertheless , it is indeed a good thing that there are those who are now appealing for negotiations with tehran .
without reciprocation , such negotiations are useless and it is unacceptable that governments are negotiating with tehran while at the same time enforcing sanctions . only when the west opens up to iran and drops its unjustified prerequisites can the tension ease .
of course , iran may still be charged with building nuclear weapons , but it has to be granted the rights that are matter of course for other countries . there 's no guarantee that iran wo n't build a nuclear bomb .

what 's missing , wrote dw ’ s peter philipp , is mutual trust . " what else is new ? " one could have asked when iran 's president mahmud ahmedinejad announced last weekend that his country is capable of industrially enriching uranium and now belongs to the nuclear club . but no one said that . instead , some saw the announcement as a new " provocation " of the west and began to speculate about when iran 's first nuclear bomb would be finished .
they also started to get used to the americans ' missile shield plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others , on the other hand , scoffed at the announcement .
they said iran really was n't that far along and ahmedinejad 's speech only proved that he is a good actor . as varied and contradictory as the reactions may be , they demonstrate yet again that the world does n't know how to deal with iran .
even competent experts all too often fall back on generalizations when it comes to the " iran issue . "
they speak of the " persian nuclear bomb " and try to measure just how close tehran is to reaching this goal . instead , a bit more sobriety and reserve are called for .
thus far , the " goal " of an iranian nuclear bomb has only existed in the minds of those who had always been suspicious of the regime in tehran and the revitalization of islam and politics that it embodied . how else can it be explained that , although iran has continually claimed that its atomic research is for peaceful purposes only and has belonged to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty for a long time already , it is still accused of having bad intentions ?
at the same time , not the slightest effort has been made to help the countries in the region that have not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty - israel , india and pakistan - to find the " right path . " the imbalance of the situation becomes even more apparent when we consider that legitimate circles of experts are not even blaming iran for enriching uranium , which is permitted under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
instead , iran is accused of not following the resolutions of the un security council , which is demanding precisely that which can not be demanded from iran - the suspension of its uranium enrichment program . nevertheless , it is indeed a good thing that there are those who are now appealing for negotiations with tehran .
without reciprocation , such negotiations are useless and it is unacceptable that governments are negotiating with tehran while at the same time enforcing sanctions . only when the west opens up to iran and drops its unjustified prerequisites can the tension ease .
of course , iran may still be charged with building nuclear weapons , but it has to be granted the rights that are matter of course for other countries . there 's no guarantee that iran wo n't build a nuclear bomb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.04.2007 eu member bulgaria still bears signs of its communist past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria became a member of the european union on jan .
1 , 2007 bulgaria now marks the european union 's new eastern border .
although the country still bears the signs of its communist past , there is also evidence of a move toward european standards . at sofia 's new international airport terminal , new signs welcome visitors to " the eu country , bulgaria , " and the passport control boasts new counters - one for eu and the other for non-eu citizens . outside the terminal , shiny new taxis wait to ferry customers into the city .
next to the meter , a sticker tells people their ride will cost them some two leva per kilometer - about one euro -lrb- $ 1.33 -rrb- . many of the taxis in sofia 's capital are also new , but a ride in one of them costs about 75 percent less than the taxis at the international terminal .
this price difference is completely legal , but it does beg the question of why the cheap taxis have n't managed to find their way out to the airport ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why are the taxis in town cheaper than at the airport ?
the reason ca n't be because the taxi drivers get lost - sofia 's roads and freeways are now signposted to european standards . the mafia ? in the past few years , there have been spectacular headlines about former communist functionaries and secret service officers who managed to privatize - in their own creative ways - the state 's treasuries and meet the challenges of the market economy with gold-stuffed suitcases in their hands . according to dimitar ludzhev , who was deputy-prime minister in bulgaria 's first non-communist government , the secret service played a key roll in this .
those working in bulgaria 's 300 foreign-based firms gathered intelligence and carried out economic espionage , while the domestic secret service was in charge of the smuggling routes and the illegal transfers of luxury goods . many observers say this was the birth of organized crime in bulgaria .
after the fall of communism in 1989 , those who had worked for the secret police used their knowledge to stay in business - but this time in the private " shadow " economy . no kickbacks ? bulgaria 's border with non-eu member serbia lies just 60 km -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- away from its capital city sofia .
but there 's not much traffic heading out of bulgaria towards its western neighbor these days along the route which used to be heavily used as part of the highway system running from turkey over sofia to belgrade and budapest and then to western europe . some trucks and busses are waiting at the kalotina border crossing , with turkish , bulgarian and german plates .
everything seems to be working smoothly and efficiently - the police and customers officers are friendly and do n't mind us observing their work . bildunterschrift : former secret service members are allegedly still involved in border smuggling there are also new signs on the border : " no payments here , only passport control . "
this has a clear meaning - bribery has no place here .
well not any more , as the officers at the border explain with a degree of pride . but even if kickbacks are no longer expected at kalotin , it 's a different story in other parts of eastern europe according to one of the bus drivers . " well , in serbia , five euros are expected unless you want to wait two or three hours , " he said .
" and it 's the same in hungary , that is if you do n't want to have your whole luggage searched . " not the same everywhere europe 's new eastern border is long and winds from kalotina south to the strumica river , where it meets the greek and macedonian borders .
here , just near the border lies blagoevgrad - earlier a well-known smuggling town and today infamous as the gangster capital of bulgaria . peter ivanov , 26 , from blagoevgrad 's radio station , joked that nowhere else in europe are there so many limousines as here .
his reason for blagoevgrad 's popularity with crime syndicates - its proximity to three borders . but dimitar ivanov -lrb- not related to peter ivanov -rrb- , a businessman , who used to work for bulgaria 's secret service , is adamant that former members of the service have nothing to do with the bulgarian mafia . " it 's a propaganda theory , " dimitar ivanov said .
" it 's propaganda from the right . " his former colleague in the secrete service zvetko zvetkov , however , would beg to differ . " you could very well establish a link -lrb- between the mafia -rrb- and the former secret service and the former regime , " zvetkov said . zvetkov , who in communist times was in charge of spying on the intellectuals , has been trying for years to shed light on the links between the bulgarian secret service and the criminal underworld . hartmut lüning and alexander andreev -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bulgaria : building a controversial eu transit route european union funds are financing a conflict-ridden highway on the outskirts of sofia .
but bulgarian environmental groups claim the new road will do little to alleviate the capital 's traffic nightmare .
-lrb- 21.03.2007 -rrb- european papers give cool reception to new eu members european commentators on tuesday had mixed reactions about bulgaria and romania 's entry into the european union .
-lrb- 02.01.2007 -rrb- will eu entry shrink bulgaria 's population even more ?
bulgarian towns are shrinking , and the birth rate is falling rapidly .
now bulgarians are worried that even more of their young people will leave after the country joins the eu on jan 1 .

it is intended to represent the interests of all muslims throughout germany and be a contact point for politicians . rafet öztürk of the cologne-based turkish-islamic union of the institute for religion -lrb- ditib -rrb- said four different muslim associations had established the umbrella organization called the " muslim coordination council " -lrb- krm -rrb- .
in addition to ditib , the others include the central council of muslims -lrb- zdm -rrb- , the islamic council and the association of islamic cultural centers -lrb- vikz -rrb- . the associations will remain independent , but the krm is to be a central contact center for political dialogue , öztürk said .
the umbrella organization is also intended to foster commonalities between the four groups . " we want to put ourselves to the test as to whether we can make decisions together , " öztürk said . " door open to all muslims " earlier this week , thousands of muslims gathered at the cologne arena to celebrate the birthday of their prophet mohammed .
there , the associations made the announcement , though the decision had already been made in march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish woman and two germans speak about the ramadan feast in essen " german chancellor angela merkel and minister of the interior wolfgang schäuble now have the historical chance of making decisions and binding agreements about integration policies with muslims for the coming years , " bekir alboga of ditib told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- paper . the krm hopes to be able to influence political decisions , such as about islam religion classes in school . according to alboga , contact offices are supposed to be established in the various german states , with the presidency of the association to alternate every six months .
the central council of muslims is to begin the first presidency , with ditib then taking over half a year later .

some employees would like to see their working conditions improved . the world 's biggest food retailer , mcdonald 's has decided germany is ripe for the mccafe - a coffee shop integrated into mcdonald 's restaurants offering drinks from cappuccinos to lattes , as well as panini , cookies and cakes . around 240 of germany 's 1,276 mcdonalds have been renovated to incorporate the snazzier-looking mccafe , and at least another 100 are expected to follow this year . the dark brown leather chairs , sleek wood deco and shiny glass displays are a giant step away from the shrill yellow and red plastic traditionally associated with mcdonalds restaurants - and they are proving popular with customers . the turnover in the redesigned stores has increased by 10 percent to 15 percent .

they also accused mcdonald 's of having a policy of employing young people with immigrant backgrounds and firing anyone who complains . after asking for a pay rise , and saying she wanted to establish a works council , former mcdonald 's employee nicole wieseler was fired after seven years working for the company .

1 , 2007 bulgaria now marks the european union 's new eastern border .
although the country still bears the signs of its communist past , there is also evidence of a move toward european standards . at sofia 's new international airport terminal , new signs welcome visitors to " the eu country , bulgaria , " and the passport control boasts new counters - one for eu and the other for non-eu citizens . outside the terminal , shiny new taxis wait to ferry customers into the city .
next to the meter , a sticker tells people their ride will cost them some two leva per kilometer - about one euro -lrb- $ 1.33 -rrb- . many of the taxis in sofia 's capital are also new , but a ride in one of them costs about 75 percent less than the taxis at the international terminal .
this price difference is completely legal , but it does beg the question of why the cheap taxis have n't managed to find their way out to the airport ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why are the taxis in town cheaper than at the airport ?
the reason ca n't be because the taxi drivers get lost - sofia 's roads and freeways are now signposted to european standards . the mafia ? in the past few years , there have been spectacular headlines about former communist functionaries and secret service officers who managed to privatize - in their own creative ways - the state 's treasuries and meet the challenges of the market economy with gold-stuffed suitcases in their hands . according to dimitar ludzhev , who was deputy-prime minister in bulgaria 's first non-communist government , the secret service played a key roll in this .
those working in bulgaria 's 300 foreign-based firms gathered intelligence and carried out economic espionage , while the domestic secret service was in charge of the smuggling routes and the illegal transfers of luxury goods . many observers say this was the birth of organized crime in bulgaria .
after the fall of communism in 1989 , those who had worked for the secret police used their knowledge to stay in business - but this time in the private " shadow " economy . no kickbacks ? bulgaria 's border with non-eu member serbia lies just 60 km -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- away from its capital city sofia .
but there 's not much traffic heading out of bulgaria towards its western neighbor these days along the route which used to be heavily used as part of the highway system running from turkey over sofia to belgrade and budapest and then to western europe . some trucks and busses are waiting at the kalotina border crossing , with turkish , bulgarian and german plates .
everything seems to be working smoothly and efficiently - the police and customers officers are friendly and do n't mind us observing their work . bildunterschrift : former secret service members are allegedly still involved in border smuggling there are also new signs on the border : " no payments here , only passport control . "
this has a clear meaning - bribery has no place here .
well not any more , as the officers at the border explain with a degree of pride . but even if kickbacks are no longer expected at kalotin , it 's a different story in other parts of eastern europe according to one of the bus drivers . " well , in serbia , five euros are expected unless you want to wait two or three hours , " he said .
" and it 's the same in hungary , that is if you do n't want to have your whole luggage searched . " not the same everywhere europe 's new eastern border is long and winds from kalotina south to the strumica river , where it meets the greek and macedonian borders .
here , just near the border lies blagoevgrad - earlier a well-known smuggling town and today infamous as the gangster capital of bulgaria . peter ivanov , 26 , from blagoevgrad 's radio station , joked that nowhere else in europe are there so many limousines as here .
his reason for blagoevgrad 's popularity with crime syndicates - its proximity to three borders . but dimitar ivanov -lrb- not related to peter ivanov -rrb- , a businessman , who used to work for bulgaria 's secret service , is adamant that former members of the service have nothing to do with the bulgarian mafia . " it 's a propaganda theory , " dimitar ivanov said .
" it 's propaganda from the right . " his former colleague in the secrete service zvetko zvetkov , however , would beg to differ . " you could very well establish a link -lrb- between the mafia -rrb- and the former secret service and the former regime , " zvetkov said . zvetkov , who in communist times was in charge of spying on the intellectuals , has been trying for years to shed light on the links between the bulgarian secret service and the criminal underworld . hartmut lüning and alexander andreev -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bulgaria : building a controversial eu transit route european union funds are financing a conflict-ridden highway on the outskirts of sofia .
but bulgarian environmental groups claim the new road will do little to alleviate the capital 's traffic nightmare .

-lrb- 02.01.2007 -rrb- will eu entry shrink bulgaria 's population even more ?
bulgarian towns are shrinking , and the birth rate is falling rapidly .
now bulgarians are worried that even more of their young people will leave after the country joins the eu on jan 1 .

some employees would like to see their working conditions improved . the world 's biggest food retailer , mcdonald 's has decided germany is ripe for the mccafe - a coffee shop integrated into mcdonald 's restaurants offering drinks from cappuccinos to lattes , as well as panini , cookies and cakes . around 240 of germany 's 1,276 mcdonalds have been renovated to incorporate the snazzier-looking mccafe , and at least another 100 are expected to follow this year . the dark brown leather chairs , sleek wood deco and shiny glass displays are a giant step away from the shrill yellow and red plastic traditionally associated with mcdonalds restaurants - and they are proving popular with customers . the turnover in the redesigned stores has increased by 10 percent to 15 percent . " we assumed that the mccafe would attract younger people , but surprisingly the over-50s , who otherwise never enter a mcdonalds , are coming , " said mcdonald 's germany chief , bane knezevic , in an interview with the german daily tagespiegel . gourmet coffee on the rise trendy coffee chains such as starbucks and balzac have been mushrooming in germany 's big cities - and mcdonald 's just was n't proving attractive to those who wanted to chill out and choose from a wide variety of coffees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's is giving many of its german restaurants a make-over " for a long time , we were n't modern enough for our customers , " knezevic said .
though it has also taken a while for the mccafe to come to germany - they were first introduced in australia in 1993 . knezevic also said mcdonald 's would introduce coffee beans certified by the rain forest alliance . although mcdonald 's might be moving in a socially responsible direction with its coffee , the chain reportedly still has room for improvement when it comes to its employees . accusations against mcdonald 's in a report on germany 's public zdf television broadcast on april 3 , former mcdonald 's employees listed a series of complaints against the food chain , including arbitrary firings and the bullying of works council representatives . former employees interviewed by zdf tell of attempts to buy off works council representatives .
they also accused mcdonald 's of having a policy of employing young people with immigrant backgrounds and firing anyone who complains . after asking for a pay rise , and saying she wanted to establish a works council , former mcdonald 's employee nicole wieseler was fired after seven years working for the company . " i was fired without notice just before the end of my holiday , and they also gave me a written order banning me from all mcdonald 's restaurants , " wieseler told zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's is under fire in china this week for allegedly paying below the minimum wage " they did n't give me a reason , and i just did n't understand it , " she added .
" i found the ban pretty harsh - it was hung up in all restaurants .
i felt like a murderer . " wieseler took case to court and won .
mcdonald 's maintains wieseler 's dismissal had nothing to do with her union activity . mcdonald 's in germany has more than 52,000 employers , but there are only 17 works councils - these are employee committees that give voice to workers ' concerns . " we do n't have anything against unions , " stefan fehr , the head of mcdonald 's ' personal department in germany , told zdf .

the first leg in italy ended in a draw .
so who 's more likely to progress ? no one is more qualified to answer a question about bayern munich versus ac milan than giovanni trapattoni , who has coached both clubs during his storied career .
he told dw-world.de to expect a close match on wednesday . " it 's still wide open , " trapattoni said .
" of course , bayern are the slight favorites , but 2-all is a difficult first-leg result .
they ca n't just go full bore offensively at home , because milan - with players like kaká , gilardino or inzaghi - are very dangerous on the counter-attack .
a waiting game would also be risky .
but if bayern play the same way they did in milan they 'll get through . " munich clawed out a draw in san siro last week , thanks to a pair of goals by defender daniel van buyten , so in fact they 'll be looking to hold milan to fewer than two goals . bayern 's main worries are midfielder bastian schweinsteiger , who 's touch-and-go with a banged-up knee , and milan 's filippo inzaghi .
no one has scored more often against bayern in the champions league than the crafty striker .
still , bayern have no reason to be quaking in their boots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milan up-ended bayern last year in the champions league " this year , " trapattoni said , " milan are n't showing anything like their past form , and not all their players at their best .
they went all out to win their home leg .
they tried to score goals , and in the end , it did n't turn out well . " wednesday 's other semi-final should be a far more relaxed affair , with liverpool taking a 3-nil advantage over psv eindhoven into anfield .
the dutch guests , who are focusing on their domestic league , have already indicated they 'll rest some key players for the match . man u steamroll rome , chelsea pip valencia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cristiano ronaldo booted a pair of goals past rome in the rout whoever prevails in munich may wish they had n't , as their semi-final opponents will be manchester united .
the red devils progressed on tuesday after flattening as rome 7-1 in old trafford . man u clearly wanted to send a message after an away leg marred by violence against their supporters and some controversial refereeing decisions .
michael carrick scored the opener in the 11th minute , and in the barrage that followed , rome could hardly have been more shocked , had george best returned from the dead , pint glass in hand , to knock one past luckless keeper doni . meanwhile , manchester 's premiership rivals were doing what they do best against valencia - getting a narrow , and somewhat fortunate result . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea just managed to push their way past well-organized valencia the blues traveled to spain needing to make up for a disappointing 1-all draw in the first leg , and things did n't look good when the hosts took a 1-nil lead into the break . but much-criticized striker andriy shevchenko knotted things up in the 52nd minute .

some employees would like to see their working conditions improved . the world 's biggest food retailer , mcdonald 's has decided germany is ripe for the mccafe - a coffee shop integrated into mcdonald 's restaurants offering drinks from cappuccinos to lattes , as well as panini , cookies and cakes . around 240 of germany 's 1,276 mcdonalds have been renovated to incorporate the snazzier-looking mccafe , and at least another 100 are expected to follow this year . the dark brown leather chairs , sleek wood deco and shiny glass displays are a giant step away from the shrill yellow and red plastic traditionally associated with mcdonalds restaurants - and they are proving popular with customers . the turnover in the redesigned stores has increased by 10 percent to 15 percent . " we assumed that the mccafe would attract younger people , but surprisingly the over-50s , who otherwise never enter a mcdonalds , are coming , " said mcdonald 's germany chief , bane knezevic , in an interview with the german daily tagespiegel . gourmet coffee on the rise trendy coffee chains such as starbucks and balzac have been mushrooming in germany 's big cities - and mcdonald 's just was n't proving attractive to those who wanted to chill out and choose from a wide variety of coffees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's is giving many of its german restaurants a make-over " for a long time , we were n't modern enough for our customers , " knezevic said .
though it has also taken a while for the mccafe to come to germany - they were first introduced in australia in 1993 . knezevic also said mcdonald 's would introduce coffee beans certified by the rain forest alliance . although mcdonald 's might be moving in a socially responsible direction with its coffee , the chain reportedly still has room for improvement when it comes to its employees . accusations against mcdonald 's in a report on germany 's public zdf television broadcast on april 3 , former mcdonald 's employees listed a series of complaints against the food chain , including arbitrary firings and the bullying of works council representatives . former employees interviewed by zdf tell of attempts to buy off works council representatives .
they also accused mcdonald 's of having a policy of employing young people with immigrant backgrounds and firing anyone who complains . after asking for a pay rise , and saying she wanted to establish a works council , former mcdonald 's employee nicole wieseler was fired after seven years working for the company . " i was fired without notice just before the end of my holiday , and they also gave me a written order banning me from all mcdonald 's restaurants , " wieseler told zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's is under fire in china this week for allegedly paying below the minimum wage " they did n't give me a reason , and i just did n't understand it , " she added .
" i found the ban pretty harsh - it was hung up in all restaurants .
i felt like a murderer . " wieseler took case to court and won .
mcdonald 's maintains wieseler 's dismissal had nothing to do with her union activity . mcdonald 's in germany has more than 52,000 employers , but there are only 17 works councils - these are employee committees that give voice to workers ' concerns . " we do n't have anything against unions , " stefan fehr , the head of mcdonald 's ' personal department in germany , told zdf .
" it 's up to our workers to start up works councils and not us .

some employees would like to see their working conditions improved . the world 's biggest food retailer , mcdonald 's has decided germany is ripe for the mccafe - a coffee shop integrated into mcdonald 's restaurants offering drinks from cappuccinos to lattes , as well as panini , cookies and cakes . around 240 of germany 's 1,276 mcdonalds have been renovated to incorporate the snazzier-looking mccafe , and at least another 100 are expected to follow this year . the dark brown leather chairs , sleek wood deco and shiny glass displays are a giant step away from the shrill yellow and red plastic traditionally associated with mcdonalds restaurants - and they are proving popular with customers . the turnover in the redesigned stores has increased by 10 percent to 15 percent . " we assumed that the mccafe would attract younger people , but surprisingly the over-50s , who otherwise never enter a mcdonalds , are coming , " said mcdonald 's germany chief , bane knezevic , in an interview with the german daily tagespiegel . gourmet coffee on the rise trendy coffee chains such as starbucks and balzac have been mushrooming in germany 's big cities - and mcdonald 's just was n't proving attractive to those who wanted to chill out and choose from a wide variety of coffees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's is giving many of its german restaurants a make-over " for a long time , we were n't modern enough for our customers , " knezevic said .
though it has also taken a while for the mccafe to come to germany - they were first introduced in australia in 1993 . knezevic also said mcdonald 's would introduce coffee beans certified by the rain forest alliance . although mcdonald 's might be moving in a socially responsible direction with its coffee , the chain reportedly still has room for improvement when it comes to its employees . accusations against mcdonald 's in a report on germany 's public zdf television broadcast on april 3 , former mcdonald 's employees listed a series of complaints against the food chain , including arbitrary firings and the bullying of works council representatives . former employees interviewed by zdf tell of attempts to buy off works council representatives .
they also accused mcdonald 's of having a policy of employing young people with immigrant backgrounds and firing anyone who complains . after asking for a pay rise , and saying she wanted to establish a works council , former mcdonald 's employee nicole wieseler was fired after seven years working for the company . " i was fired without notice just before the end of my holiday , and they also gave me a written order banning me from all mcdonald 's restaurants , " wieseler told zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's is under fire in china this week for allegedly paying below the minimum wage " they did n't give me a reason , and i just did n't understand it , " she added .
" i found the ban pretty harsh - it was hung up in all restaurants .
i felt like a murderer . " wieseler took case to court and won .
mcdonald 's maintains wieseler 's dismissal had nothing to do with her union activity . mcdonald 's in germany has more than 52,000 employers , but there are only 17 works councils - these are employee committees that give voice to workers ' concerns . " we do n't have anything against unions , " stefan fehr , the head of mcdonald 's ' personal department in germany , told zdf .
" it 's up to our workers to start up works councils and not us .

half of the arrests involved islamist extremism - the most dangerous variety of terrorism , the report says . the cross-border police agency europol released the report as eu politicians debated proposals to expand the powers of european law enforcement .
presenting the report to the european parliament in brussels on tuesday , europol chief max-peter ratzel made the case for a broader mandate for his organization . “ the mandate is currently limited to organized crime , which means that in each individual case we have to demonstrate a link or connection to local structures before we pass on the data , ” ratzel explained to a parliamentary committee .
“ in the fields of serial murder , online child pornography or travelling hooligans , local structures are generally not affected , but that is precisely the added value for -lrb- eu -rrb- member states . ” the eu commission has already proposed a reform bill to expand europol ’ s mandate , and the german presidency of the european union has also endorsed the proposal .
ratzel said terrorism is a situation that affects europe as a whole , and that it was important to share information among the member states in order to “ recognize the signs early on and act pre-emptively on dangers . ” but this also earned the europol chief some criticism from parliamentarians concerned about privacy rights .
agustín díaz de mera of the conservative evp told ratzel his agency needed to adopt more “ democratic transparency . ” separatists responsible for bulk of eu terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eta bomb at madrid 's barajas international airport ratzel expressed concern about what the europol report says is a growing threat of terrorism in europe .
nearly 500 terrorism-related offences were carried out in the 27-nation bloc last year , the report says ; however , most of them were carried out by separatists on the french island of corsica and in the spanish basque region . with 343 arrests last year , france saw the largest amount of terrorist activity .
most attacks took place on the mediterranean island of corsica , where separatists opposed to french rule have waged a low-intensity war of independence for over three decades . most of these attacks only caused property damage , with the notable exception of basque separatist group eta ’ s december 30th bombing of a parking garage at madrid barajas international airport , which killed two people and wounded several dozen more .
it was one of 145 attacks in spain last year , and the group ’ s first fatal attack since 2003 . europol says eta has “ rebuilt its capabilities ” despite a march 2006 truce with the spanish government , and is prepared to “ strike with well-prepared , organized and coordinated attacks against high-profile targets . ”
eta on sunday stood by the 2006 ceasefire , but said it would resume its armed struggle for basque independence if spain did not allow eta ’ s banned political wing to participate in local elections in may . 156 people were arrested on terrorism charges in britain .
europol did not list any terror-related offences for the 10 newest member states , most of them eastern european , that joined the eu in 2004 . islamist extremism called greatest danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic terrorism is the most dangerous , the report says the report says that acts of terrorism motivated by radical islamic ideologies pose the greatest threat to european security , in part because they aim to maximize human casualties .
as examples of islamic extremism in europe , the report cites the failed plot to bomb two regional trains in western germany . that plot was foiled by fate rather than by the police , as the crude suitcase bombs did not go off due to a technical malfunction .
ratzel also mentions last year ’ s attempted attack on transatlantic flights from british airports , which was foiled by the authorities at the last minute . the report says half of the total number of arrests was related to islamist militants .
as examples of terrorist crimes , the police agency lists disseminating terrorist propaganda , financing terrorism , forging documents or providing safe houses for illegal operatives , among others . “ we have to take care that these things don ’ t further escalate , ” ratzel told the parliamentary committee . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany determined to strengthen european police agency germany 's security policy during its eu presidency aims to give europol additional powers in order to better fight international terrorism and cross-border crime .

half of the arrests involved islamist extremism - the most dangerous variety of terrorism , the report says . the cross-border police agency europol released the report as eu politicians debated proposals to expand the powers of european law enforcement .
presenting the report to the european parliament in brussels on tuesday , europol chief max-peter ratzel made the case for a broader mandate for his organization . “ the mandate is currently limited to organized crime , which means that in each individual case we have to demonstrate a link or connection to local structures before we pass on the data , ” ratzel explained to a parliamentary committee .
“ in the fields of serial murder , online child pornography or travelling hooligans , local structures are generally not affected , but that is precisely the added value for -lrb- eu -rrb- member states . ” the eu commission has already proposed a reform bill to expand europol ’ s mandate , and the german presidency of the european union has also endorsed the proposal .
ratzel said terrorism is a situation that affects europe as a whole , and that it was important to share information among the member states in order to “ recognize the signs early on and act pre-emptively on dangers . ” but this also earned the europol chief some criticism from parliamentarians concerned about privacy rights .
agustín díaz de mera of the conservative evp told ratzel his agency needed to adopt more “ democratic transparency . ” separatists responsible for bulk of eu terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eta bomb at madrid 's barajas international airport ratzel expressed concern about what the europol report says is a growing threat of terrorism in europe .
nearly 500 terrorism-related offences were carried out in the 27-nation bloc last year , the report says ; however , most of them were carried out by separatists on the french island of corsica and in the spanish basque region . with 343 arrests last year , france saw the largest amount of terrorist activity .
most attacks took place on the mediterranean island of corsica , where separatists opposed to french rule have waged a low-intensity war of independence for over three decades . most of these attacks only caused property damage , with the notable exception of basque separatist group eta ’ s december 30th bombing of a parking garage at madrid barajas international airport , which killed two people and wounded several dozen more .
it was one of 145 attacks in spain last year , and the group ’ s first fatal attack since 2003 . europol says eta has “ rebuilt its capabilities ” despite a march 2006 truce with the spanish government , and is prepared to “ strike with well-prepared , organized and coordinated attacks against high-profile targets . ”

what 's missing , wrote dw ’ s peter philipp , is mutual trust . " what else is new ? " one could have asked when iran 's president mahmud ahmedinejad announced last weekend that his country is capable of industrially enriching uranium and now belongs to the nuclear club . but no one said that . instead , some saw the announcement as a new " provocation " of the west and began to speculate about when iran 's first nuclear bomb would be finished .
they also started to get used to the americans ' missile shield plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others , on the other hand , scoffed at the announcement .
they said iran really was n't that far along and ahmedinejad 's speech only proved that he is a good actor . as varied and contradictory as the reactions may be , they demonstrate yet again that the world does n't know how to deal with iran .
even competent experts all too often fall back on generalizations when it comes to the " iran issue . "
they speak of the " persian nuclear bomb " and try to measure just how close tehran is to reaching this goal . instead , a bit more sobriety and reserve are called for .
thus far , the " goal " of an iranian nuclear bomb has only existed in the minds of those who had always been suspicious of the regime in tehran and the revitalization of islam and politics that it embodied . how else can it be explained that , although iran has continually claimed that its atomic research is for peaceful purposes only and has belonged to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty for a long time already , it is still accused of having bad intentions ?
at the same time , not the slightest effort has been made to help the countries in the region that have not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty - israel , india and pakistan - to find the " right path . " the imbalance of the situation becomes even more apparent when we consider that legitimate circles of experts are not even blaming iran for enriching uranium , which is permitted under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
instead , iran is accused of not following the resolutions of the un security council , which is demanding precisely that which can not be demanded from iran - the suspension of its uranium enrichment program . nevertheless , it is indeed a good thing that there are those who are now appealing for negotiations with tehran .
without reciprocation , such negotiations are useless and it is unacceptable that governments are negotiating with tehran while at the same time enforcing sanctions . only when the west opens up to iran and drops its unjustified prerequisites can the tension ease .
of course , iran may still be charged with building nuclear weapons , but it has to be granted the rights that are matter of course for other countries . there 's no guarantee that iran wo n't build a nuclear bomb .

" one could have asked when iran 's president mahmud ahmedinejad announced last weekend that his country is capable of industrially enriching uranium and now belongs to the nuclear club . but no one said that . instead , some saw the announcement as a new " provocation " of the west and began to speculate about when iran 's first nuclear bomb would be finished .
they also started to get used to the americans ' missile shield plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others , on the other hand , scoffed at the announcement .
they said iran really was n't that far along and ahmedinejad 's speech only proved that he is a good actor . as varied and contradictory as the reactions may be , they demonstrate yet again that the world does n't know how to deal with iran .
even competent experts all too often fall back on generalizations when it comes to the " iran issue . "
they speak of the " persian nuclear bomb " and try to measure just how close tehran is to reaching this goal . instead , a bit more sobriety and reserve are called for .
thus far , the " goal " of an iranian nuclear bomb has only existed in the minds of those who had always been suspicious of the regime in tehran and the revitalization of islam and politics that it embodied . how else can it be explained that , although iran has continually claimed that its atomic research is for peaceful purposes only and has belonged to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty for a long time already , it is still accused of having bad intentions ?
at the same time , not the slightest effort has been made to help the countries in the region that have not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty - israel , india and pakistan - to find the " right path . " the imbalance of the situation becomes even more apparent when we consider that legitimate circles of experts are not even blaming iran for enriching uranium , which is permitted under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
instead , iran is accused of not following the resolutions of the un security council , which is demanding precisely that which can not be demanded from iran - the suspension of its uranium enrichment program . nevertheless , it is indeed a good thing that there are those who are now appealing for negotiations with tehran .
without reciprocation , such negotiations are useless and it is unacceptable that governments are negotiating with tehran while at the same time enforcing sanctions . only when the west opens up to iran and drops its unjustified prerequisites can the tension ease .
of course , iran may still be charged with building nuclear weapons , but it has to be granted the rights that are matter of course for other countries . there 's no guarantee that iran wo n't build a nuclear bomb .

starting wednesday , she is being tried for her involvement in two botched terrorist attacks . a suspected member of a german left-wing extremist group admitted in court wednesday to two failed bomb attacks in the 1980s as her trial began in berlin . the 58-year-old defendant , adrienne gerhäuser , presented a statement saying that she had " knowingly and willingly " attempted to bomb the berlin genetic technical institute in 1986 and a clothing factory in bavaria in 1987 on behalf of the far-left organization rote zora . she said the attacks were motivated by her political beliefs at the time , including a fierce opposition to genetic engineering and solidarity with striking female factory workers in south korea . gerhäuser said she had provided alarm clocks for two detonators .
but in both cases the devices failed to go off and no one was injured . she stands accused of belonging to a terrorist organization and attempting bombing . the berlin court said that because gerhäuser had turned herself in to the authorities late last year , the maximum penalty she would face would be two-year suspended sentence . rote zora was a women 's splinter group that claimed responsibility for 45 bombings and cases of arson between april 1977 and february 1988 with the aim of bringing about radical change in german society . the group was part of the so-called revolutionary cells network until 1986 . debate about a wave of attacks unleashed by the far-left in germany in the 1970s and 1980s resurfaced in recent months as two former guerrillas from the red army faction sought release from prison . brigitte mohnhaupt , who was convicted for her role in nine murders in the left-wing group 's campaign against the west german state in the 1970s , left jail last month after 24 years in detention . a german court granted the 57-year-old 's release because she served her minimum sentence and was no longer considered a threat .
but a court in february refused prison day releases for christian klar , 54 , who led the raf along with mohnhaupt . the families of the victims of the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , have bitterly opposed any clemency , partly because mohnhaupt and klar never expressed remorse for the murders . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's radical left confronts global issues and enemy within europe 's radical left-wing groups are at the forefront of demonstrations against international injustice .

this price difference is completely legal , but it does beg the question of why the cheap taxis have n't managed to find their way out to the airport ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why are the taxis in town cheaper than at the airport ?
the reason ca n't be because the taxi drivers get lost - sofia 's roads and freeways are now signposted to european standards . the mafia ? in the past few years , there have been spectacular headlines about former communist functionaries and secret service officers who managed to privatize - in their own creative ways - the state 's treasuries and meet the challenges of the market economy with gold-stuffed suitcases in their hands . according to dimitar ludzhev , who was deputy-prime minister in bulgaria 's first non-communist government , the secret service played a key roll in this .
those working in bulgaria 's 300 foreign-based firms gathered intelligence and carried out economic espionage , while the domestic secret service was in charge of the smuggling routes and the illegal transfers of luxury goods . many observers say this was the birth of organized crime in bulgaria .
after the fall of communism in 1989 , those who had worked for the secret police used their knowledge to stay in business - but this time in the private " shadow " economy . no kickbacks ? bulgaria 's border with non-eu member serbia lies just 60 km -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- away from its capital city sofia .
but there 's not much traffic heading out of bulgaria towards its western neighbor these days along the route which used to be heavily used as part of the highway system running from turkey over sofia to belgrade and budapest and then to western europe . some trucks and busses are waiting at the kalotina border crossing , with turkish , bulgarian and german plates .

" well , in serbia , five euros are expected unless you want to wait two or three hours , " he said .
" and it 's the same in hungary , that is if you do n't want to have your whole luggage searched . " not the same everywhere europe 's new eastern border is long and winds from kalotina south to the strumica river , where it meets the greek and macedonian borders .
here , just near the border lies blagoevgrad - earlier a well-known smuggling town and today infamous as the gangster capital of bulgaria . peter ivanov , 26 , from blagoevgrad 's radio station , joked that nowhere else in europe are there so many limousines as here .
his reason for blagoevgrad 's popularity with crime syndicates - its proximity to three borders . but dimitar ivanov -lrb- not related to peter ivanov -rrb- , a businessman , who used to work for bulgaria 's secret service , is adamant that former members of the service have nothing to do with the bulgarian mafia .

but it seems the 18m long strip of wall was n't nicked by souvenir hunters , it was hoisted off by the berlin government . erich stanke , who said he bought the chunk of wall back in 1990 from a border guard , is more than peeved .
he described the government 's action as a " cloak and dagger " affair . " people were shot here , and now this piece of human world heritage has simply been ripped up , " he said .
" it 's a disgrace . " stanke has lodged a complaint with the police because the contractors who removed the wall from potsdamer platz bored two holes in order to yank it out . " the wall is a protected monument and now it 's damaged , " stanke said . popular with tourists camera touting tourists regularly visited the piece of wall , which was brightly painted with graffiti and murals , such as a trabant , a typical east german car , bursting through the wall .
another mural carries the slogan " do n't destroy history " - a reference to attempts to preserve the berlin wall . the federal office for building and regional planning , who ordered the chunk 's removal , does n't know what all the fuss is about . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potsdamer platz is now famous for its modern architecture " it 's been common knowledge for quite some time " that piece would have to make way for a new environment office building , spokesperson andreas kübler told the berliner zeitung . according to kübler , contrary to stanke 's claims , the city owned the piece of wall .
once the project is completed at the end of 2008 , the strip of wall will be on display inside the building and tourists will still be able to see it through a window . wider debate but the exchange of words over this one piece of wall is part of a much bigger debate .
for some berliners , the wall is a despised symbol of a totalitarian regime and should be completely destroyed .
for others , it 's a cultural artifact that should be kept for future generations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans called the wall souvenir hunters " mauerspecht " or " wallpeckers " only a few pieces of the berlin wall survived opening up of eastern germany on november 19 , 1989 and the resulting souvenir-hunting frenzy .
five months after the event , there were only six sections in the inner-city left standing . several of these remnants were in potsdamer platz , which lies in the center of berlin .
in the 1990s , the square underwent a massive rebuilding campaign - and in 1999 of chunks of wall were removed to make way for glittering modern skyscrapers . now , a rather inconspicuous line of cobblestone set in the pavement is otherwise the only mark of the former barrier between east and west germany . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans celebrate unity day with mixed emotions as germans celebrate the 16th anniversary of reunification tuesday , there 's no masking a sense of disillusionment at the failure to tackle the country 's economic and demographic woes resulting from the tumultuous event .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 11.04.2007 eu member bulgaria still bears signs of its communist past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria became a member of the european union on jan .
1 , 2007 bulgaria now marks the european union 's new eastern border .
although the country still bears the signs of its communist past , there is also evidence of a move toward european standards . at sofia 's new international airport terminal , new signs welcome visitors to " the eu country , bulgaria , " and the passport control boasts new counters - one for eu and the other for non-eu citizens . outside the terminal , shiny new taxis wait to ferry customers into the city .
next to the meter , a sticker tells people their ride will cost them some two leva per kilometer - about one euro -lrb- $ 1.33 -rrb- . many of the taxis in sofia 's capital are also new , but a ride in one of them costs about 75 percent less than the taxis at the international terminal .
this price difference is completely legal , but it does beg the question of why the cheap taxis have n't managed to find their way out to the airport ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why are the taxis in town cheaper than at the airport ?
the reason ca n't be because the taxi drivers get lost - sofia 's roads and freeways are now signposted to european standards . the mafia ? in the past few years , there have been spectacular headlines about former communist functionaries and secret service officers who managed to privatize - in their own creative ways - the state 's treasuries and meet the challenges of the market economy with gold-stuffed suitcases in their hands . according to dimitar ludzhev , who was deputy-prime minister in bulgaria 's first non-communist government , the secret service played a key roll in this .
those working in bulgaria 's 300 foreign-based firms gathered intelligence and carried out economic espionage , while the domestic secret service was in charge of the smuggling routes and the illegal transfers of luxury goods . many observers say this was the birth of organized crime in bulgaria .
after the fall of communism in 1989 , those who had worked for the secret police used their knowledge to stay in business - but this time in the private " shadow " economy . no kickbacks ? bulgaria 's border with non-eu member serbia lies just 60 km -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- away from its capital city sofia .
but there 's not much traffic heading out of bulgaria towards its western neighbor these days along the route which used to be heavily used as part of the highway system running from turkey over sofia to belgrade and budapest and then to western europe . some trucks and busses are waiting at the kalotina border crossing , with turkish , bulgarian and german plates .
everything seems to be working smoothly and efficiently - the police and customers officers are friendly and do n't mind us observing their work . bildunterschrift : former secret service members are allegedly still involved in border smuggling there are also new signs on the border : " no payments here , only passport control . "
this has a clear meaning - bribery has no place here .
well not any more , as the officers at the border explain with a degree of pride . but even if kickbacks are no longer expected at kalotin , it 's a different story in other parts of eastern europe according to one of the bus drivers . " well , in serbia , five euros are expected unless you want to wait two or three hours , " he said .
" and it 's the same in hungary , that is if you do n't want to have your whole luggage searched . " not the same everywhere europe 's new eastern border is long and winds from kalotina south to the strumica river , where it meets the greek and macedonian borders .
here , just near the border lies blagoevgrad - earlier a well-known smuggling town and today infamous as the gangster capital of bulgaria . peter ivanov , 26 , from blagoevgrad 's radio station , joked that nowhere else in europe are there so many limousines as here .
his reason for blagoevgrad 's popularity with crime syndicates - its proximity to three borders . but dimitar ivanov -lrb- not related to peter ivanov -rrb- , a businessman , who used to work for bulgaria 's secret service , is adamant that former members of the service have nothing to do with the bulgarian mafia . " it 's a propaganda theory , " dimitar ivanov said .
" it 's propaganda from the right . " his former colleague in the secrete service zvetko zvetkov , however , would beg to differ . " you could very well establish a link -lrb- between the mafia -rrb- and the former secret service and the former regime , " zvetkov said . zvetkov , who in communist times was in charge of spying on the intellectuals , has been trying for years to shed light on the links between the bulgarian secret service and the criminal underworld . hartmut lüning and alexander andreev -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bulgaria : building a controversial eu transit route european union funds are financing a conflict-ridden highway on the outskirts of sofia .
but bulgarian environmental groups claim the new road will do little to alleviate the capital 's traffic nightmare .
-lrb- 21.03.2007 -rrb- european papers give cool reception to new eu members european commentators on tuesday had mixed reactions about bulgaria and romania 's entry into the european union .
-lrb- 02.01.2007 -rrb- will eu entry shrink bulgaria 's population even more ?
bulgarian towns are shrinking , and the birth rate is falling rapidly .
now bulgarians are worried that even more of their young people will leave after the country joins the eu on jan 1 .

some employees would like to see their working conditions improved . the world 's biggest food retailer , mcdonald 's has decided germany is ripe for the mccafe - a coffee shop integrated into mcdonald 's restaurants offering drinks from cappuccinos to lattes , as well as panini , cookies and cakes . around 240 of germany 's 1,276 mcdonalds have been renovated to incorporate the snazzier-looking mccafe , and at least another 100 are expected to follow this year . the dark brown leather chairs , sleek wood deco and shiny glass displays are a giant step away from the shrill yellow and red plastic traditionally associated with mcdonalds restaurants - and they are proving popular with customers . the turnover in the redesigned stores has increased by 10 percent to 15 percent . " we assumed that the mccafe would attract younger people , but surprisingly the over-50s , who otherwise never enter a mcdonalds , are coming , " said mcdonald 's germany chief , bane knezevic , in an interview with the german daily tagespiegel . gourmet coffee on the rise trendy coffee chains such as starbucks and balzac have been mushrooming in germany 's big cities - and mcdonald 's just was n't proving attractive to those who wanted to chill out and choose from a wide variety of coffees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's is giving many of its german restaurants a make-over " for a long time , we were n't modern enough for our customers , " knezevic said .
though it has also taken a while for the mccafe to come to germany - they were first introduced in australia in 1993 . knezevic also said mcdonald 's would introduce coffee beans certified by the rain forest alliance . although mcdonald 's might be moving in a socially responsible direction with its coffee , the chain reportedly still has room for improvement when it comes to its employees . accusations against mcdonald 's in a report on germany 's public zdf television broadcast on april 3 , former mcdonald 's employees listed a series of complaints against the food chain , including arbitrary firings and the bullying of works council representatives . former employees interviewed by zdf tell of attempts to buy off works council representatives .
they also accused mcdonald 's of having a policy of employing young people with immigrant backgrounds and firing anyone who complains . after asking for a pay rise , and saying she wanted to establish a works council , former mcdonald 's employee nicole wieseler was fired after seven years working for the company . " i was fired without notice just before the end of my holiday , and they also gave me a written order banning me from all mcdonald 's restaurants , " wieseler told zdf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's is under fire in china this week for allegedly paying below the minimum wage " they did n't give me a reason , and i just did n't understand it , " she added .
" i found the ban pretty harsh - it was hung up in all restaurants .
i felt like a murderer . " wieseler took case to court and won .
mcdonald 's maintains wieseler 's dismissal had nothing to do with her union activity . mcdonald 's in germany has more than 52,000 employers , but there are only 17 works councils - these are employee committees that give voice to workers ' concerns . " we do n't have anything against unions , " stefan fehr , the head of mcdonald 's ' personal department in germany , told zdf .

" these are very difficult times for the palestinian people , " he told reporters at a joint press conference with eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
the finance minister added that if the international community did not come to the aid of the palestinians , the outcome would be " devastating " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fayyad warns that lack of aid is devastating for the palestinians palestinian and european diplomats said the meeting itself was a sign that the eu was willing to give the new finance ministry a chance . the eu was the biggest aid donor to the palestinian government until the hamas militants came to power in march 2006 .
the quartet of middle east mediators - the european union , united states , united nations and russia - then suspended direct aid to the palestinian authority . eu bypasses unity government since then , the eu has redirected its funding , which reached 700 million euros in 2006 , through a special mechanism to help the neediest people while bypassing the government to avoid contact with hamas - which is considers a terrorist organization . at the brussels press conference , ferrero-waldner said this temporary mechanism would continue but offered fayyad technical assistance to get his finance ministry in order . she also repeated the international demands that the palestinian government renounce violence , formally recognize israel 's right to exist and abide by former agreements .
ferrero-waldner said until that happened the eu would only deal with what it considered to be western-friendly members of the new palestinian fatah-hamas unity government , which took power in march this year . bildunterschrift : lawmakers voted last month for a new unity government ferrero-waldner said she could " imagine informal exploratory talks " with foreign minister ziad abu amr , who , like fayyad , is an independent . fayyad , who as finance minister under the previous fatah government won praise for his reform of palestinian finances , said the unity government was committed to a platform to abide by " all the agreements entered into " . fayyad also met with the eu 's middle east peace envoy , marc otte , and european parliament leaders .
he is set to travel on to norway , which brokered an israeli-palestinian peace deal in 1993 , and then onto washington . dw staff / afp -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de seize the moment for peace , merkel urges middle east current eu president german chancellor angela merkel on sunday urged middle east states to seize the moment and revive the stalled peace process as she met israeli and palestinian leaders .

some employees would like to see their working conditions improved . the world 's biggest food retailer , mcdonald 's has decided germany is ripe for the mccafe - a coffee shop integrated into mcdonald 's restaurants offering drinks from cappuccinos to lattes , as well as panini , cookies and cakes . around 240 of germany 's 1,276 mcdonalds have been renovated to incorporate the snazzier-looking mccafe , and at least another 100 are expected to follow this year . the dark brown leather chairs , sleek wood deco and shiny glass displays are a giant step away from the shrill yellow and red plastic traditionally associated with mcdonalds restaurants - and they are proving popular with customers . the turnover in the redesigned stores has increased by 10 percent to 15 percent .

they also accused mcdonald 's of having a policy of employing young people with immigrant backgrounds and firing anyone who complains . after asking for a pay rise , and saying she wanted to establish a works council , former mcdonald 's employee nicole wieseler was fired after seven years working for the company .

the first leg in italy ended in a draw .
so who 's more likely to progress ? no one is more qualified to answer a question about bayern munich versus ac milan than giovanni trapattoni , who has coached both clubs during his storied career .
he told dw-world.de to expect a close match on wednesday . " it 's still wide open , " trapattoni said .
" of course , bayern are the slight favorites , but 2-all is a difficult first-leg result .
they ca n't just go full bore offensively at home , because milan - with players like kaká , gilardino or inzaghi - are very dangerous on the counter-attack .
a waiting game would also be risky .
but if bayern play the same way they did in milan they 'll get through . " munich clawed out a draw in san siro last week , thanks to a pair of goals by defender daniel van buyten , so in fact they 'll be looking to hold milan to fewer than two goals . bayern 's main worries are midfielder bastian schweinsteiger , who 's touch-and-go with a banged-up knee , and milan 's filippo inzaghi .
no one has scored more often against bayern in the champions league than the crafty striker .
still , bayern have no reason to be quaking in their boots . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milan up-ended bayern last year in the champions league " this year , " trapattoni said , " milan are n't showing anything like their past form , and not all their players at their best .
they went all out to win their home leg .
they tried to score goals , and in the end , it did n't turn out well . " wednesday 's other semi-final should be a far more relaxed affair , with liverpool taking a 3-nil advantage over psv eindhoven into anfield .
the dutch guests , who are focusing on their domestic league , have already indicated they 'll rest some key players for the match . man u steamroll rome , chelsea pip valencia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cristiano ronaldo booted a pair of goals past rome in the rout whoever prevails in munich may wish they had n't , as their semi-final opponents will be manchester united .
the red devils progressed on tuesday after flattening as rome 7-1 in old trafford . man u clearly wanted to send a message after an away leg marred by violence against their supporters and some controversial refereeing decisions .
michael carrick scored the opener in the 11th minute , and in the barrage that followed , rome could hardly have been more shocked , had george best returned from the dead , pint glass in hand , to knock one past luckless keeper doni . meanwhile , manchester 's premiership rivals were doing what they do best against valencia - getting a narrow , and somewhat fortunate result . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chelsea just managed to push their way past well-organized valencia the blues traveled to spain needing to make up for a disappointing 1-all draw in the first leg , and things did n't look good when the hosts took a 1-nil lead into the break . but much-criticized striker andriy shevchenko knotted things up in the 52nd minute .
and michael essian sent chelsea through just before time after a crucial blunder by valencia keeper santiago canizares . chelsea will now most likely have a date with liverpool later this month . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chelsea draw ; man u lose in rome english sides chelsea and manchester did not impress on wednesday evening .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.04.2007 europol seeks broader mandate amid growing terror threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europol says it requires extended powers to meet the challenges of the new threat eu police arrested over 700 terror suspects last year , according to a report released tuesday .
half of the arrests involved islamist extremism - the most dangerous variety of terrorism , the report says . the cross-border police agency europol released the report as eu politicians debated proposals to expand the powers of european law enforcement .
presenting the report to the european parliament in brussels on tuesday , europol chief max-peter ratzel made the case for a broader mandate for his organization . “ the mandate is currently limited to organized crime , which means that in each individual case we have to demonstrate a link or connection to local structures before we pass on the data , ” ratzel explained to a parliamentary committee .
“ in the fields of serial murder , online child pornography or travelling hooligans , local structures are generally not affected , but that is precisely the added value for -lrb- eu -rrb- member states . ” the eu commission has already proposed a reform bill to expand europol ’ s mandate , and the german presidency of the european union has also endorsed the proposal .
ratzel said terrorism is a situation that affects europe as a whole , and that it was important to share information among the member states in order to “ recognize the signs early on and act pre-emptively on dangers . ” but this also earned the europol chief some criticism from parliamentarians concerned about privacy rights .
agustín díaz de mera of the conservative evp told ratzel his agency needed to adopt more “ democratic transparency . ” separatists responsible for bulk of eu terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eta bomb at madrid 's barajas international airport ratzel expressed concern about what the europol report says is a growing threat of terrorism in europe .
nearly 500 terrorism-related offences were carried out in the 27-nation bloc last year , the report says ; however , most of them were carried out by separatists on the french island of corsica and in the spanish basque region . with 343 arrests last year , france saw the largest amount of terrorist activity .
most attacks took place on the mediterranean island of corsica , where separatists opposed to french rule have waged a low-intensity war of independence for over three decades . most of these attacks only caused property damage , with the notable exception of basque separatist group eta ’ s december 30th bombing of a parking garage at madrid barajas international airport , which killed two people and wounded several dozen more .
it was one of 145 attacks in spain last year , and the group ’ s first fatal attack since 2003 . europol says eta has “ rebuilt its capabilities ” despite a march 2006 truce with the spanish government , and is prepared to “ strike with well-prepared , organized and coordinated attacks against high-profile targets . ”
eta on sunday stood by the 2006 ceasefire , but said it would resume its armed struggle for basque independence if spain did not allow eta ’ s banned political wing to participate in local elections in may . 156 people were arrested on terrorism charges in britain .
europol did not list any terror-related offences for the 10 newest member states , most of them eastern european , that joined the eu in 2004 . islamist extremism called greatest danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic terrorism is the most dangerous , the report says the report says that acts of terrorism motivated by radical islamic ideologies pose the greatest threat to european security , in part because they aim to maximize human casualties .
as examples of islamic extremism in europe , the report cites the failed plot to bomb two regional trains in western germany . that plot was foiled by fate rather than by the police , as the crude suitcase bombs did not go off due to a technical malfunction .
ratzel also mentions last year ’ s attempted attack on transatlantic flights from british airports , which was foiled by the authorities at the last minute . the report says half of the total number of arrests was related to islamist militants .
as examples of terrorist crimes , the police agency lists disseminating terrorist propaganda , financing terrorism , forging documents or providing safe houses for illegal operatives , among others . “ we have to take care that these things don ’ t further escalate , ” ratzel told the parliamentary committee . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany determined to strengthen european police agency germany 's security policy during its eu presidency aims to give europol additional powers in order to better fight international terrorism and cross-border crime .

half of the arrests involved islamist extremism - the most dangerous variety of terrorism , the report says . the cross-border police agency europol released the report as eu politicians debated proposals to expand the powers of european law enforcement .
presenting the report to the european parliament in brussels on tuesday , europol chief max-peter ratzel made the case for a broader mandate for his organization . “ the mandate is currently limited to organized crime , which means that in each individual case we have to demonstrate a link or connection to local structures before we pass on the data , ” ratzel explained to a parliamentary committee .
“ in the fields of serial murder , online child pornography or travelling hooligans , local structures are generally not affected , but that is precisely the added value for -lrb- eu -rrb- member states . ” the eu commission has already proposed a reform bill to expand europol ’ s mandate , and the german presidency of the european union has also endorsed the proposal .
ratzel said terrorism is a situation that affects europe as a whole , and that it was important to share information among the member states in order to “ recognize the signs early on and act pre-emptively on dangers . ” but this also earned the europol chief some criticism from parliamentarians concerned about privacy rights .
agustín díaz de mera of the conservative evp told ratzel his agency needed to adopt more “ democratic transparency . ” separatists responsible for bulk of eu terrorism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an eta bomb at madrid 's barajas international airport ratzel expressed concern about what the europol report says is a growing threat of terrorism in europe .
nearly 500 terrorism-related offences were carried out in the 27-nation bloc last year , the report says ; however , most of them were carried out by separatists on the french island of corsica and in the spanish basque region . with 343 arrests last year , france saw the largest amount of terrorist activity .
most attacks took place on the mediterranean island of corsica , where separatists opposed to french rule have waged a low-intensity war of independence for over three decades . most of these attacks only caused property damage , with the notable exception of basque separatist group eta ’ s december 30th bombing of a parking garage at madrid barajas international airport , which killed two people and wounded several dozen more .
it was one of 145 attacks in spain last year , and the group ’ s first fatal attack since 2003 . europol says eta has “ rebuilt its capabilities ” despite a march 2006 truce with the spanish government , and is prepared to “ strike with well-prepared , organized and coordinated attacks against high-profile targets . ”
eta on sunday stood by the 2006 ceasefire , but said it would resume its armed struggle for basque independence if spain did not allow eta ’ s banned political wing to participate in local elections in may . 156 people were arrested on terrorism charges in britain .
europol did not list any terror-related offences for the 10 newest member states , most of them eastern european , that joined the eu in 2004 . islamist extremism called greatest danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic terrorism is the most dangerous , the report says the report says that acts of terrorism motivated by radical islamic ideologies pose the greatest threat to european security , in part because they aim to maximize human casualties .
as examples of islamic extremism in europe , the report cites the failed plot to bomb two regional trains in western germany . that plot was foiled by fate rather than by the police , as the crude suitcase bombs did not go off due to a technical malfunction .
ratzel also mentions last year ’ s attempted attack on transatlantic flights from british airports , which was foiled by the authorities at the last minute . the report says half of the total number of arrests was related to islamist militants .
as examples of terrorist crimes , the police agency lists disseminating terrorist propaganda , financing terrorism , forging documents or providing safe houses for illegal operatives , among others . “ we have to take care that these things don ’ t further escalate , ” ratzel told the parliamentary committee . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany determined to strengthen european police agency germany 's security policy during its eu presidency aims to give europol additional powers in order to better fight international terrorism and cross-border crime .

1 , 2007 bulgaria now marks the european union 's new eastern border .
although the country still bears the signs of its communist past , there is also evidence of a move toward european standards . at sofia 's new international airport terminal , new signs welcome visitors to " the eu country , bulgaria , " and the passport control boasts new counters - one for eu and the other for non-eu citizens . outside the terminal , shiny new taxis wait to ferry customers into the city .
next to the meter , a sticker tells people their ride will cost them some two leva per kilometer - about one euro -lrb- $ 1.33 -rrb- . many of the taxis in sofia 's capital are also new , but a ride in one of them costs about 75 percent less than the taxis at the international terminal .
this price difference is completely legal , but it does beg the question of why the cheap taxis have n't managed to find their way out to the airport ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why are the taxis in town cheaper than at the airport ?
the reason ca n't be because the taxi drivers get lost - sofia 's roads and freeways are now signposted to european standards . the mafia ? in the past few years , there have been spectacular headlines about former communist functionaries and secret service officers who managed to privatize - in their own creative ways - the state 's treasuries and meet the challenges of the market economy with gold-stuffed suitcases in their hands . according to dimitar ludzhev , who was deputy-prime minister in bulgaria 's first non-communist government , the secret service played a key roll in this .
those working in bulgaria 's 300 foreign-based firms gathered intelligence and carried out economic espionage , while the domestic secret service was in charge of the smuggling routes and the illegal transfers of luxury goods . many observers say this was the birth of organized crime in bulgaria .
after the fall of communism in 1989 , those who had worked for the secret police used their knowledge to stay in business - but this time in the private " shadow " economy . no kickbacks ? bulgaria 's border with non-eu member serbia lies just 60 km -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- away from its capital city sofia .
but there 's not much traffic heading out of bulgaria towards its western neighbor these days along the route which used to be heavily used as part of the highway system running from turkey over sofia to belgrade and budapest and then to western europe . some trucks and busses are waiting at the kalotina border crossing , with turkish , bulgarian and german plates .
everything seems to be working smoothly and efficiently - the police and customers officers are friendly and do n't mind us observing their work . bildunterschrift : former secret service members are allegedly still involved in border smuggling there are also new signs on the border : " no payments here , only passport control . "
this has a clear meaning - bribery has no place here .
well not any more , as the officers at the border explain with a degree of pride . but even if kickbacks are no longer expected at kalotin , it 's a different story in other parts of eastern europe according to one of the bus drivers . " well , in serbia , five euros are expected unless you want to wait two or three hours , " he said .
" and it 's the same in hungary , that is if you do n't want to have your whole luggage searched . " not the same everywhere europe 's new eastern border is long and winds from kalotina south to the strumica river , where it meets the greek and macedonian borders .
here , just near the border lies blagoevgrad - earlier a well-known smuggling town and today infamous as the gangster capital of bulgaria . peter ivanov , 26 , from blagoevgrad 's radio station , joked that nowhere else in europe are there so many limousines as here .
his reason for blagoevgrad 's popularity with crime syndicates - its proximity to three borders . but dimitar ivanov -lrb- not related to peter ivanov -rrb- , a businessman , who used to work for bulgaria 's secret service , is adamant that former members of the service have nothing to do with the bulgarian mafia . " it 's a propaganda theory , " dimitar ivanov said .
" it 's propaganda from the right . " his former colleague in the secrete service zvetko zvetkov , however , would beg to differ . " you could very well establish a link -lrb- between the mafia -rrb- and the former secret service and the former regime , " zvetkov said . zvetkov , who in communist times was in charge of spying on the intellectuals , has been trying for years to shed light on the links between the bulgarian secret service and the criminal underworld . hartmut lüning and alexander andreev -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bulgaria : building a controversial eu transit route european union funds are financing a conflict-ridden highway on the outskirts of sofia .
but bulgarian environmental groups claim the new road will do little to alleviate the capital 's traffic nightmare .
-lrb- 21.03.2007 -rrb- european papers give cool reception to new eu members european commentators on tuesday had mixed reactions about bulgaria and romania 's entry into the european union .
-lrb- 02.01.2007 -rrb- will eu entry shrink bulgaria 's population even more ?
bulgarian towns are shrinking , and the birth rate is falling rapidly .
now bulgarians are worried that even more of their young people will leave after the country joins the eu on jan 1 .

those working in bulgaria 's 300 foreign-based firms gathered intelligence and carried out economic espionage , while the domestic secret service was in charge of the smuggling routes and the illegal transfers of luxury goods . many observers say this was the birth of organized crime in bulgaria .

although the country still bears the signs of its communist past , there is also evidence of a move toward european standards . at sofia 's new international airport terminal , new signs welcome visitors to " the eu country , bulgaria , " and the passport control boasts new counters - one for eu and the other for non-eu citizens . outside the terminal , shiny new taxis wait to ferry customers into the city .
next to the meter , a sticker tells people their ride will cost them some two leva per kilometer - about one euro -lrb- $ 1.33 -rrb- . many of the taxis in sofia 's capital are also new , but a ride in one of them costs about 75 percent less than the taxis at the international terminal .

what 's missing , wrote dw ’ s peter philipp , is mutual trust . " what else is new ? " one could have asked when iran 's president mahmud ahmedinejad announced last weekend that his country is capable of industrially enriching uranium and now belongs to the nuclear club . but no one said that . instead , some saw the announcement as a new " provocation " of the west and began to speculate about when iran 's first nuclear bomb would be finished .
they also started to get used to the americans ' missile shield plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others , on the other hand , scoffed at the announcement .
they said iran really was n't that far along and ahmedinejad 's speech only proved that he is a good actor . as varied and contradictory as the reactions may be , they demonstrate yet again that the world does n't know how to deal with iran .
even competent experts all too often fall back on generalizations when it comes to the " iran issue . "
they speak of the " persian nuclear bomb " and try to measure just how close tehran is to reaching this goal . instead , a bit more sobriety and reserve are called for .
thus far , the " goal " of an iranian nuclear bomb has only existed in the minds of those who had always been suspicious of the regime in tehran and the revitalization of islam and politics that it embodied . how else can it be explained that , although iran has continually claimed that its atomic research is for peaceful purposes only and has belonged to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty for a long time already , it is still accused of having bad intentions ?
at the same time , not the slightest effort has been made to help the countries in the region that have not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty - israel , india and pakistan - to find the " right path . " the imbalance of the situation becomes even more apparent when we consider that legitimate circles of experts are not even blaming iran for enriching uranium , which is permitted under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
instead , iran is accused of not following the resolutions of the un security council , which is demanding precisely that which can not be demanded from iran - the suspension of its uranium enrichment program . nevertheless , it is indeed a good thing that there are those who are now appealing for negotiations with tehran .
without reciprocation , such negotiations are useless and it is unacceptable that governments are negotiating with tehran while at the same time enforcing sanctions . only when the west opens up to iran and drops its unjustified prerequisites can the tension ease .
of course , iran may still be charged with building nuclear weapons , but it has to be granted the rights that are matter of course for other countries . there 's no guarantee that iran wo n't build a nuclear bomb .

what 's missing , wrote dw ’ s peter philipp , is mutual trust . " what else is new ? " one could have asked when iran 's president mahmud ahmedinejad announced last weekend that his country is capable of industrially enriching uranium and now belongs to the nuclear club . but no one said that . instead , some saw the announcement as a new " provocation " of the west and began to speculate about when iran 's first nuclear bomb would be finished .
they also started to get used to the americans ' missile shield plan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others , on the other hand , scoffed at the announcement .
they said iran really was n't that far along and ahmedinejad 's speech only proved that he is a good actor . as varied and contradictory as the reactions may be , they demonstrate yet again that the world does n't know how to deal with iran .
even competent experts all too often fall back on generalizations when it comes to the " iran issue . "
they speak of the " persian nuclear bomb " and try to measure just how close tehran is to reaching this goal . instead , a bit more sobriety and reserve are called for .
thus far , the " goal " of an iranian nuclear bomb has only existed in the minds of those who had always been suspicious of the regime in tehran and the revitalization of islam and politics that it embodied . how else can it be explained that , although iran has continually claimed that its atomic research is for peaceful purposes only and has belonged to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty for a long time already , it is still accused of having bad intentions ?
at the same time , not the slightest effort has been made to help the countries in the region that have not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty - israel , india and pakistan - to find the " right path . " the imbalance of the situation becomes even more apparent when we consider that legitimate circles of experts are not even blaming iran for enriching uranium , which is permitted under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
instead , iran is accused of not following the resolutions of the un security council , which is demanding precisely that which can not be demanded from iran - the suspension of its uranium enrichment program . nevertheless , it is indeed a good thing that there are those who are now appealing for negotiations with tehran .
without reciprocation , such negotiations are useless and it is unacceptable that governments are negotiating with tehran while at the same time enforcing sanctions . only when the west opens up to iran and drops its unjustified prerequisites can the tension ease .

starting wednesday , she is being tried for her involvement in two botched terrorist attacks . a suspected member of a german left-wing extremist group admitted in court wednesday to two failed bomb attacks in the 1980s as her trial began in berlin . the 58-year-old defendant , adrienne gerhäuser , presented a statement saying that she had " knowingly and willingly " attempted to bomb the berlin genetic technical institute in 1986 and a clothing factory in bavaria in 1987 on behalf of the far-left organization rote zora . she said the attacks were motivated by her political beliefs at the time , including a fierce opposition to genetic engineering and solidarity with striking female factory workers in south korea . gerhäuser said she had provided alarm clocks for two detonators .
but in both cases the devices failed to go off and no one was injured . she stands accused of belonging to a terrorist organization and attempting bombing . the berlin court said that because gerhäuser had turned herself in to the authorities late last year , the maximum penalty she would face would be two-year suspended sentence . rote zora was a women 's splinter group that claimed responsibility for 45 bombings and cases of arson between april 1977 and february 1988 with the aim of bringing about radical change in german society . the group was part of the so-called revolutionary cells network until 1986 . debate about a wave of attacks unleashed by the far-left in germany in the 1970s and 1980s resurfaced in recent months as two former guerrillas from the red army faction sought release from prison . brigitte mohnhaupt , who was convicted for her role in nine murders in the left-wing group 's campaign against the west german state in the 1970s , left jail last month after 24 years in detention . a german court granted the 57-year-old 's release because she served her minimum sentence and was no longer considered a threat .
but a court in february refused prison day releases for christian klar , 54 , who led the raf along with mohnhaupt . the families of the victims of the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , have bitterly opposed any clemency , partly because mohnhaupt and klar never expressed remorse for the murders . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's radical left confronts global issues and enemy within europe 's radical left-wing groups are at the forefront of demonstrations against international injustice .

1 , 2007 bulgaria now marks the european union 's new eastern border .
although the country still bears the signs of its communist past , there is also evidence of a move toward european standards . at sofia 's new international airport terminal , new signs welcome visitors to " the eu country , bulgaria , " and the passport control boasts new counters - one for eu and the other for non-eu citizens . outside the terminal , shiny new taxis wait to ferry customers into the city .
next to the meter , a sticker tells people their ride will cost them some two leva per kilometer - about one euro -lrb- $ 1.33 -rrb- . many of the taxis in sofia 's capital are also new , but a ride in one of them costs about 75 percent less than the taxis at the international terminal .
this price difference is completely legal , but it does beg the question of why the cheap taxis have n't managed to find their way out to the airport ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why are the taxis in town cheaper than at the airport ?
the reason ca n't be because the taxi drivers get lost - sofia 's roads and freeways are now signposted to european standards . the mafia ? in the past few years , there have been spectacular headlines about former communist functionaries and secret service officers who managed to privatize - in their own creative ways - the state 's treasuries and meet the challenges of the market economy with gold-stuffed suitcases in their hands . according to dimitar ludzhev , who was deputy-prime minister in bulgaria 's first non-communist government , the secret service played a key roll in this .
those working in bulgaria 's 300 foreign-based firms gathered intelligence and carried out economic espionage , while the domestic secret service was in charge of the smuggling routes and the illegal transfers of luxury goods . many observers say this was the birth of organized crime in bulgaria .
after the fall of communism in 1989 , those who had worked for the secret police used their knowledge to stay in business - but this time in the private " shadow " economy . no kickbacks ? bulgaria 's border with non-eu member serbia lies just 60 km -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- away from its capital city sofia .
but there 's not much traffic heading out of bulgaria towards its western neighbor these days along the route which used to be heavily used as part of the highway system running from turkey over sofia to belgrade and budapest and then to western europe . some trucks and busses are waiting at the kalotina border crossing , with turkish , bulgarian and german plates .
everything seems to be working smoothly and efficiently - the police and customers officers are friendly and do n't mind us observing their work . bildunterschrift : former secret service members are allegedly still involved in border smuggling there are also new signs on the border : " no payments here , only passport control . "
this has a clear meaning - bribery has no place here .
well not any more , as the officers at the border explain with a degree of pride . but even if kickbacks are no longer expected at kalotin , it 's a different story in other parts of eastern europe according to one of the bus drivers . " well , in serbia , five euros are expected unless you want to wait two or three hours , " he said .
" and it 's the same in hungary , that is if you do n't want to have your whole luggage searched . " not the same everywhere europe 's new eastern border is long and winds from kalotina south to the strumica river , where it meets the greek and macedonian borders .
here , just near the border lies blagoevgrad - earlier a well-known smuggling town and today infamous as the gangster capital of bulgaria . peter ivanov , 26 , from blagoevgrad 's radio station , joked that nowhere else in europe are there so many limousines as here .
his reason for blagoevgrad 's popularity with crime syndicates - its proximity to three borders . but dimitar ivanov -lrb- not related to peter ivanov -rrb- , a businessman , who used to work for bulgaria 's secret service , is adamant that former members of the service have nothing to do with the bulgarian mafia . " it 's a propaganda theory , " dimitar ivanov said .
" it 's propaganda from the right . " his former colleague in the secrete service zvetko zvetkov , however , would beg to differ . " you could very well establish a link -lrb- between the mafia -rrb- and the former secret service and the former regime , " zvetkov said . zvetkov , who in communist times was in charge of spying on the intellectuals , has been trying for years to shed light on the links between the bulgarian secret service and the criminal underworld . hartmut lüning and alexander andreev -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bulgaria : building a controversial eu transit route european union funds are financing a conflict-ridden highway on the outskirts of sofia .

after the fall of communism in 1989 , those who had worked for the secret police used their knowledge to stay in business - but this time in the private " shadow " economy . no kickbacks ? bulgaria 's border with non-eu member serbia lies just 60 km -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- away from its capital city sofia .
but there 's not much traffic heading out of bulgaria towards its western neighbor these days along the route which used to be heavily used as part of the highway system running from turkey over sofia to belgrade and budapest and then to western europe . some trucks and busses are waiting at the kalotina border crossing , with turkish , bulgarian and german plates .
everything seems to be working smoothly and efficiently - the police and customers officers are friendly and do n't mind us observing their work . bildunterschrift : former secret service members are allegedly still involved in border smuggling there are also new signs on the border : " no payments here , only passport control . "
this has a clear meaning - bribery has no place here .
well not any more , as the officers at the border explain with a degree of pride . but even if kickbacks are no longer expected at kalotin , it 's a different story in other parts of eastern europe according to one of the bus drivers . " well , in serbia , five euros are expected unless you want to wait two or three hours , " he said .
" and it 's the same in hungary , that is if you do n't want to have your whole luggage searched . " not the same everywhere europe 's new eastern border is long and winds from kalotina south to the strumica river , where it meets the greek and macedonian borders .
here , just near the border lies blagoevgrad - earlier a well-known smuggling town and today infamous as the gangster capital of bulgaria . peter ivanov , 26 , from blagoevgrad 's radio station , joked that nowhere else in europe are there so many limousines as here .
his reason for blagoevgrad 's popularity with crime syndicates - its proximity to three borders . but dimitar ivanov -lrb- not related to peter ivanov -rrb- , a businessman , who used to work for bulgaria 's secret service , is adamant that former members of the service have nothing to do with the bulgarian mafia . " it 's a propaganda theory , " dimitar ivanov said .
" it 's propaganda from the right . " his former colleague in the secrete service zvetko zvetkov , however , would beg to differ . " you could very well establish a link -lrb- between the mafia -rrb- and the former secret service and the former regime , " zvetkov said . zvetkov , who in communist times was in charge of spying on the intellectuals , has been trying for years to shed light on the links between the bulgarian secret service and the criminal underworld . hartmut lüning and alexander andreev -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bulgaria : building a controversial eu transit route european union funds are financing a conflict-ridden highway on the outskirts of sofia .
but bulgarian environmental groups claim the new road will do little to alleviate the capital 's traffic nightmare .
-lrb- 21.03.2007 -rrb- european papers give cool reception to new eu members european commentators on tuesday had mixed reactions about bulgaria and romania 's entry into the european union .
-lrb- 02.01.2007 -rrb- will eu entry shrink bulgaria 's population even more ?
bulgarian towns are shrinking , and the birth rate is falling rapidly .
now bulgarians are worried that even more of their young people will leave after the country joins the eu on jan 1 .

both officials are involved in a review of the issue to assess whether current regulations should be relaxed .
this would bring them into line with other eu countries .
pressure for a rethink came about because the uk 's dispensation for extra controls over and above those of the eu runs out next year .
the controls ... actually may be more than is necessary to achieve the level of protection that we want dr debby reynolds it is not that long ago that fears of rabies arriving in the uk meant that dogs travelling back from europe had to be kept in quarantine .
now the pet travel scheme allows owners to vaccinate their dogs and confirm it with a blood test six months before travel .
it is a more humane system - but still complex and rigid for many pet owners .
each year , many of them have to cancel holiday plans because they did not know the system well enough .
available evidence the government 's chief veterinary officer , dr debby reynolds , told bbc news that she believed the current system was more than was needed to keep the uk rabies-free .
pet travel scheme -lrb- pets -rrb- eu introduced its european pet movement regulation in 2004 the ' passport ' system allows pets to move between countries animals are tagged with a chip and vaccinated against rabies a blood test confirms the presence of antibodies tick and tapeworm treatments needed before entering uk documentation and chip will be checked at borders technical differences between countries can be confusing she said : " our scientific conclusions do suggest that the controls themselves are precautionary ; that they actually may be more than is necessary to achieve the level of protection that we want . "
it is a view that is backed up by the government 's chief scientific adviser , professor sir david king : " i 've reviewed all the available evidence and i agree that the current restrictions are too precautionary .
" there 's a case to consider bringing our rules more in line with other european union countries . "
within europe , animals can travel between countries 21 days after vaccination .
dr reynolds and professor king have been asked to advise ministers on the issue .
they say that there has been a dramatic decline of rabies in western europe .
they also say that it is possible to tell within three - rather than six - months whether a dog is carrying rabies .
most animal welfare groups agree the current system is too severe .
but chris lawrence of the dogs trust believes that it would be wrong to bring the waiting time down to 21 days after vaccination .
have your say there 's no reason why we should change the current situation to suit the rest of the eu tio , epsom send us your comments " rabies is prevalent in poland , eastern europe and many accession countries and by harmonising our regulations , -lsb- we -rsb- would increase the risk of rabies arriving in the uk , " he said .
" a three-month waiting period is supported by the science - and separate blood tests should continue to be required because one ca n't be completely sure of all vaccine stocks . "

people with the condition are known as insulin-dependent , and require regular shots of the hormone .
but 14 out of 15 young people newly diagnosed with the condition no longer needed injections - sometimes for years - following the stem cell treatment .
however , experts warned the journal of the american medical association study was preliminary and inconclusive . "
we would wish to avoid false hope based on the very preliminary nature of these results " dr iain frame diabetes uk q & a : stem cells type 1 diabetes is caused by the patient 's own immune system destroying insulin-producing cells in the pancreas .
the researchers , from the university of sao paulo , gave the patients powerful drugs to suppress their immune systems in an attempt to stop further destruction of pancreatic cells .
this was followed by transfusions of stem cells taken from their own blood , in effect designed to restart the immune system .
some patients reacted more quickly to the treatment than others , and the length of the effect also varied .
one patient was able to survive without insulin injections for 35 months , and four others for at least 21 months .
two patients who responded late did not have to inject themselves for one and five months .
mechanism unclear previous studies have suggested stem cell therapy might be a promising approach for type 1 diabetes .
stem cells are immature cells which can become different types of adult tissue .
it is thought that in this instance the stem cells may have generated new immune cells which do not target the pancreas , helping to safeguard what remaining insulin-producing cells the patient has left .
however , it is also possible that the treatment may have led to the growth of new insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas .
a third possibility is that the treatment stimulated an as yet unknown mechanism which stopped existing beta cells being destroyed .
the results do throw up the possibility that stem cell therapy could have a dramatic impact .
' preliminary study ' but the study was small , did not monitor the patients for very long and did not compare them with similar patients who were given alternative therapy or remained untreated .
dr iain frame , of the charity diabetes uk , warned against raising people 's hopes on the basis of a " very preliminary " study .
" it is well known that there is often a honeymoon period of relative remission after the onset of type 1 diabetes that complicates the interpretation of results such as the ones shown in this study .
" all these issues need to be addressed through more research before there are any conclusive findings in this area . "
dr richard burt , of northwestern university , chicago , who worked on the study , said : " i do not use the word cure , or the word breakthrough , but this is a step forward .
" it is the first time in which a stem cell therapy has been used effectively in this disease . "
previous research has suggested that stem cell therapy can benefit patients with other auto-immune diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis and crohn 's .
of the 2.2 million people with diabetes in the uk , only around 300,000 have the type 1 disease .
however , for unknown reasons , the number of british children under the age of five developing type 1 diabetes has risen five-fold in the last 20 years .

a third possibility is that the treatment stimulated an as yet unknown mechanism which stopped existing beta cells being destroyed .
the results do throw up the possibility that stem cell therapy could have a dramatic impact .
' preliminary study ' but the study was small , did not monitor the patients for very long and did not compare them with similar patients who were given alternative therapy or remained untreated .
dr iain frame , of the charity diabetes uk , warned against raising people 's hopes on the basis of a " very preliminary " study .
" it is well known that there is often a honeymoon period of relative remission after the onset of type 1 diabetes that complicates the interpretation of results such as the ones shown in this study .
" all these issues need to be addressed through more research before there are any conclusive findings in this area . "
dr richard burt , of northwestern university , chicago , who worked on the study , said : " i do not use the word cure , or the word breakthrough , but this is a step forward .
" it is the first time in which a stem cell therapy has been used effectively in this disease . "
previous research has suggested that stem cell therapy can benefit patients with other auto-immune diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis and crohn 's .
of the 2.2 million people with diabetes in the uk , only around 300,000 have the type 1 disease .
however , for unknown reasons , the number of british children under the age of five developing type 1 diabetes has risen five-fold in the last 20 years .

people with the condition are known as insulin-dependent , and require regular shots of the hormone .
but 14 out of 15 young people newly diagnosed with the condition no longer needed injections - sometimes for years - following the stem cell treatment .
however , experts warned the journal of the american medical association study was preliminary and inconclusive .
we would wish to avoid false hope based on the very preliminary nature of these results dr iain frame diabetes uk q & a : stem cells type 1 diabetes is caused by the patient 's own immune system destroying insulin-producing cells in the pancreas .
the researchers , from the university of sao paulo , gave the patients powerful drugs to suppress their immune systems in an attempt to stop further destruction of pancreatic cells .
this was followed by transfusions of stem cells taken from their own blood , in effect designed to restart the immune system .
some patients reacted more quickly to the treatment than others , and the length of the effect also varied .
one patient was able to survive without insulin injections for 35 months , and four others for at least 21 months .
two patients who responded late did not have to inject themselves for one and five months .
mechanism unclear previous studies have suggested stem cell therapy might be a promising approach for type 1 diabetes .
stem cell technology key sources for stem cells are adult organs or embryonic cells adult stem cells are identified and separated from other cells embryonic stem cells are removed from 5-day-old embryos cells are manipulated to stimulate them to take on a specific function specialised cells may then be used to treat unhealthy areas back next 1 of 5 stem cells are immature cells which can become different types of adult tissue .
it is thought that in this instance the stem cells may have generated new immune cells which do not target the pancreas , helping to safeguard what remaining insulin-producing cells the patient has left .
however , it is also possible that the treatment may have led to the growth of new insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas .

the galapagos islands were made a world heritage site 30 years ago for their unique plant and animal life .
" we are pushing for a series of actions to overcome the huge institutional , environmental and social crises in the islands , " mr correa said , adding that these problems were the result of years of neglect by previous governments .

the incident provoked an outcry in ecuador as it illustrated for many the practices which are damaging the site .

however , ecologists say the problems in the galapagos run much deeper than the government has acknowledged .
they fear that a rapid increase in the human population and the gradual introduction of external species of flora and fauna are threatening the entire ecosystem on the islands .

tony hodgson is to run the equivalent of ten marathons in ten days from his llanelltyd home to raise £ 3,500 for the deaf blind charity sense .
the 57-year-old said he would take it " fairly gently " to london and enjoy visits to tea shops and the " odd pint " .
" however , i 'm really going to push myself on marathon day , " he added .
beginning at 0930 bst on wednesday , mr hodgson will head across wales to shropshire , before going south to birmingham .
from there , he will join the grand union canal , which will lead him to the thames and onto london .
i 've never done that amount of mileage before , but i 'll be going fairly gently tony hodgson mr hodgson is undertaking the challenge on his own , carrying just a small rucksack on his back , and washing out his running kit every night .
he said : " this is my eighth london marathon in a row .
i 've done all the ones starting in 2000 so this year i thought i 'd do something a little bit different . "
despite the extra mileage mr hodgson , who trains for 40-50 miles a week , is confident he will complete the race .
" i 've never done that amount of mileage before , but i 'll be going fairly gently , " he explained .
" there 'll be teashops to visit en route and the odd pint in the evenings , i 'm sure .
" however , i 'm really going to push myself on marathon day as i currently hold the club marathon record and i do n't want to lose it . "
positive outlook mr hodgson said he had chosen to support sense after it helped a dolgellau family whose son was born blind and deaf .
" the care offered to the family by sense has changed their lives , and they now have a positive outlook for the future of their son , knowing that with the correct support , anything is possible , " he explained .
london marathon project manager , alison rulton , said : " it 's fantastic to work with someone with so much energy and relentless commitment to sense .
" we wish tony the very best of luck and will be behind him all the way . "

tony hodgson is to run the equivalent of ten marathons in ten days from his llanelltyd home to raise £ 3,500 for the deaf blind charity sense .
the 57-year-old said he would take it " fairly gently " to london and enjoy visits to tea shops and the " odd pint " .
" however , i 'm really going to push myself on marathon day , " he added .
beginning at 0930 bst on wednesday , mr hodgson will head across wales to shropshire , before going south to birmingham .
from there , he will join the grand union canal , which will lead him to the thames and onto london .
i 've never done that amount of mileage before , but i 'll be going fairly gently tony hodgson mr hodgson is undertaking the challenge on his own , carrying just a small rucksack on his back , and washing out his running kit every night .
he said : " this is my eighth london marathon in a row .
i 've done all the ones starting in 2000 so this year i thought i 'd do something a little bit different . "
despite the extra mileage mr hodgson , who trains for 40-50 miles a week , is confident he will complete the race .
" i 've never done that amount of mileage before , but i 'll be going fairly gently , " he explained .
" there 'll be teashops to visit en route and the odd pint in the evenings , i 'm sure .
" however , i 'm really going to push myself on marathon day as i currently hold the club marathon record and i do n't want to lose it . "
positive outlook mr hodgson said he had chosen to support sense after it helped a dolgellau family whose son was born blind and deaf .
" the care offered to the family by sense has changed their lives , and they now have a positive outlook for the future of their son , knowing that with the correct support , anything is possible , " he explained .
london marathon project manager , alison rulton , said : " it 's fantastic to work with someone with so much energy and relentless commitment to sense .
" we wish tony the very best of luck and will be behind him all the way . "
and although he is pulling out all the stops to run 10 marathons before the london marathon on 22 april , mr hodgson is planning to take the train home to north wales .

construction of the liquefied natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- pipe from milford haven to gloucestershire has already been disrupted by environmental campaigners .
but now a delay in planning permission for a pipe terminus at cilfrew , near neath , is causing further problems .
national grid said it was still assessing the full impact on supply .
the latest setback comes after a series of protests , including a demonstration last november when work in the swansea valley was halted by protestors who climbed inside the pipe .
however , phase one of the pipeline from milford haven to aberdulais , is over 95 % complete , and phase two from felindre to gloucestershire is said to be " well under way " .
green light eventually , the 190-mile pipeline will carry around 20 % of gas needed to meet the uk 's energy supply .
but the national grid said work at cilfrew had been suspended until planning permission is given , and the pipe would not work at full capacity until work there was complete .
initially , the scheme to build the terminus was approved by the planning committee of neath port talbot council .
the pipeline will eventually supply 20 % of the uk 's energy but some local people were unhappy that four councillors who had attended an earlier protest meeting against the plans had been advised not to vote by council officials .
the residents sought a judicial review , and last month a high court judge struck down the planning committee 's decision as " unlawful " and ordered the vote be taken again .
the council is unlikely to vote on the planning permission again until at least 15 may , according to the national grid .
a spokesman for the company said it would only be possible to make an accurate estimate of what capacity will be available for shippers importing gas to milford haven when the terminals open next winter .
in a statement , neath port talbot council said : " we will be giving careful consideration to the court judgement ... before deciding the next course of action . "
meanwhile , national grid said work on the pipeline was continuing and it would progress with other parts of the project as quickly as it could .

a medical report issued by the hospital said doctors recommended medical and dietary treatments as alternative therapies to be continued after his release , state media cited .
troubled star the former argentine team captain is still idolised in his home country , and his fans have been watching and waiting for any news .

a network of privately owned computer systems has been busy carrying thousands of international telephone calls into bangladesh over the internet .
voice over internet protocol , or voip , is a technology in use across the world , and in most places , perfectly legal .
it allows telecoms companies , often those selling pre-paid international phone cards , to route large volumes of calls very cheaply anywhere in the world , by buying space on broadband computer links and computer servers .
but now the illegal system has hit a major problem .
" it used to cost one or two pence a minute to call home , " says hossein , a worker in a bangladeshi restaurant in london .
" now we call but we can not get through , we try again and again , but we just ca n't get through . "
corruption charges voip has remained illegal in bangladesh in an attempt by the government to protect the state-owned telephone company , the bangladesh telegraph and telephone board . "
people are facing big problems getting connected in bangladesh .
it is creating a kind of traffic jam - all the time it is busy , busy , busy " voip entrepreneur , hassan but it simply has n't worked .
earlier this year it was estimated that voip calls accounted for up to 80 % of the total telephone traffic from abroad .
there have been rumours that some high profile politicians and businessmen have themselves been operating voip internet exchanges .
they have had an interest in keeping the industry outside of the law , it has been argued , as the longer it remained unregulated the longer they did not have to pay tax on the huge revenues it generated .
for whatever reason little action was taken against the voip providers and their existence seemed likely to continue to be tolerated .
but then bangladesh found itself under a state of emergency .
for the past three months the country 's new military-backed government has been waging war on what it sees as the too-long tolerated illegality and corruption of the past .
wealthy and powerful politicians have been arrested and are facing corruption charges .
' busy , busy , busy ' thousands of illegally built shops , businesses and slums have been torn down .
the voip industry has gone the same way .
" they have already taken my equipment from one of my places .
this is huge equipment , 11 gateways and 22 modems , many pieces of equipment , maybe $ 60,000 worth , " hassan says .
he is one of the young entrepreneurs who made a very good living running the illegal internet phone services , selling space on his computer equipment to foreign phone companies .
but he says closing him down , and others like him , has thrown the system into chaos , as hundreds of thousands of people try to call home with fewer and fewer lines available .
" people are facing big problems getting connected in bangladesh , " he says .
" most are not getting connected .
it is creating a kind of traffic jam - all the time it is busy , busy , busy . "
lt col zia safdar is the man who has been leading the drive against the illegal telephone businesses .
he says prior to the raids the size of the industry was enormous .
" at one stage we were a little surprised , " he says .
" we knew that they were handling a large volume of calls , but we found it was a huge quantity . "
as all of it was generating money untouched and untaxed by the government they had no choice but to act , he adds , telling me that the government is now trying to rectify the problem . "
it is very important that telecommunication should function well and this needs to be corrected as soon as possible " anwar-ul alam chowdhury businessman the number of conventional phone circuits is being doubled to at least 30,000 by the end of april , but col zia admits that for a country of 140 million people this will still be too few .
anwar-ul alam chowdhury is president of the bangladesh garment manufacturers association .
he says there are ways round the problem , using e-mail for example , but a functioning international phone network needs to be re-established in the long run .
" calling from outside bangladesh is really tough , " he says .
" it is very important that we have to trade and we have to communicate .
" it is very important that telecommunication should function well and this needs to be corrected as soon as possible . "
there is widespread popular support for the emergency government here .
people have welcomed the anti-corruption measures and the arrest of high profile individuals on corruption charges .
but there is also concern that some of its actions are hurting those it is meant to be helping .
giving the many overseas workers the chance to once again phone home would be welcomed too .

a network of privately owned computer systems has been busy carrying thousands of international telephone calls into bangladesh over the internet .
voice over internet protocol , or voip , is a technology in use across the world , and in most places , perfectly legal .
it allows telecoms companies , often those selling pre-paid international phone cards , to route large volumes of calls very cheaply anywhere in the world , by buying space on broadband computer links and computer servers .
but now the illegal system has hit a major problem .
" it used to cost one or two pence a minute to call home , " says hossein , a worker in a bangladeshi restaurant in london .
" now we call but we can not get through , we try again and again , but we just ca n't get through . "
corruption charges voip has remained illegal in bangladesh in an attempt by the government to protect the state-owned telephone company , the bangladesh telegraph and telephone board .
people are facing big problems getting connected in bangladesh .
it is creating a kind of traffic jam - all the time it is busy , busy , busy voip entrepreneur , hassan but it simply has n't worked .
earlier this year it was estimated that voip calls accounted for up to 80 % of the total telephone traffic from abroad .
there have been rumours that some high profile politicians and businessmen have themselves been operating voip internet exchanges .
they have had an interest in keeping the industry outside of the law , it has been argued , as the longer it remained unregulated the longer they did not have to pay tax on the huge revenues it generated .
for whatever reason little action was taken against the voip providers and their existence seemed likely to continue to be tolerated .
but then bangladesh found itself under a state of emergency .
for the past three months the country 's new military-backed government has been waging war on what it sees as the too-long tolerated illegality and corruption of the past .
wealthy and powerful politicians have been arrested and are facing corruption charges .
' busy , busy , busy ' thousands of illegally built shops , businesses and slums have been torn down .
the voip industry has gone the same way .
" they have already taken my equipment from one of my places .
this is huge equipment , 11 gateways and 22 modems , many pieces of equipment , maybe $ 60,000 worth , " hassan says .
small telephone vendors used the cheap voip providers ' rates he is one of the young entrepreneurs who made a very good living running the illegal internet phone services , selling space on his computer equipment to foreign phone companies .
but he says closing him down , and others like him , has thrown the system into chaos , as hundreds of thousands of people try to call home with fewer and fewer lines available .
" people are facing big problems getting connected in bangladesh , " he says .
" most are not getting connected .
it is creating a kind of traffic jam - all the time it is busy , busy , busy . "
lt col zia safdar is the man who has been leading the drive against the illegal telephone businesses .
he says prior to the raids the size of the industry was enormous .
" at one stage we were a little surprised , " he says .
" we knew that they were handling a large volume of calls , but we found it was a huge quantity . "
as all of it was generating money untouched and untaxed by the government they had no choice but to act , he adds , telling me that the government is now trying to rectify the problem .
it is very important that telecommunication should function well and this needs to be corrected as soon as possible anwar-ul alam chowdhury businessman the number of conventional phone circuits is being doubled to at least 30,000 by the end of april , but col zia admits that for a country of 140 million people this will still be too few .
anwar-ul alam chowdhury is president of the bangladesh garment manufacturers association .
he says there are ways round the problem , using e-mail for example , but a functioning international phone network needs to be re-established in the long run .
" calling from outside bangladesh is really tough , " he says .
" it is very important that we have to trade and we have to communicate .
" it is very important that telecommunication should function well and this needs to be corrected as soon as possible . "
there is widespread popular support for the emergency government here .
people have welcomed the anti-corruption measures and the arrest of high profile individuals on corruption charges .
but there is also concern that some of its actions are hurting those it is meant to be helping .
giving the many overseas workers the chance to once again phone home would be welcomed too .

the united states holocaust memorial museum in washington dc has teamed up with google 's internet mapping service , google earth , to try to halt what they see as genocide .
by combining the museum 's darfur database with clickable images on the ground , they aim to create a " community of conscience " among internet users .
the hope is that people around the world will then put pressure on their governments to stop the violence in darfur .
at least 200,000 people have been killed and two million displaced during the four-year conflict between rebel groups and pro-government militia in the region .
sudan 's government has so far refused to allow a joint un-african union peacekeeping mission to be deployed .
zooming in from now , anyone logging into google earth will see a welcome screen with a marker highlighting the darfur area .
if they then zoom in , flame-shaped icons will lead them to satellite images of destroyed villages , where blackened rings show where burnt-out mud and straw huts once stood .
other images show the tented camps where those displaced within darfur and hundreds of thousands more who have fled to neighbouring chad now live .
users can also see photographs and personal accounts of people who have lost family members and homes to the violence .
john heffernan , of the museum 's genocide prevention initiative , said the site would show viewers the scope of the " systematic destruction " occurring in darfur .
" this has certainly destroyed villages - it has also destroyed lives and livelihoods , " he said .
museum director sara bloomfield said the challenge in preventing genocide was not only to inform people but also to make them empathise with the victims - and then act .
" when it comes to responding to genocide , the world 's record is terrible , " she said .
each information screen has a link for people to follow for advice on what they can do to help - including writing letters to politicians .
and with some 200 million people using google earth over the past two years , the scheme 's potential reach is huge .
the museum 's genocide prevention mapping initiative - which aims to halt violence before it becomes genocide - could be extended to other conflicts in the future .
home ' completely gone ' the museum 's database of information has been gathered from the un , us state department and aid agencies working in the region . "
we need president bashir and other perpetrators to know they are being watched " daowd salih darfur campaigner hopes fade for solution users can view more than 1,600 villages throughout darfur that have been partially or completely destroyed , comprising more than 130,000 homes , schools , mosques and other structures , the project 's creators say .
they plan to update the google earth site as new satellite images and information come in .
daowd salih , a former red cross and red crescent worker who was forced to leave his home in western darfur , said he hoped the initiative would also serve as a warning to sudan 's leader , omar al-bashir , to rein in pro-government militias .
" we need president bashir and other perpetrators to know they are being watched , " he said .
mr salih , who now heads a campaign group on darfur , has seen what little remains of his former village using the satellite imagery .
" it 's one that has been completely destroyed , " he said .
" the site will show you how it was and how it is now - it is no longer there and you would never know where people used to play and gather .
" all this is completely gone , and we do n't know how people will come back -lsb- to rebuild when the violence ends -rsb- - it will take years . "
' it 's us ' google plans to track whether use of the darfur site sparks new community and political action on the internet , taking that as a measure of success .
so will it work ?
the peavey family , visiting the holocaust museum from fremont , california , said they believed the public would grasp the project 's message .
" i think people should know more about darfur and about all the other genocides that are going on around the world , " said david peavey .
" we can offer help to get people out , we can offer places to take the refugees , we can put pressure on the government , we can document it , take pictures of it and show people 's faces . "
" i think the more personalised you get , the more of a difference it makes , " said arlynn peavey .

enlarge image using hi-tech satellite imagery , photos and eyewitness accounts , the ongoing crisis in sudan 's darfur region is being brought into the homes of millions of internet users .
the united states holocaust memorial museum in washington dc has teamed up with google 's internet mapping service , google earth , to try to halt what they see as genocide .
by combining the museum 's darfur database with clickable images on the ground , they aim to create a " community of conscience " among internet users .
the hope is that people around the world will then put pressure on their governments to stop the violence in darfur .
at least 200,000 people have been killed and two million displaced during the four-year conflict between rebel groups and pro-government militia in the region .
sudan 's government has so far refused to allow a joint un-african union peacekeeping mission to be deployed .
zooming in from now , anyone logging into google earth will see a welcome screen with a marker highlighting the darfur area .
more than 2m people are living in camps after four years of conflict if they then zoom in , flame-shaped icons will lead them to satellite images of destroyed villages , where blackened rings show where burnt-out mud and straw huts once stood .
other images show the tented camps where those displaced within darfur and hundreds of thousands more who have fled to neighbouring chad now live .
users can also see photographs and personal accounts of people who have lost family members and homes to the violence .
john heffernan , of the museum 's genocide prevention initiative , said the site would show viewers the scope of the " systematic destruction " occurring in darfur .
" this has certainly destroyed villages - it has also destroyed lives and livelihoods , " he said .
the satellite images will be updated regularly by google earth museum director sara bloomfield said the challenge in preventing genocide was not only to inform people but also to make them empathise with the victims - and then act .
" when it comes to responding to genocide , the world 's record is terrible , " she said .
each information screen has a link for people to follow for advice on what they can do to help - including writing letters to politicians .
and with some 200 million people using google earth over the past two years , the scheme 's potential reach is huge .
the museum 's genocide prevention mapping initiative - which aims to halt violence before it becomes genocide - could be extended to other conflicts in the future .
home ' completely gone ' the museum 's database of information has been gathered from the un , us state department and aid agencies working in the region .
we need president bashir and other perpetrators to know they are being watched daowd salih darfur campaigner hopes fade for solution users can view more than 1,600 villages throughout darfur that have been partially or completely destroyed , comprising more than 130,000 homes , schools , mosques and other structures , the project 's creators say .
they plan to update the google earth site as new satellite images and information come in .
daowd salih , a former red cross and red crescent worker who was forced to leave his home in western darfur , said he hoped the initiative would also serve as a warning to sudan 's leader , omar al-bashir , to rein in pro-government militias .
" we need president bashir and other perpetrators to know they are being watched , " he said .
mr salih , who now heads a campaign group on darfur , has seen what little remains of his former village using the satellite imagery .
" it 's one that has been completely destroyed , " he said .
" the site will show you how it was and how it is now - it is no longer there and you would never know where people used to play and gather .
" all this is completely gone , and we do n't know how people will come back -lsb- to rebuild when the violence ends -rsb- - it will take years . "
' it 's us ' google plans to track whether use of the darfur site sparks new community and political action on the internet , taking that as a measure of success .
the site contains personal accounts of those affected by the crisis so will it work ?
the peavey family , visiting the holocaust museum from fremont , california , said they believed the public would grasp the project 's message .
" i think people should know more about darfur and about all the other genocides that are going on around the world , " said david peavey .
" we can offer help to get people out , we can offer places to take the refugees , we can put pressure on the government , we can document it , take pictures of it and show people 's faces . "
" i think the more personalised you get , the more of a difference it makes , " said arlynn peavey .
" you think ' it 's people , it 's us ' . "

members of the fishguard search and rescue team have said they will not respond to many emergencies next week .
the part-time team , which covers 30 miles of pembrokeshire coast are angered over the amount of compensation awarded to an injured colleague .
the maritime and coastguard agency said cases were assessed individually .
the part-time team , which covers 30 miles of the pembrokeshire coast , have said they will not respond to all call outs from next week unless the insurance row with the maritime and coastguard agency -lrb- mca -rrb- is resolved .
the team is one of about 400 around the uk and although members have full-time day jobs , they are on-call around-the-clock , every day of the year .
we will not carry out duties involving risk of personal injury until we are satisfied that our families will not suffer unnecessarily in the event of an injury anthony rogers they support full-time coastguards and volunteer life-boat crews in emergencies such as finding and rescuing missing people .
former coastguard rescue officer brian macfarlane is classed as 25 % permanently disabled , because of a knee injury sustained in a cliff rescue more than four years ago .
unable to continue his full-time career as a residential social worker , the benefits the 38-year-old now receives leave him and his family around £ 8,000 a year short of his previous earnings .
he was recently told he did not qualify for permanent injury benefit but would get temporary payments .
team member anthony rogers said the rest of his colleagues were worried that they would lose out financially if they were also injured .
there are about 400 mca search and rescue teams covering the uk " we have said we will not carry out duties involving risk of personal injury until we are satisfied that our families will not suffer unnecessarily in the event of an injury , " he said .
" it is not a decision we have gone into lightly and the reason we have given the mca 10 days notice is we hope to resolve this before then . "
the public and commercial services union which represents mca workers said the agency needed to make its policies clearer , so rescue officers understood the financial risk they face .
" the issue for me is that it is important that all of the coastguard rescuers understand what they are entitled to if they do get injured , " said paul smith from the union .
in a statement , the mca said it could not release information about individual employees but said the service provided by rescue officers was " valued highly " .
it added rescue officers were covered under the civil service injury benefits scheme .
" under this scheme all cases are assessed on an individual basis by the government medical officers , " it said .
the mca added mr macfarlane was currently receiving payments under the scheme .

the guidelines for schools in england says teachers should praise pupils five times more than they criticise them .
and they recommend difficult pupils be given special prizes or letters home if they make improvements .
education secretary alan johnson has promised a tougher stance against disruptive pupils .
" we must develop a new three rs : rules , responsibility and respect , " he told the annual conference of the nasuwt teachers ' union in belfast .
and he called on parents to " set proper boundaries " to stop their children " drifting into anti-social behaviour " .
guidance on discipline the department for education and skills has issued guidance on classroom discipline - with teachers having clearer rights to restrain pupils .
the guidance proposes that pupils should be given rewards for good behaviour - including prizes and privileges . "
any sense of ratio of five-to-one simply is a nonsense " mary bousted , atl postcards could be sent to their parents praising their behaviour , because many parents probably only heard complaints about their children .
teachers should also take into account a child 's cultural background before remonstrating with them or punishing them , the advice says .
teachers will now have clearer rights to restrain violent pupils - but they will not have authority to act against pupils outside school , as had been expected .
the guidelines also suggest that children who stand up to bullies should be rewarded .
a union leader dismissed the idea of a rigid ratio for punishment to reward as " nonsense " .
' crude ' mary bousted , general secretary of the association of teachers and lecturers -lrb- atl -rrb- , told the today programme on bbc radio 4 : " crude guidelines which say praise in proportion to punishment of five to one simply are n't helpful .
" it 's a nonsense - it takes away any sense of professional autonomy , professional respect and professional judgment for teachers .
" the principle of rewarding someone for being good ... that principle i wholly endorse and support .
" but if they are behaving badly then you have to deal with that behaviour and any sense of ratio of five-to-one simply is a nonsense . "
alan smithers , professor of education at the university of buckingham said the approach being recommended might encourage perverse behaviour .
children who had previously behaved well might play up to try to win rewards .
" as a soft approach it wo n't work because children and their parents will soon pick up that it is false . "
strike action the national union of teachers , holding its conference in harrogate voted to speed up the process by which they could take industrial action in support of a refusal to teach violent pupils .
a union official from calderdale , sue mcmahon , said : " my members this year have been : bitten by a five-year-old thumped by a six-year-old kicked by a seven-year-old spat on by an eight-year-old punched by a nine-year-old verbally abused by a 10-year-old received malicious damage to a car by an 11-year-old head butted by a 14-year-old received a facial injury so bad it required hospitalisation and surgery . "
veronica peppiatt from west sussex said some school managers dismissed sexual remarks as " harmless banter " or even said it was " flattering " for explicit references to be made to a young female teacher 's physical attributes by teenage boys - or younger .
" i have come across a nine-year-old boy who came up to a young teacher in a playground and said ' miss , are you wearing a bra under that t-shirt ? ' then shoved his hand up to find out and went ' phwoar ' . "
the conference also agreed with a proposal from the union 's leadership to undertake research into the impact of social class and deprivation on pupil achievement , motivation and behaviour .
a past president of the union , judy moorhouse , said teachers who had been assaulted did not want " patronising homilies on classroom practice or home circumstances " trivialising their experiences .
teachers were " beaten , kicked , stabbed and punched " and subjected to abuse on websites , she said .
if teachers believed their managements were not taking the matter seriously it must be right for their union to take action .

the guidelines for schools in england says teachers should praise pupils five times more than they criticise them .
and they recommend difficult pupils be given special prizes or letters home if they make improvements .
education secretary alan johnson has promised a tougher stance against disruptive pupils .
" we must develop a new three rs : rules , responsibility and respect , " he told the annual conference of the nasuwt teachers ' union in belfast .
and he called on parents to " set proper boundaries " to stop their children " drifting into anti-social behaviour " .
guidance on discipline the department for education and skills has issued guidance on classroom discipline - with teachers having clearer rights to restrain pupils .
the guidance proposes that pupils should be given rewards for good behaviour - including prizes and privileges .
any sense of ratio of five-to-one simply is a nonsense mary bousted , atl postcards could be sent to their parents praising their behaviour , because many parents probably only heard complaints about their children .
teachers should also take into account a child 's cultural background before remonstrating with them or punishing them , the advice says .
teachers will now have clearer rights to restrain violent pupils - but they will not have authority to act against pupils outside school , as had been expected .
the guidelines also suggest that children who stand up to bullies should be rewarded .
a union leader dismissed the idea of a rigid ratio for punishment to reward as " nonsense " .
' crude ' mary bousted , general secretary of the association of teachers and lecturers -lrb- atl -rrb- , told the today programme on bbc radio 4 : " crude guidelines which say praise in proportion to punishment of five to one simply are n't helpful .
" it 's a nonsense - it takes away any sense of professional autonomy , professional respect and professional judgment for teachers .
" the principle of rewarding someone for being good ... that principle i wholly endorse and support .
" but if they are behaving badly then you have to deal with that behaviour and any sense of ratio of five-to-one simply is a nonsense . "
alan smithers , professor of education at the university of buckingham said the approach being recommended might encourage perverse behaviour .
children who had previously behaved well might play up to try to win rewards .
" as a soft approach it wo n't work because children and their parents will soon pick up that it is false . "
strike action the national union of teachers , holding its conference in harrogate voted to speed up the process by which they could take industrial action in support of a refusal to teach violent pupils .
a union official from calderdale , sue mcmahon , said : " my members this year have been : bitten by a five-year-old thumped by a six-year-old kicked by a seven-year-old spat on by an eight-year-old punched by a nine-year-old verbally abused by a 10-year-old received malicious damage to a car by an 11-year-old head butted by a 14-year-old received a facial injury so bad it required hospitalisation and surgery .
