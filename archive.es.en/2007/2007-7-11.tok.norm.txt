but berlin says the meeting will go ahead . a summit meant to ease the lives of germany 's estimated 15 million immigrants hit a major hurdle when four turkish groups representing a chunk of the foreign population threatened to withdraw from talks this week with chancellor angela merkel 's government .
the groups , who were part of the first such integration summit held last year , say they feel hurt and discriminated against by the government 's recent changes to a 2005 immigration law which tightens restrictions on foreign spouses joining their non-german partners in germany .
they also say in the spirit of integration the government should have consulted them before making the changes .
the groups are now demanding that the government either revoke the changes to the law or else they will boycott the meeting .
" we 've concluded that it does n't make any sense to participate in the summit because the german government has n't understood the seriousness of our concerns and apparently does n't want to talk about making possible changes to the immigration law , " kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg -lrb- tgb -rrb- , told the online version of der spiegel on the eve of the summit .
helga and horst , but not ahmed and aische ?
in addition to raising the minimum age for foreign spouses to 18 , germany wants them in future to learn basic german before they enter the country .
the aim is to combat forced marriages believed to be widespread among germany 's turkish community .
turks make up the largest group among the country 's 6.7 million foreigners .
but turkish groups are irked that the regulation only applies to non-germans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government says the new law is meant to combat forced marriages " if helga and horst are allowed to get their partners here why not ahmed and aische too ? "
kolat said .
speaking at a press conference , kolat added the law amounted to " ethnic discrimination " and applied " double standards . "
kolat also raised doubts about the law 's effectiveness in fighting forced marriages .
he pointed out that the number of brides being imported from turkey had fallen in recent years .
those who do come in , kolat said , tended to be better educated .
" we too believe that every forced marriage is one too much and should be severely punished , " he said .
" but the law is no means to counter forced marriages . "
government says summit will go ahead the integration summit on thursday is one of a number of measures drawn up by chancellor angela merkel 's government to reach out to its large immigrant population amid mounting concerns in europe about radicalization and home-grown terrorism . german media regularly reports about the poor school performance of children from immigrant families , conflicts over the wearing of the islamic headscarf and the building of so-called parallel societies in large cities .
the summit , which brings together representatives from the government , migrant groups and independent experts , plans to introduce a weighty " national integration plan " which analyzes the problems of immigrants and includes some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to promote the integration of foreigners .
the plan is a result of a year 's work by the various groups that are part of the integration summit .
german politicians say the threatened boycott by the turkish groups should not be allowed to disrupt the work achieved so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer says the groups threatening the boycott are hurting the 2.5 million turks in germany " the summit will take place in any case and there will be no empty chairs , " said maria böhmer , federal commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" you do n't solve problems by staying away , but only when you speak to each other . "
a " self-boycott by the organizations " will not help the 2.5 million turks in germany , böhmer added .
" dream of multiculturalism has failed " the rift between the turkish groups and politicians ahead of the summit also reflects a tougher attitude in germany towards immigrants after decades of politicians refusing to accept its status as an immigrant country .
böhmer insisted that the new immigration law was not discriminatory and said integration also meant accepting the values and laws of the country that immigrants came to .

protestant leaders were offended and said inter-denominational dialogue was now at risk .
german commentators agreed . german commentators had a sharp eye on pope benedict xvi , himself a german , following the pontiff 's comments that other christian churches outside roman catholicism were " defective . "
benedict approved a document released tuesday from his old office , the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , which reiterated church teaching on catholic relations with other christians .
the 16-page document described christian orthodox churches as true churches , but said they suffered from a " wound " since they do not recognize the primacy of the pope .
however , the document also said that the " wound is still more profound " in protestant denominations .
" despite the fact that this teaching has created no little distress ... it is nevertheless difficult to see how the title of ' church ' could possibly be attributed to them , " the paper said .
not new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope said the catholic church is " true " the vatican text reiterates the controversial document " dominus iesus , " which the pope - at that time cardinal joseph ratzinger - issued in 2000 .
with the current document , its authors said they sought to address " erroneous " interpretations and theological " misunderstandings " deriving from the adoption of the second vatican council of the 1960s .
the vatican said it wanted to again stress the issue because it said some catholic theologians continued to misunderstand it .
the document is the pontiff 's second strong reaffirmation of catholic tradition within a week , following a decree on saturday restoring the old latin mass alongside the modern liturgy .
the vatican document said dialogue with other christians remained " one of the priorities of the catholic church , " but it nonetheless prompted swift criticism from protestants , lutherans and other christian denominations spawned by the 16th century reformation .
" it makes us question the seriousness with which the roman catholic church takes its dialogues with the reformed family and other families of the church , " the world alliance of reformed churches said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestants not feeling warm and fuzzy about pontiff right now " it makes us question whether we are indeed praying together for christian unity , " the alliance wrote in a letter to the vatican 's key ecumenical official , cardinal walter kasper .
mainz 's allgemeine zeitung said that " the path toward ecumenism - if it is desired - is based on respect from both sides .
a fair dialogue can not be achieved if one side asserts the claim of embodying the one , sole truth .
for those seeking commonalities on the basis of the christian message , these " answers " -lrb- from the pope -rrb- are just one more punch . "
mannheim 's mannheimer morgen noted that the pontiff was merely sticking to his principles in his comments .
" one may find the pope 's remarks outrageous , but benedict is actually just maintaining the stance he 's always had .
he has not transformed himself from a conservative into a liberal after taking up the papacy .
he has always deflected popular notions of belief .
by focusing on the leading role of the roman catholic church , he is keeping in line with the logic of the vatican .
for those who believe in ecumenism , the pope 's words were brusque .
on the other hand , they can be grateful to benedict : it is now clear that catholics and protestants will not forge closer ties during his papacy .
both sides know where they stand .
that is certainly better than an elusory hope that will never become reality , " the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict made a landmark visit to cologne 's synagoge in 2005 münster 's westfälische nachrichten took a pragmatic approach to benedict 's comments .
" texts in which the church is only concerned with itself , in which doctrines and interpretations shift only very slightly , provide material for a theologians ' circus , and for common rituals of critique .
but they completely miss the realities in which believers live .
believers want help in their daily lives , to deal with their jobs , their families , living with spouses of different faiths , in raising their children to be responsible christians .
marl 's recklinghäuser zeitung said that " people can disagree about how to approach ecumenism .
one can debate about whether different faiths should share sacraments .
but one should not belittle other people or willfully snub them .
during the second vatican council , the then young joseph ratzinger was one of the reformers of the catholic church in the midst of change .

" russia is an important destination for our customers , " mayrhuber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa is more than five times larger than airunion carrying 4.9 million passengers last year , airunion is russia 's second-biggest airline after aeroflot , which carried 8.75 million people , and was formed following a merger of five regional airlines including krasair , domodedovo airlines , omskavia , samara and sibaviatrans .
lufthansa had in recent years attempted to reach a cooperation arrangement with aeroflot , but other international contracts kept a deal from being reached as lufthansa is a leading member of the star alliance group while aeroflot signed on with the sky team , led by air france .
lufthansa also announced tuesday that its global traffic figures had hit a record level in the first half of 2007 of about 27 million passengers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 11.07.2007 opinion : debate strays on cruise as hitler 's attempted assassin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood star and scientologist tom cruise is slated to play a character who attempted to assassinate adolf hitler , and germany has been up in arms .
dw-radio 's ramon garcia ziemsen comments on the controversy . he 's a famous actor , but his talent is average .
he will play a german resistance fighter .
nothing spectacular in itself .
however , this famous , albeit mediocre , actor is an active member of the church of scientology - a community whose belief system includes totalitarian structures and claims to world supremacy .
the resistance fighter is claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , who attempted to assassinate adolf hitler , and a man who went down in history books as a " symbol of the resistance . "
someone who embodied a " different germany " during its dark period .
he may , he may not tom cruise is to play von stauffenberg - it 's a story loaded with everything that can prompt a fierce debate in germany .
after all , it concerns both the jurisdiction of interpretation of one 's own history , as well as a group in which brainwashing supposedly takes place and one which the german domestic intelligence agency has categorized as undemocratic .
scientology is a group whose organization reminds some germans of their darkest hour in history .
tom cruise in the role of a german who tried to overcome totalitarian structures .
while some ask " is he allowed to do that ? " other newspapers are talking about a " new clash of cultures . "
everyone 's entitled to their own beliefs but that is the way things are in both real and alleged cultural clashes : there is no clear distinction between fact and opinion .
the debate strays .
everything gets mixed up .
of course cruise is " allowed " to play von stauffenberg , even if many consider him wrong for the role , which he probably is .
it 's understandable , for instance , that von stauffenberg 's eldest son considers cruise an imposition in the role .
but to forbid people from doing their job based on their beliefs ?
that 's unacceptable - even if it comes to pass what peter steinbach , director of the memorial of the german opposition , warned of : that the film could be perceived as a scientologists ' venture .
the global media industry will , like always , abbreviate .
the equation : an active and prestigious member of the church of scientology - an organization that recently opened up a major center in the middle of berlin and a member of the german resistance ; in other words , scientology equals resistance .
that is the way it will be conveyed .
that is abhorrent and dangerous .
but it is still no reason to forbid cruise from playing stauffenberg .
just a little quote from article 4 of the german constitution , or " basic law : " " freedom of faith and of conscience and freedom to profess religious or philosophical creed shall be inviolable . "
bendlerblock is a memorial site so cruise is allowed to play him , but there 's another , more important question : where he is permitted to play him .
the german authorities have banned tom cruise from filming at a few historical sites - at the place where stauffenberg attempted a coup d 'etat on july 20 , 1944 , and where he and other conspirators were executed on that same night .
" there is no better way of evoking the nazi era than be denying a man the possibility of doing his job because of his beliefs , " one american newspaper wrote .
there are many people in germany who are talking about possible damage to the country 's image due to the ban .
they also point to the fact that three years ago , people were allowed to shoot a film about stauffenberg at bendlerblock - precisely the location where cruise is not allowed to shoot .
if not sooner , this is the point at which things can get confusing : cruise was not prevented from filming there because he is a scientologist , but because the employees at the memorial have had bad experiences with elaborate film shoots there .
and because they have learned that this memorial , this place of mourning , simply can not be turned into a setting for a film .
any german film crew would have experienced exactly the same thing as the american crew .
it 's just that no one here would have got upset about it .
original locations not necessary the director of the memorial at the dachau concentration camp once said that memorials must not be misused ; their sanctity must not be violated .
he said commerce - and that 's what hollywood is , after all - had no business being there .
must a film be shot at an original location anyway ?
this is not a documentary film that demands the authenticity of an original location .
these settings can be built , such as in steven spielberg 's film " schindler 's list . "
many other such examples exist as well .
let 's be clear : cruise should play stauffenberg .
but not everywhere .
we have to be very precise about why cruise may not film at bendlerblock : because this would be like a desecration .
because it would be unbearable to again execute stauffenberg at the original location for a popcorn-eating audience .
that is the argument .
and not that cruise is a member of an unbearable denomination . ramon garcia ziemsen works in dw-radio 's culture department -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-radio 's ramon garcia ziemsen comments on the controversy . he 's a famous actor , but his talent is average .
he will play a german resistance fighter .
nothing spectacular in itself .
however , this famous , albeit mediocre , actor is an active member of the church of scientology - a community whose belief system includes totalitarian structures and claims to world supremacy .
the resistance fighter is claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , who attempted to assassinate adolf hitler , and a man who went down in history books as a " symbol of the resistance . "
someone who embodied a " different germany " during its dark period .
he may , he may not tom cruise is to play von stauffenberg - it 's a story loaded with everything that can prompt a fierce debate in germany .
after all , it concerns both the jurisdiction of interpretation of one 's own history , as well as a group in which brainwashing supposedly takes place and one which the german domestic intelligence agency has categorized as undemocratic .
scientology is a group whose organization reminds some germans of their darkest hour in history .
tom cruise in the role of a german who tried to overcome totalitarian structures .
while some ask " is he allowed to do that ? " other newspapers are talking about a " new clash of cultures . "
everyone 's entitled to their own beliefs but that is the way things are in both real and alleged cultural clashes : there is no clear distinction between fact and opinion .
the debate strays .
everything gets mixed up .
of course cruise is " allowed " to play von stauffenberg , even if many consider him wrong for the role , which he probably is .
it 's understandable , for instance , that von stauffenberg 's eldest son considers cruise an imposition in the role .
but to forbid people from doing their job based on their beliefs ?
that 's unacceptable - even if it comes to pass what peter steinbach , director of the memorial of the german opposition , warned of : that the film could be perceived as a scientologists ' venture .
the global media industry will , like always , abbreviate .
the equation : an active and prestigious member of the church of scientology - an organization that recently opened up a major center in the middle of berlin and a member of the german resistance ; in other words , scientology equals resistance .
that is the way it will be conveyed .
that is abhorrent and dangerous .
but it is still no reason to forbid cruise from playing stauffenberg .
just a little quote from article 4 of the german constitution , or " basic law : " " freedom of faith and of conscience and freedom to profess religious or philosophical creed shall be inviolable . "
bendlerblock is a memorial site so cruise is allowed to play him , but there 's another , more important question : where he is permitted to play him .
the german authorities have banned tom cruise from filming at a few historical sites - at the place where stauffenberg attempted a coup d 'etat on july 20 , 1944 , and where he and other conspirators were executed on that same night .
" there is no better way of evoking the nazi era than be denying a man the possibility of doing his job because of his beliefs , " one american newspaper wrote .
there are many people in germany who are talking about possible damage to the country 's image due to the ban .
they also point to the fact that three years ago , people were allowed to shoot a film about stauffenberg at bendlerblock - precisely the location where cruise is not allowed to shoot .
if not sooner , this is the point at which things can get confusing : cruise was not prevented from filming there because he is a scientologist , but because the employees at the memorial have had bad experiences with elaborate film shoots there .
and because they have learned that this memorial , this place of mourning , simply can not be turned into a setting for a film .
any german film crew would have experienced exactly the same thing as the american crew .
it 's just that no one here would have got upset about it .
original locations not necessary the director of the memorial at the dachau concentration camp once said that memorials must not be misused ; their sanctity must not be violated .
he said commerce - and that 's what hollywood is , after all - had no business being there .
must a film be shot at an original location anyway ?
this is not a documentary film that demands the authenticity of an original location .
these settings can be built , such as in steven spielberg 's film " schindler 's list . "
many other such examples exist as well .
let 's be clear : cruise should play stauffenberg .
but not everywhere .
we have to be very precise about why cruise may not film at bendlerblock : because this would be like a desecration .
because it would be unbearable to again execute stauffenberg at the original location for a popcorn-eating audience .
that is the argument .
and not that cruise is a member of an unbearable denomination . ramon garcia ziemsen works in dw-radio 's culture department -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , it believes that new competitors would probably try to distinguish themselves from existing state-controlled post offices with lower costs and special services . eu financial services commissioner charlie mccreevy earlier defended the plans for a full market opening by 2009 .
as the bloc 's top internal market official , he said the industry would suffer if the market is not fully liberalized within the original timetable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post workers faces new competition in 2008 " our proposal is based on sound preparation .
it is not ... based on ideological zeal , " he said .
" experience with market opening to date has been overwhelmingly positive . " communication revolution mccreevy warned the european parliament that postal services around europe which fail to alter their business practices will lose out when new forms of communication , such as electronic mail , become even more widespread . " it is common knowledge that a communications revolution is taking place , " he said .
" it poses a threat for those postal operators that fail to adapt . "
mccreevy 's plans for liberalization by 2009 had gained support from the european commission , and eu members such as germany and britain , agreed that it would lead to a more reliable and better quality service driven by foreign competition in their postal markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some private mail delivery companies are already in action in germany the german national postal system , deutsche post , was already slated to give up its monopoly in 2008 . however , it fears a disadvantage if other countries are permitted to maintain their monopolies longer . bulgaria , estonia , finland , sweden and the uk have currently opened their postal markets up completely . the european parliament wants to cushion the disadvantage for deutsche post and other countries which have already deregulated their markets .
eu lawmakers said postal services in france and other countries who maintain their monopolies should not be granted access to the already liberalized markets . france and luxembourg , as well as other states , pushed for the delay , saying they need more time to prepare . the eu began efforts to liberalize the market back in 1997 and first entertained mccreevy 's 2009 plan in 2002 . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- als / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

from hillbilly to deep-fried southern funk , anything goes - as long as it 's got soul . munich 's trikont label is , by any standards , one of the world 's most eclectic .
recent releases span everything from us immigrant folk songs , mexican boleros and 1970s punk to depression-era yodellers and cajun swamp music . trikont 's compilation cds are put together by experts and collectors , but as label founder achim bergmann said , they 're aimed at a general contemporary audience . " we want to put things in a new light and show people where rock and popular music came from , " bergmann said .
" we want listeners to see themselves as part of a tradition . " trikont 's program is unusual but accessible .
the 2004 compilation " dirty laundry , " for instance , featured black musicians singing country songs .
forgotten recordings by soul legends james brown and bobby womack were represented , as were singles by unjustly neglected singers like bobby jonz and freddie north . " dirty laundry " proved a profitable hit , and a follow-up compilation will be released this fall , although profits are n't the main idea , according to bergmann . tuned in to afn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cajun music is one of trikont 's biggest sellers the trikont label evolved in 1971 out of the radical left-wing book publisher of the same name .

" when we go to music trade fairs , americans are sometimes surprised , " said bergmann .

this is something we do n't have . " ' " it 's like a kind of cultural anarchy with a critical eye toward capitalism , " said detlef diederichsen , a record critic and the musical director of berlin 's house of world cultures concert hall .

from hillbilly to deep-fried southern funk , anything goes - as long as it 's got soul . munich 's trikont label is , by any standards , one of the world 's most eclectic .
recent releases span everything from us immigrant folk songs , mexican boleros and 1970s punk to depression-era yodellers and cajun swamp music . trikont 's compilation cds are put together by experts and collectors , but as label founder achim bergmann said , they 're aimed at a general contemporary audience . " we want to put things in a new light and show people where rock and popular music came from , " bergmann said .
" we want listeners to see themselves as part of a tradition . " trikont 's program is unusual but accessible .
the 2004 compilation " dirty laundry , " for instance , featured black musicians singing country songs .
forgotten recordings by soul legends james brown and bobby womack were represented , as were singles by unjustly neglected singers like bobby jonz and freddie north . " dirty laundry " proved a profitable hit , and a follow-up compilation will be released this fall , although profits are n't the main idea , according to bergmann . tuned in to afn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cajun music is one of trikont 's biggest sellers the trikont label evolved in 1971 out of the radical left-wing book publisher of the same name .
german volksmusik had been discredited by its association with the third reich , and the label 's search for the authentic sounds of everyday working people led it to what cultural critic greil marcus has called " the old , weird america " - the land of cowboys , hillbillies , bootleggers , drifters , sharecroppers and others who made music beyond the confines of commerce . ironically , the left-wingers at trikont were introduced to much of the music they came to cherish by the armed forces network , the radio station that serviced american soldiers in post-war germany and continues to broadcast to us troops around the world . " it was like a second liberation , " bergmann said .
" the music they played had changed a whole century .
it had an existential side that german music lacked .
also , the idea of quality and mass culture was unknown in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trikont 's motto speaks volumes meanwhile , trikont publishes material that 's largely unknown in the us itself .
" when we go to music trade fairs , americans are sometimes surprised , " said bergmann .
" they come up and say , ' what is this ?
this is something we do n't have . " ' " it 's like a kind of cultural anarchy with a critical eye toward capitalism , " said detlef diederichsen , a record critic and the musical director of berlin 's house of world cultures concert hall .
" they 're raiding the archives of big companies who ca n't deal with their own back catalogues . " down home , up north if trikont is about breadth , bear family records , located in a small village near the northern german city of bremen , is about depth .
since 1975 , the label has specialized in exhaustively researched , painstakingly produced compilations of mostly country and rockabilly artists . recent releases include sets by ricky nelson , jerry lee lewis and hank snow .
all were made from the original recording tapes and feature extensive booklets with previously unpublished photos and background information . bear family does a large portion of its business via international mail order , and it has won a number of awards from the german record critics association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he was n't marrying his underage cousins , jerry lee lewis made great music label founder richard weize said he spends weeks at a time in america , investigating archives , searching through recording-studio vaults , negotiating contracts for rights and trying to locate collectors . " without collectors , i 'd be dead and buried , " weize said .
" and luck also plays a role .
you do your research , contact people , but in the end it 's often accident . " one of such fortuitous discovery was a lost version of johnny cash singing " ring of fire " in spanish , which weize found after listening to an unmarked master tape in a california studio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child tv star ricky nelson has been given the bear family treatment trikont 's bergmann said the reason german labels have played such a large role in cultivating older american music was that , as foreigners , they had a keener eye for hidden gems .
weize , on the other hand , thinks the reasons are economic . " you have to be crazy to do this , " weize said .
" all our editions sell in the long term .
but you ca n't be primarily profit-oriented . " the future of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bear family boss richard weize has been combing the archives for 30 years does the rise of mp3s and downloaded music present a threat to labels like trikont and bear family ?
are they afraid their small market of passionate collectors and people who want to discover the uncanny sounds of yesteryear will dry up ? " i 'm not afraid , " said weize .
" the cd is dying , as are many of its customers .
you can be sad about that , but it 's a fact .
so there 's no reason to fear anything . " bergmann added that a change in format could have less of an impact on focused labels . " major label music today is mostly about selling ring tones , " bergmann said .
" but passion and respect for real music will remain , and there 'll be a mix of cds and other formats . " the secret to these two independent labels ' survival may be that they target a selective audience of music fanatics - and those who want to be like them . " when people have everything at the disposal of their computer , they need experts , " diederichsen said .

for german authors , cracking the us book market is a hard task .
so when children 's book writer rotraut susanne berner got a call from a us publisher , she was happy - until she heard what would have to be changed . german children 's book author rotraut susanne berner was delighted when her latest worldwide success story , the newest of her " wimmelbücher " series , was courted by a publisher in the notoriously fickle us book market .
however , after celebrating the fact that a german book had been noticed by the normally indifferent american publishing industry , berner 's happiness turned to consternation when she discovered just how fickle the industry could be .
of course , said publishers , boyds mills press , there would be some cultural differences that would have to be addressed and possibly changed , which berner herself was happy to consider .
the publishers suggested that the inclusion of some smokers in the brightly colored illustrations would not be suitable for us children , and berner agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magnifying glass not included but when the publishers began suggesting censorship of naked artworks in the background of a museum scene , the german author could n't believe what she was hearing .
" it was a sensation to start with , " said berner of her amazement at attracting us interest , in an interview with the german der spiegel news magazine .

it seemed that the whole micro-penis affair is " highly embarrassing " to the publishing company , according to berner , which fears a backlash from angry parents if the book is published with the tiny organ still in place .

"
eighty-six people from all aspects of german life were invited by chancellor angela merkel to discuss the problems of immigration in germany and specifically the problems associated with the integration of immigrants .
more than two-thirds of the participants were german politicians , representatives of federations and church leaders .
less than one third came from the demographic of those the meeting was set up to help .
of the immigrants who did attend , half were of turkish origin .
the turks , with 2.2 million people , are the biggest group among germany 's immigrants and approximately 20 percent of them have taken on german nationality .
in total about 7 million people of non-german origin live in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 11.07.2007 germany 's integration summit clouded by turkish boycott großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not looking too bright for the summit at berlin 's chancellery upset by the government 's recent changes to the immigration law , four leading turkish groups are boycotting an integration summit thursday called by chancellor angela merkel .
but berlin says the meeting will go ahead . a summit meant to ease the lives of germany 's estimated 15 million immigrants hit a major hurdle when four turkish groups representing a chunk of the foreign population threatened to withdraw from talks this week with chancellor angela merkel 's government .
the groups , who were part of the first such integration summit held last year , say they feel hurt and discriminated against by the government 's recent changes to a 2005 immigration law which tightens restrictions on foreign spouses joining their non-german partners in germany .
they also say in the spirit of integration the government should have consulted them before making the changes .
the groups are now demanding that the government either revoke the changes to the law or else they will boycott the meeting .
" we 've concluded that it does n't make any sense to participate in the summit because the german government has n't understood the seriousness of our concerns and apparently does n't want to talk about making possible changes to the immigration law , " kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg -lrb- tgb -rrb- , told the online version of der spiegel on the eve of the summit .
helga and horst , but not ahmed and aische ?
in addition to raising the minimum age for foreign spouses to 18 , germany wants them in future to learn basic german before they enter the country .
the aim is to combat forced marriages believed to be widespread among germany 's turkish community .
turks make up the largest group among the country 's 6.7 million foreigners .
but turkish groups are irked that the regulation only applies to non-germans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government says the new law is meant to combat forced marriages " if helga and horst are allowed to get their partners here why not ahmed and aische too ? "
kolat said .
speaking at a press conference , kolat added the law amounted to " ethnic discrimination " and applied " double standards . "
kolat also raised doubts about the law 's effectiveness in fighting forced marriages .
he pointed out that the number of brides being imported from turkey had fallen in recent years .
those who do come in , kolat said , tended to be better educated .
" we too believe that every forced marriage is one too much and should be severely punished , " he said .
" but the law is no means to counter forced marriages . "
government says summit will go ahead the integration summit on thursday is one of a number of measures drawn up by chancellor angela merkel 's government to reach out to its large immigrant population amid mounting concerns in europe about radicalization and home-grown terrorism . german media regularly reports about the poor school performance of children from immigrant families , conflicts over the wearing of the islamic headscarf and the building of so-called parallel societies in large cities .
the summit , which brings together representatives from the government , migrant groups and independent experts , plans to introduce a weighty " national integration plan " which analyzes the problems of immigrants and includes some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to promote the integration of foreigners .
the plan is a result of a year 's work by the various groups that are part of the integration summit .
german politicians say the threatened boycott by the turkish groups should not be allowed to disrupt the work achieved so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer says the groups threatening the boycott are hurting the 2.5 million turks in germany " the summit will take place in any case and there will be no empty chairs , " said maria böhmer , federal commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" you do n't solve problems by staying away , but only when you speak to each other . "

the ministry said such rooms were no longer necessary because threat scenarios had changed .
though the ministry made the decision in may , the bonn-based german federal office of civil protection and disaster assistance -lrb- bkk -rrb- only announced the move this week .
the bkk said the shelters would not offer sufficient protection in the face of terrorist attacks and added that only a portion of the german population would find space in the rooms . millions in maintenance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some said other uses could be found for the structures , like this bunker turned penthouse maintenance for the bunkers and shelters has cost the government 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.7 million -rrb- per year .
bkk spokeswoman ursula fuchs said the institute for federal real estate would take care of selling the government-owned bunkers .
shelters to be sold also include those located in subway stations in several major cities .
most of the protective structures were built during world war ii .
some of them were integrated into an " emergency program " developed during the korean war in the 1950s .
additional bunkers were refurbished and expanded in the 1960s during the cuban missile crisis when the cold war came closest to escalating into a nuclear war .
following the end of the cold war , programs for refurbishing bunkers and other projects for installing civilian shelters came to a halt in the 1990s .
some historians have said they hope at least some of the bunkers will be kept intact so future generations can visit the structures and see information material common when the bunkers were built , such as a poster of a man hiding behind a tree with his briefcase in front of his head .
the poster 's headline read , " you 're better protected this way ! "
this year a bunker near bonn , the former capital of west germany , that would have housed west german government officials in the case of nuclear attack will be opened as a museum documenting the cold war . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

protestant leaders were offended and said inter-denominational dialogue was now at risk .
german commentators agreed . german commentators had a sharp eye on pope benedict xvi , himself a german , following the pontiff 's comments that other christian churches outside roman catholicism were " defective . "
benedict approved a document released tuesday from his old office , the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , which reiterated church teaching on catholic relations with other christians .
the 16-page document described christian orthodox churches as true churches , but said they suffered from a " wound " since they do not recognize the primacy of the pope .
however , the document also said that the " wound is still more profound " in protestant denominations .

the document is the pontiff 's second strong reaffirmation of catholic tradition within a week , following a decree on saturday restoring the old latin mass alongside the modern liturgy .
the vatican document said dialogue with other christians remained " one of the priorities of the catholic church , " but it nonetheless prompted swift criticism from protestants , lutherans and other christian denominations spawned by the 16th century reformation .

but berlin says the meeting will go ahead . a summit meant to ease the lives of germany 's estimated 15 million immigrants hit a major hurdle when four turkish groups representing a chunk of the foreign population threatened to withdraw from talks this week with chancellor angela merkel 's government .
the groups , who were part of the first such integration summit held last year , say they feel hurt and discriminated against by the government 's recent changes to a 2005 immigration law which tightens restrictions on foreign spouses joining their non-german partners in germany .
they also say in the spirit of integration the government should have consulted them before making the changes .
the groups are now demanding that the government either revoke the changes to the law or else they will boycott the meeting .
" we 've concluded that it does n't make any sense to participate in the summit because the german government has n't understood the seriousness of our concerns and apparently does n't want to talk about making possible changes to the immigration law , " kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg -lrb- tgb -rrb- , told the online version of der spiegel on the eve of the summit .
helga and horst , but not ahmed and aische ?
in addition to raising the minimum age for foreign spouses to 18 , germany wants them in future to learn basic german before they enter the country .
the aim is to combat forced marriages believed to be widespread among germany 's turkish community .
turks make up the largest group among the country 's 6.7 million foreigners .
but turkish groups are irked that the regulation only applies to non-germans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government says the new law is meant to combat forced marriages " if helga and horst are allowed to get their partners here why not ahmed and aische too ? "
kolat said .
speaking at a press conference , kolat added the law amounted to " ethnic discrimination " and applied " double standards . "
kolat also raised doubts about the law 's effectiveness in fighting forced marriages .
he pointed out that the number of brides being imported from turkey had fallen in recent years .
those who do come in , kolat said , tended to be better educated .
" we too believe that every forced marriage is one too much and should be severely punished , " he said .
" but the law is no means to counter forced marriages . "
government says summit will go ahead the integration summit on thursday is one of a number of measures drawn up by chancellor angela merkel 's government to reach out to its large immigrant population amid mounting concerns in europe about radicalization and home-grown terrorism . german media regularly reports about the poor school performance of children from immigrant families , conflicts over the wearing of the islamic headscarf and the building of so-called parallel societies in large cities .
the summit , which brings together representatives from the government , migrant groups and independent experts , plans to introduce a weighty " national integration plan " which analyzes the problems of immigrants and includes some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to promote the integration of foreigners .
the plan is a result of a year 's work by the various groups that are part of the integration summit .
german politicians say the threatened boycott by the turkish groups should not be allowed to disrupt the work achieved so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer says the groups threatening the boycott are hurting the 2.5 million turks in germany " the summit will take place in any case and there will be no empty chairs , " said maria böhmer , federal commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" you do n't solve problems by staying away , but only when you speak to each other . "
a " self-boycott by the organizations " will not help the 2.5 million turks in germany , böhmer added .
" dream of multiculturalism has failed " the rift between the turkish groups and politicians ahead of the summit also reflects a tougher attitude in germany towards immigrants after decades of politicians refusing to accept its status as an immigrant country .
böhmer insisted that the new immigration law was not discriminatory and said integration also meant accepting the values and laws of the country that immigrants came to .

but berlin says the meeting will go ahead . a summit meant to ease the lives of germany 's estimated 15 million immigrants hit a major hurdle when four turkish groups representing a chunk of the foreign population threatened to withdraw from talks this week with chancellor angela merkel 's government .
the groups , who were part of the first such integration summit held last year , say they feel hurt and discriminated against by the government 's recent changes to a 2005 immigration law which tightens restrictions on foreign spouses joining their non-german partners in germany .
they also say in the spirit of integration the government should have consulted them before making the changes .
the groups are now demanding that the government either revoke the changes to the law or else they will boycott the meeting .
" we 've concluded that it does n't make any sense to participate in the summit because the german government has n't understood the seriousness of our concerns and apparently does n't want to talk about making possible changes to the immigration law , " kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg -lrb- tgb -rrb- , told the online version of der spiegel on the eve of the summit .
helga and horst , but not ahmed and aische ?
in addition to raising the minimum age for foreign spouses to 18 , germany wants them in future to learn basic german before they enter the country .
the aim is to combat forced marriages believed to be widespread among germany 's turkish community .
turks make up the largest group among the country 's 6.7 million foreigners .
but turkish groups are irked that the regulation only applies to non-germans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government says the new law is meant to combat forced marriages " if helga and horst are allowed to get their partners here why not ahmed and aische too ? "
kolat said .
speaking at a press conference , kolat added the law amounted to " ethnic discrimination " and applied " double standards . "
kolat also raised doubts about the law 's effectiveness in fighting forced marriages .
he pointed out that the number of brides being imported from turkey had fallen in recent years .
those who do come in , kolat said , tended to be better educated .
" we too believe that every forced marriage is one too much and should be severely punished , " he said .
" but the law is no means to counter forced marriages . "
government says summit will go ahead the integration summit on thursday is one of a number of measures drawn up by chancellor angela merkel 's government to reach out to its large immigrant population amid mounting concerns in europe about radicalization and home-grown terrorism . german media regularly reports about the poor school performance of children from immigrant families , conflicts over the wearing of the islamic headscarf and the building of so-called parallel societies in large cities .
the summit , which brings together representatives from the government , migrant groups and independent experts , plans to introduce a weighty " national integration plan " which analyzes the problems of immigrants and includes some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to promote the integration of foreigners .
the plan is a result of a year 's work by the various groups that are part of the integration summit .
german politicians say the threatened boycott by the turkish groups should not be allowed to disrupt the work achieved so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer says the groups threatening the boycott are hurting the 2.5 million turks in germany " the summit will take place in any case and there will be no empty chairs , " said maria böhmer , federal commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" you do n't solve problems by staying away , but only when you speak to each other . "
a " self-boycott by the organizations " will not help the 2.5 million turks in germany , böhmer added .
" dream of multiculturalism has failed " the rift between the turkish groups and politicians ahead of the summit also reflects a tougher attitude in germany towards immigrants after decades of politicians refusing to accept its status as an immigrant country .
böhmer insisted that the new immigration law was not discriminatory and said integration also meant accepting the values and laws of the country that immigrants came to .

for german authors , cracking the us book market is a hard task .
so when children 's book writer rotraut susanne berner got a call from a us publisher , she was happy - until she heard what would have to be changed . german children 's book author rotraut susanne berner was delighted when her latest worldwide success story , the newest of her " wimmelbücher " series , was courted by a publisher in the notoriously fickle us book market .
however , after celebrating the fact that a german book had been noticed by the normally indifferent american publishing industry , berner 's happiness turned to consternation when she discovered just how fickle the industry could be .
of course , said publishers , boyds mills press , there would be some cultural differences that would have to be addressed and possibly changed , which berner herself was happy to consider .
the publishers suggested that the inclusion of some smokers in the brightly colored illustrations would not be suitable for us children , and berner agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magnifying glass not included but when the publishers began suggesting censorship of naked artworks in the background of a museum scene , the german author could n't believe what she was hearing .
" it was a sensation to start with , " said berner of her amazement at attracting us interest , in an interview with the german der spiegel news magazine .
but when the suggestions for edits and exclusions started to flood in over the nude paintings and sculpture , she thought it was a joke .
teenie weenie causes problems what could possibly have got the suits at boyds mills so hot under the overly starched collar ?

on the page , the sculpture stands at a very unthreatening seven millimeters tall and the appendage could , at first glance , be dismissed as a wayward brushstroke .
the " little willy " as berner called it " was barely half a millimeter in length . "
the sculpture is an aside in the overall museum scene and is in no way prominent to the storyline on that page , she added .
yet , the censors spotted it and wanted it out .
it seemed that the whole micro-penis affair is " highly embarrassing " to the publishing company , according to berner , which fears a backlash from angry parents if the book is published with the tiny organ still in place .
author pulls plug over censorship while berner admitted that she could have lived with the offending artworks being covered by a black box or bar in the book , the author and graphic arts designer said that she could not agree to a complete reworking of the page and the omission of the artifacts .
instead , she pulled the plug on the us deal .
the contract would have been a sweet one , but berner need not worry .
her books are sold all over the world and she has racked up best-sellers in 13 countries from japan to the faroe islands .
no one , other than the americans , has complained about the nudity , she said .
and so , the munich-based author continues her successful career with her principles intact and the innocence of the children of the united states spared .

however , after celebrating the fact that a german book had been noticed by the normally indifferent american publishing industry , berner 's happiness turned to consternation when she discovered just how fickle the industry could be .
of course , said publishers , boyds mills press , there would be some cultural differences that would have to be addressed and possibly changed , which berner herself was happy to consider .

dw-radio 's ramon garcia ziemsen comments on the controversy . he 's a famous actor , but his talent is average .
he will play a german resistance fighter .
nothing spectacular in itself .
however , this famous , albeit mediocre , actor is an active member of the church of scientology - a community whose belief system includes totalitarian structures and claims to world supremacy .
the resistance fighter is claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , who attempted to assassinate adolf hitler , and a man who went down in history books as a " symbol of the resistance . "
someone who embodied a " different germany " during its dark period .
he may , he may not tom cruise is to play von stauffenberg - it 's a story loaded with everything that can prompt a fierce debate in germany .
after all , it concerns both the jurisdiction of interpretation of one 's own history , as well as a group in which brainwashing supposedly takes place and one which the german domestic intelligence agency has categorized as undemocratic .
scientology is a group whose organization reminds some germans of their darkest hour in history .
tom cruise in the role of a german who tried to overcome totalitarian structures .
while some ask " is he allowed to do that ? " other newspapers are talking about a " new clash of cultures . "
everyone 's entitled to their own beliefs but that is the way things are in both real and alleged cultural clashes : there is no clear distinction between fact and opinion .
the debate strays .
everything gets mixed up .
of course cruise is " allowed " to play von stauffenberg , even if many consider him wrong for the role , which he probably is .
it 's understandable , for instance , that von stauffenberg 's eldest son considers cruise an imposition in the role .
but to forbid people from doing their job based on their beliefs ?
that 's unacceptable - even if it comes to pass what peter steinbach , director of the memorial of the german opposition , warned of : that the film could be perceived as a scientologists ' venture .
the global media industry will , like always , abbreviate .
the equation : an active and prestigious member of the church of scientology - an organization that recently opened up a major center in the middle of berlin and a member of the german resistance ; in other words , scientology equals resistance .
that is the way it will be conveyed .
that is abhorrent and dangerous .
but it is still no reason to forbid cruise from playing stauffenberg .
just a little quote from article 4 of the german constitution , or " basic law : " " freedom of faith and of conscience and freedom to profess religious or philosophical creed shall be inviolable . "
bendlerblock is a memorial site so cruise is allowed to play him , but there 's another , more important question : where he is permitted to play him .
the german authorities have banned tom cruise from filming at a few historical sites - at the place where stauffenberg attempted a coup d 'etat on july 20 , 1944 , and where he and other conspirators were executed on that same night .
" there is no better way of evoking the nazi era than be denying a man the possibility of doing his job because of his beliefs , " one american newspaper wrote .
there are many people in germany who are talking about possible damage to the country 's image due to the ban .
they also point to the fact that three years ago , people were allowed to shoot a film about stauffenberg at bendlerblock - precisely the location where cruise is not allowed to shoot .
if not sooner , this is the point at which things can get confusing : cruise was not prevented from filming there because he is a scientologist , but because the employees at the memorial have had bad experiences with elaborate film shoots there .
and because they have learned that this memorial , this place of mourning , simply can not be turned into a setting for a film .
any german film crew would have experienced exactly the same thing as the american crew .
it 's just that no one here would have got upset about it .
original locations not necessary the director of the memorial at the dachau concentration camp once said that memorials must not be misused ; their sanctity must not be violated .
he said commerce - and that 's what hollywood is , after all - had no business being there .
must a film be shot at an original location anyway ?
this is not a documentary film that demands the authenticity of an original location .
these settings can be built , such as in steven spielberg 's film " schindler 's list . "
many other such examples exist as well .
let 's be clear : cruise should play stauffenberg .
but not everywhere .
we have to be very precise about why cruise may not film at bendlerblock : because this would be like a desecration .
because it would be unbearable to again execute stauffenberg at the original location for a popcorn-eating audience .

dw-radio 's ramon garcia ziemsen comments on the controversy . he 's a famous actor , but his talent is average .
he will play a german resistance fighter .
nothing spectacular in itself .
however , this famous , albeit mediocre , actor is an active member of the church of scientology - a community whose belief system includes totalitarian structures and claims to world supremacy .
the resistance fighter is claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , who attempted to assassinate adolf hitler , and a man who went down in history books as a " symbol of the resistance . "
someone who embodied a " different germany " during its dark period .
he may , he may not tom cruise is to play von stauffenberg - it 's a story loaded with everything that can prompt a fierce debate in germany .
after all , it concerns both the jurisdiction of interpretation of one 's own history , as well as a group in which brainwashing supposedly takes place and one which the german domestic intelligence agency has categorized as undemocratic .
scientology is a group whose organization reminds some germans of their darkest hour in history .
tom cruise in the role of a german who tried to overcome totalitarian structures .
while some ask " is he allowed to do that ? " other newspapers are talking about a " new clash of cultures . "
everyone 's entitled to their own beliefs but that is the way things are in both real and alleged cultural clashes : there is no clear distinction between fact and opinion .
the debate strays .
everything gets mixed up .
of course cruise is " allowed " to play von stauffenberg , even if many consider him wrong for the role , which he probably is .
it 's understandable , for instance , that von stauffenberg 's eldest son considers cruise an imposition in the role .
but to forbid people from doing their job based on their beliefs ?
that 's unacceptable - even if it comes to pass what peter steinbach , director of the memorial of the german opposition , warned of : that the film could be perceived as a scientologists ' venture .
the global media industry will , like always , abbreviate .
the equation : an active and prestigious member of the church of scientology - an organization that recently opened up a major center in the middle of berlin and a member of the german resistance ; in other words , scientology equals resistance .
that is the way it will be conveyed .
that is abhorrent and dangerous .
but it is still no reason to forbid cruise from playing stauffenberg .
just a little quote from article 4 of the german constitution , or " basic law : " " freedom of faith and of conscience and freedom to profess religious or philosophical creed shall be inviolable . "
bendlerblock is a memorial site so cruise is allowed to play him , but there 's another , more important question : where he is permitted to play him .
the german authorities have banned tom cruise from filming at a few historical sites - at the place where stauffenberg attempted a coup d 'etat on july 20 , 1944 , and where he and other conspirators were executed on that same night .
" there is no better way of evoking the nazi era than be denying a man the possibility of doing his job because of his beliefs , " one american newspaper wrote .
there are many people in germany who are talking about possible damage to the country 's image due to the ban .
they also point to the fact that three years ago , people were allowed to shoot a film about stauffenberg at bendlerblock - precisely the location where cruise is not allowed to shoot .
if not sooner , this is the point at which things can get confusing : cruise was not prevented from filming there because he is a scientologist , but because the employees at the memorial have had bad experiences with elaborate film shoots there .
and because they have learned that this memorial , this place of mourning , simply can not be turned into a setting for a film .
any german film crew would have experienced exactly the same thing as the american crew .
it 's just that no one here would have got upset about it .
original locations not necessary the director of the memorial at the dachau concentration camp once said that memorials must not be misused ; their sanctity must not be violated .
he said commerce - and that 's what hollywood is , after all - had no business being there .
must a film be shot at an original location anyway ?
this is not a documentary film that demands the authenticity of an original location .
these settings can be built , such as in steven spielberg 's film " schindler 's list . "
many other such examples exist as well .
let 's be clear : cruise should play stauffenberg .
but not everywhere .
we have to be very precise about why cruise may not film at bendlerblock : because this would be like a desecration .
because it would be unbearable to again execute stauffenberg at the original location for a popcorn-eating audience .
that is the argument .
and not that cruise is a member of an unbearable denomination . ramon garcia ziemsen works in dw-radio 's culture department -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
eighty-six people from all aspects of german life were invited by chancellor angela merkel to discuss the problems of immigration in germany and specifically the problems associated with the integration of immigrants .
more than two-thirds of the participants were german politicians , representatives of federations and church leaders .
less than one third came from the demographic of those the meeting was set up to help .
of the immigrants who did attend , half were of turkish origin .
the turks , with 2.2 million people , are the biggest group among germany 's immigrants and approximately 20 percent of them have taken on german nationality .
in total about 7 million people of non-german origin live in germany .
a quarter of them come from eu countries and , due to the generosity of the eu , they experience few problems coming to and settling down in germany .
a third of germany 's immigrants have lived in the country for more than 20 years while about half have lived in the country for more than 10 years and nearly every fifth was born there .
the " guest workers " who came to stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " guest workers " began to arrive in the 1950s the first influx of immigrants began in the 1950s when germany began to enlist the help of " guest workers " from southern europe , followed by workers from turkey in the early 1960s .
they were all called " guest workers " because germany 's idea was that they would return to the native country some time in the future .
while many did this , others remained in germany and stopped being " guest workers " and instead became " immigrants . "
it soon became obvious that germany had not anticipated such a phenomenon and had little infrastructure and few laws in place to cope with the admission and integration needs of these people .
the turkish immigrants especially were concerned by the cultural and religious differences they saw in german society .
in later years , there was even greater concern , especially after sept .
11 , 2001 when an upsurge in mistrust of islam and muslims followed the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
study groups charged with compiling integration plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel meeting the delegates at the 2006 summit bearing in mind the difficulties allaying all parties , the first german " integration summit " in 2006 attempted to solve the problems together .
six study groups were set up to deal with the most important factors : integration courses ; learning german ; education and vocational training ; as well as the situation regarding women ; local integration activities and integration activities to benefit civil society .
these study groups were expected to bring these factors together in the integration plan that is due to be discussed at the second summit on july 12 .
but while there had been much initial praise for the first summit , there has been growing criticism ahead of the second .
the german government 's handling of the immigration law has left many feeling deceived , with the the turkish federations feeling most discriminated against .
many immigrant organizations have said the government ignored them in the policy-making process , and the turks feel that many of the points in the law were targeting them specifically .
so while germany prepares for its second , laudable summit aimed at easing integration problems , those who it hopes to help are again marginalized and several turkish groups have already said that they will boycott the summit in protest .

however , it believes that new competitors would probably try to distinguish themselves from existing state-controlled post offices with lower costs and special services . eu financial services commissioner charlie mccreevy earlier defended the plans for a full market opening by 2009 .
as the bloc 's top internal market official , he said the industry would suffer if the market is not fully liberalized within the original timetable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post workers faces new competition in 2008 " our proposal is based on sound preparation .
it is not ... based on ideological zeal , " he said .
" experience with market opening to date has been overwhelmingly positive . " communication revolution mccreevy warned the european parliament that postal services around europe which fail to alter their business practices will lose out when new forms of communication , such as electronic mail , become even more widespread . " it is common knowledge that a communications revolution is taking place , " he said .
" it poses a threat for those postal operators that fail to adapt . "
mccreevy 's plans for liberalization by 2009 had gained support from the european commission , and eu members such as germany and britain , agreed that it would lead to a more reliable and better quality service driven by foreign competition in their postal markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some private mail delivery companies are already in action in germany the german national postal system , deutsche post , was already slated to give up its monopoly in 2008 . however , it fears a disadvantage if other countries are permitted to maintain their monopolies longer . bulgaria , estonia , finland , sweden and the uk have currently opened their postal markets up completely . the european parliament wants to cushion the disadvantage for deutsche post and other countries which have already deregulated their markets .
eu lawmakers said postal services in france and other countries who maintain their monopolies should not be granted access to the already liberalized markets . france and luxembourg , as well as other states , pushed for the delay , saying they need more time to prepare . the eu began efforts to liberalize the market back in 1997 and first entertained mccreevy 's 2009 plan in 2002 . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- als / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ministry said such rooms were no longer necessary because threat scenarios had changed .
though the ministry made the decision in may , the bonn-based german federal office of civil protection and disaster assistance -lrb- bkk -rrb- only announced the move this week .

bkk spokeswoman ursula fuchs said the institute for federal real estate would take care of selling the government-owned bunkers .
shelters to be sold also include those located in subway stations in several major cities .
most of the protective structures were built during world war ii .
some of them were integrated into an " emergency program " developed during the korean war in the 1950s .
additional bunkers were refurbished and expanded in the 1960s during the cuban missile crisis when the cold war came closest to escalating into a nuclear war .
following the end of the cold war , programs for refurbishing bunkers and other projects for installing civilian shelters came to a halt in the 1990s .
some historians have said they hope at least some of the bunkers will be kept intact so future generations can visit the structures and see information material common when the bunkers were built , such as a poster of a man hiding behind a tree with his briefcase in front of his head .
the poster 's headline read , " you 're better protected this way ! "

bkk spokeswoman ursula fuchs said the institute for federal real estate would take care of selling the government-owned bunkers .

following the end of the cold war , programs for refurbishing bunkers and other projects for installing civilian shelters came to a halt in the 1990s .
some historians have said they hope at least some of the bunkers will be kept intact so future generations can visit the structures and see information material common when the bunkers were built , such as a poster of a man hiding behind a tree with his briefcase in front of his head .

" russia is an important destination for our customers , " mayrhuber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa is more than five times larger than airunion carrying 4.9 million passengers last year , airunion is russia 's second-biggest airline after aeroflot , which carried 8.75 million people , and was formed following a merger of five regional airlines including krasair , domodedovo airlines , omskavia , samara and sibaviatrans .
lufthansa had in recent years attempted to reach a cooperation arrangement with aeroflot , but other international contracts kept a deal from being reached as lufthansa is a leading member of the star alliance group while aeroflot signed on with the sky team , led by air france .
lufthansa also announced tuesday that its global traffic figures had hit a record level in the first half of 2007 of about 27 million passengers .

protestant leaders were offended and said inter-denominational dialogue was now at risk .
german commentators agreed . german commentators had a sharp eye on pope benedict xvi , himself a german , following the pontiff 's comments that other christian churches outside roman catholicism were " defective . "
benedict approved a document released tuesday from his old office , the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , which reiterated church teaching on catholic relations with other christians .
the 16-page document described christian orthodox churches as true churches , but said they suffered from a " wound " since they do not recognize the primacy of the pope .
however , the document also said that the " wound is still more profound " in protestant denominations .
" despite the fact that this teaching has created no little distress ... it is nevertheless difficult to see how the title of ' church ' could possibly be attributed to them , " the paper said .

with the current document , its authors said they sought to address " erroneous " interpretations and theological " misunderstandings " deriving from the adoption of the second vatican council of the 1960s .
the vatican said it wanted to again stress the issue because it said some catholic theologians continued to misunderstand it .
the document is the pontiff 's second strong reaffirmation of catholic tradition within a week , following a decree on saturday restoring the old latin mass alongside the modern liturgy .
the vatican document said dialogue with other christians remained " one of the priorities of the catholic church , " but it nonetheless prompted swift criticism from protestants , lutherans and other christian denominations spawned by the 16th century reformation .
" it makes us question the seriousness with which the roman catholic church takes its dialogues with the reformed family and other families of the church , " the world alliance of reformed churches said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestants not feeling warm and fuzzy about pontiff right now " it makes us question whether we are indeed praying together for christian unity , " the alliance wrote in a letter to the vatican 's key ecumenical official , cardinal walter kasper .
mainz 's allgemeine zeitung said that " the path toward ecumenism - if it is desired - is based on respect from both sides .
a fair dialogue can not be achieved if one side asserts the claim of embodying the one , sole truth .
for those seeking commonalities on the basis of the christian message , these " answers " -lrb- from the pope -rrb- are just one more punch . "
mannheim 's mannheimer morgen noted that the pontiff was merely sticking to his principles in his comments .
" one may find the pope 's remarks outrageous , but benedict is actually just maintaining the stance he 's always had .
he has not transformed himself from a conservative into a liberal after taking up the papacy .
he has always deflected popular notions of belief .
by focusing on the leading role of the roman catholic church , he is keeping in line with the logic of the vatican .
for those who believe in ecumenism , the pope 's words were brusque .
on the other hand , they can be grateful to benedict : it is now clear that catholics and protestants will not forge closer ties during his papacy .
both sides know where they stand .
that is certainly better than an elusory hope that will never become reality , " the paper wrote .

german commentators agreed . german commentators had a sharp eye on pope benedict xvi , himself a german , following the pontiff 's comments that other christian churches outside roman catholicism were " defective . "
benedict approved a document released tuesday from his old office , the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , which reiterated church teaching on catholic relations with other christians .
the 16-page document described christian orthodox churches as true churches , but said they suffered from a " wound " since they do not recognize the primacy of the pope .
however , the document also said that the " wound is still more profound " in protestant denominations .

the vatican said it wanted to again stress the issue because it said some catholic theologians continued to misunderstand it .
the document is the pontiff 's second strong reaffirmation of catholic tradition within a week , following a decree on saturday restoring the old latin mass alongside the modern liturgy .
the vatican document said dialogue with other christians remained " one of the priorities of the catholic church , " but it nonetheless prompted swift criticism from protestants , lutherans and other christian denominations spawned by the 16th century reformation .

dw-radio 's ramon garcia ziemsen comments on the controversy . he 's a famous actor , but his talent is average .
he will play a german resistance fighter .
nothing spectacular in itself .
however , this famous , albeit mediocre , actor is an active member of the church of scientology - a community whose belief system includes totalitarian structures and claims to world supremacy .
the resistance fighter is claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , who attempted to assassinate adolf hitler , and a man who went down in history books as a " symbol of the resistance . "
someone who embodied a " different germany " during its dark period .
he may , he may not tom cruise is to play von stauffenberg - it 's a story loaded with everything that can prompt a fierce debate in germany .
after all , it concerns both the jurisdiction of interpretation of one 's own history , as well as a group in which brainwashing supposedly takes place and one which the german domestic intelligence agency has categorized as undemocratic .
scientology is a group whose organization reminds some germans of their darkest hour in history .
tom cruise in the role of a german who tried to overcome totalitarian structures .
while some ask " is he allowed to do that ? " other newspapers are talking about a " new clash of cultures . "
everyone 's entitled to their own beliefs but that is the way things are in both real and alleged cultural clashes : there is no clear distinction between fact and opinion .
the debate strays .
everything gets mixed up .
of course cruise is " allowed " to play von stauffenberg , even if many consider him wrong for the role , which he probably is .
it 's understandable , for instance , that von stauffenberg 's eldest son considers cruise an imposition in the role .
but to forbid people from doing their job based on their beliefs ?
that 's unacceptable - even if it comes to pass what peter steinbach , director of the memorial of the german opposition , warned of : that the film could be perceived as a scientologists ' venture .
the global media industry will , like always , abbreviate .
the equation : an active and prestigious member of the church of scientology - an organization that recently opened up a major center in the middle of berlin and a member of the german resistance ; in other words , scientology equals resistance .
that is the way it will be conveyed .
that is abhorrent and dangerous .
but it is still no reason to forbid cruise from playing stauffenberg .
just a little quote from article 4 of the german constitution , or " basic law : " " freedom of faith and of conscience and freedom to profess religious or philosophical creed shall be inviolable . "
bendlerblock is a memorial site so cruise is allowed to play him , but there 's another , more important question : where he is permitted to play him .
the german authorities have banned tom cruise from filming at a few historical sites - at the place where stauffenberg attempted a coup d 'etat on july 20 , 1944 , and where he and other conspirators were executed on that same night .
" there is no better way of evoking the nazi era than be denying a man the possibility of doing his job because of his beliefs , " one american newspaper wrote .
there are many people in germany who are talking about possible damage to the country 's image due to the ban .
they also point to the fact that three years ago , people were allowed to shoot a film about stauffenberg at bendlerblock - precisely the location where cruise is not allowed to shoot .
if not sooner , this is the point at which things can get confusing : cruise was not prevented from filming there because he is a scientologist , but because the employees at the memorial have had bad experiences with elaborate film shoots there .
and because they have learned that this memorial , this place of mourning , simply can not be turned into a setting for a film .
any german film crew would have experienced exactly the same thing as the american crew .
it 's just that no one here would have got upset about it .
original locations not necessary the director of the memorial at the dachau concentration camp once said that memorials must not be misused ; their sanctity must not be violated .
he said commerce - and that 's what hollywood is , after all - had no business being there .
must a film be shot at an original location anyway ?
this is not a documentary film that demands the authenticity of an original location .
these settings can be built , such as in steven spielberg 's film " schindler 's list . "
many other such examples exist as well .
let 's be clear : cruise should play stauffenberg .
but not everywhere .
we have to be very precise about why cruise may not film at bendlerblock : because this would be like a desecration .
because it would be unbearable to again execute stauffenberg at the original location for a popcorn-eating audience .
that is the argument .
and not that cruise is a member of an unbearable denomination . ramon garcia ziemsen works in dw-radio 's culture department -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

from hillbilly to deep-fried southern funk , anything goes - as long as it 's got soul . munich 's trikont label is , by any standards , one of the world 's most eclectic .
recent releases span everything from us immigrant folk songs , mexican boleros and 1970s punk to depression-era yodellers and cajun swamp music . trikont 's compilation cds are put together by experts and collectors , but as label founder achim bergmann said , they 're aimed at a general contemporary audience . " we want to put things in a new light and show people where rock and popular music came from , " bergmann said .
" we want listeners to see themselves as part of a tradition . " trikont 's program is unusual but accessible .
the 2004 compilation " dirty laundry , " for instance , featured black musicians singing country songs .
forgotten recordings by soul legends james brown and bobby womack were represented , as were singles by unjustly neglected singers like bobby jonz and freddie north . " dirty laundry " proved a profitable hit , and a follow-up compilation will be released this fall , although profits are n't the main idea , according to bergmann . tuned in to afn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cajun music is one of trikont 's biggest sellers the trikont label evolved in 1971 out of the radical left-wing book publisher of the same name .
german volksmusik had been discredited by its association with the third reich , and the label 's search for the authentic sounds of everyday working people led it to what cultural critic greil marcus has called " the old , weird america " - the land of cowboys , hillbillies , bootleggers , drifters , sharecroppers and others who made music beyond the confines of commerce . ironically , the left-wingers at trikont were introduced to much of the music they came to cherish by the armed forces network , the radio station that serviced american soldiers in post-war germany and continues to broadcast to us troops around the world . " it was like a second liberation , " bergmann said .
" the music they played had changed a whole century .
it had an existential side that german music lacked .
also , the idea of quality and mass culture was unknown in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trikont 's motto speaks volumes meanwhile , trikont publishes material that 's largely unknown in the us itself .
" when we go to music trade fairs , americans are sometimes surprised , " said bergmann .
" they come up and say , ' what is this ?
this is something we do n't have . " ' " it 's like a kind of cultural anarchy with a critical eye toward capitalism , " said detlef diederichsen , a record critic and the musical director of berlin 's house of world cultures concert hall .
" they 're raiding the archives of big companies who ca n't deal with their own back catalogues . " down home , up north if trikont is about breadth , bear family records , located in a small village near the northern german city of bremen , is about depth .
since 1975 , the label has specialized in exhaustively researched , painstakingly produced compilations of mostly country and rockabilly artists . recent releases include sets by ricky nelson , jerry lee lewis and hank snow .
all were made from the original recording tapes and feature extensive booklets with previously unpublished photos and background information . bear family does a large portion of its business via international mail order , and it has won a number of awards from the german record critics association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he was n't marrying his underage cousins , jerry lee lewis made great music label founder richard weize said he spends weeks at a time in america , investigating archives , searching through recording-studio vaults , negotiating contracts for rights and trying to locate collectors . " without collectors , i 'd be dead and buried , " weize said .
" and luck also plays a role .
you do your research , contact people , but in the end it 's often accident . " one of such fortuitous discovery was a lost version of johnny cash singing " ring of fire " in spanish , which weize found after listening to an unmarked master tape in a california studio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child tv star ricky nelson has been given the bear family treatment trikont 's bergmann said the reason german labels have played such a large role in cultivating older american music was that , as foreigners , they had a keener eye for hidden gems .
weize , on the other hand , thinks the reasons are economic . " you have to be crazy to do this , " weize said .
" all our editions sell in the long term .
but you ca n't be primarily profit-oriented . " the future of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bear family boss richard weize has been combing the archives for 30 years does the rise of mp3s and downloaded music present a threat to labels like trikont and bear family ?
are they afraid their small market of passionate collectors and people who want to discover the uncanny sounds of yesteryear will dry up ? " i 'm not afraid , " said weize .
" the cd is dying , as are many of its customers .
you can be sad about that , but it 's a fact .
so there 's no reason to fear anything . " bergmann added that a change in format could have less of an impact on focused labels . " major label music today is mostly about selling ring tones , " bergmann said .
" but passion and respect for real music will remain , and there 'll be a mix of cds and other formats . " the secret to these two independent labels ' survival may be that they target a selective audience of music fanatics - and those who want to be like them . " when people have everything at the disposal of their computer , they need experts , " diederichsen said .
" they need to be guided by someone with a personal taste who explains and comments on the music . " and guiding listeners on sonic expeditions through the old , weird america is something both bear family and trikont have been doing for 30 years . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for german authors , cracking the us book market is a hard task .
so when children 's book writer rotraut susanne berner got a call from a us publisher , she was happy - until she heard what would have to be changed . german children 's book author rotraut susanne berner was delighted when her latest worldwide success story , the newest of her " wimmelbücher " series , was courted by a publisher in the notoriously fickle us book market .
however , after celebrating the fact that a german book had been noticed by the normally indifferent american publishing industry , berner 's happiness turned to consternation when she discovered just how fickle the industry could be .
of course , said publishers , boyds mills press , there would be some cultural differences that would have to be addressed and possibly changed , which berner herself was happy to consider .
the publishers suggested that the inclusion of some smokers in the brightly colored illustrations would not be suitable for us children , and berner agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magnifying glass not included but when the publishers began suggesting censorship of naked artworks in the background of a museum scene , the german author could n't believe what she was hearing .
" it was a sensation to start with , " said berner of her amazement at attracting us interest , in an interview with the german der spiegel news magazine .
but when the suggestions for edits and exclusions started to flood in over the nude paintings and sculpture , she thought it was a joke .

it seemed that the whole micro-penis affair is " highly embarrassing " to the publishing company , according to berner , which fears a backlash from angry parents if the book is published with the tiny organ still in place .
author pulls plug over censorship while berner admitted that she could have lived with the offending artworks being covered by a black box or bar in the book , the author and graphic arts designer said that she could not agree to a complete reworking of the page and the omission of the artifacts .

the publishers suggested that the inclusion of some smokers in the brightly colored illustrations would not be suitable for us children , and berner agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magnifying glass not included but when the publishers began suggesting censorship of naked artworks in the background of a museum scene , the german author could n't believe what she was hearing .
" it was a sensation to start with , " said berner of her amazement at attracting us interest , in an interview with the german der spiegel news magazine .
but when the suggestions for edits and exclusions started to flood in over the nude paintings and sculpture , she thought it was a joke .
teenie weenie causes problems what could possibly have got the suits at boyds mills so hot under the overly starched collar ?
a painting depicting a gratuitous roman orgy being viewed by wide-eyed 5-year olds ?
a massive bronze phallus gawped at by an awestruck group of pre-teens ?
hardly .
apart from a tasteful nude reclining in a slightly blurred watercolor in the background , the main offending artifact was a tiny male statue and its microscopic penis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this 50 million euro artwork from the 16th century obscene ?
on the page , the sculpture stands at a very unthreatening seven millimeters tall and the appendage could , at first glance , be dismissed as a wayward brushstroke .
the " little willy " as berner called it " was barely half a millimeter in length . "
the sculpture is an aside in the overall museum scene and is in no way prominent to the storyline on that page , she added .
yet , the censors spotted it and wanted it out .
it seemed that the whole micro-penis affair is " highly embarrassing " to the publishing company , according to berner , which fears a backlash from angry parents if the book is published with the tiny organ still in place .
author pulls plug over censorship while berner admitted that she could have lived with the offending artworks being covered by a black box or bar in the book , the author and graphic arts designer said that she could not agree to a complete reworking of the page and the omission of the artifacts .
instead , she pulled the plug on the us deal .
the contract would have been a sweet one , but berner need not worry .
her books are sold all over the world and she has racked up best-sellers in 13 countries from japan to the faroe islands .
no one , other than the americans , has complained about the nudity , she said .
and so , the munich-based author continues her successful career with her principles intact and the innocence of the children of the united states spared .
at least until the next class trip to a museum . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but berlin says the meeting will go ahead . a summit meant to ease the lives of germany 's estimated 15 million immigrants hit a major hurdle when four turkish groups representing a chunk of the foreign population threatened to withdraw from talks this week with chancellor angela merkel 's government .
the groups , who were part of the first such integration summit held last year , say they feel hurt and discriminated against by the government 's recent changes to a 2005 immigration law which tightens restrictions on foreign spouses joining their non-german partners in germany .
they also say in the spirit of integration the government should have consulted them before making the changes .
the groups are now demanding that the government either revoke the changes to the law or else they will boycott the meeting .
" we 've concluded that it does n't make any sense to participate in the summit because the german government has n't understood the seriousness of our concerns and apparently does n't want to talk about making possible changes to the immigration law , " kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg -lrb- tgb -rrb- , told the online version of der spiegel on the eve of the summit .
helga and horst , but not ahmed and aische ?
in addition to raising the minimum age for foreign spouses to 18 , germany wants them in future to learn basic german before they enter the country .
the aim is to combat forced marriages believed to be widespread among germany 's turkish community .
turks make up the largest group among the country 's 6.7 million foreigners .
but turkish groups are irked that the regulation only applies to non-germans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government says the new law is meant to combat forced marriages " if helga and horst are allowed to get their partners here why not ahmed and aische too ? "
kolat said .
speaking at a press conference , kolat added the law amounted to " ethnic discrimination " and applied " double standards . "
kolat also raised doubts about the law 's effectiveness in fighting forced marriages .
he pointed out that the number of brides being imported from turkey had fallen in recent years .
those who do come in , kolat said , tended to be better educated .
" we too believe that every forced marriage is one too much and should be severely punished , " he said .
" but the law is no means to counter forced marriages . "
government says summit will go ahead the integration summit on thursday is one of a number of measures drawn up by chancellor angela merkel 's government to reach out to its large immigrant population amid mounting concerns in europe about radicalization and home-grown terrorism . german media regularly reports about the poor school performance of children from immigrant families , conflicts over the wearing of the islamic headscarf and the building of so-called parallel societies in large cities .
the summit , which brings together representatives from the government , migrant groups and independent experts , plans to introduce a weighty " national integration plan " which analyzes the problems of immigrants and includes some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to promote the integration of foreigners .
the plan is a result of a year 's work by the various groups that are part of the integration summit .
german politicians say the threatened boycott by the turkish groups should not be allowed to disrupt the work achieved so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer says the groups threatening the boycott are hurting the 2.5 million turks in germany " the summit will take place in any case and there will be no empty chairs , " said maria böhmer , federal commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" you do n't solve problems by staying away , but only when you speak to each other . "
a " self-boycott by the organizations " will not help the 2.5 million turks in germany , böhmer added .
" dream of multiculturalism has failed " the rift between the turkish groups and politicians ahead of the summit also reflects a tougher attitude in germany towards immigrants after decades of politicians refusing to accept its status as an immigrant country .

but berlin says the meeting will go ahead . a summit meant to ease the lives of germany 's estimated 15 million immigrants hit a major hurdle when four turkish groups representing a chunk of the foreign population threatened to withdraw from talks this week with chancellor angela merkel 's government .
the groups , who were part of the first such integration summit held last year , say they feel hurt and discriminated against by the government 's recent changes to a 2005 immigration law which tightens restrictions on foreign spouses joining their non-german partners in germany .
they also say in the spirit of integration the government should have consulted them before making the changes .
the groups are now demanding that the government either revoke the changes to the law or else they will boycott the meeting .
" we 've concluded that it does n't make any sense to participate in the summit because the german government has n't understood the seriousness of our concerns and apparently does n't want to talk about making possible changes to the immigration law , " kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg -lrb- tgb -rrb- , told the online version of der spiegel on the eve of the summit .
helga and horst , but not ahmed and aische ?
in addition to raising the minimum age for foreign spouses to 18 , germany wants them in future to learn basic german before they enter the country .
the aim is to combat forced marriages believed to be widespread among germany 's turkish community .
turks make up the largest group among the country 's 6.7 million foreigners .
but turkish groups are irked that the regulation only applies to non-germans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government says the new law is meant to combat forced marriages " if helga and horst are allowed to get their partners here why not ahmed and aische too ? "
kolat said .
speaking at a press conference , kolat added the law amounted to " ethnic discrimination " and applied " double standards . "
kolat also raised doubts about the law 's effectiveness in fighting forced marriages .
he pointed out that the number of brides being imported from turkey had fallen in recent years .
those who do come in , kolat said , tended to be better educated .
" we too believe that every forced marriage is one too much and should be severely punished , " he said .
" but the law is no means to counter forced marriages . "
government says summit will go ahead the integration summit on thursday is one of a number of measures drawn up by chancellor angela merkel 's government to reach out to its large immigrant population amid mounting concerns in europe about radicalization and home-grown terrorism . german media regularly reports about the poor school performance of children from immigrant families , conflicts over the wearing of the islamic headscarf and the building of so-called parallel societies in large cities .
the summit , which brings together representatives from the government , migrant groups and independent experts , plans to introduce a weighty " national integration plan " which analyzes the problems of immigrants and includes some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to promote the integration of foreigners .
the plan is a result of a year 's work by the various groups that are part of the integration summit .
german politicians say the threatened boycott by the turkish groups should not be allowed to disrupt the work achieved so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer says the groups threatening the boycott are hurting the 2.5 million turks in germany " the summit will take place in any case and there will be no empty chairs , " said maria böhmer , federal commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" you do n't solve problems by staying away , but only when you speak to each other . "
a " self-boycott by the organizations " will not help the 2.5 million turks in germany , böhmer added .
" dream of multiculturalism has failed " the rift between the turkish groups and politicians ahead of the summit also reflects a tougher attitude in germany towards immigrants after decades of politicians refusing to accept its status as an immigrant country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 11.07.2007 press review : pope 's comments on catholic " primacy " grate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has stirred controversay before the vatican said tuesday that christian communities outside roman catholicism were not full churches .
protestant leaders were offended and said inter-denominational dialogue was now at risk .
german commentators agreed . german commentators had a sharp eye on pope benedict xvi , himself a german , following the pontiff 's comments that other christian churches outside roman catholicism were " defective . "
benedict approved a document released tuesday from his old office , the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , which reiterated church teaching on catholic relations with other christians .
the 16-page document described christian orthodox churches as true churches , but said they suffered from a " wound " since they do not recognize the primacy of the pope .
however , the document also said that the " wound is still more profound " in protestant denominations .
" despite the fact that this teaching has created no little distress ... it is nevertheless difficult to see how the title of ' church ' could possibly be attributed to them , " the paper said .
not new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope said the catholic church is " true " the vatican text reiterates the controversial document " dominus iesus , " which the pope - at that time cardinal joseph ratzinger - issued in 2000 .
with the current document , its authors said they sought to address " erroneous " interpretations and theological " misunderstandings " deriving from the adoption of the second vatican council of the 1960s .
the vatican said it wanted to again stress the issue because it said some catholic theologians continued to misunderstand it .
the document is the pontiff 's second strong reaffirmation of catholic tradition within a week , following a decree on saturday restoring the old latin mass alongside the modern liturgy .
the vatican document said dialogue with other christians remained " one of the priorities of the catholic church , " but it nonetheless prompted swift criticism from protestants , lutherans and other christian denominations spawned by the 16th century reformation .
" it makes us question the seriousness with which the roman catholic church takes its dialogues with the reformed family and other families of the church , " the world alliance of reformed churches said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestants not feeling warm and fuzzy about pontiff right now " it makes us question whether we are indeed praying together for christian unity , " the alliance wrote in a letter to the vatican 's key ecumenical official , cardinal walter kasper .
mainz 's allgemeine zeitung said that " the path toward ecumenism - if it is desired - is based on respect from both sides .
a fair dialogue can not be achieved if one side asserts the claim of embodying the one , sole truth .
for those seeking commonalities on the basis of the christian message , these " answers " -lrb- from the pope -rrb- are just one more punch . "
mannheim 's mannheimer morgen noted that the pontiff was merely sticking to his principles in his comments .
" one may find the pope 's remarks outrageous , but benedict is actually just maintaining the stance he 's always had .
he has not transformed himself from a conservative into a liberal after taking up the papacy .
he has always deflected popular notions of belief .
by focusing on the leading role of the roman catholic church , he is keeping in line with the logic of the vatican .
for those who believe in ecumenism , the pope 's words were brusque .
on the other hand , they can be grateful to benedict : it is now clear that catholics and protestants will not forge closer ties during his papacy .
both sides know where they stand .
that is certainly better than an elusory hope that will never become reality , " the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict made a landmark visit to cologne 's synagoge in 2005 münster 's westfälische nachrichten took a pragmatic approach to benedict 's comments .
" texts in which the church is only concerned with itself , in which doctrines and interpretations shift only very slightly , provide material for a theologians ' circus , and for common rituals of critique .
but they completely miss the realities in which believers live .
believers want help in their daily lives , to deal with their jobs , their families , living with spouses of different faiths , in raising their children to be responsible christians .
marl 's recklinghäuser zeitung said that " people can disagree about how to approach ecumenism .
one can debate about whether different faiths should share sacraments .
but one should not belittle other people or willfully snub them .
during the second vatican council , the then young joseph ratzinger was one of the reformers of the catholic church in the midst of change .
as pope , the one-time " rebel " now wants to re-establish the latin mass and dig up things that should have long been laid to rest .
that 's sad , " the paper wrote . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

protestant leaders were offended and said inter-denominational dialogue was now at risk .
german commentators agreed . german commentators had a sharp eye on pope benedict xvi , himself a german , following the pontiff 's comments that other christian churches outside roman catholicism were " defective . "
benedict approved a document released tuesday from his old office , the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , which reiterated church teaching on catholic relations with other christians .
the 16-page document described christian orthodox churches as true churches , but said they suffered from a " wound " since they do not recognize the primacy of the pope .
however , the document also said that the " wound is still more profound " in protestant denominations .
" despite the fact that this teaching has created no little distress ... it is nevertheless difficult to see how the title of ' church ' could possibly be attributed to them , " the paper said .

with the current document , its authors said they sought to address " erroneous " interpretations and theological " misunderstandings " deriving from the adoption of the second vatican council of the 1960s .
the vatican said it wanted to again stress the issue because it said some catholic theologians continued to misunderstand it .
the document is the pontiff 's second strong reaffirmation of catholic tradition within a week , following a decree on saturday restoring the old latin mass alongside the modern liturgy .
the vatican document said dialogue with other christians remained " one of the priorities of the catholic church , " but it nonetheless prompted swift criticism from protestants , lutherans and other christian denominations spawned by the 16th century reformation .
" it makes us question the seriousness with which the roman catholic church takes its dialogues with the reformed family and other families of the church , " the world alliance of reformed churches said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestants not feeling warm and fuzzy about pontiff right now " it makes us question whether we are indeed praying together for christian unity , " the alliance wrote in a letter to the vatican 's key ecumenical official , cardinal walter kasper .
mainz 's allgemeine zeitung said that " the path toward ecumenism - if it is desired - is based on respect from both sides .
a fair dialogue can not be achieved if one side asserts the claim of embodying the one , sole truth .
for those seeking commonalities on the basis of the christian message , these " answers " -lrb- from the pope -rrb- are just one more punch . "
mannheim 's mannheimer morgen noted that the pontiff was merely sticking to his principles in his comments .
" one may find the pope 's remarks outrageous , but benedict is actually just maintaining the stance he 's always had .
he has not transformed himself from a conservative into a liberal after taking up the papacy .
he has always deflected popular notions of belief .
by focusing on the leading role of the roman catholic church , he is keeping in line with the logic of the vatican .
for those who believe in ecumenism , the pope 's words were brusque .
on the other hand , they can be grateful to benedict : it is now clear that catholics and protestants will not forge closer ties during his papacy .
both sides know where they stand .
that is certainly better than an elusory hope that will never become reality , " the paper wrote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 11.07.2007 german labels search for the real sound of america großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bobby womack rides the range for trikont for three decades , the german labels bear family records and trikont have rescued classic american music from obscurity .
from hillbilly to deep-fried southern funk , anything goes - as long as it 's got soul . munich 's trikont label is , by any standards , one of the world 's most eclectic .
recent releases span everything from us immigrant folk songs , mexican boleros and 1970s punk to depression-era yodellers and cajun swamp music . trikont 's compilation cds are put together by experts and collectors , but as label founder achim bergmann said , they 're aimed at a general contemporary audience . " we want to put things in a new light and show people where rock and popular music came from , " bergmann said .
" we want listeners to see themselves as part of a tradition . " trikont 's program is unusual but accessible .
the 2004 compilation " dirty laundry , " for instance , featured black musicians singing country songs .
forgotten recordings by soul legends james brown and bobby womack were represented , as were singles by unjustly neglected singers like bobby jonz and freddie north . " dirty laundry " proved a profitable hit , and a follow-up compilation will be released this fall , although profits are n't the main idea , according to bergmann . tuned in to afn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cajun music is one of trikont 's biggest sellers the trikont label evolved in 1971 out of the radical left-wing book publisher of the same name .
german volksmusik had been discredited by its association with the third reich , and the label 's search for the authentic sounds of everyday working people led it to what cultural critic greil marcus has called " the old , weird america " - the land of cowboys , hillbillies , bootleggers , drifters , sharecroppers and others who made music beyond the confines of commerce . ironically , the left-wingers at trikont were introduced to much of the music they came to cherish by the armed forces network , the radio station that serviced american soldiers in post-war germany and continues to broadcast to us troops around the world . " it was like a second liberation , " bergmann said .
" the music they played had changed a whole century .
it had an existential side that german music lacked .
also , the idea of quality and mass culture was unknown in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trikont 's motto speaks volumes meanwhile , trikont publishes material that 's largely unknown in the us itself .
" when we go to music trade fairs , americans are sometimes surprised , " said bergmann .
" they come up and say , ' what is this ?
this is something we do n't have . " ' " it 's like a kind of cultural anarchy with a critical eye toward capitalism , " said detlef diederichsen , a record critic and the musical director of berlin 's house of world cultures concert hall .
" they 're raiding the archives of big companies who ca n't deal with their own back catalogues . " down home , up north if trikont is about breadth , bear family records , located in a small village near the northern german city of bremen , is about depth .
since 1975 , the label has specialized in exhaustively researched , painstakingly produced compilations of mostly country and rockabilly artists . recent releases include sets by ricky nelson , jerry lee lewis and hank snow .
all were made from the original recording tapes and feature extensive booklets with previously unpublished photos and background information . bear family does a large portion of its business via international mail order , and it has won a number of awards from the german record critics association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he was n't marrying his underage cousins , jerry lee lewis made great music label founder richard weize said he spends weeks at a time in america , investigating archives , searching through recording-studio vaults , negotiating contracts for rights and trying to locate collectors . " without collectors , i 'd be dead and buried , " weize said .
" and luck also plays a role .
you do your research , contact people , but in the end it 's often accident . " one of such fortuitous discovery was a lost version of johnny cash singing " ring of fire " in spanish , which weize found after listening to an unmarked master tape in a california studio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child tv star ricky nelson has been given the bear family treatment trikont 's bergmann said the reason german labels have played such a large role in cultivating older american music was that , as foreigners , they had a keener eye for hidden gems .
weize , on the other hand , thinks the reasons are economic . " you have to be crazy to do this , " weize said .
" all our editions sell in the long term .
but you ca n't be primarily profit-oriented . " the future of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bear family boss richard weize has been combing the archives for 30 years does the rise of mp3s and downloaded music present a threat to labels like trikont and bear family ?
are they afraid their small market of passionate collectors and people who want to discover the uncanny sounds of yesteryear will dry up ? " i 'm not afraid , " said weize .
" the cd is dying , as are many of its customers .
you can be sad about that , but it 's a fact .
so there 's no reason to fear anything . " bergmann added that a change in format could have less of an impact on focused labels . " major label music today is mostly about selling ring tones , " bergmann said .
" but passion and respect for real music will remain , and there 'll be a mix of cds and other formats . " the secret to these two independent labels ' survival may be that they target a selective audience of music fanatics - and those who want to be like them . " when people have everything at the disposal of their computer , they need experts , " diederichsen said .
" they need to be guided by someone with a personal taste who explains and comments on the music . " and guiding listeners on sonic expeditions through the old , weird america is something both bear family and trikont have been doing for 30 years . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

from hillbilly to deep-fried southern funk , anything goes - as long as it 's got soul . munich 's trikont label is , by any standards , one of the world 's most eclectic .
recent releases span everything from us immigrant folk songs , mexican boleros and 1970s punk to depression-era yodellers and cajun swamp music . trikont 's compilation cds are put together by experts and collectors , but as label founder achim bergmann said , they 're aimed at a general contemporary audience . " we want to put things in a new light and show people where rock and popular music came from , " bergmann said .
" we want listeners to see themselves as part of a tradition . " trikont 's program is unusual but accessible .
the 2004 compilation " dirty laundry , " for instance , featured black musicians singing country songs .
forgotten recordings by soul legends james brown and bobby womack were represented , as were singles by unjustly neglected singers like bobby jonz and freddie north . " dirty laundry " proved a profitable hit , and a follow-up compilation will be released this fall , although profits are n't the main idea , according to bergmann . tuned in to afn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cajun music is one of trikont 's biggest sellers the trikont label evolved in 1971 out of the radical left-wing book publisher of the same name .
german volksmusik had been discredited by its association with the third reich , and the label 's search for the authentic sounds of everyday working people led it to what cultural critic greil marcus has called " the old , weird america " - the land of cowboys , hillbillies , bootleggers , drifters , sharecroppers and others who made music beyond the confines of commerce . ironically , the left-wingers at trikont were introduced to much of the music they came to cherish by the armed forces network , the radio station that serviced american soldiers in post-war germany and continues to broadcast to us troops around the world . " it was like a second liberation , " bergmann said .
" the music they played had changed a whole century .
it had an existential side that german music lacked .
also , the idea of quality and mass culture was unknown in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trikont 's motto speaks volumes meanwhile , trikont publishes material that 's largely unknown in the us itself .
" when we go to music trade fairs , americans are sometimes surprised , " said bergmann .
" they come up and say , ' what is this ?
this is something we do n't have . " ' " it 's like a kind of cultural anarchy with a critical eye toward capitalism , " said detlef diederichsen , a record critic and the musical director of berlin 's house of world cultures concert hall .
" they 're raiding the archives of big companies who ca n't deal with their own back catalogues . " down home , up north if trikont is about breadth , bear family records , located in a small village near the northern german city of bremen , is about depth .
since 1975 , the label has specialized in exhaustively researched , painstakingly produced compilations of mostly country and rockabilly artists . recent releases include sets by ricky nelson , jerry lee lewis and hank snow .
all were made from the original recording tapes and feature extensive booklets with previously unpublished photos and background information . bear family does a large portion of its business via international mail order , and it has won a number of awards from the german record critics association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he was n't marrying his underage cousins , jerry lee lewis made great music label founder richard weize said he spends weeks at a time in america , investigating archives , searching through recording-studio vaults , negotiating contracts for rights and trying to locate collectors . " without collectors , i 'd be dead and buried , " weize said .
" and luck also plays a role .
you do your research , contact people , but in the end it 's often accident . " one of such fortuitous discovery was a lost version of johnny cash singing " ring of fire " in spanish , which weize found after listening to an unmarked master tape in a california studio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child tv star ricky nelson has been given the bear family treatment trikont 's bergmann said the reason german labels have played such a large role in cultivating older american music was that , as foreigners , they had a keener eye for hidden gems .
weize , on the other hand , thinks the reasons are economic . " you have to be crazy to do this , " weize said .
" all our editions sell in the long term .
but you ca n't be primarily profit-oriented . " the future of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bear family boss richard weize has been combing the archives for 30 years does the rise of mp3s and downloaded music present a threat to labels like trikont and bear family ?
are they afraid their small market of passionate collectors and people who want to discover the uncanny sounds of yesteryear will dry up ? " i 'm not afraid , " said weize .
" the cd is dying , as are many of its customers .
you can be sad about that , but it 's a fact .
so there 's no reason to fear anything . " bergmann added that a change in format could have less of an impact on focused labels . " major label music today is mostly about selling ring tones , " bergmann said .
" but passion and respect for real music will remain , and there 'll be a mix of cds and other formats . " the secret to these two independent labels ' survival may be that they target a selective audience of music fanatics - and those who want to be like them . " when people have everything at the disposal of their computer , they need experts , " diederichsen said .
" they need to be guided by someone with a personal taste who explains and comments on the music . " and guiding listeners on sonic expeditions through the old , weird america is something both bear family and trikont have been doing for 30 years . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
eighty-six people from all aspects of german life were invited by chancellor angela merkel to discuss the problems of immigration in germany and specifically the problems associated with the integration of immigrants .
more than two-thirds of the participants were german politicians , representatives of federations and church leaders .
less than one third came from the demographic of those the meeting was set up to help .
of the immigrants who did attend , half were of turkish origin .
the turks , with 2.2 million people , are the biggest group among germany 's immigrants and approximately 20 percent of them have taken on german nationality .
in total about 7 million people of non-german origin live in germany .
a quarter of them come from eu countries and , due to the generosity of the eu , they experience few problems coming to and settling down in germany .
a third of germany 's immigrants have lived in the country for more than 20 years while about half have lived in the country for more than 10 years and nearly every fifth was born there .
the " guest workers " who came to stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " guest workers " began to arrive in the 1950s the first influx of immigrants began in the 1950s when germany began to enlist the help of " guest workers " from southern europe , followed by workers from turkey in the early 1960s .
they were all called " guest workers " because germany 's idea was that they would return to the native country some time in the future .
while many did this , others remained in germany and stopped being " guest workers " and instead became " immigrants . "
it soon became obvious that germany had not anticipated such a phenomenon and had little infrastructure and few laws in place to cope with the admission and integration needs of these people .
the turkish immigrants especially were concerned by the cultural and religious differences they saw in german society .
in later years , there was even greater concern , especially after sept .

six study groups were set up to deal with the most important factors : integration courses ; learning german ; education and vocational training ; as well as the situation regarding women ; local integration activities and integration activities to benefit civil society .
these study groups were expected to bring these factors together in the integration plan that is due to be discussed at the second summit on july 12 .
but while there had been much initial praise for the first summit , there has been growing criticism ahead of the second .
the german government 's handling of the immigration law has left many feeling deceived , with the the turkish federations feeling most discriminated against .
many immigrant organizations have said the government ignored them in the policy-making process , and the turks feel that many of the points in the law were targeting them specifically .
so while germany prepares for its second , laudable summit aimed at easing integration problems , those who it hopes to help are again marginalized and several turkish groups have already said that they will boycott the summit in protest .

"
eighty-six people from all aspects of german life were invited by chancellor angela merkel to discuss the problems of immigration in germany and specifically the problems associated with the integration of immigrants .
more than two-thirds of the participants were german politicians , representatives of federations and church leaders .
less than one third came from the demographic of those the meeting was set up to help .
of the immigrants who did attend , half were of turkish origin .
the turks , with 2.2 million people , are the biggest group among germany 's immigrants and approximately 20 percent of them have taken on german nationality .
in total about 7 million people of non-german origin live in germany .
a quarter of them come from eu countries and , due to the generosity of the eu , they experience few problems coming to and settling down in germany .
a third of germany 's immigrants have lived in the country for more than 20 years while about half have lived in the country for more than 10 years and nearly every fifth was born there .
the " guest workers " who came to stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " guest workers " began to arrive in the 1950s the first influx of immigrants began in the 1950s when germany began to enlist the help of " guest workers " from southern europe , followed by workers from turkey in the early 1960s .
they were all called " guest workers " because germany 's idea was that they would return to the native country some time in the future .
while many did this , others remained in germany and stopped being " guest workers " and instead became " immigrants . "
it soon became obvious that germany had not anticipated such a phenomenon and had little infrastructure and few laws in place to cope with the admission and integration needs of these people .
the turkish immigrants especially were concerned by the cultural and religious differences they saw in german society .
in later years , there was even greater concern , especially after sept .

six study groups were set up to deal with the most important factors : integration courses ; learning german ; education and vocational training ; as well as the situation regarding women ; local integration activities and integration activities to benefit civil society .
these study groups were expected to bring these factors together in the integration plan that is due to be discussed at the second summit on july 12 .
but while there had been much initial praise for the first summit , there has been growing criticism ahead of the second .
the german government 's handling of the immigration law has left many feeling deceived , with the the turkish federations feeling most discriminated against .

from hillbilly to deep-fried southern funk , anything goes - as long as it 's got soul . munich 's trikont label is , by any standards , one of the world 's most eclectic .
recent releases span everything from us immigrant folk songs , mexican boleros and 1970s punk to depression-era yodellers and cajun swamp music . trikont 's compilation cds are put together by experts and collectors , but as label founder achim bergmann said , they 're aimed at a general contemporary audience . " we want to put things in a new light and show people where rock and popular music came from , " bergmann said .
" we want listeners to see themselves as part of a tradition . " trikont 's program is unusual but accessible .
the 2004 compilation " dirty laundry , " for instance , featured black musicians singing country songs .
forgotten recordings by soul legends james brown and bobby womack were represented , as were singles by unjustly neglected singers like bobby jonz and freddie north . " dirty laundry " proved a profitable hit , and a follow-up compilation will be released this fall , although profits are n't the main idea , according to bergmann . tuned in to afn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cajun music is one of trikont 's biggest sellers the trikont label evolved in 1971 out of the radical left-wing book publisher of the same name .

from hillbilly to deep-fried southern funk , anything goes - as long as it 's got soul . munich 's trikont label is , by any standards , one of the world 's most eclectic .
recent releases span everything from us immigrant folk songs , mexican boleros and 1970s punk to depression-era yodellers and cajun swamp music . trikont 's compilation cds are put together by experts and collectors , but as label founder achim bergmann said , they 're aimed at a general contemporary audience .

" we want listeners to see themselves as part of a tradition . " trikont 's program is unusual but accessible .
the 2004 compilation " dirty laundry , " for instance , featured black musicians singing country songs .
forgotten recordings by soul legends james brown and bobby womack were represented , as were singles by unjustly neglected singers like bobby jonz and freddie north . " dirty laundry " proved a profitable hit , and a follow-up compilation will be released this fall , although profits are n't the main idea , according to bergmann . tuned in to afn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cajun music is one of trikont 's biggest sellers the trikont label evolved in 1971 out of the radical left-wing book publisher of the same name .

the ministry said such rooms were no longer necessary because threat scenarios had changed .

bkk spokeswoman ursula fuchs said the institute for federal real estate would take care of selling the government-owned bunkers .
shelters to be sold also include those located in subway stations in several major cities .
most of the protective structures were built during world war ii .
some of them were integrated into an " emergency program " developed during the korean war in the 1950s .

following the end of the cold war , programs for refurbishing bunkers and other projects for installing civilian shelters came to a halt in the 1990s .
some historians have said they hope at least some of the bunkers will be kept intact so future generations can visit the structures and see information material common when the bunkers were built , such as a poster of a man hiding behind a tree with his briefcase in front of his head .

dw-radio 's ramon garcia ziemsen comments on the controversy . he 's a famous actor , but his talent is average .
he will play a german resistance fighter .
nothing spectacular in itself .
however , this famous , albeit mediocre , actor is an active member of the church of scientology - a community whose belief system includes totalitarian structures and claims to world supremacy .
the resistance fighter is claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , who attempted to assassinate adolf hitler , and a man who went down in history books as a " symbol of the resistance . "
someone who embodied a " different germany " during its dark period .
he may , he may not tom cruise is to play von stauffenberg - it 's a story loaded with everything that can prompt a fierce debate in germany .
after all , it concerns both the jurisdiction of interpretation of one 's own history , as well as a group in which brainwashing supposedly takes place and one which the german domestic intelligence agency has categorized as undemocratic .
scientology is a group whose organization reminds some germans of their darkest hour in history .
tom cruise in the role of a german who tried to overcome totalitarian structures .
while some ask " is he allowed to do that ? " other newspapers are talking about a " new clash of cultures . "
everyone 's entitled to their own beliefs but that is the way things are in both real and alleged cultural clashes : there is no clear distinction between fact and opinion .
the debate strays .
everything gets mixed up .
of course cruise is " allowed " to play von stauffenberg , even if many consider him wrong for the role , which he probably is .
it 's understandable , for instance , that von stauffenberg 's eldest son considers cruise an imposition in the role .
but to forbid people from doing their job based on their beliefs ?
that 's unacceptable - even if it comes to pass what peter steinbach , director of the memorial of the german opposition , warned of : that the film could be perceived as a scientologists ' venture .
the global media industry will , like always , abbreviate .
the equation : an active and prestigious member of the church of scientology - an organization that recently opened up a major center in the middle of berlin and a member of the german resistance ; in other words , scientology equals resistance .
that is the way it will be conveyed .
that is abhorrent and dangerous .
but it is still no reason to forbid cruise from playing stauffenberg .
just a little quote from article 4 of the german constitution , or " basic law : " " freedom of faith and of conscience and freedom to profess religious or philosophical creed shall be inviolable . "
bendlerblock is a memorial site so cruise is allowed to play him , but there 's another , more important question : where he is permitted to play him .
the german authorities have banned tom cruise from filming at a few historical sites - at the place where stauffenberg attempted a coup d 'etat on july 20 , 1944 , and where he and other conspirators were executed on that same night .
" there is no better way of evoking the nazi era than be denying a man the possibility of doing his job because of his beliefs , " one american newspaper wrote .
there are many people in germany who are talking about possible damage to the country 's image due to the ban .
they also point to the fact that three years ago , people were allowed to shoot a film about stauffenberg at bendlerblock - precisely the location where cruise is not allowed to shoot .
if not sooner , this is the point at which things can get confusing : cruise was not prevented from filming there because he is a scientologist , but because the employees at the memorial have had bad experiences with elaborate film shoots there .
and because they have learned that this memorial , this place of mourning , simply can not be turned into a setting for a film .
any german film crew would have experienced exactly the same thing as the american crew .
it 's just that no one here would have got upset about it .
original locations not necessary the director of the memorial at the dachau concentration camp once said that memorials must not be misused ; their sanctity must not be violated .
he said commerce - and that 's what hollywood is , after all - had no business being there .
must a film be shot at an original location anyway ?
this is not a documentary film that demands the authenticity of an original location .
these settings can be built , such as in steven spielberg 's film " schindler 's list . "
many other such examples exist as well .
let 's be clear : cruise should play stauffenberg .
but not everywhere .
we have to be very precise about why cruise may not film at bendlerblock : because this would be like a desecration .
because it would be unbearable to again execute stauffenberg at the original location for a popcorn-eating audience .
that is the argument .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 11.07.2007 opinion : debate strays on cruise as hitler 's attempted assassin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood star and scientologist tom cruise is slated to play a character who attempted to assassinate adolf hitler , and germany has been up in arms .
dw-radio 's ramon garcia ziemsen comments on the controversy . he 's a famous actor , but his talent is average .
he will play a german resistance fighter .
nothing spectacular in itself .
however , this famous , albeit mediocre , actor is an active member of the church of scientology - a community whose belief system includes totalitarian structures and claims to world supremacy .
the resistance fighter is claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , who attempted to assassinate adolf hitler , and a man who went down in history books as a " symbol of the resistance . "
someone who embodied a " different germany " during its dark period .
he may , he may not tom cruise is to play von stauffenberg - it 's a story loaded with everything that can prompt a fierce debate in germany .
after all , it concerns both the jurisdiction of interpretation of one 's own history , as well as a group in which brainwashing supposedly takes place and one which the german domestic intelligence agency has categorized as undemocratic .
scientology is a group whose organization reminds some germans of their darkest hour in history .
tom cruise in the role of a german who tried to overcome totalitarian structures .
while some ask " is he allowed to do that ? " other newspapers are talking about a " new clash of cultures . "
everyone 's entitled to their own beliefs but that is the way things are in both real and alleged cultural clashes : there is no clear distinction between fact and opinion .
the debate strays .
everything gets mixed up .
of course cruise is " allowed " to play von stauffenberg , even if many consider him wrong for the role , which he probably is .
it 's understandable , for instance , that von stauffenberg 's eldest son considers cruise an imposition in the role .
but to forbid people from doing their job based on their beliefs ?
that 's unacceptable - even if it comes to pass what peter steinbach , director of the memorial of the german opposition , warned of : that the film could be perceived as a scientologists ' venture .
the global media industry will , like always , abbreviate .
the equation : an active and prestigious member of the church of scientology - an organization that recently opened up a major center in the middle of berlin and a member of the german resistance ; in other words , scientology equals resistance .
that is the way it will be conveyed .
that is abhorrent and dangerous .
but it is still no reason to forbid cruise from playing stauffenberg .
just a little quote from article 4 of the german constitution , or " basic law : " " freedom of faith and of conscience and freedom to profess religious or philosophical creed shall be inviolable . "
bendlerblock is a memorial site so cruise is allowed to play him , but there 's another , more important question : where he is permitted to play him .
the german authorities have banned tom cruise from filming at a few historical sites - at the place where stauffenberg attempted a coup d 'etat on july 20 , 1944 , and where he and other conspirators were executed on that same night .
" there is no better way of evoking the nazi era than be denying a man the possibility of doing his job because of his beliefs , " one american newspaper wrote .
there are many people in germany who are talking about possible damage to the country 's image due to the ban .
they also point to the fact that three years ago , people were allowed to shoot a film about stauffenberg at bendlerblock - precisely the location where cruise is not allowed to shoot .
if not sooner , this is the point at which things can get confusing : cruise was not prevented from filming there because he is a scientologist , but because the employees at the memorial have had bad experiences with elaborate film shoots there .
and because they have learned that this memorial , this place of mourning , simply can not be turned into a setting for a film .
any german film crew would have experienced exactly the same thing as the american crew .
it 's just that no one here would have got upset about it .
original locations not necessary the director of the memorial at the dachau concentration camp once said that memorials must not be misused ; their sanctity must not be violated .
he said commerce - and that 's what hollywood is , after all - had no business being there .
must a film be shot at an original location anyway ?
this is not a documentary film that demands the authenticity of an original location .
these settings can be built , such as in steven spielberg 's film " schindler 's list . "
many other such examples exist as well .
let 's be clear : cruise should play stauffenberg .
but not everywhere .
we have to be very precise about why cruise may not film at bendlerblock : because this would be like a desecration .

"
eighty-six people from all aspects of german life were invited by chancellor angela merkel to discuss the problems of immigration in germany and specifically the problems associated with the integration of immigrants .
more than two-thirds of the participants were german politicians , representatives of federations and church leaders .
less than one third came from the demographic of those the meeting was set up to help .
of the immigrants who did attend , half were of turkish origin .
the turks , with 2.2 million people , are the biggest group among germany 's immigrants and approximately 20 percent of them have taken on german nationality .
in total about 7 million people of non-german origin live in germany .
a quarter of them come from eu countries and , due to the generosity of the eu , they experience few problems coming to and settling down in germany .

they were all called " guest workers " because germany 's idea was that they would return to the native country some time in the future .
while many did this , others remained in germany and stopped being " guest workers " and instead became " immigrants . "
it soon became obvious that germany had not anticipated such a phenomenon and had little infrastructure and few laws in place to cope with the admission and integration needs of these people .

these study groups were expected to bring these factors together in the integration plan that is due to be discussed at the second summit on july 12 .
but while there had been much initial praise for the first summit , there has been growing criticism ahead of the second .
the german government 's handling of the immigration law has left many feeling deceived , with the the turkish federations feeling most discriminated against .

the ministry said such rooms were no longer necessary because threat scenarios had changed .
though the ministry made the decision in may , the bonn-based german federal office of civil protection and disaster assistance -lrb- bkk -rrb- only announced the move this week .
the bkk said the shelters would not offer sufficient protection in the face of terrorist attacks and added that only a portion of the german population would find space in the rooms . millions in maintenance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some said other uses could be found for the structures , like this bunker turned penthouse maintenance for the bunkers and shelters has cost the government 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.7 million -rrb- per year .
bkk spokeswoman ursula fuchs said the institute for federal real estate would take care of selling the government-owned bunkers .
shelters to be sold also include those located in subway stations in several major cities .
most of the protective structures were built during world war ii .
some of them were integrated into an " emergency program " developed during the korean war in the 1950s .
additional bunkers were refurbished and expanded in the 1960s during the cuban missile crisis when the cold war came closest to escalating into a nuclear war .
following the end of the cold war , programs for refurbishing bunkers and other projects for installing civilian shelters came to a halt in the 1990s .
some historians have said they hope at least some of the bunkers will be kept intact so future generations can visit the structures and see information material common when the bunkers were built , such as a poster of a man hiding behind a tree with his briefcase in front of his head .
the poster 's headline read , " you 're better protected this way ! "
this year a bunker near bonn , the former capital of west germany , that would have housed west german government officials in the case of nuclear attack will be opened as a museum documenting the cold war . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ministry said such rooms were no longer necessary because threat scenarios had changed .
though the ministry made the decision in may , the bonn-based german federal office of civil protection and disaster assistance -lrb- bkk -rrb- only announced the move this week .

shelters to be sold also include those located in subway stations in several major cities .
most of the protective structures were built during world war ii .

however , it believes that new competitors would probably try to distinguish themselves from existing state-controlled post offices with lower costs and special services . eu financial services commissioner charlie mccreevy earlier defended the plans for a full market opening by 2009 .
as the bloc 's top internal market official , he said the industry would suffer if the market is not fully liberalized within the original timetable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post workers faces new competition in 2008 " our proposal is based on sound preparation .
it is not ... based on ideological zeal , " he said .
" experience with market opening to date has been overwhelmingly positive . " communication revolution mccreevy warned the european parliament that postal services around europe which fail to alter their business practices will lose out when new forms of communication , such as electronic mail , become even more widespread . " it is common knowledge that a communications revolution is taking place , " he said .
" it poses a threat for those postal operators that fail to adapt . "
mccreevy 's plans for liberalization by 2009 had gained support from the european commission , and eu members such as germany and britain , agreed that it would lead to a more reliable and better quality service driven by foreign competition in their postal markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some private mail delivery companies are already in action in germany the german national postal system , deutsche post , was already slated to give up its monopoly in 2008 . however , it fears a disadvantage if other countries are permitted to maintain their monopolies longer . bulgaria , estonia , finland , sweden and the uk have currently opened their postal markets up completely . the european parliament wants to cushion the disadvantage for deutsche post and other countries which have already deregulated their markets .
eu lawmakers said postal services in france and other countries who maintain their monopolies should not be granted access to the already liberalized markets . france and luxembourg , as well as other states , pushed for the delay , saying they need more time to prepare . the eu began efforts to liberalize the market back in 1997 and first entertained mccreevy 's 2009 plan in 2002 . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- als / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

from hillbilly to deep-fried southern funk , anything goes - as long as it 's got soul . munich 's trikont label is , by any standards , one of the world 's most eclectic .
recent releases span everything from us immigrant folk songs , mexican boleros and 1970s punk to depression-era yodellers and cajun swamp music . trikont 's compilation cds are put together by experts and collectors , but as label founder achim bergmann said , they 're aimed at a general contemporary audience . " we want to put things in a new light and show people where rock and popular music came from , " bergmann said .
" we want listeners to see themselves as part of a tradition . " trikont 's program is unusual but accessible .
the 2004 compilation " dirty laundry , " for instance , featured black musicians singing country songs .
forgotten recordings by soul legends james brown and bobby womack were represented , as were singles by unjustly neglected singers like bobby jonz and freddie north . " dirty laundry " proved a profitable hit , and a follow-up compilation will be released this fall , although profits are n't the main idea , according to bergmann . tuned in to afn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cajun music is one of trikont 's biggest sellers the trikont label evolved in 1971 out of the radical left-wing book publisher of the same name .
german volksmusik had been discredited by its association with the third reich , and the label 's search for the authentic sounds of everyday working people led it to what cultural critic greil marcus has called " the old , weird america " - the land of cowboys , hillbillies , bootleggers , drifters , sharecroppers and others who made music beyond the confines of commerce . ironically , the left-wingers at trikont were introduced to much of the music they came to cherish by the armed forces network , the radio station that serviced american soldiers in post-war germany and continues to broadcast to us troops around the world . " it was like a second liberation , " bergmann said .
" the music they played had changed a whole century .
it had an existential side that german music lacked .
also , the idea of quality and mass culture was unknown in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trikont 's motto speaks volumes meanwhile , trikont publishes material that 's largely unknown in the us itself .
" when we go to music trade fairs , americans are sometimes surprised , " said bergmann .
" they come up and say , ' what is this ?
this is something we do n't have . " ' " it 's like a kind of cultural anarchy with a critical eye toward capitalism , " said detlef diederichsen , a record critic and the musical director of berlin 's house of world cultures concert hall .
" they 're raiding the archives of big companies who ca n't deal with their own back catalogues . " down home , up north if trikont is about breadth , bear family records , located in a small village near the northern german city of bremen , is about depth .
since 1975 , the label has specialized in exhaustively researched , painstakingly produced compilations of mostly country and rockabilly artists . recent releases include sets by ricky nelson , jerry lee lewis and hank snow .
all were made from the original recording tapes and feature extensive booklets with previously unpublished photos and background information . bear family does a large portion of its business via international mail order , and it has won a number of awards from the german record critics association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he was n't marrying his underage cousins , jerry lee lewis made great music label founder richard weize said he spends weeks at a time in america , investigating archives , searching through recording-studio vaults , negotiating contracts for rights and trying to locate collectors . " without collectors , i 'd be dead and buried , " weize said .
" and luck also plays a role .
you do your research , contact people , but in the end it 's often accident . " one of such fortuitous discovery was a lost version of johnny cash singing " ring of fire " in spanish , which weize found after listening to an unmarked master tape in a california studio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child tv star ricky nelson has been given the bear family treatment trikont 's bergmann said the reason german labels have played such a large role in cultivating older american music was that , as foreigners , they had a keener eye for hidden gems .
weize , on the other hand , thinks the reasons are economic . " you have to be crazy to do this , " weize said .
" all our editions sell in the long term .
but you ca n't be primarily profit-oriented . " the future of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bear family boss richard weize has been combing the archives for 30 years does the rise of mp3s and downloaded music present a threat to labels like trikont and bear family ?
are they afraid their small market of passionate collectors and people who want to discover the uncanny sounds of yesteryear will dry up ? " i 'm not afraid , " said weize .
" the cd is dying , as are many of its customers .
you can be sad about that , but it 's a fact .
so there 's no reason to fear anything . " bergmann added that a change in format could have less of an impact on focused labels . " major label music today is mostly about selling ring tones , " bergmann said .
" but passion and respect for real music will remain , and there 'll be a mix of cds and other formats . " the secret to these two independent labels ' survival may be that they target a selective audience of music fanatics - and those who want to be like them . " when people have everything at the disposal of their computer , they need experts , " diederichsen said .
" they need to be guided by someone with a personal taste who explains and comments on the music . " and guiding listeners on sonic expeditions through the old , weird america is something both bear family and trikont have been doing for 30 years . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , it believes that new competitors would probably try to distinguish themselves from existing state-controlled post offices with lower costs and special services . eu financial services commissioner charlie mccreevy earlier defended the plans for a full market opening by 2009 .
as the bloc 's top internal market official , he said the industry would suffer if the market is not fully liberalized within the original timetable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post workers faces new competition in 2008 " our proposal is based on sound preparation .
it is not ... based on ideological zeal , " he said .
" experience with market opening to date has been overwhelmingly positive . " communication revolution mccreevy warned the european parliament that postal services around europe which fail to alter their business practices will lose out when new forms of communication , such as electronic mail , become even more widespread . " it is common knowledge that a communications revolution is taking place , " he said .
" it poses a threat for those postal operators that fail to adapt . "
mccreevy 's plans for liberalization by 2009 had gained support from the european commission , and eu members such as germany and britain , agreed that it would lead to a more reliable and better quality service driven by foreign competition in their postal markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some private mail delivery companies are already in action in germany the german national postal system , deutsche post , was already slated to give up its monopoly in 2008 . however , it fears a disadvantage if other countries are permitted to maintain their monopolies longer . bulgaria , estonia , finland , sweden and the uk have currently opened their postal markets up completely . the european parliament wants to cushion the disadvantage for deutsche post and other countries which have already deregulated their markets .
eu lawmakers said postal services in france and other countries who maintain their monopolies should not be granted access to the already liberalized markets . france and luxembourg , as well as other states , pushed for the delay , saying they need more time to prepare . the eu began efforts to liberalize the market back in 1997 and first entertained mccreevy 's 2009 plan in 2002 . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- als / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
eighty-six people from all aspects of german life were invited by chancellor angela merkel to discuss the problems of immigration in germany and specifically the problems associated with the integration of immigrants .
more than two-thirds of the participants were german politicians , representatives of federations and church leaders .
less than one third came from the demographic of those the meeting was set up to help .
of the immigrants who did attend , half were of turkish origin .
the turks , with 2.2 million people , are the biggest group among germany 's immigrants and approximately 20 percent of them have taken on german nationality .
in total about 7 million people of non-german origin live in germany .
a quarter of them come from eu countries and , due to the generosity of the eu , they experience few problems coming to and settling down in germany .
a third of germany 's immigrants have lived in the country for more than 20 years while about half have lived in the country for more than 10 years and nearly every fifth was born there .
the " guest workers " who came to stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " guest workers " began to arrive in the 1950s the first influx of immigrants began in the 1950s when germany began to enlist the help of " guest workers " from southern europe , followed by workers from turkey in the early 1960s .
they were all called " guest workers " because germany 's idea was that they would return to the native country some time in the future .
while many did this , others remained in germany and stopped being " guest workers " and instead became " immigrants . "
it soon became obvious that germany had not anticipated such a phenomenon and had little infrastructure and few laws in place to cope with the admission and integration needs of these people .
the turkish immigrants especially were concerned by the cultural and religious differences they saw in german society .
in later years , there was even greater concern , especially after sept .
11 , 2001 when an upsurge in mistrust of islam and muslims followed the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
study groups charged with compiling integration plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel meeting the delegates at the 2006 summit bearing in mind the difficulties allaying all parties , the first german " integration summit " in 2006 attempted to solve the problems together .
six study groups were set up to deal with the most important factors : integration courses ; learning german ; education and vocational training ; as well as the situation regarding women ; local integration activities and integration activities to benefit civil society .
these study groups were expected to bring these factors together in the integration plan that is due to be discussed at the second summit on july 12 .
but while there had been much initial praise for the first summit , there has been growing criticism ahead of the second .
the german government 's handling of the immigration law has left many feeling deceived , with the the turkish federations feeling most discriminated against .
many immigrant organizations have said the government ignored them in the policy-making process , and the turks feel that many of the points in the law were targeting them specifically .
so while germany prepares for its second , laudable summit aimed at easing integration problems , those who it hopes to help are again marginalized and several turkish groups have already said that they will boycott the summit in protest .
how many immigrant representatives show up at the 2007 summit remains to be seen . peter philipp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , it believes that new competitors would probably try to distinguish themselves from existing state-controlled post offices with lower costs and special services . eu financial services commissioner charlie mccreevy earlier defended the plans for a full market opening by 2009 .
as the bloc 's top internal market official , he said the industry would suffer if the market is not fully liberalized within the original timetable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post workers faces new competition in 2008 " our proposal is based on sound preparation .
it is not ... based on ideological zeal , " he said .
" experience with market opening to date has been overwhelmingly positive . " communication revolution mccreevy warned the european parliament that postal services around europe which fail to alter their business practices will lose out when new forms of communication , such as electronic mail , become even more widespread . " it is common knowledge that a communications revolution is taking place , " he said .
" it poses a threat for those postal operators that fail to adapt . "
mccreevy 's plans for liberalization by 2009 had gained support from the european commission , and eu members such as germany and britain , agreed that it would lead to a more reliable and better quality service driven by foreign competition in their postal markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some private mail delivery companies are already in action in germany the german national postal system , deutsche post , was already slated to give up its monopoly in 2008 . however , it fears a disadvantage if other countries are permitted to maintain their monopolies longer . bulgaria , estonia , finland , sweden and the uk have currently opened their postal markets up completely . the european parliament wants to cushion the disadvantage for deutsche post and other countries which have already deregulated their markets .
eu lawmakers said postal services in france and other countries who maintain their monopolies should not be granted access to the already liberalized markets . france and luxembourg , as well as other states , pushed for the delay , saying they need more time to prepare . the eu began efforts to liberalize the market back in 1997 and first entertained mccreevy 's 2009 plan in 2002 . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- als / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for german authors , cracking the us book market is a hard task .
so when children 's book writer rotraut susanne berner got a call from a us publisher , she was happy - until she heard what would have to be changed . german children 's book author rotraut susanne berner was delighted when her latest worldwide success story , the newest of her " wimmelbücher " series , was courted by a publisher in the notoriously fickle us book market .
however , after celebrating the fact that a german book had been noticed by the normally indifferent american publishing industry , berner 's happiness turned to consternation when she discovered just how fickle the industry could be .
of course , said publishers , boyds mills press , there would be some cultural differences that would have to be addressed and possibly changed , which berner herself was happy to consider .
the publishers suggested that the inclusion of some smokers in the brightly colored illustrations would not be suitable for us children , and berner agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magnifying glass not included but when the publishers began suggesting censorship of naked artworks in the background of a museum scene , the german author could n't believe what she was hearing .
" it was a sensation to start with , " said berner of her amazement at attracting us interest , in an interview with the german der spiegel news magazine .
but when the suggestions for edits and exclusions started to flood in over the nude paintings and sculpture , she thought it was a joke .

hardly .
apart from a tasteful nude reclining in a slightly blurred watercolor in the background , the main offending artifact was a tiny male statue and its microscopic penis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this 50 million euro artwork from the 16th century obscene ?
on the page , the sculpture stands at a very unthreatening seven millimeters tall and the appendage could , at first glance , be dismissed as a wayward brushstroke .
the " little willy " as berner called it " was barely half a millimeter in length . "
the sculpture is an aside in the overall museum scene and is in no way prominent to the storyline on that page , she added .
yet , the censors spotted it and wanted it out .
it seemed that the whole micro-penis affair is " highly embarrassing " to the publishing company , according to berner , which fears a backlash from angry parents if the book is published with the tiny organ still in place .
author pulls plug over censorship while berner admitted that she could have lived with the offending artworks being covered by a black box or bar in the book , the author and graphic arts designer said that she could not agree to a complete reworking of the page and the omission of the artifacts .
instead , she pulled the plug on the us deal .
the contract would have been a sweet one , but berner need not worry .
her books are sold all over the world and she has racked up best-sellers in 13 countries from japan to the faroe islands .
no one , other than the americans , has complained about the nudity , she said .
and so , the munich-based author continues her successful career with her principles intact and the innocence of the children of the united states spared .

" russia is an important destination for our customers , " mayrhuber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa is more than five times larger than airunion carrying 4.9 million passengers last year , airunion is russia 's second-biggest airline after aeroflot , which carried 8.75 million people , and was formed following a merger of five regional airlines including krasair , domodedovo airlines , omskavia , samara and sibaviatrans .
lufthansa had in recent years attempted to reach a cooperation arrangement with aeroflot , but other international contracts kept a deal from being reached as lufthansa is a leading member of the star alliance group while aeroflot signed on with the sky team , led by air france .
lufthansa also announced tuesday that its global traffic figures had hit a record level in the first half of 2007 of about 27 million passengers .

for german authors , cracking the us book market is a hard task .
so when children 's book writer rotraut susanne berner got a call from a us publisher , she was happy - until she heard what would have to be changed . german children 's book author rotraut susanne berner was delighted when her latest worldwide success story , the newest of her " wimmelbücher " series , was courted by a publisher in the notoriously fickle us book market .
however , after celebrating the fact that a german book had been noticed by the normally indifferent american publishing industry , berner 's happiness turned to consternation when she discovered just how fickle the industry could be .
of course , said publishers , boyds mills press , there would be some cultural differences that would have to be addressed and possibly changed , which berner herself was happy to consider .
the publishers suggested that the inclusion of some smokers in the brightly colored illustrations would not be suitable for us children , and berner agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magnifying glass not included but when the publishers began suggesting censorship of naked artworks in the background of a museum scene , the german author could n't believe what she was hearing .
" it was a sensation to start with , " said berner of her amazement at attracting us interest , in an interview with the german der spiegel news magazine .
but when the suggestions for edits and exclusions started to flood in over the nude paintings and sculpture , she thought it was a joke .

the " little willy " as berner called it " was barely half a millimeter in length . "
the sculpture is an aside in the overall museum scene and is in no way prominent to the storyline on that page , she added .
yet , the censors spotted it and wanted it out .
it seemed that the whole micro-penis affair is " highly embarrassing " to the publishing company , according to berner , which fears a backlash from angry parents if the book is published with the tiny organ still in place .
author pulls plug over censorship while berner admitted that she could have lived with the offending artworks being covered by a black box or bar in the book , the author and graphic arts designer said that she could not agree to a complete reworking of the page and the omission of the artifacts .
instead , she pulled the plug on the us deal .

protestant leaders were offended and said inter-denominational dialogue was now at risk .
german commentators agreed . german commentators had a sharp eye on pope benedict xvi , himself a german , following the pontiff 's comments that other christian churches outside roman catholicism were " defective . "
benedict approved a document released tuesday from his old office , the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , which reiterated church teaching on catholic relations with other christians .
the 16-page document described christian orthodox churches as true churches , but said they suffered from a " wound " since they do not recognize the primacy of the pope .
however , the document also said that the " wound is still more profound " in protestant denominations .
" despite the fact that this teaching has created no little distress ... it is nevertheless difficult to see how the title of ' church ' could possibly be attributed to them , " the paper said .
not new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope said the catholic church is " true " the vatican text reiterates the controversial document " dominus iesus , " which the pope - at that time cardinal joseph ratzinger - issued in 2000 .
with the current document , its authors said they sought to address " erroneous " interpretations and theological " misunderstandings " deriving from the adoption of the second vatican council of the 1960s .
the vatican said it wanted to again stress the issue because it said some catholic theologians continued to misunderstand it .
the document is the pontiff 's second strong reaffirmation of catholic tradition within a week , following a decree on saturday restoring the old latin mass alongside the modern liturgy .
the vatican document said dialogue with other christians remained " one of the priorities of the catholic church , " but it nonetheless prompted swift criticism from protestants , lutherans and other christian denominations spawned by the 16th century reformation .
" it makes us question the seriousness with which the roman catholic church takes its dialogues with the reformed family and other families of the church , " the world alliance of reformed churches said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestants not feeling warm and fuzzy about pontiff right now " it makes us question whether we are indeed praying together for christian unity , " the alliance wrote in a letter to the vatican 's key ecumenical official , cardinal walter kasper .
mainz 's allgemeine zeitung said that " the path toward ecumenism - if it is desired - is based on respect from both sides .
a fair dialogue can not be achieved if one side asserts the claim of embodying the one , sole truth .
for those seeking commonalities on the basis of the christian message , these " answers " -lrb- from the pope -rrb- are just one more punch . "
mannheim 's mannheimer morgen noted that the pontiff was merely sticking to his principles in his comments .
" one may find the pope 's remarks outrageous , but benedict is actually just maintaining the stance he 's always had .
he has not transformed himself from a conservative into a liberal after taking up the papacy .
he has always deflected popular notions of belief .
by focusing on the leading role of the roman catholic church , he is keeping in line with the logic of the vatican .
for those who believe in ecumenism , the pope 's words were brusque .
on the other hand , they can be grateful to benedict : it is now clear that catholics and protestants will not forge closer ties during his papacy .
both sides know where they stand .
that is certainly better than an elusory hope that will never become reality , " the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict made a landmark visit to cologne 's synagoge in 2005 münster 's westfälische nachrichten took a pragmatic approach to benedict 's comments .
" texts in which the church is only concerned with itself , in which doctrines and interpretations shift only very slightly , provide material for a theologians ' circus , and for common rituals of critique .
but they completely miss the realities in which believers live .
believers want help in their daily lives , to deal with their jobs , their families , living with spouses of different faiths , in raising their children to be responsible christians .
marl 's recklinghäuser zeitung said that " people can disagree about how to approach ecumenism .
one can debate about whether different faiths should share sacraments .
but one should not belittle other people or willfully snub them .
during the second vatican council , the then young joseph ratzinger was one of the reformers of the catholic church in the midst of change .
as pope , the one-time " rebel " now wants to re-establish the latin mass and dig up things that should have long been laid to rest .
that 's sad , " the paper wrote . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 11.07.2007 opinion : debate strays on cruise as hitler 's attempted assassin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood star and scientologist tom cruise is slated to play a character who attempted to assassinate adolf hitler , and germany has been up in arms .
dw-radio 's ramon garcia ziemsen comments on the controversy . he 's a famous actor , but his talent is average .
he will play a german resistance fighter .
nothing spectacular in itself .
however , this famous , albeit mediocre , actor is an active member of the church of scientology - a community whose belief system includes totalitarian structures and claims to world supremacy .
the resistance fighter is claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , who attempted to assassinate adolf hitler , and a man who went down in history books as a " symbol of the resistance . "
someone who embodied a " different germany " during its dark period .
he may , he may not tom cruise is to play von stauffenberg - it 's a story loaded with everything that can prompt a fierce debate in germany .
after all , it concerns both the jurisdiction of interpretation of one 's own history , as well as a group in which brainwashing supposedly takes place and one which the german domestic intelligence agency has categorized as undemocratic .
scientology is a group whose organization reminds some germans of their darkest hour in history .
tom cruise in the role of a german who tried to overcome totalitarian structures .
while some ask " is he allowed to do that ? " other newspapers are talking about a " new clash of cultures . "
everyone 's entitled to their own beliefs but that is the way things are in both real and alleged cultural clashes : there is no clear distinction between fact and opinion .
the debate strays .
everything gets mixed up .
of course cruise is " allowed " to play von stauffenberg , even if many consider him wrong for the role , which he probably is .
it 's understandable , for instance , that von stauffenberg 's eldest son considers cruise an imposition in the role .
but to forbid people from doing their job based on their beliefs ?
that 's unacceptable - even if it comes to pass what peter steinbach , director of the memorial of the german opposition , warned of : that the film could be perceived as a scientologists ' venture .
the global media industry will , like always , abbreviate .
the equation : an active and prestigious member of the church of scientology - an organization that recently opened up a major center in the middle of berlin and a member of the german resistance ; in other words , scientology equals resistance .
that is the way it will be conveyed .
that is abhorrent and dangerous .
but it is still no reason to forbid cruise from playing stauffenberg .
just a little quote from article 4 of the german constitution , or " basic law : " " freedom of faith and of conscience and freedom to profess religious or philosophical creed shall be inviolable . "
bendlerblock is a memorial site so cruise is allowed to play him , but there 's another , more important question : where he is permitted to play him .
the german authorities have banned tom cruise from filming at a few historical sites - at the place where stauffenberg attempted a coup d 'etat on july 20 , 1944 , and where he and other conspirators were executed on that same night .
" there is no better way of evoking the nazi era than be denying a man the possibility of doing his job because of his beliefs , " one american newspaper wrote .
there are many people in germany who are talking about possible damage to the country 's image due to the ban .
they also point to the fact that three years ago , people were allowed to shoot a film about stauffenberg at bendlerblock - precisely the location where cruise is not allowed to shoot .
if not sooner , this is the point at which things can get confusing : cruise was not prevented from filming there because he is a scientologist , but because the employees at the memorial have had bad experiences with elaborate film shoots there .
and because they have learned that this memorial , this place of mourning , simply can not be turned into a setting for a film .
any german film crew would have experienced exactly the same thing as the american crew .
it 's just that no one here would have got upset about it .
original locations not necessary the director of the memorial at the dachau concentration camp once said that memorials must not be misused ; their sanctity must not be violated .
he said commerce - and that 's what hollywood is , after all - had no business being there .
must a film be shot at an original location anyway ?
this is not a documentary film that demands the authenticity of an original location .
these settings can be built , such as in steven spielberg 's film " schindler 's list . "
many other such examples exist as well .
let 's be clear : cruise should play stauffenberg .
but not everywhere .
we have to be very precise about why cruise may not film at bendlerblock : because this would be like a desecration .
because it would be unbearable to again execute stauffenberg at the original location for a popcorn-eating audience .
that is the argument .
and not that cruise is a member of an unbearable denomination . ramon garcia ziemsen works in dw-radio 's culture department -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-radio 's ramon garcia ziemsen comments on the controversy . he 's a famous actor , but his talent is average .
he will play a german resistance fighter .
nothing spectacular in itself .
however , this famous , albeit mediocre , actor is an active member of the church of scientology - a community whose belief system includes totalitarian structures and claims to world supremacy .
the resistance fighter is claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , who attempted to assassinate adolf hitler , and a man who went down in history books as a " symbol of the resistance . "
someone who embodied a " different germany " during its dark period .
he may , he may not tom cruise is to play von stauffenberg - it 's a story loaded with everything that can prompt a fierce debate in germany .
after all , it concerns both the jurisdiction of interpretation of one 's own history , as well as a group in which brainwashing supposedly takes place and one which the german domestic intelligence agency has categorized as undemocratic .
scientology is a group whose organization reminds some germans of their darkest hour in history .
tom cruise in the role of a german who tried to overcome totalitarian structures .
while some ask " is he allowed to do that ? " other newspapers are talking about a " new clash of cultures . "
everyone 's entitled to their own beliefs but that is the way things are in both real and alleged cultural clashes : there is no clear distinction between fact and opinion .
the debate strays .
everything gets mixed up .
of course cruise is " allowed " to play von stauffenberg , even if many consider him wrong for the role , which he probably is .
it 's understandable , for instance , that von stauffenberg 's eldest son considers cruise an imposition in the role .
but to forbid people from doing their job based on their beliefs ?
that 's unacceptable - even if it comes to pass what peter steinbach , director of the memorial of the german opposition , warned of : that the film could be perceived as a scientologists ' venture .
the global media industry will , like always , abbreviate .
the equation : an active and prestigious member of the church of scientology - an organization that recently opened up a major center in the middle of berlin and a member of the german resistance ; in other words , scientology equals resistance .
that is the way it will be conveyed .
that is abhorrent and dangerous .
but it is still no reason to forbid cruise from playing stauffenberg .
just a little quote from article 4 of the german constitution , or " basic law : " " freedom of faith and of conscience and freedom to profess religious or philosophical creed shall be inviolable . "
bendlerblock is a memorial site so cruise is allowed to play him , but there 's another , more important question : where he is permitted to play him .
the german authorities have banned tom cruise from filming at a few historical sites - at the place where stauffenberg attempted a coup d 'etat on july 20 , 1944 , and where he and other conspirators were executed on that same night .
" there is no better way of evoking the nazi era than be denying a man the possibility of doing his job because of his beliefs , " one american newspaper wrote .
there are many people in germany who are talking about possible damage to the country 's image due to the ban .
they also point to the fact that three years ago , people were allowed to shoot a film about stauffenberg at bendlerblock - precisely the location where cruise is not allowed to shoot .
if not sooner , this is the point at which things can get confusing : cruise was not prevented from filming there because he is a scientologist , but because the employees at the memorial have had bad experiences with elaborate film shoots there .
and because they have learned that this memorial , this place of mourning , simply can not be turned into a setting for a film .
any german film crew would have experienced exactly the same thing as the american crew .
it 's just that no one here would have got upset about it .
original locations not necessary the director of the memorial at the dachau concentration camp once said that memorials must not be misused ; their sanctity must not be violated .
he said commerce - and that 's what hollywood is , after all - had no business being there .
must a film be shot at an original location anyway ?
this is not a documentary film that demands the authenticity of an original location .
these settings can be built , such as in steven spielberg 's film " schindler 's list . "
many other such examples exist as well .
let 's be clear : cruise should play stauffenberg .
but not everywhere .
we have to be very precise about why cruise may not film at bendlerblock : because this would be like a desecration .
because it would be unbearable to again execute stauffenberg at the original location for a popcorn-eating audience .
that is the argument .
and not that cruise is a member of an unbearable denomination . ramon garcia ziemsen works in dw-radio 's culture department -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 11.07.2007 press review : pope 's comments on catholic " primacy " grate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has stirred controversay before the vatican said tuesday that christian communities outside roman catholicism were not full churches .
protestant leaders were offended and said inter-denominational dialogue was now at risk .
german commentators agreed . german commentators had a sharp eye on pope benedict xvi , himself a german , following the pontiff 's comments that other christian churches outside roman catholicism were " defective . "
benedict approved a document released tuesday from his old office , the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , which reiterated church teaching on catholic relations with other christians .
the 16-page document described christian orthodox churches as true churches , but said they suffered from a " wound " since they do not recognize the primacy of the pope .
however , the document also said that the " wound is still more profound " in protestant denominations .
" despite the fact that this teaching has created no little distress ... it is nevertheless difficult to see how the title of ' church ' could possibly be attributed to them , " the paper said .
not new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope said the catholic church is " true " the vatican text reiterates the controversial document " dominus iesus , " which the pope - at that time cardinal joseph ratzinger - issued in 2000 .
with the current document , its authors said they sought to address " erroneous " interpretations and theological " misunderstandings " deriving from the adoption of the second vatican council of the 1960s .
the vatican said it wanted to again stress the issue because it said some catholic theologians continued to misunderstand it .
the document is the pontiff 's second strong reaffirmation of catholic tradition within a week , following a decree on saturday restoring the old latin mass alongside the modern liturgy .
the vatican document said dialogue with other christians remained " one of the priorities of the catholic church , " but it nonetheless prompted swift criticism from protestants , lutherans and other christian denominations spawned by the 16th century reformation .
" it makes us question the seriousness with which the roman catholic church takes its dialogues with the reformed family and other families of the church , " the world alliance of reformed churches said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestants not feeling warm and fuzzy about pontiff right now " it makes us question whether we are indeed praying together for christian unity , " the alliance wrote in a letter to the vatican 's key ecumenical official , cardinal walter kasper .
mainz 's allgemeine zeitung said that " the path toward ecumenism - if it is desired - is based on respect from both sides .
a fair dialogue can not be achieved if one side asserts the claim of embodying the one , sole truth .
for those seeking commonalities on the basis of the christian message , these " answers " -lrb- from the pope -rrb- are just one more punch . "
mannheim 's mannheimer morgen noted that the pontiff was merely sticking to his principles in his comments .
" one may find the pope 's remarks outrageous , but benedict is actually just maintaining the stance he 's always had .
he has not transformed himself from a conservative into a liberal after taking up the papacy .
he has always deflected popular notions of belief .
by focusing on the leading role of the roman catholic church , he is keeping in line with the logic of the vatican .
for those who believe in ecumenism , the pope 's words were brusque .
on the other hand , they can be grateful to benedict : it is now clear that catholics and protestants will not forge closer ties during his papacy .
both sides know where they stand .
that is certainly better than an elusory hope that will never become reality , " the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict made a landmark visit to cologne 's synagoge in 2005 münster 's westfälische nachrichten took a pragmatic approach to benedict 's comments .
" texts in which the church is only concerned with itself , in which doctrines and interpretations shift only very slightly , provide material for a theologians ' circus , and for common rituals of critique .
but they completely miss the realities in which believers live .
believers want help in their daily lives , to deal with their jobs , their families , living with spouses of different faiths , in raising their children to be responsible christians .
marl 's recklinghäuser zeitung said that " people can disagree about how to approach ecumenism .
one can debate about whether different faiths should share sacraments .
but one should not belittle other people or willfully snub them .
during the second vatican council , the then young joseph ratzinger was one of the reformers of the catholic church in the midst of change .
as pope , the one-time " rebel " now wants to re-establish the latin mass and dig up things that should have long been laid to rest .
that 's sad , " the paper wrote . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but berlin says the meeting will go ahead . a summit meant to ease the lives of germany 's estimated 15 million immigrants hit a major hurdle when four turkish groups representing a chunk of the foreign population threatened to withdraw from talks this week with chancellor angela merkel 's government .
the groups , who were part of the first such integration summit held last year , say they feel hurt and discriminated against by the government 's recent changes to a 2005 immigration law which tightens restrictions on foreign spouses joining their non-german partners in germany .
they also say in the spirit of integration the government should have consulted them before making the changes .
the groups are now demanding that the government either revoke the changes to the law or else they will boycott the meeting .
" we 've concluded that it does n't make any sense to participate in the summit because the german government has n't understood the seriousness of our concerns and apparently does n't want to talk about making possible changes to the immigration law , " kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg -lrb- tgb -rrb- , told the online version of der spiegel on the eve of the summit .
helga and horst , but not ahmed and aische ?
in addition to raising the minimum age for foreign spouses to 18 , germany wants them in future to learn basic german before they enter the country .
the aim is to combat forced marriages believed to be widespread among germany 's turkish community .
turks make up the largest group among the country 's 6.7 million foreigners .
but turkish groups are irked that the regulation only applies to non-germans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government says the new law is meant to combat forced marriages " if helga and horst are allowed to get their partners here why not ahmed and aische too ? "
kolat said .
speaking at a press conference , kolat added the law amounted to " ethnic discrimination " and applied " double standards . "
kolat also raised doubts about the law 's effectiveness in fighting forced marriages .
he pointed out that the number of brides being imported from turkey had fallen in recent years .
those who do come in , kolat said , tended to be better educated .
" we too believe that every forced marriage is one too much and should be severely punished , " he said .
" but the law is no means to counter forced marriages . "
government says summit will go ahead the integration summit on thursday is one of a number of measures drawn up by chancellor angela merkel 's government to reach out to its large immigrant population amid mounting concerns in europe about radicalization and home-grown terrorism . german media regularly reports about the poor school performance of children from immigrant families , conflicts over the wearing of the islamic headscarf and the building of so-called parallel societies in large cities .
the summit , which brings together representatives from the government , migrant groups and independent experts , plans to introduce a weighty " national integration plan " which analyzes the problems of immigrants and includes some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to promote the integration of foreigners .
the plan is a result of a year 's work by the various groups that are part of the integration summit .
german politicians say the threatened boycott by the turkish groups should not be allowed to disrupt the work achieved so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer says the groups threatening the boycott are hurting the 2.5 million turks in germany " the summit will take place in any case and there will be no empty chairs , " said maria böhmer , federal commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" you do n't solve problems by staying away , but only when you speak to each other . "
a " self-boycott by the organizations " will not help the 2.5 million turks in germany , böhmer added .
" dream of multiculturalism has failed " the rift between the turkish groups and politicians ahead of the summit also reflects a tougher attitude in germany towards immigrants after decades of politicians refusing to accept its status as an immigrant country .

but berlin says the meeting will go ahead . a summit meant to ease the lives of germany 's estimated 15 million immigrants hit a major hurdle when four turkish groups representing a chunk of the foreign population threatened to withdraw from talks this week with chancellor angela merkel 's government .
the groups , who were part of the first such integration summit held last year , say they feel hurt and discriminated against by the government 's recent changes to a 2005 immigration law which tightens restrictions on foreign spouses joining their non-german partners in germany .
they also say in the spirit of integration the government should have consulted them before making the changes .
the groups are now demanding that the government either revoke the changes to the law or else they will boycott the meeting .
" we 've concluded that it does n't make any sense to participate in the summit because the german government has n't understood the seriousness of our concerns and apparently does n't want to talk about making possible changes to the immigration law , " kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg -lrb- tgb -rrb- , told the online version of der spiegel on the eve of the summit .
helga and horst , but not ahmed and aische ?
in addition to raising the minimum age for foreign spouses to 18 , germany wants them in future to learn basic german before they enter the country .
the aim is to combat forced marriages believed to be widespread among germany 's turkish community .
turks make up the largest group among the country 's 6.7 million foreigners .
but turkish groups are irked that the regulation only applies to non-germans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government says the new law is meant to combat forced marriages " if helga and horst are allowed to get their partners here why not ahmed and aische too ? "
kolat said .
speaking at a press conference , kolat added the law amounted to " ethnic discrimination " and applied " double standards . "
kolat also raised doubts about the law 's effectiveness in fighting forced marriages .
he pointed out that the number of brides being imported from turkey had fallen in recent years .
those who do come in , kolat said , tended to be better educated .
" we too believe that every forced marriage is one too much and should be severely punished , " he said .
" but the law is no means to counter forced marriages . "
government says summit will go ahead the integration summit on thursday is one of a number of measures drawn up by chancellor angela merkel 's government to reach out to its large immigrant population amid mounting concerns in europe about radicalization and home-grown terrorism . german media regularly reports about the poor school performance of children from immigrant families , conflicts over the wearing of the islamic headscarf and the building of so-called parallel societies in large cities .
the summit , which brings together representatives from the government , migrant groups and independent experts , plans to introduce a weighty " national integration plan " which analyzes the problems of immigrants and includes some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to promote the integration of foreigners .
the plan is a result of a year 's work by the various groups that are part of the integration summit .
german politicians say the threatened boycott by the turkish groups should not be allowed to disrupt the work achieved so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer says the groups threatening the boycott are hurting the 2.5 million turks in germany " the summit will take place in any case and there will be no empty chairs , " said maria böhmer , federal commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" you do n't solve problems by staying away , but only when you speak to each other . "
a " self-boycott by the organizations " will not help the 2.5 million turks in germany , böhmer added .
" dream of multiculturalism has failed " the rift between the turkish groups and politicians ahead of the summit also reflects a tougher attitude in germany towards immigrants after decades of politicians refusing to accept its status as an immigrant country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 11.07.2007 press review : pope 's comments on catholic " primacy " grate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has stirred controversay before the vatican said tuesday that christian communities outside roman catholicism were not full churches .
protestant leaders were offended and said inter-denominational dialogue was now at risk .
german commentators agreed . german commentators had a sharp eye on pope benedict xvi , himself a german , following the pontiff 's comments that other christian churches outside roman catholicism were " defective . "
benedict approved a document released tuesday from his old office , the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , which reiterated church teaching on catholic relations with other christians .
the 16-page document described christian orthodox churches as true churches , but said they suffered from a " wound " since they do not recognize the primacy of the pope .
however , the document also said that the " wound is still more profound " in protestant denominations .
" despite the fact that this teaching has created no little distress ... it is nevertheless difficult to see how the title of ' church ' could possibly be attributed to them , " the paper said .
not new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope said the catholic church is " true " the vatican text reiterates the controversial document " dominus iesus , " which the pope - at that time cardinal joseph ratzinger - issued in 2000 .
with the current document , its authors said they sought to address " erroneous " interpretations and theological " misunderstandings " deriving from the adoption of the second vatican council of the 1960s .
the vatican said it wanted to again stress the issue because it said some catholic theologians continued to misunderstand it .
the document is the pontiff 's second strong reaffirmation of catholic tradition within a week , following a decree on saturday restoring the old latin mass alongside the modern liturgy .
the vatican document said dialogue with other christians remained " one of the priorities of the catholic church , " but it nonetheless prompted swift criticism from protestants , lutherans and other christian denominations spawned by the 16th century reformation .
" it makes us question the seriousness with which the roman catholic church takes its dialogues with the reformed family and other families of the church , " the world alliance of reformed churches said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestants not feeling warm and fuzzy about pontiff right now " it makes us question whether we are indeed praying together for christian unity , " the alliance wrote in a letter to the vatican 's key ecumenical official , cardinal walter kasper .
mainz 's allgemeine zeitung said that " the path toward ecumenism - if it is desired - is based on respect from both sides .
a fair dialogue can not be achieved if one side asserts the claim of embodying the one , sole truth .
for those seeking commonalities on the basis of the christian message , these " answers " -lrb- from the pope -rrb- are just one more punch . "
mannheim 's mannheimer morgen noted that the pontiff was merely sticking to his principles in his comments .
" one may find the pope 's remarks outrageous , but benedict is actually just maintaining the stance he 's always had .
he has not transformed himself from a conservative into a liberal after taking up the papacy .
he has always deflected popular notions of belief .
by focusing on the leading role of the roman catholic church , he is keeping in line with the logic of the vatican .
for those who believe in ecumenism , the pope 's words were brusque .
on the other hand , they can be grateful to benedict : it is now clear that catholics and protestants will not forge closer ties during his papacy .
both sides know where they stand .
that is certainly better than an elusory hope that will never become reality , " the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict made a landmark visit to cologne 's synagoge in 2005 münster 's westfälische nachrichten took a pragmatic approach to benedict 's comments .
" texts in which the church is only concerned with itself , in which doctrines and interpretations shift only very slightly , provide material for a theologians ' circus , and for common rituals of critique .
but they completely miss the realities in which believers live .
believers want help in their daily lives , to deal with their jobs , their families , living with spouses of different faiths , in raising their children to be responsible christians .
marl 's recklinghäuser zeitung said that " people can disagree about how to approach ecumenism .
one can debate about whether different faiths should share sacraments .
but one should not belittle other people or willfully snub them .
during the second vatican council , the then young joseph ratzinger was one of the reformers of the catholic church in the midst of change .
as pope , the one-time " rebel " now wants to re-establish the latin mass and dig up things that should have long been laid to rest .
that 's sad , " the paper wrote . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for german authors , cracking the us book market is a hard task .
so when children 's book writer rotraut susanne berner got a call from a us publisher , she was happy - until she heard what would have to be changed . german children 's book author rotraut susanne berner was delighted when her latest worldwide success story , the newest of her " wimmelbücher " series , was courted by a publisher in the notoriously fickle us book market .
however , after celebrating the fact that a german book had been noticed by the normally indifferent american publishing industry , berner 's happiness turned to consternation when she discovered just how fickle the industry could be .
of course , said publishers , boyds mills press , there would be some cultural differences that would have to be addressed and possibly changed , which berner herself was happy to consider .
the publishers suggested that the inclusion of some smokers in the brightly colored illustrations would not be suitable for us children , and berner agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magnifying glass not included but when the publishers began suggesting censorship of naked artworks in the background of a museum scene , the german author could n't believe what she was hearing .
" it was a sensation to start with , " said berner of her amazement at attracting us interest , in an interview with the german der spiegel news magazine .
but when the suggestions for edits and exclusions started to flood in over the nude paintings and sculpture , she thought it was a joke .
teenie weenie causes problems what could possibly have got the suits at boyds mills so hot under the overly starched collar ?
a painting depicting a gratuitous roman orgy being viewed by wide-eyed 5-year olds ?
a massive bronze phallus gawped at by an awestruck group of pre-teens ?
hardly .
apart from a tasteful nude reclining in a slightly blurred watercolor in the background , the main offending artifact was a tiny male statue and its microscopic penis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this 50 million euro artwork from the 16th century obscene ?
on the page , the sculpture stands at a very unthreatening seven millimeters tall and the appendage could , at first glance , be dismissed as a wayward brushstroke .
the " little willy " as berner called it " was barely half a millimeter in length . "
the sculpture is an aside in the overall museum scene and is in no way prominent to the storyline on that page , she added .
yet , the censors spotted it and wanted it out .
it seemed that the whole micro-penis affair is " highly embarrassing " to the publishing company , according to berner , which fears a backlash from angry parents if the book is published with the tiny organ still in place .
author pulls plug over censorship while berner admitted that she could have lived with the offending artworks being covered by a black box or bar in the book , the author and graphic arts designer said that she could not agree to a complete reworking of the page and the omission of the artifacts .
instead , she pulled the plug on the us deal .
the contract would have been a sweet one , but berner need not worry .
her books are sold all over the world and she has racked up best-sellers in 13 countries from japan to the faroe islands .
no one , other than the americans , has complained about the nudity , she said .
and so , the munich-based author continues her successful career with her principles intact and the innocence of the children of the united states spared .
at least until the next class trip to a museum . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-radio 's ramon garcia ziemsen comments on the controversy . he 's a famous actor , but his talent is average .
he will play a german resistance fighter .
nothing spectacular in itself .
however , this famous , albeit mediocre , actor is an active member of the church of scientology - a community whose belief system includes totalitarian structures and claims to world supremacy .
the resistance fighter is claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , who attempted to assassinate adolf hitler , and a man who went down in history books as a " symbol of the resistance . "
someone who embodied a " different germany " during its dark period .
he may , he may not tom cruise is to play von stauffenberg - it 's a story loaded with everything that can prompt a fierce debate in germany .
after all , it concerns both the jurisdiction of interpretation of one 's own history , as well as a group in which brainwashing supposedly takes place and one which the german domestic intelligence agency has categorized as undemocratic .
scientology is a group whose organization reminds some germans of their darkest hour in history .
tom cruise in the role of a german who tried to overcome totalitarian structures .
while some ask " is he allowed to do that ? " other newspapers are talking about a " new clash of cultures . "
everyone 's entitled to their own beliefs but that is the way things are in both real and alleged cultural clashes : there is no clear distinction between fact and opinion .
the debate strays .
everything gets mixed up .
of course cruise is " allowed " to play von stauffenberg , even if many consider him wrong for the role , which he probably is .
it 's understandable , for instance , that von stauffenberg 's eldest son considers cruise an imposition in the role .
but to forbid people from doing their job based on their beliefs ?
that 's unacceptable - even if it comes to pass what peter steinbach , director of the memorial of the german opposition , warned of : that the film could be perceived as a scientologists ' venture .
the global media industry will , like always , abbreviate .
the equation : an active and prestigious member of the church of scientology - an organization that recently opened up a major center in the middle of berlin and a member of the german resistance ; in other words , scientology equals resistance .
that is the way it will be conveyed .
that is abhorrent and dangerous .
but it is still no reason to forbid cruise from playing stauffenberg .
just a little quote from article 4 of the german constitution , or " basic law : " " freedom of faith and of conscience and freedom to profess religious or philosophical creed shall be inviolable . "
bendlerblock is a memorial site so cruise is allowed to play him , but there 's another , more important question : where he is permitted to play him .
the german authorities have banned tom cruise from filming at a few historical sites - at the place where stauffenberg attempted a coup d 'etat on july 20 , 1944 , and where he and other conspirators were executed on that same night .
" there is no better way of evoking the nazi era than be denying a man the possibility of doing his job because of his beliefs , " one american newspaper wrote .
there are many people in germany who are talking about possible damage to the country 's image due to the ban .
they also point to the fact that three years ago , people were allowed to shoot a film about stauffenberg at bendlerblock - precisely the location where cruise is not allowed to shoot .
if not sooner , this is the point at which things can get confusing : cruise was not prevented from filming there because he is a scientologist , but because the employees at the memorial have had bad experiences with elaborate film shoots there .
and because they have learned that this memorial , this place of mourning , simply can not be turned into a setting for a film .
any german film crew would have experienced exactly the same thing as the american crew .
it 's just that no one here would have got upset about it .
original locations not necessary the director of the memorial at the dachau concentration camp once said that memorials must not be misused ; their sanctity must not be violated .
he said commerce - and that 's what hollywood is , after all - had no business being there .
must a film be shot at an original location anyway ?
this is not a documentary film that demands the authenticity of an original location .
these settings can be built , such as in steven spielberg 's film " schindler 's list . "
many other such examples exist as well .
let 's be clear : cruise should play stauffenberg .
but not everywhere .
we have to be very precise about why cruise may not film at bendlerblock : because this would be like a desecration .
because it would be unbearable to again execute stauffenberg at the original location for a popcorn-eating audience .

protestant leaders were offended and said inter-denominational dialogue was now at risk .
german commentators agreed . german commentators had a sharp eye on pope benedict xvi , himself a german , following the pontiff 's comments that other christian churches outside roman catholicism were " defective . "
benedict approved a document released tuesday from his old office , the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , which reiterated church teaching on catholic relations with other christians .
the 16-page document described christian orthodox churches as true churches , but said they suffered from a " wound " since they do not recognize the primacy of the pope .
however , the document also said that the " wound is still more profound " in protestant denominations .
" despite the fact that this teaching has created no little distress ... it is nevertheless difficult to see how the title of ' church ' could possibly be attributed to them , " the paper said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 11.07.2007 opinion : debate strays on cruise as hitler 's attempted assassin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood star and scientologist tom cruise is slated to play a character who attempted to assassinate adolf hitler , and germany has been up in arms .
dw-radio 's ramon garcia ziemsen comments on the controversy . he 's a famous actor , but his talent is average .
he will play a german resistance fighter .
nothing spectacular in itself .
however , this famous , albeit mediocre , actor is an active member of the church of scientology - a community whose belief system includes totalitarian structures and claims to world supremacy .
the resistance fighter is claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , who attempted to assassinate adolf hitler , and a man who went down in history books as a " symbol of the resistance . "
someone who embodied a " different germany " during its dark period .
he may , he may not tom cruise is to play von stauffenberg - it 's a story loaded with everything that can prompt a fierce debate in germany .
after all , it concerns both the jurisdiction of interpretation of one 's own history , as well as a group in which brainwashing supposedly takes place and one which the german domestic intelligence agency has categorized as undemocratic .
scientology is a group whose organization reminds some germans of their darkest hour in history .
tom cruise in the role of a german who tried to overcome totalitarian structures .
while some ask " is he allowed to do that ? " other newspapers are talking about a " new clash of cultures . "
everyone 's entitled to their own beliefs but that is the way things are in both real and alleged cultural clashes : there is no clear distinction between fact and opinion .
the debate strays .
everything gets mixed up .
of course cruise is " allowed " to play von stauffenberg , even if many consider him wrong for the role , which he probably is .
it 's understandable , for instance , that von stauffenberg 's eldest son considers cruise an imposition in the role .
but to forbid people from doing their job based on their beliefs ?
that 's unacceptable - even if it comes to pass what peter steinbach , director of the memorial of the german opposition , warned of : that the film could be perceived as a scientologists ' venture .
the global media industry will , like always , abbreviate .
the equation : an active and prestigious member of the church of scientology - an organization that recently opened up a major center in the middle of berlin and a member of the german resistance ; in other words , scientology equals resistance .
that is the way it will be conveyed .
that is abhorrent and dangerous .
but it is still no reason to forbid cruise from playing stauffenberg .
just a little quote from article 4 of the german constitution , or " basic law : " " freedom of faith and of conscience and freedom to profess religious or philosophical creed shall be inviolable . "
bendlerblock is a memorial site so cruise is allowed to play him , but there 's another , more important question : where he is permitted to play him .
the german authorities have banned tom cruise from filming at a few historical sites - at the place where stauffenberg attempted a coup d 'etat on july 20 , 1944 , and where he and other conspirators were executed on that same night .

the debate strays .
everything gets mixed up .
of course cruise is " allowed " to play von stauffenberg , even if many consider him wrong for the role , which he probably is .
it 's understandable , for instance , that von stauffenberg 's eldest son considers cruise an imposition in the role .
but to forbid people from doing their job based on their beliefs ?

for german authors , cracking the us book market is a hard task .
so when children 's book writer rotraut susanne berner got a call from a us publisher , she was happy - until she heard what would have to be changed . german children 's book author rotraut susanne berner was delighted when her latest worldwide success story , the newest of her " wimmelbücher " series , was courted by a publisher in the notoriously fickle us book market .
however , after celebrating the fact that a german book had been noticed by the normally indifferent american publishing industry , berner 's happiness turned to consternation when she discovered just how fickle the industry could be .
of course , said publishers , boyds mills press , there would be some cultural differences that would have to be addressed and possibly changed , which berner herself was happy to consider .
the publishers suggested that the inclusion of some smokers in the brightly colored illustrations would not be suitable for us children , and berner agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magnifying glass not included but when the publishers began suggesting censorship of naked artworks in the background of a museum scene , the german author could n't believe what she was hearing .
" it was a sensation to start with , " said berner of her amazement at attracting us interest , in an interview with the german der spiegel news magazine .
but when the suggestions for edits and exclusions started to flood in over the nude paintings and sculpture , she thought it was a joke .
teenie weenie causes problems what could possibly have got the suits at boyds mills so hot under the overly starched collar ?
a painting depicting a gratuitous roman orgy being viewed by wide-eyed 5-year olds ?
a massive bronze phallus gawped at by an awestruck group of pre-teens ?
hardly .
apart from a tasteful nude reclining in a slightly blurred watercolor in the background , the main offending artifact was a tiny male statue and its microscopic penis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this 50 million euro artwork from the 16th century obscene ?
on the page , the sculpture stands at a very unthreatening seven millimeters tall and the appendage could , at first glance , be dismissed as a wayward brushstroke .
the " little willy " as berner called it " was barely half a millimeter in length . "
the sculpture is an aside in the overall museum scene and is in no way prominent to the storyline on that page , she added .
yet , the censors spotted it and wanted it out .
it seemed that the whole micro-penis affair is " highly embarrassing " to the publishing company , according to berner , which fears a backlash from angry parents if the book is published with the tiny organ still in place .
author pulls plug over censorship while berner admitted that she could have lived with the offending artworks being covered by a black box or bar in the book , the author and graphic arts designer said that she could not agree to a complete reworking of the page and the omission of the artifacts .
instead , she pulled the plug on the us deal .
the contract would have been a sweet one , but berner need not worry .
her books are sold all over the world and she has racked up best-sellers in 13 countries from japan to the faroe islands .
no one , other than the americans , has complained about the nudity , she said .
and so , the munich-based author continues her successful career with her principles intact and the innocence of the children of the united states spared .
at least until the next class trip to a museum . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
eighty-six people from all aspects of german life were invited by chancellor angela merkel to discuss the problems of immigration in germany and specifically the problems associated with the integration of immigrants .
more than two-thirds of the participants were german politicians , representatives of federations and church leaders .
less than one third came from the demographic of those the meeting was set up to help .
of the immigrants who did attend , half were of turkish origin .
the turks , with 2.2 million people , are the biggest group among germany 's immigrants and approximately 20 percent of them have taken on german nationality .
in total about 7 million people of non-german origin live in germany .
a quarter of them come from eu countries and , due to the generosity of the eu , they experience few problems coming to and settling down in germany .
a third of germany 's immigrants have lived in the country for more than 20 years while about half have lived in the country for more than 10 years and nearly every fifth was born there .
the " guest workers " who came to stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " guest workers " began to arrive in the 1950s the first influx of immigrants began in the 1950s when germany began to enlist the help of " guest workers " from southern europe , followed by workers from turkey in the early 1960s .
they were all called " guest workers " because germany 's idea was that they would return to the native country some time in the future .
while many did this , others remained in germany and stopped being " guest workers " and instead became " immigrants . "
it soon became obvious that germany had not anticipated such a phenomenon and had little infrastructure and few laws in place to cope with the admission and integration needs of these people .
the turkish immigrants especially were concerned by the cultural and religious differences they saw in german society .
in later years , there was even greater concern , especially after sept .
11 , 2001 when an upsurge in mistrust of islam and muslims followed the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
study groups charged with compiling integration plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel meeting the delegates at the 2006 summit bearing in mind the difficulties allaying all parties , the first german " integration summit " in 2006 attempted to solve the problems together .
six study groups were set up to deal with the most important factors : integration courses ; learning german ; education and vocational training ; as well as the situation regarding women ; local integration activities and integration activities to benefit civil society .
these study groups were expected to bring these factors together in the integration plan that is due to be discussed at the second summit on july 12 .
but while there had been much initial praise for the first summit , there has been growing criticism ahead of the second .
the german government 's handling of the immigration law has left many feeling deceived , with the the turkish federations feeling most discriminated against .
many immigrant organizations have said the government ignored them in the policy-making process , and the turks feel that many of the points in the law were targeting them specifically .
so while germany prepares for its second , laudable summit aimed at easing integration problems , those who it hopes to help are again marginalized and several turkish groups have already said that they will boycott the summit in protest .

eighty-six people from all aspects of german life were invited by chancellor angela merkel to discuss the problems of immigration in germany and specifically the problems associated with the integration of immigrants .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 11.07.2007 opinion : debate strays on cruise as hitler 's attempted assassin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood star and scientologist tom cruise is slated to play a character who attempted to assassinate adolf hitler , and germany has been up in arms .
dw-radio 's ramon garcia ziemsen comments on the controversy . he 's a famous actor , but his talent is average .
he will play a german resistance fighter .
nothing spectacular in itself .
however , this famous , albeit mediocre , actor is an active member of the church of scientology - a community whose belief system includes totalitarian structures and claims to world supremacy .
the resistance fighter is claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , who attempted to assassinate adolf hitler , and a man who went down in history books as a " symbol of the resistance . "
someone who embodied a " different germany " during its dark period .
he may , he may not tom cruise is to play von stauffenberg - it 's a story loaded with everything that can prompt a fierce debate in germany .
after all , it concerns both the jurisdiction of interpretation of one 's own history , as well as a group in which brainwashing supposedly takes place and one which the german domestic intelligence agency has categorized as undemocratic .
scientology is a group whose organization reminds some germans of their darkest hour in history .
tom cruise in the role of a german who tried to overcome totalitarian structures .
while some ask " is he allowed to do that ? " other newspapers are talking about a " new clash of cultures . "
everyone 's entitled to their own beliefs but that is the way things are in both real and alleged cultural clashes : there is no clear distinction between fact and opinion .
the debate strays .
everything gets mixed up .
of course cruise is " allowed " to play von stauffenberg , even if many consider him wrong for the role , which he probably is .
it 's understandable , for instance , that von stauffenberg 's eldest son considers cruise an imposition in the role .
but to forbid people from doing their job based on their beliefs ?
that 's unacceptable - even if it comes to pass what peter steinbach , director of the memorial of the german opposition , warned of : that the film could be perceived as a scientologists ' venture .
the global media industry will , like always , abbreviate .
the equation : an active and prestigious member of the church of scientology - an organization that recently opened up a major center in the middle of berlin and a member of the german resistance ; in other words , scientology equals resistance .
that is the way it will be conveyed .
that is abhorrent and dangerous .
but it is still no reason to forbid cruise from playing stauffenberg .
just a little quote from article 4 of the german constitution , or " basic law : " " freedom of faith and of conscience and freedom to profess religious or philosophical creed shall be inviolable . "
bendlerblock is a memorial site so cruise is allowed to play him , but there 's another , more important question : where he is permitted to play him .
the german authorities have banned tom cruise from filming at a few historical sites - at the place where stauffenberg attempted a coup d 'etat on july 20 , 1944 , and where he and other conspirators were executed on that same night .
" there is no better way of evoking the nazi era than be denying a man the possibility of doing his job because of his beliefs , " one american newspaper wrote .
there are many people in germany who are talking about possible damage to the country 's image due to the ban .
they also point to the fact that three years ago , people were allowed to shoot a film about stauffenberg at bendlerblock - precisely the location where cruise is not allowed to shoot .
if not sooner , this is the point at which things can get confusing : cruise was not prevented from filming there because he is a scientologist , but because the employees at the memorial have had bad experiences with elaborate film shoots there .
and because they have learned that this memorial , this place of mourning , simply can not be turned into a setting for a film .
any german film crew would have experienced exactly the same thing as the american crew .
it 's just that no one here would have got upset about it .
original locations not necessary the director of the memorial at the dachau concentration camp once said that memorials must not be misused ; their sanctity must not be violated .
he said commerce - and that 's what hollywood is , after all - had no business being there .
must a film be shot at an original location anyway ?
this is not a documentary film that demands the authenticity of an original location .
these settings can be built , such as in steven spielberg 's film " schindler 's list . "
many other such examples exist as well .
let 's be clear : cruise should play stauffenberg .
but not everywhere .
we have to be very precise about why cruise may not film at bendlerblock : because this would be like a desecration .
because it would be unbearable to again execute stauffenberg at the original location for a popcorn-eating audience .
that is the argument .
and not that cruise is a member of an unbearable denomination . ramon garcia ziemsen works in dw-radio 's culture department -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for german authors , cracking the us book market is a hard task .
so when children 's book writer rotraut susanne berner got a call from a us publisher , she was happy - until she heard what would have to be changed . german children 's book author rotraut susanne berner was delighted when her latest worldwide success story , the newest of her " wimmelbücher " series , was courted by a publisher in the notoriously fickle us book market .
however , after celebrating the fact that a german book had been noticed by the normally indifferent american publishing industry , berner 's happiness turned to consternation when she discovered just how fickle the industry could be .
of course , said publishers , boyds mills press , there would be some cultural differences that would have to be addressed and possibly changed , which berner herself was happy to consider .
the publishers suggested that the inclusion of some smokers in the brightly colored illustrations would not be suitable for us children , and berner agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magnifying glass not included but when the publishers began suggesting censorship of naked artworks in the background of a museum scene , the german author could n't believe what she was hearing .
" it was a sensation to start with , " said berner of her amazement at attracting us interest , in an interview with the german der spiegel news magazine .
but when the suggestions for edits and exclusions started to flood in over the nude paintings and sculpture , she thought it was a joke .
teenie weenie causes problems what could possibly have got the suits at boyds mills so hot under the overly starched collar ?
a painting depicting a gratuitous roman orgy being viewed by wide-eyed 5-year olds ?
a massive bronze phallus gawped at by an awestruck group of pre-teens ?
hardly .
apart from a tasteful nude reclining in a slightly blurred watercolor in the background , the main offending artifact was a tiny male statue and its microscopic penis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this 50 million euro artwork from the 16th century obscene ?
on the page , the sculpture stands at a very unthreatening seven millimeters tall and the appendage could , at first glance , be dismissed as a wayward brushstroke .
the " little willy " as berner called it " was barely half a millimeter in length . "
the sculpture is an aside in the overall museum scene and is in no way prominent to the storyline on that page , she added .
yet , the censors spotted it and wanted it out .
it seemed that the whole micro-penis affair is " highly embarrassing " to the publishing company , according to berner , which fears a backlash from angry parents if the book is published with the tiny organ still in place .
author pulls plug over censorship while berner admitted that she could have lived with the offending artworks being covered by a black box or bar in the book , the author and graphic arts designer said that she could not agree to a complete reworking of the page and the omission of the artifacts .
instead , she pulled the plug on the us deal .
the contract would have been a sweet one , but berner need not worry .
her books are sold all over the world and she has racked up best-sellers in 13 countries from japan to the faroe islands .
no one , other than the americans , has complained about the nudity , she said .
and so , the munich-based author continues her successful career with her principles intact and the innocence of the children of the united states spared .

for german authors , cracking the us book market is a hard task .
so when children 's book writer rotraut susanne berner got a call from a us publisher , she was happy - until she heard what would have to be changed . german children 's book author rotraut susanne berner was delighted when her latest worldwide success story , the newest of her " wimmelbücher " series , was courted by a publisher in the notoriously fickle us book market .
however , after celebrating the fact that a german book had been noticed by the normally indifferent american publishing industry , berner 's happiness turned to consternation when she discovered just how fickle the industry could be .
of course , said publishers , boyds mills press , there would be some cultural differences that would have to be addressed and possibly changed , which berner herself was happy to consider .
the publishers suggested that the inclusion of some smokers in the brightly colored illustrations would not be suitable for us children , and berner agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magnifying glass not included but when the publishers began suggesting censorship of naked artworks in the background of a museum scene , the german author could n't believe what she was hearing .
" it was a sensation to start with , " said berner of her amazement at attracting us interest , in an interview with the german der spiegel news magazine .
but when the suggestions for edits and exclusions started to flood in over the nude paintings and sculpture , she thought it was a joke .
teenie weenie causes problems what could possibly have got the suits at boyds mills so hot under the overly starched collar ?
a painting depicting a gratuitous roman orgy being viewed by wide-eyed 5-year olds ?
a massive bronze phallus gawped at by an awestruck group of pre-teens ?
hardly .
apart from a tasteful nude reclining in a slightly blurred watercolor in the background , the main offending artifact was a tiny male statue and its microscopic penis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this 50 million euro artwork from the 16th century obscene ?
on the page , the sculpture stands at a very unthreatening seven millimeters tall and the appendage could , at first glance , be dismissed as a wayward brushstroke .
the " little willy " as berner called it " was barely half a millimeter in length . "
the sculpture is an aside in the overall museum scene and is in no way prominent to the storyline on that page , she added .
yet , the censors spotted it and wanted it out .
it seemed that the whole micro-penis affair is " highly embarrassing " to the publishing company , according to berner , which fears a backlash from angry parents if the book is published with the tiny organ still in place .
author pulls plug over censorship while berner admitted that she could have lived with the offending artworks being covered by a black box or bar in the book , the author and graphic arts designer said that she could not agree to a complete reworking of the page and the omission of the artifacts .
instead , she pulled the plug on the us deal .
the contract would have been a sweet one , but berner need not worry .
her books are sold all over the world and she has racked up best-sellers in 13 countries from japan to the faroe islands .
no one , other than the americans , has complained about the nudity , she said .
and so , the munich-based author continues her successful career with her principles intact and the innocence of the children of the united states spared .
at least until the next class trip to a museum . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but berlin says the meeting will go ahead . a summit meant to ease the lives of germany 's estimated 15 million immigrants hit a major hurdle when four turkish groups representing a chunk of the foreign population threatened to withdraw from talks this week with chancellor angela merkel 's government .
the groups , who were part of the first such integration summit held last year , say they feel hurt and discriminated against by the government 's recent changes to a 2005 immigration law which tightens restrictions on foreign spouses joining their non-german partners in germany .
they also say in the spirit of integration the government should have consulted them before making the changes .
the groups are now demanding that the government either revoke the changes to the law or else they will boycott the meeting .
" we 've concluded that it does n't make any sense to participate in the summit because the german government has n't understood the seriousness of our concerns and apparently does n't want to talk about making possible changes to the immigration law , " kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg -lrb- tgb -rrb- , told the online version of der spiegel on the eve of the summit .
helga and horst , but not ahmed and aische ?
in addition to raising the minimum age for foreign spouses to 18 , germany wants them in future to learn basic german before they enter the country .
the aim is to combat forced marriages believed to be widespread among germany 's turkish community .
turks make up the largest group among the country 's 6.7 million foreigners .
but turkish groups are irked that the regulation only applies to non-germans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government says the new law is meant to combat forced marriages " if helga and horst are allowed to get their partners here why not ahmed and aische too ? "
kolat said .
speaking at a press conference , kolat added the law amounted to " ethnic discrimination " and applied " double standards . "
kolat also raised doubts about the law 's effectiveness in fighting forced marriages .
he pointed out that the number of brides being imported from turkey had fallen in recent years .
those who do come in , kolat said , tended to be better educated .
" we too believe that every forced marriage is one too much and should be severely punished , " he said .
" but the law is no means to counter forced marriages . "
government says summit will go ahead the integration summit on thursday is one of a number of measures drawn up by chancellor angela merkel 's government to reach out to its large immigrant population amid mounting concerns in europe about radicalization and home-grown terrorism . german media regularly reports about the poor school performance of children from immigrant families , conflicts over the wearing of the islamic headscarf and the building of so-called parallel societies in large cities .
the summit , which brings together representatives from the government , migrant groups and independent experts , plans to introduce a weighty " national integration plan " which analyzes the problems of immigrants and includes some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to promote the integration of foreigners .
the plan is a result of a year 's work by the various groups that are part of the integration summit .
german politicians say the threatened boycott by the turkish groups should not be allowed to disrupt the work achieved so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer says the groups threatening the boycott are hurting the 2.5 million turks in germany " the summit will take place in any case and there will be no empty chairs , " said maria böhmer , federal commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" you do n't solve problems by staying away , but only when you speak to each other . "
a " self-boycott by the organizations " will not help the 2.5 million turks in germany , böhmer added .
" dream of multiculturalism has failed " the rift between the turkish groups and politicians ahead of the summit also reflects a tougher attitude in germany towards immigrants after decades of politicians refusing to accept its status as an immigrant country .
böhmer insisted that the new immigration law was not discriminatory and said integration also meant accepting the values and laws of the country that immigrants came to .

" we too believe that every forced marriage is one too much and should be severely punished , " he said .
" but the law is no means to counter forced marriages . "
government says summit will go ahead the integration summit on thursday is one of a number of measures drawn up by chancellor angela merkel 's government to reach out to its large immigrant population amid mounting concerns in europe about radicalization and home-grown terrorism . german media regularly reports about the poor school performance of children from immigrant families , conflicts over the wearing of the islamic headscarf and the building of so-called parallel societies in large cities .
the summit , which brings together representatives from the government , migrant groups and independent experts , plans to introduce a weighty " national integration plan " which analyzes the problems of immigrants and includes some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to promote the integration of foreigners .
the plan is a result of a year 's work by the various groups that are part of the integration summit .
german politicians say the threatened boycott by the turkish groups should not be allowed to disrupt the work achieved so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer says the groups threatening the boycott are hurting the 2.5 million turks in germany " the summit will take place in any case and there will be no empty chairs , " said maria böhmer , federal commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" you do n't solve problems by staying away , but only when you speak to each other . "
a " self-boycott by the organizations " will not help the 2.5 million turks in germany , böhmer added .
" dream of multiculturalism has failed " the rift between the turkish groups and politicians ahead of the summit also reflects a tougher attitude in germany towards immigrants after decades of politicians refusing to accept its status as an immigrant country .
böhmer insisted that the new immigration law was not discriminatory and said integration also meant accepting the values and laws of the country that immigrants came to .
" the dream of multiculturalism has failed , " she said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ministry said such rooms were no longer necessary because threat scenarios had changed .

bkk spokeswoman ursula fuchs said the institute for federal real estate would take care of selling the government-owned bunkers .
shelters to be sold also include those located in subway stations in several major cities .
most of the protective structures were built during world war ii .
some of them were integrated into an " emergency program " developed during the korean war in the 1950s .
additional bunkers were refurbished and expanded in the 1960s during the cuban missile crisis when the cold war came closest to escalating into a nuclear war .
following the end of the cold war , programs for refurbishing bunkers and other projects for installing civilian shelters came to a halt in the 1990s .
some historians have said they hope at least some of the bunkers will be kept intact so future generations can visit the structures and see information material common when the bunkers were built , such as a poster of a man hiding behind a tree with his briefcase in front of his head .

the ministry said such rooms were no longer necessary because threat scenarios had changed .
though the ministry made the decision in may , the bonn-based german federal office of civil protection and disaster assistance -lrb- bkk -rrb- only announced the move this week .
the bkk said the shelters would not offer sufficient protection in the face of terrorist attacks and added that only a portion of the german population would find space in the rooms . millions in maintenance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some said other uses could be found for the structures , like this bunker turned penthouse maintenance for the bunkers and shelters has cost the government 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.7 million -rrb- per year .
bkk spokeswoman ursula fuchs said the institute for federal real estate would take care of selling the government-owned bunkers .
shelters to be sold also include those located in subway stations in several major cities .
most of the protective structures were built during world war ii .
some of them were integrated into an " emergency program " developed during the korean war in the 1950s .
additional bunkers were refurbished and expanded in the 1960s during the cuban missile crisis when the cold war came closest to escalating into a nuclear war .
following the end of the cold war , programs for refurbishing bunkers and other projects for installing civilian shelters came to a halt in the 1990s .
some historians have said they hope at least some of the bunkers will be kept intact so future generations can visit the structures and see information material common when the bunkers were built , such as a poster of a man hiding behind a tree with his briefcase in front of his head .
the poster 's headline read , " you 're better protected this way ! "
this year a bunker near bonn , the former capital of west germany , that would have housed west german government officials in the case of nuclear attack will be opened as a museum documenting the cold war . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for german authors , cracking the us book market is a hard task .
so when children 's book writer rotraut susanne berner got a call from a us publisher , she was happy - until she heard what would have to be changed . german children 's book author rotraut susanne berner was delighted when her latest worldwide success story , the newest of her " wimmelbücher " series , was courted by a publisher in the notoriously fickle us book market .
however , after celebrating the fact that a german book had been noticed by the normally indifferent american publishing industry , berner 's happiness turned to consternation when she discovered just how fickle the industry could be .
of course , said publishers , boyds mills press , there would be some cultural differences that would have to be addressed and possibly changed , which berner herself was happy to consider .
the publishers suggested that the inclusion of some smokers in the brightly colored illustrations would not be suitable for us children , and berner agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magnifying glass not included but when the publishers began suggesting censorship of naked artworks in the background of a museum scene , the german author could n't believe what she was hearing .
" it was a sensation to start with , " said berner of her amazement at attracting us interest , in an interview with the german der spiegel news magazine .
but when the suggestions for edits and exclusions started to flood in over the nude paintings and sculpture , she thought it was a joke .

on the page , the sculpture stands at a very unthreatening seven millimeters tall and the appendage could , at first glance , be dismissed as a wayward brushstroke .
the " little willy " as berner called it " was barely half a millimeter in length . "
the sculpture is an aside in the overall museum scene and is in no way prominent to the storyline on that page , she added .
yet , the censors spotted it and wanted it out .
it seemed that the whole micro-penis affair is " highly embarrassing " to the publishing company , according to berner , which fears a backlash from angry parents if the book is published with the tiny organ still in place .
author pulls plug over censorship while berner admitted that she could have lived with the offending artworks being covered by a black box or bar in the book , the author and graphic arts designer said that she could not agree to a complete reworking of the page and the omission of the artifacts .

however , it believes that new competitors would probably try to distinguish themselves from existing state-controlled post offices with lower costs and special services . eu financial services commissioner charlie mccreevy earlier defended the plans for a full market opening by 2009 .
as the bloc 's top internal market official , he said the industry would suffer if the market is not fully liberalized within the original timetable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post workers faces new competition in 2008 " our proposal is based on sound preparation .
it is not ... based on ideological zeal , " he said .
" experience with market opening to date has been overwhelmingly positive . " communication revolution mccreevy warned the european parliament that postal services around europe which fail to alter their business practices will lose out when new forms of communication , such as electronic mail , become even more widespread . " it is common knowledge that a communications revolution is taking place , " he said .
" it poses a threat for those postal operators that fail to adapt . "
mccreevy 's plans for liberalization by 2009 had gained support from the european commission , and eu members such as germany and britain , agreed that it would lead to a more reliable and better quality service driven by foreign competition in their postal markets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some private mail delivery companies are already in action in germany the german national postal system , deutsche post , was already slated to give up its monopoly in 2008 . however , it fears a disadvantage if other countries are permitted to maintain their monopolies longer . bulgaria , estonia , finland , sweden and the uk have currently opened their postal markets up completely . the european parliament wants to cushion the disadvantage for deutsche post and other countries which have already deregulated their markets .
eu lawmakers said postal services in france and other countries who maintain their monopolies should not be granted access to the already liberalized markets . france and luxembourg , as well as other states , pushed for the delay , saying they need more time to prepare . the eu began efforts to liberalize the market back in 1997 and first entertained mccreevy 's 2009 plan in 2002 . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- als / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but berlin says the meeting will go ahead . a summit meant to ease the lives of germany 's estimated 15 million immigrants hit a major hurdle when four turkish groups representing a chunk of the foreign population threatened to withdraw from talks this week with chancellor angela merkel 's government .
the groups , who were part of the first such integration summit held last year , say they feel hurt and discriminated against by the government 's recent changes to a 2005 immigration law which tightens restrictions on foreign spouses joining their non-german partners in germany .
they also say in the spirit of integration the government should have consulted them before making the changes .
the groups are now demanding that the government either revoke the changes to the law or else they will boycott the meeting .
" we 've concluded that it does n't make any sense to participate in the summit because the german government has n't understood the seriousness of our concerns and apparently does n't want to talk about making possible changes to the immigration law , " kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg -lrb- tgb -rrb- , told the online version of der spiegel on the eve of the summit .
helga and horst , but not ahmed and aische ?
in addition to raising the minimum age for foreign spouses to 18 , germany wants them in future to learn basic german before they enter the country .
the aim is to combat forced marriages believed to be widespread among germany 's turkish community .

kolat also raised doubts about the law 's effectiveness in fighting forced marriages .
he pointed out that the number of brides being imported from turkey had fallen in recent years .

government says summit will go ahead the integration summit on thursday is one of a number of measures drawn up by chancellor angela merkel 's government to reach out to its large immigrant population amid mounting concerns in europe about radicalization and home-grown terrorism . german media regularly reports about the poor school performance of children from immigrant families , conflicts over the wearing of the islamic headscarf and the building of so-called parallel societies in large cities .
the summit , which brings together representatives from the government , migrant groups and independent experts , plans to introduce a weighty " national integration plan " which analyzes the problems of immigrants and includes some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to promote the integration of foreigners .
the plan is a result of a year 's work by the various groups that are part of the integration summit .
german politicians say the threatened boycott by the turkish groups should not be allowed to disrupt the work achieved so far .

" you do n't solve problems by staying away , but only when you speak to each other . "
a " self-boycott by the organizations " will not help the 2.5 million turks in germany , böhmer added .
" dream of multiculturalism has failed " the rift between the turkish groups and politicians ahead of the summit also reflects a tougher attitude in germany towards immigrants after decades of politicians refusing to accept its status as an immigrant country .

but berlin says the meeting will go ahead . a summit meant to ease the lives of germany 's estimated 15 million immigrants hit a major hurdle when four turkish groups representing a chunk of the foreign population threatened to withdraw from talks this week with chancellor angela merkel 's government .
the groups , who were part of the first such integration summit held last year , say they feel hurt and discriminated against by the government 's recent changes to a 2005 immigration law which tightens restrictions on foreign spouses joining their non-german partners in germany .
they also say in the spirit of integration the government should have consulted them before making the changes .
the groups are now demanding that the government either revoke the changes to the law or else they will boycott the meeting .
" we 've concluded that it does n't make any sense to participate in the summit because the german government has n't understood the seriousness of our concerns and apparently does n't want to talk about making possible changes to the immigration law , " kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg -lrb- tgb -rrb- , told the online version of der spiegel on the eve of the summit .
helga and horst , but not ahmed and aische ?
in addition to raising the minimum age for foreign spouses to 18 , germany wants them in future to learn basic german before they enter the country .
the aim is to combat forced marriages believed to be widespread among germany 's turkish community .
turks make up the largest group among the country 's 6.7 million foreigners .
but turkish groups are irked that the regulation only applies to non-germans .

" russia is an important destination for our customers , " mayrhuber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa is more than five times larger than airunion carrying 4.9 million passengers last year , airunion is russia 's second-biggest airline after aeroflot , which carried 8.75 million people , and was formed following a merger of five regional airlines including krasair , domodedovo airlines , omskavia , samara and sibaviatrans .
lufthansa had in recent years attempted to reach a cooperation arrangement with aeroflot , but other international contracts kept a deal from being reached as lufthansa is a leading member of the star alliance group while aeroflot signed on with the sky team , led by air france .
lufthansa also announced tuesday that its global traffic figures had hit a record level in the first half of 2007 of about 27 million passengers .

protestant leaders were offended and said inter-denominational dialogue was now at risk .
german commentators agreed . german commentators had a sharp eye on pope benedict xvi , himself a german , following the pontiff 's comments that other christian churches outside roman catholicism were " defective . "
benedict approved a document released tuesday from his old office , the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , which reiterated church teaching on catholic relations with other christians .
the 16-page document described christian orthodox churches as true churches , but said they suffered from a " wound " since they do not recognize the primacy of the pope .
however , the document also said that the " wound is still more profound " in protestant denominations .
" despite the fact that this teaching has created no little distress ... it is nevertheless difficult to see how the title of ' church ' could possibly be attributed to them , " the paper said .
not new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope said the catholic church is " true " the vatican text reiterates the controversial document " dominus iesus , " which the pope - at that time cardinal joseph ratzinger - issued in 2000 .
with the current document , its authors said they sought to address " erroneous " interpretations and theological " misunderstandings " deriving from the adoption of the second vatican council of the 1960s .
the vatican said it wanted to again stress the issue because it said some catholic theologians continued to misunderstand it .
the document is the pontiff 's second strong reaffirmation of catholic tradition within a week , following a decree on saturday restoring the old latin mass alongside the modern liturgy .
the vatican document said dialogue with other christians remained " one of the priorities of the catholic church , " but it nonetheless prompted swift criticism from protestants , lutherans and other christian denominations spawned by the 16th century reformation .
" it makes us question the seriousness with which the roman catholic church takes its dialogues with the reformed family and other families of the church , " the world alliance of reformed churches said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestants not feeling warm and fuzzy about pontiff right now " it makes us question whether we are indeed praying together for christian unity , " the alliance wrote in a letter to the vatican 's key ecumenical official , cardinal walter kasper .
mainz 's allgemeine zeitung said that " the path toward ecumenism - if it is desired - is based on respect from both sides .
a fair dialogue can not be achieved if one side asserts the claim of embodying the one , sole truth .
for those seeking commonalities on the basis of the christian message , these " answers " -lrb- from the pope -rrb- are just one more punch . "
mannheim 's mannheimer morgen noted that the pontiff was merely sticking to his principles in his comments .
" one may find the pope 's remarks outrageous , but benedict is actually just maintaining the stance he 's always had .
he has not transformed himself from a conservative into a liberal after taking up the papacy .
he has always deflected popular notions of belief .
by focusing on the leading role of the roman catholic church , he is keeping in line with the logic of the vatican .
for those who believe in ecumenism , the pope 's words were brusque .
on the other hand , they can be grateful to benedict : it is now clear that catholics and protestants will not forge closer ties during his papacy .
both sides know where they stand .
that is certainly better than an elusory hope that will never become reality , " the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict made a landmark visit to cologne 's synagoge in 2005 münster 's westfälische nachrichten took a pragmatic approach to benedict 's comments .
" texts in which the church is only concerned with itself , in which doctrines and interpretations shift only very slightly , provide material for a theologians ' circus , and for common rituals of critique .
but they completely miss the realities in which believers live .
believers want help in their daily lives , to deal with their jobs , their families , living with spouses of different faiths , in raising their children to be responsible christians .
marl 's recklinghäuser zeitung said that " people can disagree about how to approach ecumenism .
one can debate about whether different faiths should share sacraments .
but one should not belittle other people or willfully snub them .
during the second vatican council , the then young joseph ratzinger was one of the reformers of the catholic church in the midst of change .
as pope , the one-time " rebel " now wants to re-establish the latin mass and dig up things that should have long been laid to rest .

protestant leaders were offended and said inter-denominational dialogue was now at risk .
german commentators agreed . german commentators had a sharp eye on pope benedict xvi , himself a german , following the pontiff 's comments that other christian churches outside roman catholicism were " defective . "
benedict approved a document released tuesday from his old office , the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , which reiterated church teaching on catholic relations with other christians .
the 16-page document described christian orthodox churches as true churches , but said they suffered from a " wound " since they do not recognize the primacy of the pope .
however , the document also said that the " wound is still more profound " in protestant denominations .
" despite the fact that this teaching has created no little distress ... it is nevertheless difficult to see how the title of ' church ' could possibly be attributed to them , " the paper said .
not new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope said the catholic church is " true " the vatican text reiterates the controversial document " dominus iesus , " which the pope - at that time cardinal joseph ratzinger - issued in 2000 .
with the current document , its authors said they sought to address " erroneous " interpretations and theological " misunderstandings " deriving from the adoption of the second vatican council of the 1960s .
the vatican said it wanted to again stress the issue because it said some catholic theologians continued to misunderstand it .
the document is the pontiff 's second strong reaffirmation of catholic tradition within a week , following a decree on saturday restoring the old latin mass alongside the modern liturgy .
the vatican document said dialogue with other christians remained " one of the priorities of the catholic church , " but it nonetheless prompted swift criticism from protestants , lutherans and other christian denominations spawned by the 16th century reformation .
" it makes us question the seriousness with which the roman catholic church takes its dialogues with the reformed family and other families of the church , " the world alliance of reformed churches said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestants not feeling warm and fuzzy about pontiff right now " it makes us question whether we are indeed praying together for christian unity , " the alliance wrote in a letter to the vatican 's key ecumenical official , cardinal walter kasper .
mainz 's allgemeine zeitung said that " the path toward ecumenism - if it is desired - is based on respect from both sides .
a fair dialogue can not be achieved if one side asserts the claim of embodying the one , sole truth .
for those seeking commonalities on the basis of the christian message , these " answers " -lrb- from the pope -rrb- are just one more punch . "
mannheim 's mannheimer morgen noted that the pontiff was merely sticking to his principles in his comments .
" one may find the pope 's remarks outrageous , but benedict is actually just maintaining the stance he 's always had .
he has not transformed himself from a conservative into a liberal after taking up the papacy .
he has always deflected popular notions of belief .
by focusing on the leading role of the roman catholic church , he is keeping in line with the logic of the vatican .
for those who believe in ecumenism , the pope 's words were brusque .
on the other hand , they can be grateful to benedict : it is now clear that catholics and protestants will not forge closer ties during his papacy .
both sides know where they stand .
that is certainly better than an elusory hope that will never become reality , " the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict made a landmark visit to cologne 's synagoge in 2005 münster 's westfälische nachrichten took a pragmatic approach to benedict 's comments .
" texts in which the church is only concerned with itself , in which doctrines and interpretations shift only very slightly , provide material for a theologians ' circus , and for common rituals of critique .
but they completely miss the realities in which believers live .
believers want help in their daily lives , to deal with their jobs , their families , living with spouses of different faiths , in raising their children to be responsible christians .
marl 's recklinghäuser zeitung said that " people can disagree about how to approach ecumenism .
one can debate about whether different faiths should share sacraments .
but one should not belittle other people or willfully snub them .
during the second vatican council , the then young joseph ratzinger was one of the reformers of the catholic church in the midst of change .
as pope , the one-time " rebel " now wants to re-establish the latin mass and dig up things that should have long been laid to rest .

dw-radio 's ramon garcia ziemsen comments on the controversy . he 's a famous actor , but his talent is average .
he will play a german resistance fighter .
nothing spectacular in itself .
however , this famous , albeit mediocre , actor is an active member of the church of scientology - a community whose belief system includes totalitarian structures and claims to world supremacy .
the resistance fighter is claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , who attempted to assassinate adolf hitler , and a man who went down in history books as a " symbol of the resistance . "
someone who embodied a " different germany " during its dark period .
he may , he may not tom cruise is to play von stauffenberg - it 's a story loaded with everything that can prompt a fierce debate in germany .
after all , it concerns both the jurisdiction of interpretation of one 's own history , as well as a group in which brainwashing supposedly takes place and one which the german domestic intelligence agency has categorized as undemocratic .
scientology is a group whose organization reminds some germans of their darkest hour in history .
tom cruise in the role of a german who tried to overcome totalitarian structures .
while some ask " is he allowed to do that ? " other newspapers are talking about a " new clash of cultures . "
everyone 's entitled to their own beliefs but that is the way things are in both real and alleged cultural clashes : there is no clear distinction between fact and opinion .
the debate strays .
everything gets mixed up .
of course cruise is " allowed " to play von stauffenberg , even if many consider him wrong for the role , which he probably is .
it 's understandable , for instance , that von stauffenberg 's eldest son considers cruise an imposition in the role .
but to forbid people from doing their job based on their beliefs ?
that 's unacceptable - even if it comes to pass what peter steinbach , director of the memorial of the german opposition , warned of : that the film could be perceived as a scientologists ' venture .
the global media industry will , like always , abbreviate .
the equation : an active and prestigious member of the church of scientology - an organization that recently opened up a major center in the middle of berlin and a member of the german resistance ; in other words , scientology equals resistance .
that is the way it will be conveyed .
that is abhorrent and dangerous .
but it is still no reason to forbid cruise from playing stauffenberg .
just a little quote from article 4 of the german constitution , or " basic law : " " freedom of faith and of conscience and freedom to profess religious or philosophical creed shall be inviolable . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 11.07.2007 press review : pope 's comments on catholic " primacy " grate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi has stirred controversay before the vatican said tuesday that christian communities outside roman catholicism were not full churches .
protestant leaders were offended and said inter-denominational dialogue was now at risk .
german commentators agreed . german commentators had a sharp eye on pope benedict xvi , himself a german , following the pontiff 's comments that other christian churches outside roman catholicism were " defective . "
benedict approved a document released tuesday from his old office , the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , which reiterated church teaching on catholic relations with other christians .
the 16-page document described christian orthodox churches as true churches , but said they suffered from a " wound " since they do not recognize the primacy of the pope .
however , the document also said that the " wound is still more profound " in protestant denominations .
" despite the fact that this teaching has created no little distress ... it is nevertheless difficult to see how the title of ' church ' could possibly be attributed to them , " the paper said .
not new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope said the catholic church is " true " the vatican text reiterates the controversial document " dominus iesus , " which the pope - at that time cardinal joseph ratzinger - issued in 2000 .
with the current document , its authors said they sought to address " erroneous " interpretations and theological " misunderstandings " deriving from the adoption of the second vatican council of the 1960s .
the vatican said it wanted to again stress the issue because it said some catholic theologians continued to misunderstand it .
the document is the pontiff 's second strong reaffirmation of catholic tradition within a week , following a decree on saturday restoring the old latin mass alongside the modern liturgy .
the vatican document said dialogue with other christians remained " one of the priorities of the catholic church , " but it nonetheless prompted swift criticism from protestants , lutherans and other christian denominations spawned by the 16th century reformation .
" it makes us question the seriousness with which the roman catholic church takes its dialogues with the reformed family and other families of the church , " the world alliance of reformed churches said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestants not feeling warm and fuzzy about pontiff right now " it makes us question whether we are indeed praying together for christian unity , " the alliance wrote in a letter to the vatican 's key ecumenical official , cardinal walter kasper .
mainz 's allgemeine zeitung said that " the path toward ecumenism - if it is desired - is based on respect from both sides .
a fair dialogue can not be achieved if one side asserts the claim of embodying the one , sole truth .
for those seeking commonalities on the basis of the christian message , these " answers " -lrb- from the pope -rrb- are just one more punch . "
mannheim 's mannheimer morgen noted that the pontiff was merely sticking to his principles in his comments .
" one may find the pope 's remarks outrageous , but benedict is actually just maintaining the stance he 's always had .
he has not transformed himself from a conservative into a liberal after taking up the papacy .
he has always deflected popular notions of belief .
by focusing on the leading role of the roman catholic church , he is keeping in line with the logic of the vatican .
for those who believe in ecumenism , the pope 's words were brusque .
on the other hand , they can be grateful to benedict : it is now clear that catholics and protestants will not forge closer ties during his papacy .
both sides know where they stand .
that is certainly better than an elusory hope that will never become reality , " the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict made a landmark visit to cologne 's synagoge in 2005 münster 's westfälische nachrichten took a pragmatic approach to benedict 's comments .
" texts in which the church is only concerned with itself , in which doctrines and interpretations shift only very slightly , provide material for a theologians ' circus , and for common rituals of critique .
but they completely miss the realities in which believers live .
believers want help in their daily lives , to deal with their jobs , their families , living with spouses of different faiths , in raising their children to be responsible christians .
marl 's recklinghäuser zeitung said that " people can disagree about how to approach ecumenism .
one can debate about whether different faiths should share sacraments .
but one should not belittle other people or willfully snub them .
during the second vatican council , the then young joseph ratzinger was one of the reformers of the catholic church in the midst of change .
as pope , the one-time " rebel " now wants to re-establish the latin mass and dig up things that should have long been laid to rest .
that 's sad , " the paper wrote . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the equation : an active and prestigious member of the church of scientology - an organization that recently opened up a major center in the middle of berlin and a member of the german resistance ; in other words , scientology equals resistance .
that is the way it will be conveyed .
that is abhorrent and dangerous .
but it is still no reason to forbid cruise from playing stauffenberg .
just a little quote from article 4 of the german constitution , or " basic law : " " freedom of faith and of conscience and freedom to profess religious or philosophical creed shall be inviolable . "
bendlerblock is a memorial site so cruise is allowed to play him , but there 's another , more important question : where he is permitted to play him .
the german authorities have banned tom cruise from filming at a few historical sites - at the place where stauffenberg attempted a coup d 'etat on july 20 , 1944 , and where he and other conspirators were executed on that same night .
" there is no better way of evoking the nazi era than be denying a man the possibility of doing his job because of his beliefs , " one american newspaper wrote .
there are many people in germany who are talking about possible damage to the country 's image due to the ban .
they also point to the fact that three years ago , people were allowed to shoot a film about stauffenberg at bendlerblock - precisely the location where cruise is not allowed to shoot .
if not sooner , this is the point at which things can get confusing : cruise was not prevented from filming there because he is a scientologist , but because the employees at the memorial have had bad experiences with elaborate film shoots there .
and because they have learned that this memorial , this place of mourning , simply can not be turned into a setting for a film .
any german film crew would have experienced exactly the same thing as the american crew .
it 's just that no one here would have got upset about it .
original locations not necessary the director of the memorial at the dachau concentration camp once said that memorials must not be misused ; their sanctity must not be violated .
he said commerce - and that 's what hollywood is , after all - had no business being there .
must a film be shot at an original location anyway ?
this is not a documentary film that demands the authenticity of an original location .
these settings can be built , such as in steven spielberg 's film " schindler 's list . "
many other such examples exist as well .
let 's be clear : cruise should play stauffenberg .
but not everywhere .
we have to be very precise about why cruise may not film at bendlerblock : because this would be like a desecration .
because it would be unbearable to again execute stauffenberg at the original location for a popcorn-eating audience .
that is the argument .
and not that cruise is a member of an unbearable denomination . ramon garcia ziemsen works in dw-radio 's culture department -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 11.07.2007 opinion : debate strays on cruise as hitler 's attempted assassin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood star and scientologist tom cruise is slated to play a character who attempted to assassinate adolf hitler , and germany has been up in arms .
dw-radio 's ramon garcia ziemsen comments on the controversy . he 's a famous actor , but his talent is average .
he will play a german resistance fighter .
nothing spectacular in itself .
however , this famous , albeit mediocre , actor is an active member of the church of scientology - a community whose belief system includes totalitarian structures and claims to world supremacy .
the resistance fighter is claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , who attempted to assassinate adolf hitler , and a man who went down in history books as a " symbol of the resistance . "
someone who embodied a " different germany " during its dark period .
he may , he may not tom cruise is to play von stauffenberg - it 's a story loaded with everything that can prompt a fierce debate in germany .
after all , it concerns both the jurisdiction of interpretation of one 's own history , as well as a group in which brainwashing supposedly takes place and one which the german domestic intelligence agency has categorized as undemocratic .
scientology is a group whose organization reminds some germans of their darkest hour in history .
tom cruise in the role of a german who tried to overcome totalitarian structures .
while some ask " is he allowed to do that ? " other newspapers are talking about a " new clash of cultures . "
everyone 's entitled to their own beliefs but that is the way things are in both real and alleged cultural clashes : there is no clear distinction between fact and opinion .
the debate strays .
everything gets mixed up .
of course cruise is " allowed " to play von stauffenberg , even if many consider him wrong for the role , which he probably is .
it 's understandable , for instance , that von stauffenberg 's eldest son considers cruise an imposition in the role .
but to forbid people from doing their job based on their beliefs ?
that 's unacceptable - even if it comes to pass what peter steinbach , director of the memorial of the german opposition , warned of : that the film could be perceived as a scientologists ' venture .
the global media industry will , like always , abbreviate .
the equation : an active and prestigious member of the church of scientology - an organization that recently opened up a major center in the middle of berlin and a member of the german resistance ; in other words , scientology equals resistance .
that is the way it will be conveyed .
that is abhorrent and dangerous .
but it is still no reason to forbid cruise from playing stauffenberg .

bendlerblock is a memorial site so cruise is allowed to play him , but there 's another , more important question : where he is permitted to play him .
the german authorities have banned tom cruise from filming at a few historical sites - at the place where stauffenberg attempted a coup d 'etat on july 20 , 1944 , and where he and other conspirators were executed on that same night .
" there is no better way of evoking the nazi era than be denying a man the possibility of doing his job because of his beliefs , " one american newspaper wrote .
there are many people in germany who are talking about possible damage to the country 's image due to the ban .
they also point to the fact that three years ago , people were allowed to shoot a film about stauffenberg at bendlerblock - precisely the location where cruise is not allowed to shoot .
if not sooner , this is the point at which things can get confusing : cruise was not prevented from filming there because he is a scientologist , but because the employees at the memorial have had bad experiences with elaborate film shoots there .
and because they have learned that this memorial , this place of mourning , simply can not be turned into a setting for a film .

dw-radio 's ramon garcia ziemsen comments on the controversy . he 's a famous actor , but his talent is average .
he will play a german resistance fighter .
nothing spectacular in itself .
however , this famous , albeit mediocre , actor is an active member of the church of scientology - a community whose belief system includes totalitarian structures and claims to world supremacy .
the resistance fighter is claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , who attempted to assassinate adolf hitler , and a man who went down in history books as a " symbol of the resistance . "
someone who embodied a " different germany " during its dark period .
he may , he may not tom cruise is to play von stauffenberg - it 's a story loaded with everything that can prompt a fierce debate in germany .
after all , it concerns both the jurisdiction of interpretation of one 's own history , as well as a group in which brainwashing supposedly takes place and one which the german domestic intelligence agency has categorized as undemocratic .
scientology is a group whose organization reminds some germans of their darkest hour in history .
tom cruise in the role of a german who tried to overcome totalitarian structures .
while some ask " is he allowed to do that ? " other newspapers are talking about a " new clash of cultures . "
everyone 's entitled to their own beliefs but that is the way things are in both real and alleged cultural clashes : there is no clear distinction between fact and opinion .
the debate strays .
everything gets mixed up .
of course cruise is " allowed " to play von stauffenberg , even if many consider him wrong for the role , which he probably is .
it 's understandable , for instance , that von stauffenberg 's eldest son considers cruise an imposition in the role .
but to forbid people from doing their job based on their beliefs ?
that 's unacceptable - even if it comes to pass what peter steinbach , director of the memorial of the german opposition , warned of : that the film could be perceived as a scientologists ' venture .
the global media industry will , like always , abbreviate .
the equation : an active and prestigious member of the church of scientology - an organization that recently opened up a major center in the middle of berlin and a member of the german resistance ; in other words , scientology equals resistance .
that is the way it will be conveyed .
that is abhorrent and dangerous .

for german authors , cracking the us book market is a hard task .
so when children 's book writer rotraut susanne berner got a call from a us publisher , she was happy - until she heard what would have to be changed . german children 's book author rotraut susanne berner was delighted when her latest worldwide success story , the newest of her " wimmelbücher " series , was courted by a publisher in the notoriously fickle us book market .
however , after celebrating the fact that a german book had been noticed by the normally indifferent american publishing industry , berner 's happiness turned to consternation when she discovered just how fickle the industry could be .
of course , said publishers , boyds mills press , there would be some cultural differences that would have to be addressed and possibly changed , which berner herself was happy to consider .
the publishers suggested that the inclusion of some smokers in the brightly colored illustrations would not be suitable for us children , and berner agreed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magnifying glass not included but when the publishers began suggesting censorship of naked artworks in the background of a museum scene , the german author could n't believe what she was hearing .
" it was a sensation to start with , " said berner of her amazement at attracting us interest , in an interview with the german der spiegel news magazine .
but when the suggestions for edits and exclusions started to flood in over the nude paintings and sculpture , she thought it was a joke .
teenie weenie causes problems what could possibly have got the suits at boyds mills so hot under the overly starched collar ?
a painting depicting a gratuitous roman orgy being viewed by wide-eyed 5-year olds ?
a massive bronze phallus gawped at by an awestruck group of pre-teens ?
hardly .
apart from a tasteful nude reclining in a slightly blurred watercolor in the background , the main offending artifact was a tiny male statue and its microscopic penis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this 50 million euro artwork from the 16th century obscene ?
on the page , the sculpture stands at a very unthreatening seven millimeters tall and the appendage could , at first glance , be dismissed as a wayward brushstroke .
the " little willy " as berner called it " was barely half a millimeter in length . "
the sculpture is an aside in the overall museum scene and is in no way prominent to the storyline on that page , she added .
yet , the censors spotted it and wanted it out .
it seemed that the whole micro-penis affair is " highly embarrassing " to the publishing company , according to berner , which fears a backlash from angry parents if the book is published with the tiny organ still in place .
author pulls plug over censorship while berner admitted that she could have lived with the offending artworks being covered by a black box or bar in the book , the author and graphic arts designer said that she could not agree to a complete reworking of the page and the omission of the artifacts .
instead , she pulled the plug on the us deal .
the contract would have been a sweet one , but berner need not worry .
her books are sold all over the world and she has racked up best-sellers in 13 countries from japan to the faroe islands .
no one , other than the americans , has complained about the nudity , she said .
and so , the munich-based author continues her successful career with her principles intact and the innocence of the children of the united states spared .

but berlin says the meeting will go ahead . a summit meant to ease the lives of germany 's estimated 15 million immigrants hit a major hurdle when four turkish groups representing a chunk of the foreign population threatened to withdraw from talks this week with chancellor angela merkel 's government .
the groups , who were part of the first such integration summit held last year , say they feel hurt and discriminated against by the government 's recent changes to a 2005 immigration law which tightens restrictions on foreign spouses joining their non-german partners in germany .
they also say in the spirit of integration the government should have consulted them before making the changes .
the groups are now demanding that the government either revoke the changes to the law or else they will boycott the meeting .
" we 've concluded that it does n't make any sense to participate in the summit because the german government has n't understood the seriousness of our concerns and apparently does n't want to talk about making possible changes to the immigration law , " kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg -lrb- tgb -rrb- , told the online version of der spiegel on the eve of the summit .
helga and horst , but not ahmed and aische ?
in addition to raising the minimum age for foreign spouses to 18 , germany wants them in future to learn basic german before they enter the country .
the aim is to combat forced marriages believed to be widespread among germany 's turkish community .
turks make up the largest group among the country 's 6.7 million foreigners .
but turkish groups are irked that the regulation only applies to non-germans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government says the new law is meant to combat forced marriages " if helga and horst are allowed to get their partners here why not ahmed and aische too ? "
kolat said .
speaking at a press conference , kolat added the law amounted to " ethnic discrimination " and applied " double standards . "
kolat also raised doubts about the law 's effectiveness in fighting forced marriages .
he pointed out that the number of brides being imported from turkey had fallen in recent years .
those who do come in , kolat said , tended to be better educated .
" we too believe that every forced marriage is one too much and should be severely punished , " he said .
" but the law is no means to counter forced marriages . "
government says summit will go ahead the integration summit on thursday is one of a number of measures drawn up by chancellor angela merkel 's government to reach out to its large immigrant population amid mounting concerns in europe about radicalization and home-grown terrorism . german media regularly reports about the poor school performance of children from immigrant families , conflicts over the wearing of the islamic headscarf and the building of so-called parallel societies in large cities .
the summit , which brings together representatives from the government , migrant groups and independent experts , plans to introduce a weighty " national integration plan " which analyzes the problems of immigrants and includes some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to promote the integration of foreigners .
the plan is a result of a year 's work by the various groups that are part of the integration summit .
german politicians say the threatened boycott by the turkish groups should not be allowed to disrupt the work achieved so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer says the groups threatening the boycott are hurting the 2.5 million turks in germany " the summit will take place in any case and there will be no empty chairs , " said maria böhmer , federal commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" you do n't solve problems by staying away , but only when you speak to each other . "
a " self-boycott by the organizations " will not help the 2.5 million turks in germany , böhmer added .
" dream of multiculturalism has failed " the rift between the turkish groups and politicians ahead of the summit also reflects a tougher attitude in germany towards immigrants after decades of politicians refusing to accept its status as an immigrant country .
böhmer insisted that the new immigration law was not discriminatory and said integration also meant accepting the values and laws of the country that immigrants came to .

he pointed out that the number of brides being imported from turkey had fallen in recent years .
those who do come in , kolat said , tended to be better educated .
" we too believe that every forced marriage is one too much and should be severely punished , " he said .
" but the law is no means to counter forced marriages . "
government says summit will go ahead the integration summit on thursday is one of a number of measures drawn up by chancellor angela merkel 's government to reach out to its large immigrant population amid mounting concerns in europe about radicalization and home-grown terrorism . german media regularly reports about the poor school performance of children from immigrant families , conflicts over the wearing of the islamic headscarf and the building of so-called parallel societies in large cities .
the summit , which brings together representatives from the government , migrant groups and independent experts , plans to introduce a weighty " national integration plan " which analyzes the problems of immigrants and includes some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to promote the integration of foreigners .
the plan is a result of a year 's work by the various groups that are part of the integration summit .
german politicians say the threatened boycott by the turkish groups should not be allowed to disrupt the work achieved so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer says the groups threatening the boycott are hurting the 2.5 million turks in germany " the summit will take place in any case and there will be no empty chairs , " said maria böhmer , federal commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" you do n't solve problems by staying away , but only when you speak to each other . "
a " self-boycott by the organizations " will not help the 2.5 million turks in germany , böhmer added .
" dream of multiculturalism has failed " the rift between the turkish groups and politicians ahead of the summit also reflects a tougher attitude in germany towards immigrants after decades of politicians refusing to accept its status as an immigrant country .
böhmer insisted that the new immigration law was not discriminatory and said integration also meant accepting the values and laws of the country that immigrants came to .

but berlin says the meeting will go ahead . a summit meant to ease the lives of germany 's estimated 15 million immigrants hit a major hurdle when four turkish groups representing a chunk of the foreign population threatened to withdraw from talks this week with chancellor angela merkel 's government .
the groups , who were part of the first such integration summit held last year , say they feel hurt and discriminated against by the government 's recent changes to a 2005 immigration law which tightens restrictions on foreign spouses joining their non-german partners in germany .
they also say in the spirit of integration the government should have consulted them before making the changes .
the groups are now demanding that the government either revoke the changes to the law or else they will boycott the meeting .
" we 've concluded that it does n't make any sense to participate in the summit because the german government has n't understood the seriousness of our concerns and apparently does n't want to talk about making possible changes to the immigration law , " kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg -lrb- tgb -rrb- , told the online version of der spiegel on the eve of the summit .
helga and horst , but not ahmed and aische ?
in addition to raising the minimum age for foreign spouses to 18 , germany wants them in future to learn basic german before they enter the country .
the aim is to combat forced marriages believed to be widespread among germany 's turkish community .
turks make up the largest group among the country 's 6.7 million foreigners .
but turkish groups are irked that the regulation only applies to non-germans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government says the new law is meant to combat forced marriages " if helga and horst are allowed to get their partners here why not ahmed and aische too ? "
kolat said .

kolat also raised doubts about the law 's effectiveness in fighting forced marriages .
he pointed out that the number of brides being imported from turkey had fallen in recent years .

protestant leaders were offended and said inter-denominational dialogue was now at risk .
german commentators agreed . german commentators had a sharp eye on pope benedict xvi , himself a german , following the pontiff 's comments that other christian churches outside roman catholicism were " defective . "
benedict approved a document released tuesday from his old office , the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , which reiterated church teaching on catholic relations with other christians .
the 16-page document described christian orthodox churches as true churches , but said they suffered from a " wound " since they do not recognize the primacy of the pope .
however , the document also said that the " wound is still more profound " in protestant denominations .
" despite the fact that this teaching has created no little distress ... it is nevertheless difficult to see how the title of ' church ' could possibly be attributed to them , " the paper said .

with the current document , its authors said they sought to address " erroneous " interpretations and theological " misunderstandings " deriving from the adoption of the second vatican council of the 1960s .
the vatican said it wanted to again stress the issue because it said some catholic theologians continued to misunderstand it .
the document is the pontiff 's second strong reaffirmation of catholic tradition within a week , following a decree on saturday restoring the old latin mass alongside the modern liturgy .
the vatican document said dialogue with other christians remained " one of the priorities of the catholic church , " but it nonetheless prompted swift criticism from protestants , lutherans and other christian denominations spawned by the 16th century reformation .
" it makes us question the seriousness with which the roman catholic church takes its dialogues with the reformed family and other families of the church , " the world alliance of reformed churches said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestants not feeling warm and fuzzy about pontiff right now " it makes us question whether we are indeed praying together for christian unity , " the alliance wrote in a letter to the vatican 's key ecumenical official , cardinal walter kasper .

a fair dialogue can not be achieved if one side asserts the claim of embodying the one , sole truth .
for those seeking commonalities on the basis of the christian message , these " answers " -lrb- from the pope -rrb- are just one more punch . "
mannheim 's mannheimer morgen noted that the pontiff was merely sticking to his principles in his comments .
" one may find the pope 's remarks outrageous , but benedict is actually just maintaining the stance he 's always had .
he has not transformed himself from a conservative into a liberal after taking up the papacy .
he has always deflected popular notions of belief .

for those who believe in ecumenism , the pope 's words were brusque .
on the other hand , they can be grateful to benedict : it is now clear that catholics and protestants will not forge closer ties during his papacy .
both sides know where they stand .

protestant leaders were offended and said inter-denominational dialogue was now at risk .
german commentators agreed . german commentators had a sharp eye on pope benedict xvi , himself a german , following the pontiff 's comments that other christian churches outside roman catholicism were " defective . "
benedict approved a document released tuesday from his old office , the congregation for the doctrine of the faith , which reiterated church teaching on catholic relations with other christians .
the 16-page document described christian orthodox churches as true churches , but said they suffered from a " wound " since they do not recognize the primacy of the pope .
however , the document also said that the " wound is still more profound " in protestant denominations .
" despite the fact that this teaching has created no little distress ... it is nevertheless difficult to see how the title of ' church ' could possibly be attributed to them , " the paper said .
not new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope said the catholic church is " true " the vatican text reiterates the controversial document " dominus iesus , " which the pope - at that time cardinal joseph ratzinger - issued in 2000 .
with the current document , its authors said they sought to address " erroneous " interpretations and theological " misunderstandings " deriving from the adoption of the second vatican council of the 1960s .
the vatican said it wanted to again stress the issue because it said some catholic theologians continued to misunderstand it .
the document is the pontiff 's second strong reaffirmation of catholic tradition within a week , following a decree on saturday restoring the old latin mass alongside the modern liturgy .
the vatican document said dialogue with other christians remained " one of the priorities of the catholic church , " but it nonetheless prompted swift criticism from protestants , lutherans and other christian denominations spawned by the 16th century reformation .
" it makes us question the seriousness with which the roman catholic church takes its dialogues with the reformed family and other families of the church , " the world alliance of reformed churches said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestants not feeling warm and fuzzy about pontiff right now " it makes us question whether we are indeed praying together for christian unity , " the alliance wrote in a letter to the vatican 's key ecumenical official , cardinal walter kasper .
mainz 's allgemeine zeitung said that " the path toward ecumenism - if it is desired - is based on respect from both sides .
a fair dialogue can not be achieved if one side asserts the claim of embodying the one , sole truth .
for those seeking commonalities on the basis of the christian message , these " answers " -lrb- from the pope -rrb- are just one more punch . "
mannheim 's mannheimer morgen noted that the pontiff was merely sticking to his principles in his comments .
" one may find the pope 's remarks outrageous , but benedict is actually just maintaining the stance he 's always had .
he has not transformed himself from a conservative into a liberal after taking up the papacy .
he has always deflected popular notions of belief .
by focusing on the leading role of the roman catholic church , he is keeping in line with the logic of the vatican .
for those who believe in ecumenism , the pope 's words were brusque .
on the other hand , they can be grateful to benedict : it is now clear that catholics and protestants will not forge closer ties during his papacy .
both sides know where they stand .
that is certainly better than an elusory hope that will never become reality , " the paper wrote .

" russia is an important destination for our customers , " mayrhuber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa is more than five times larger than airunion carrying 4.9 million passengers last year , airunion is russia 's second-biggest airline after aeroflot , which carried 8.75 million people , and was formed following a merger of five regional airlines including krasair , domodedovo airlines , omskavia , samara and sibaviatrans .
lufthansa had in recent years attempted to reach a cooperation arrangement with aeroflot , but other international contracts kept a deal from being reached as lufthansa is a leading member of the star alliance group while aeroflot signed on with the sky team , led by air france .
lufthansa also announced tuesday that its global traffic figures had hit a record level in the first half of 2007 of about 27 million passengers .
this represented a 5.9 percent increase during the first six months of the year compared to the same period in 2005 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
eighty-six people from all aspects of german life were invited by chancellor angela merkel to discuss the problems of immigration in germany and specifically the problems associated with the integration of immigrants .
more than two-thirds of the participants were german politicians , representatives of federations and church leaders .
less than one third came from the demographic of those the meeting was set up to help .
of the immigrants who did attend , half were of turkish origin .
the turks , with 2.2 million people , are the biggest group among germany 's immigrants and approximately 20 percent of them have taken on german nationality .
in total about 7 million people of non-german origin live in germany .
a quarter of them come from eu countries and , due to the generosity of the eu , they experience few problems coming to and settling down in germany .
a third of germany 's immigrants have lived in the country for more than 20 years while about half have lived in the country for more than 10 years and nearly every fifth was born there .
the " guest workers " who came to stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " guest workers " began to arrive in the 1950s the first influx of immigrants began in the 1950s when germany began to enlist the help of " guest workers " from southern europe , followed by workers from turkey in the early 1960s .
they were all called " guest workers " because germany 's idea was that they would return to the native country some time in the future .
while many did this , others remained in germany and stopped being " guest workers " and instead became " immigrants . "
it soon became obvious that germany had not anticipated such a phenomenon and had little infrastructure and few laws in place to cope with the admission and integration needs of these people .
the turkish immigrants especially were concerned by the cultural and religious differences they saw in german society .
in later years , there was even greater concern , especially after sept .
11 , 2001 when an upsurge in mistrust of islam and muslims followed the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
study groups charged with compiling integration plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel meeting the delegates at the 2006 summit bearing in mind the difficulties allaying all parties , the first german " integration summit " in 2006 attempted to solve the problems together .
six study groups were set up to deal with the most important factors : integration courses ; learning german ; education and vocational training ; as well as the situation regarding women ; local integration activities and integration activities to benefit civil society .
these study groups were expected to bring these factors together in the integration plan that is due to be discussed at the second summit on july 12 .
but while there had been much initial praise for the first summit , there has been growing criticism ahead of the second .
the german government 's handling of the immigration law has left many feeling deceived , with the the turkish federations feeling most discriminated against .
many immigrant organizations have said the government ignored them in the policy-making process , and the turks feel that many of the points in the law were targeting them specifically .
so while germany prepares for its second , laudable summit aimed at easing integration problems , those who it hopes to help are again marginalized and several turkish groups have already said that they will boycott the summit in protest .
how many immigrant representatives show up at the 2007 summit remains to be seen . peter philipp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
eighty-six people from all aspects of german life were invited by chancellor angela merkel to discuss the problems of immigration in germany and specifically the problems associated with the integration of immigrants .
more than two-thirds of the participants were german politicians , representatives of federations and church leaders .
less than one third came from the demographic of those the meeting was set up to help .
of the immigrants who did attend , half were of turkish origin .
the turks , with 2.2 million people , are the biggest group among germany 's immigrants and approximately 20 percent of them have taken on german nationality .
in total about 7 million people of non-german origin live in germany .
a quarter of them come from eu countries and , due to the generosity of the eu , they experience few problems coming to and settling down in germany .
a third of germany 's immigrants have lived in the country for more than 20 years while about half have lived in the country for more than 10 years and nearly every fifth was born there .

they were all called " guest workers " because germany 's idea was that they would return to the native country some time in the future .
while many did this , others remained in germany and stopped being " guest workers " and instead became " immigrants . "
it soon became obvious that germany had not anticipated such a phenomenon and had little infrastructure and few laws in place to cope with the admission and integration needs of these people .
the turkish immigrants especially were concerned by the cultural and religious differences they saw in german society .

six study groups were set up to deal with the most important factors : integration courses ; learning german ; education and vocational training ; as well as the situation regarding women ; local integration activities and integration activities to benefit civil society .
these study groups were expected to bring these factors together in the integration plan that is due to be discussed at the second summit on july 12 .
but while there had been much initial praise for the first summit , there has been growing criticism ahead of the second .
the german government 's handling of the immigration law has left many feeling deceived , with the the turkish federations feeling most discriminated against .
many immigrant organizations have said the government ignored them in the policy-making process , and the turks feel that many of the points in the law were targeting them specifically .
so while germany prepares for its second , laudable summit aimed at easing integration problems , those who it hopes to help are again marginalized and several turkish groups have already said that they will boycott the summit in protest .

study groups charged with compiling integration plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel meeting the delegates at the 2006 summit bearing in mind the difficulties allaying all parties , the first german " integration summit " in 2006 attempted to solve the problems together .
six study groups were set up to deal with the most important factors : integration courses ; learning german ; education and vocational training ; as well as the situation regarding women ; local integration activities and integration activities to benefit civil society .
these study groups were expected to bring these factors together in the integration plan that is due to be discussed at the second summit on july 12 .
but while there had been much initial praise for the first summit , there has been growing criticism ahead of the second .
the german government 's handling of the immigration law has left many feeling deceived , with the the turkish federations feeling most discriminated against .
many immigrant organizations have said the government ignored them in the policy-making process , and the turks feel that many of the points in the law were targeting them specifically .
so while germany prepares for its second , laudable summit aimed at easing integration problems , those who it hopes to help are again marginalized and several turkish groups have already said that they will boycott the summit in protest .
how many immigrant representatives show up at the 2007 summit remains to be seen . peter philipp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

from hillbilly to deep-fried southern funk , anything goes - as long as it 's got soul . munich 's trikont label is , by any standards , one of the world 's most eclectic .
recent releases span everything from us immigrant folk songs , mexican boleros and 1970s punk to depression-era yodellers and cajun swamp music . trikont 's compilation cds are put together by experts and collectors , but as label founder achim bergmann said , they 're aimed at a general contemporary audience . " we want to put things in a new light and show people where rock and popular music came from , " bergmann said .
" we want listeners to see themselves as part of a tradition . " trikont 's program is unusual but accessible .
the 2004 compilation " dirty laundry , " for instance , featured black musicians singing country songs .
forgotten recordings by soul legends james brown and bobby womack were represented , as were singles by unjustly neglected singers like bobby jonz and freddie north . " dirty laundry " proved a profitable hit , and a follow-up compilation will be released this fall , although profits are n't the main idea , according to bergmann . tuned in to afn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cajun music is one of trikont 's biggest sellers the trikont label evolved in 1971 out of the radical left-wing book publisher of the same name .
german volksmusik had been discredited by its association with the third reich , and the label 's search for the authentic sounds of everyday working people led it to what cultural critic greil marcus has called " the old , weird america " - the land of cowboys , hillbillies , bootleggers , drifters , sharecroppers and others who made music beyond the confines of commerce . ironically , the left-wingers at trikont were introduced to much of the music they came to cherish by the armed forces network , the radio station that serviced american soldiers in post-war germany and continues to broadcast to us troops around the world . " it was like a second liberation , " bergmann said .
" the music they played had changed a whole century .
it had an existential side that german music lacked .
also , the idea of quality and mass culture was unknown in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trikont 's motto speaks volumes meanwhile , trikont publishes material that 's largely unknown in the us itself .
" when we go to music trade fairs , americans are sometimes surprised , " said bergmann .
" they come up and say , ' what is this ?
this is something we do n't have . " ' " it 's like a kind of cultural anarchy with a critical eye toward capitalism , " said detlef diederichsen , a record critic and the musical director of berlin 's house of world cultures concert hall .
" they 're raiding the archives of big companies who ca n't deal with their own back catalogues . " down home , up north if trikont is about breadth , bear family records , located in a small village near the northern german city of bremen , is about depth .
since 1975 , the label has specialized in exhaustively researched , painstakingly produced compilations of mostly country and rockabilly artists . recent releases include sets by ricky nelson , jerry lee lewis and hank snow .
all were made from the original recording tapes and feature extensive booklets with previously unpublished photos and background information . bear family does a large portion of its business via international mail order , and it has won a number of awards from the german record critics association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he was n't marrying his underage cousins , jerry lee lewis made great music label founder richard weize said he spends weeks at a time in america , investigating archives , searching through recording-studio vaults , negotiating contracts for rights and trying to locate collectors . " without collectors , i 'd be dead and buried , " weize said .
" and luck also plays a role .
you do your research , contact people , but in the end it 's often accident .

weize , on the other hand , thinks the reasons are economic . " you have to be crazy to do this , " weize said .
" all our editions sell in the long term .
but you ca n't be primarily profit-oriented . " the future of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bear family boss richard weize has been combing the archives for 30 years does the rise of mp3s and downloaded music present a threat to labels like trikont and bear family ?
are they afraid their small market of passionate collectors and people who want to discover the uncanny sounds of yesteryear will dry up ? " i 'm not afraid , " said weize .
" the cd is dying , as are many of its customers .
you can be sad about that , but it 's a fact .
so there 's no reason to fear anything . " bergmann added that a change in format could have less of an impact on focused labels . " major label music today is mostly about selling ring tones , " bergmann said .
" but passion and respect for real music will remain , and there 'll be a mix of cds and other formats . " the secret to these two independent labels ' survival may be that they target a selective audience of music fanatics - and those who want to be like them .

" we want listeners to see themselves as part of a tradition . " trikont 's program is unusual but accessible .

this is something we do n't have . " ' " it 's like a kind of cultural anarchy with a critical eye toward capitalism , " said detlef diederichsen , a record critic and the musical director of berlin 's house of world cultures concert hall .

from hillbilly to deep-fried southern funk , anything goes - as long as it 's got soul . munich 's trikont label is , by any standards , one of the world 's most eclectic .
recent releases span everything from us immigrant folk songs , mexican boleros and 1970s punk to depression-era yodellers and cajun swamp music . trikont 's compilation cds are put together by experts and collectors , but as label founder achim bergmann said , they 're aimed at a general contemporary audience . " we want to put things in a new light and show people where rock and popular music came from , " bergmann said .
" we want listeners to see themselves as part of a tradition . " trikont 's program is unusual but accessible .
the 2004 compilation " dirty laundry , " for instance , featured black musicians singing country songs .
forgotten recordings by soul legends james brown and bobby womack were represented , as were singles by unjustly neglected singers like bobby jonz and freddie north . " dirty laundry " proved a profitable hit , and a follow-up compilation will be released this fall , although profits are n't the main idea , according to bergmann . tuned in to afn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cajun music is one of trikont 's biggest sellers the trikont label evolved in 1971 out of the radical left-wing book publisher of the same name .
german volksmusik had been discredited by its association with the third reich , and the label 's search for the authentic sounds of everyday working people led it to what cultural critic greil marcus has called " the old , weird america " - the land of cowboys , hillbillies , bootleggers , drifters , sharecroppers and others who made music beyond the confines of commerce . ironically , the left-wingers at trikont were introduced to much of the music they came to cherish by the armed forces network , the radio station that serviced american soldiers in post-war germany and continues to broadcast to us troops around the world . " it was like a second liberation , " bergmann said .
" the music they played had changed a whole century .
it had an existential side that german music lacked .
also , the idea of quality and mass culture was unknown in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trikont 's motto speaks volumes meanwhile , trikont publishes material that 's largely unknown in the us itself .
" when we go to music trade fairs , americans are sometimes surprised , " said bergmann .
" they come up and say , ' what is this ?
this is something we do n't have . " ' " it 's like a kind of cultural anarchy with a critical eye toward capitalism , " said detlef diederichsen , a record critic and the musical director of berlin 's house of world cultures concert hall .
" they 're raiding the archives of big companies who ca n't deal with their own back catalogues . " down home , up north if trikont is about breadth , bear family records , located in a small village near the northern german city of bremen , is about depth .
since 1975 , the label has specialized in exhaustively researched , painstakingly produced compilations of mostly country and rockabilly artists . recent releases include sets by ricky nelson , jerry lee lewis and hank snow .
all were made from the original recording tapes and feature extensive booklets with previously unpublished photos and background information . bear family does a large portion of its business via international mail order , and it has won a number of awards from the german record critics association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he was n't marrying his underage cousins , jerry lee lewis made great music label founder richard weize said he spends weeks at a time in america , investigating archives , searching through recording-studio vaults , negotiating contracts for rights and trying to locate collectors . " without collectors , i 'd be dead and buried , " weize said .
" and luck also plays a role .
you do your research , contact people , but in the end it 's often accident . " one of such fortuitous discovery was a lost version of johnny cash singing " ring of fire " in spanish , which weize found after listening to an unmarked master tape in a california studio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child tv star ricky nelson has been given the bear family treatment trikont 's bergmann said the reason german labels have played such a large role in cultivating older american music was that , as foreigners , they had a keener eye for hidden gems .
weize , on the other hand , thinks the reasons are economic . " you have to be crazy to do this , " weize said .
" all our editions sell in the long term .
but you ca n't be primarily profit-oriented . " the future of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bear family boss richard weize has been combing the archives for 30 years does the rise of mp3s and downloaded music present a threat to labels like trikont and bear family ?
are they afraid their small market of passionate collectors and people who want to discover the uncanny sounds of yesteryear will dry up ? " i 'm not afraid , " said weize .
" the cd is dying , as are many of its customers .
you can be sad about that , but it 's a fact .
so there 's no reason to fear anything . " bergmann added that a change in format could have less of an impact on focused labels . " major label music today is mostly about selling ring tones , " bergmann said .

all were made from the original recording tapes and feature extensive booklets with previously unpublished photos and background information . bear family does a large portion of its business via international mail order , and it has won a number of awards from the german record critics association . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when he was n't marrying his underage cousins , jerry lee lewis made great music label founder richard weize said he spends weeks at a time in america , investigating archives , searching through recording-studio vaults , negotiating contracts for rights and trying to locate collectors . " without collectors , i 'd be dead and buried , " weize said .
" and luck also plays a role .
you do your research , contact people , but in the end it 's often accident . " one of such fortuitous discovery was a lost version of johnny cash singing " ring of fire " in spanish , which weize found after listening to an unmarked master tape in a california studio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : child tv star ricky nelson has been given the bear family treatment trikont 's bergmann said the reason german labels have played such a large role in cultivating older american music was that , as foreigners , they had a keener eye for hidden gems .
weize , on the other hand , thinks the reasons are economic . " you have to be crazy to do this , " weize said .
" all our editions sell in the long term .
but you ca n't be primarily profit-oriented . " the future of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bear family boss richard weize has been combing the archives for 30 years does the rise of mp3s and downloaded music present a threat to labels like trikont and bear family ?
are they afraid their small market of passionate collectors and people who want to discover the uncanny sounds of yesteryear will dry up ? " i 'm not afraid , " said weize .
" the cd is dying , as are many of its customers .
you can be sad about that , but it 's a fact .
so there 's no reason to fear anything . " bergmann added that a change in format could have less of an impact on focused labels . " major label music today is mostly about selling ring tones , " bergmann said .
" but passion and respect for real music will remain , and there 'll be a mix of cds and other formats . " the secret to these two independent labels ' survival may be that they target a selective audience of music fanatics - and those who want to be like them . " when people have everything at the disposal of their computer , they need experts , " diederichsen said .
" they need to be guided by someone with a personal taste who explains and comments on the music .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 11.07.2007 germany 's integration summit clouded by turkish boycott großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not looking too bright for the summit at berlin 's chancellery upset by the government 's recent changes to the immigration law , four leading turkish groups are boycotting an integration summit thursday called by chancellor angela merkel .
but berlin says the meeting will go ahead . a summit meant to ease the lives of germany 's estimated 15 million immigrants hit a major hurdle when four turkish groups representing a chunk of the foreign population threatened to withdraw from talks this week with chancellor angela merkel 's government .
the groups , who were part of the first such integration summit held last year , say they feel hurt and discriminated against by the government 's recent changes to a 2005 immigration law which tightens restrictions on foreign spouses joining their non-german partners in germany .
they also say in the spirit of integration the government should have consulted them before making the changes .
the groups are now demanding that the government either revoke the changes to the law or else they will boycott the meeting .
" we 've concluded that it does n't make any sense to participate in the summit because the german government has n't understood the seriousness of our concerns and apparently does n't want to talk about making possible changes to the immigration law , " kenan kolat , head of the turkish association in berlin and brandenburg -lrb- tgb -rrb- , told the online version of der spiegel on the eve of the summit .
helga and horst , but not ahmed and aische ?
in addition to raising the minimum age for foreign spouses to 18 , germany wants them in future to learn basic german before they enter the country .
the aim is to combat forced marriages believed to be widespread among germany 's turkish community .
turks make up the largest group among the country 's 6.7 million foreigners .
but turkish groups are irked that the regulation only applies to non-germans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government says the new law is meant to combat forced marriages " if helga and horst are allowed to get their partners here why not ahmed and aische too ? "
kolat said .
speaking at a press conference , kolat added the law amounted to " ethnic discrimination " and applied " double standards . "
kolat also raised doubts about the law 's effectiveness in fighting forced marriages .
he pointed out that the number of brides being imported from turkey had fallen in recent years .
those who do come in , kolat said , tended to be better educated .
" we too believe that every forced marriage is one too much and should be severely punished , " he said .
" but the law is no means to counter forced marriages . "
government says summit will go ahead the integration summit on thursday is one of a number of measures drawn up by chancellor angela merkel 's government to reach out to its large immigrant population amid mounting concerns in europe about radicalization and home-grown terrorism . german media regularly reports about the poor school performance of children from immigrant families , conflicts over the wearing of the islamic headscarf and the building of so-called parallel societies in large cities .
the summit , which brings together representatives from the government , migrant groups and independent experts , plans to introduce a weighty " national integration plan " which analyzes the problems of immigrants and includes some 400 voluntary commitments for states and local governments to promote the integration of foreigners .
the plan is a result of a year 's work by the various groups that are part of the integration summit .
german politicians say the threatened boycott by the turkish groups should not be allowed to disrupt the work achieved so far .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer says the groups threatening the boycott are hurting the 2.5 million turks in germany " the summit will take place in any case and there will be no empty chairs , " said maria böhmer , federal commissioner for integration and immigration issues and a member of merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" you do n't solve problems by staying away , but only when you speak to each other . "
a " self-boycott by the organizations " will not help the 2.5 million turks in germany , böhmer added .
" dream of multiculturalism has failed " the rift between the turkish groups and politicians ahead of the summit also reflects a tougher attitude in germany towards immigrants after decades of politicians refusing to accept its status as an immigrant country .
böhmer insisted that the new immigration law was not discriminatory and said integration also meant accepting the values and laws of the country that immigrants came to .

"
eighty-six people from all aspects of german life were invited by chancellor angela merkel to discuss the problems of immigration in germany and specifically the problems associated with the integration of immigrants .
more than two-thirds of the participants were german politicians , representatives of federations and church leaders .
less than one third came from the demographic of those the meeting was set up to help .
of the immigrants who did attend , half were of turkish origin .
the turks , with 2.2 million people , are the biggest group among germany 's immigrants and approximately 20 percent of them have taken on german nationality .
in total about 7 million people of non-german origin live in germany .
a quarter of them come from eu countries and , due to the generosity of the eu , they experience few problems coming to and settling down in germany .
a third of germany 's immigrants have lived in the country for more than 20 years while about half have lived in the country for more than 10 years and nearly every fifth was born there .
the " guest workers " who came to stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " guest workers " began to arrive in the 1950s the first influx of immigrants began in the 1950s when germany began to enlist the help of " guest workers " from southern europe , followed by workers from turkey in the early 1960s .
they were all called " guest workers " because germany 's idea was that they would return to the native country some time in the future .
while many did this , others remained in germany and stopped being " guest workers " and instead became " immigrants . "
it soon became obvious that germany had not anticipated such a phenomenon and had little infrastructure and few laws in place to cope with the admission and integration needs of these people .
the turkish immigrants especially were concerned by the cultural and religious differences they saw in german society .
in later years , there was even greater concern , especially after sept .
11 , 2001 when an upsurge in mistrust of islam and muslims followed the terrorist attacks on new york and washington .
study groups charged with compiling integration plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel meeting the delegates at the 2006 summit bearing in mind the difficulties allaying all parties , the first german " integration summit " in 2006 attempted to solve the problems together .
six study groups were set up to deal with the most important factors : integration courses ; learning german ; education and vocational training ; as well as the situation regarding women ; local integration activities and integration activities to benefit civil society .
these study groups were expected to bring these factors together in the integration plan that is due to be discussed at the second summit on july 12 .
but while there had been much initial praise for the first summit , there has been growing criticism ahead of the second .
the german government 's handling of the immigration law has left many feeling deceived , with the the turkish federations feeling most discriminated against .
many immigrant organizations have said the government ignored them in the policy-making process , and the turks feel that many of the points in the law were targeting them specifically .
so while germany prepares for its second , laudable summit aimed at easing integration problems , those who it hopes to help are again marginalized and several turkish groups have already said that they will boycott the summit in protest .
how many immigrant representatives show up at the 2007 summit remains to be seen . peter philipp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-radio 's ramon garcia ziemsen comments on the controversy . he 's a famous actor , but his talent is average .
he will play a german resistance fighter .
nothing spectacular in itself .
however , this famous , albeit mediocre , actor is an active member of the church of scientology - a community whose belief system includes totalitarian structures and claims to world supremacy .
the resistance fighter is claus schenk graf von stauffenberg , who attempted to assassinate adolf hitler , and a man who went down in history books as a " symbol of the resistance . "
someone who embodied a " different germany " during its dark period .
he may , he may not tom cruise is to play von stauffenberg - it 's a story loaded with everything that can prompt a fierce debate in germany .
after all , it concerns both the jurisdiction of interpretation of one 's own history , as well as a group in which brainwashing supposedly takes place and one which the german domestic intelligence agency has categorized as undemocratic .
scientology is a group whose organization reminds some germans of their darkest hour in history .
tom cruise in the role of a german who tried to overcome totalitarian structures .
while some ask " is he allowed to do that ? " other newspapers are talking about a " new clash of cultures . "
everyone 's entitled to their own beliefs but that is the way things are in both real and alleged cultural clashes : there is no clear distinction between fact and opinion .
the debate strays .
everything gets mixed up .
of course cruise is " allowed " to play von stauffenberg , even if many consider him wrong for the role , which he probably is .
it 's understandable , for instance , that von stauffenberg 's eldest son considers cruise an imposition in the role .
but to forbid people from doing their job based on their beliefs ?
that 's unacceptable - even if it comes to pass what peter steinbach , director of the memorial of the german opposition , warned of : that the film could be perceived as a scientologists ' venture .
the global media industry will , like always , abbreviate .
the equation : an active and prestigious member of the church of scientology - an organization that recently opened up a major center in the middle of berlin and a member of the german resistance ; in other words , scientology equals resistance .
that is the way it will be conveyed .
that is abhorrent and dangerous .
but it is still no reason to forbid cruise from playing stauffenberg .
just a little quote from article 4 of the german constitution , or " basic law : " " freedom of faith and of conscience and freedom to profess religious or philosophical creed shall be inviolable . "
bendlerblock is a memorial site so cruise is allowed to play him , but there 's another , more important question : where he is permitted to play him .
the german authorities have banned tom cruise from filming at a few historical sites - at the place where stauffenberg attempted a coup d 'etat on july 20 , 1944 , and where he and other conspirators were executed on that same night .
" there is no better way of evoking the nazi era than be denying a man the possibility of doing his job because of his beliefs , " one american newspaper wrote .
there are many people in germany who are talking about possible damage to the country 's image due to the ban .
they also point to the fact that three years ago , people were allowed to shoot a film about stauffenberg at bendlerblock - precisely the location where cruise is not allowed to shoot .
if not sooner , this is the point at which things can get confusing : cruise was not prevented from filming there because he is a scientologist , but because the employees at the memorial have had bad experiences with elaborate film shoots there .
and because they have learned that this memorial , this place of mourning , simply can not be turned into a setting for a film .
any german film crew would have experienced exactly the same thing as the american crew .
it 's just that no one here would have got upset about it .
original locations not necessary the director of the memorial at the dachau concentration camp once said that memorials must not be misused ; their sanctity must not be violated .
he said commerce - and that 's what hollywood is , after all - had no business being there .
must a film be shot at an original location anyway ?
this is not a documentary film that demands the authenticity of an original location .
these settings can be built , such as in steven spielberg 's film " schindler 's list . "
many other such examples exist as well .
let 's be clear : cruise should play stauffenberg .
but not everywhere .
we have to be very precise about why cruise may not film at bendlerblock : because this would be like a desecration .
because it would be unbearable to again execute stauffenberg at the original location for a popcorn-eating audience .
that is the argument .
and not that cruise is a member of an unbearable denomination . ramon garcia ziemsen works in dw-radio 's culture department -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead , it is the media companies paying eye-watering sums for broadcasting rights .
and in a market hungry for tv , internet and mobile phone rights sporting rights holders need to make sure they protect their product .
but here the supporters come back into the picture .
they may not be underwriting the sports they love through ticket sales as once they did , but in an on-demand , user-interactive , multi-platform era , it is crucial not to alienate the sports fans .
' protection needed ' instead , sports have to find ways for fans to feel they are contributing to the news and content .
" the increase in user-generated-content -lrb- ugc -rrb- and social networking sites are one of the major biggest developments we have seen with regard to sporting rights , " says rachael church-sanders , editor of e-newsletter sport and technology .
" at the same time we also have viacom , seconds out and the fa premier league suing youtube over footage that has been posted there . "
the most valuable right is live content , but there is also value in clips which can be delivered online or to mobiles " christopher stokes , netresult " some rights owners will see these changes as an opportunity , while others will see it as a threat . "
many of those worried about ugc turn to firms such as netresult , which works on behalf of rights holders and takes illegal content off the internet .
its clients include football leagues in the uk , uefa , formula one , and the cricket and rugby union world cups .
" the most valuable right is live content , but there is also value in clips which can be delivered online or to mobiles , " says netresult chief executive christopher stokes .
" you also need to protect crests , logos , live data and live scoring , though many are happy to licence this sort of material to third parties . "
' niche sport ' however , that kind of licensing does not cover the youtube factor .
the popular video sharing website - and other similar ones - has many sporting organisations , media organisations and rights holders expressing concern at some of the sporting material posted there .
youtube has been named in two high-profile class action cases led by viacom and the premier league , which target the appearance on the site of what the claimants ' say are " pirated " clips .
someone else with youtube in his sights is robert waterman , a boxing entrepreneur who owns the website secondsout.com.
he is suing youtube over a world boxing championship fight between vladimir klitschko and ray austin that he streamed exclusively on his website in march .
but the entire bout was posted on youtube.com shortly after the fight and could be viewed for free .
youtube says it will be happy to remove the clips if mr waterman sends them the web addresses of the offending clips .
but that , he insists , should not be his responsibility .
" the fight was on youtube within minutes of the end of the fight and it is still up there , " he told the bbc at a recent sport business group conference .
" your rights are not being monetised when your events go up on youtube .
i am operating in a large niche sport , and this sort of thing can destroy earning power . "
mr waterman is also unhappy that another klitschko fight he broadcast , on 7 july , appeared on youtube , before being removed by his german broadcasting partners .
a youtube spokesman said : " we are working with copyright holders across europe , including with many sporting organisations , to help them exercise their rights , whether they choose to promote , take down or monetise their videos .
" we have met secondsout.com to explain how they can use the tools we have developed to help rights-holders manage their content on youtube . "
' empowering copyright holders ' youtube 's owner google also says it is introducing new measures in the battle against sports rights piracy by developing video clip identification technology for its file-sharing site .
it hopes that will allow sports rights-holders to combat unauthorised use of their content . "
we spend a lot of time checking out content , we do n't want to break the law " ze 'ev rozov , sportingo the new technology could allow rights-holders who form a relationship with youtube to either take down the clips or monetise them through advertising in a revenue share with the site .
it is testing new video fingerprinting technology with disney , time warner , and other media companies , partners and non-partners .
" our upcoming video identification system will be our latest way of empowering copyright holders , going above and beyond legal requirements , " youtube 's spokesman says .
' fan attention ' however , not all material posted by non-rights holders need necessarily be subject to controversy .
some , after all , is generated by the fans themselves - and forms the source material for sites such as sportingo , which publishes fan articles and photographs , as well as offering direction to useful sports audiovisual resources and statistics .
however , it is not an unregulated free-for-all , as the site has a team of sub-editors to tidy up articles and ensure there are no copyright breaches .
" we are all operating in a sporting economy which is about getting fans ' attention , " says ze 'ev rozov , sportingo 's chief executive .
" if rights holders do not pay attention to fans , then someone else will fill the void . "
but he adds : " we spend a lot of time checking out content .
we do n't want to break the law . "
still , threats remain for rights holders , such as from peer-to-peer applications .
for example , coverage of english premiership football matches has in the past been put on peer-to-peer networks and then watched around the world .
no live premiership matches are yet available legally online anywhere in the world but from 2007/08 , sky and setanta sports - who have the uk tv rights until 2010 - will also be able to broadcast them legally on the internet .
the bbc has the rights to stream recorded highlights to uk internet users , while sky sports is sending clips to mobiles .
before then the premier league hopes to complete high court actions against three websites unlawfully showing its games online , one of which is a peer-to-peer .

" the most valuable right is live content , but there is also value in clips which can be delivered online or to mobiles , " says netresult chief executive christopher stokes .
" you also need to protect crests , logos , live data and live scoring , though many are happy to licence this sort of material to third parties . "
' niche sport ' however , that kind of licensing does not cover the youtube factor .
the popular video sharing website - and other similar ones - has many sporting organisations , media organisations and rights holders expressing concern at some of the sporting material posted there .
youtube has been named in two high-profile class action cases led by viacom and the premier league , which target the appearance on the site of what the claimants ' say are " pirated " clips .
footage of a klitschko fight on youtube is causing some concern someone else with youtube in his sights is robert waterman , a boxing entrepreneur who owns the website secondsout.com.
he is suing youtube over a world boxing championship fight between vladimir klitschko and ray austin that he streamed exclusively on his website in march .
but the entire bout was posted on youtube.com shortly after the fight and could be viewed for free .
youtube says it will be happy to remove the clips if mr waterman sends them the web addresses of the offending clips .
but that , he insists , should not be his responsibility .
" the fight was on youtube within minutes of the end of the fight and it is still up there , " he told the bbc at a recent sport business group conference .
" your rights are not being monetised when your events go up on youtube .
i am operating in a large niche sport , and this sort of thing can destroy earning power . "
mr waterman is also unhappy that another klitschko fight he broadcast , on 7 july , appeared on youtube , before being removed by his german broadcasting partners .
a youtube spokesman said : " we are working with copyright holders across europe , including with many sporting organisations , to help them exercise their rights , whether they choose to promote , take down or monetise their videos .
" we have met secondsout.com to explain how they can use the tools we have developed to help rights-holders manage their content on youtube . "
' empowering copyright holders ' youtube 's owner google also says it is introducing new measures in the battle against sports rights piracy by developing video clip identification technology for its file-sharing site .
it hopes that will allow sports rights-holders to combat unauthorised use of their content .
we spend a lot of time checking out content , we do n't want to break the law ze 'ev rozov , sportingo the new technology could allow rights-holders who form a relationship with youtube to either take down the clips or monetise them through advertising in a revenue share with the site .
it is testing new video fingerprinting technology with disney , time warner , and other media companies , partners and non-partners .
" our upcoming video identification system will be our latest way of empowering copyright holders , going above and beyond legal requirements , " youtube 's spokesman says .
' fan attention ' however , not all material posted by non-rights holders need necessarily be subject to controversy .
some , after all , is generated by the fans themselves - and forms the source material for sites such as sportingo , which publishes fan articles and photographs , as well as offering direction to useful sports audiovisual resources and statistics .
however , it is not an unregulated free-for-all , as the site has a team of sub-editors to tidy up articles and ensure there are no copyright breaches .
" we are all operating in a sporting economy which is about getting fans ' attention , " says ze 'ev rozov , sportingo 's chief executive .
" if rights holders do not pay attention to fans , then someone else will fill the void . "
but he adds : " we spend a lot of time checking out content .
we do n't want to break the law . "
still , threats remain for rights holders , such as from peer-to-peer applications .
for example , coverage of english premiership football matches has in the past been put on peer-to-peer networks and then watched around the world .
no live premiership matches are yet available legally online anywhere in the world but from 2007/08 , sky and setanta sports - who have the uk tv rights until 2010 - will also be able to broadcast them legally on the internet .

the hope is that about 30,000 people might take part in a project that could help reveal whether our existing models of the universe are correct .
computer users undergo a three-minute online tutorial and are then allocated a series of images and asked to decide whether each one shows a spiral or an elliptical galaxy .
if it 's a spiral galaxy , they 're asked to decide which way it appears to be rotating .
the images come from the sloan digital sky survey telescope in new mexico , us .
kevin schawinski , an astrophysicist at oxford university , uk , is one of the team who devised the project .
" i classified about 50,000 galaxies myself in a week , " he said .
" it was mind-numbing . "
he 's hoping that involving the public will speed the work up .
" it 's not just for fun , " he added .
" the human brain is actually better than a computer at pattern recognition tasks like this .
whether you spend five minutes , 15 minutes or five hours using the site , your contribution will be invaluable . "
the project was inspired by others , such as stardust @ home , in which the us space agency invited the public to help sort through dust grains obtained by a mission to a comet .
amateur skills dr chris lintott , another member of the oxford team , said : " what the stardust team achieved was incredible , but our galaxies are much more interesting to look at than their dust grains .
" we hope that participants in galaxy zoo will not only contribute to science , but have a lot of fun along the way . "
he added : " one advantage is that you get to see parts of space that have never been seen before .
these images were taken by a robotic telescope and processed automatically , so the odds are that when you log on , that first galaxy you see will be one that no human has seen before .
" it 's not often you get to see something unique . "
the hope is to have 20,000-30,000 people take part and to have some results in a matter of months .
cosmologist kate land , another member of the team , is expecting amateurs to make a better job of it than the experts : " we get hung up on the details .
i got stuck myself !
i 've found that members of public are much better ; they just go with it , on first instinct .
" they do n't get too stressed about the images .
astronomers are n't the best people to do this . "
she is hoping to test theories about the rotation of galaxies .
she added : " some people have argued that galaxies are rotating all in agreement with each other , not randomly as we 'd expect .
" we want people to classify the galaxies according to which way they 're rotating and i 'll be able to go and see if there 's anything bizarre going on .
if there are any patterns that we 're not expecting , it could really turn up some surprises . "

the hope is that about 30,000 people might take part in a project that could help reveal whether our existing models of the universe are correct .

bbc wales ' initiative , if i ruled wales invited people to submit ideas which they wanted to be brought in as law .
a shortlist of three ideas , suggested by the public via email , phone and post , then attracted 500 votes .
the findings will be handed over as a petition to the assembly presiding officer as a first stage .
banning plastic bags attracted more than half the vote , over banning the smacking of children and creating a new body to oversee search and rescue services .
to have a chance of becoming law , the proposal now has to go to the new assembly petitions committee , which will decide where it goes for further discussion at cardiff bay .
at the same time , the assembly government is trying to acquire the powers to pass laws in environmental areas .
sustainability minister jane davidson said she welcomed the outcome and added that she personally supported the ban .
i do n't think that most retailers , the average butcher and baker , can afford paper alwyn evans , packaging manufacturer ms davidson said : " the banning of plastic bags is an issue i raised last month at the assembly when i announced that we were seeking powers to help make wales a greener , cleaner place .
" these new powers would allow the assembly to consider a ban on plastic bags . "
the legislative competence order -lrb- lco -rrb- seeking powers in environmental protection and waste management was published on 18 june .
this would allow the assembly to consider a ban on plastic bags , should it receive the backing of members .
according to the environmental group friends of the earth , eight billion plastic carrier bags are handed out in the uk annually .
it also said that wales has one of the worst recycling records in europe and that the " throwaway society had left a legacy of badly managed landfill sites . "
however the director of a packaging company in cardiff , which distributes around two million plastic bags a month , said the ban would not lower carbon emissions .
if i ruled wales will put forward the petition for ams to consider " if you transport 100,000 paper bags , it takes a whole trailer .
to transport 100,000 polythene bags , it 's one pallet , " said alwyn evans , of william jones packaging ltd .
" the biggest problem with polythene bags is the disposal .
you can put them into landfill sites but they 're so tightly compacted , even if they 're degradable , they do n't break down .
" all polythene can be recycled .
it can be used for garden benches , bollards , street furniture .
there 's no reason why it should n't be used again . "
mr evans added : " i do n't think that most retailers , the average butcher and baker , can afford paper .
" if we can use more re-useable bags which we do sell as well , i think that is the better answer . "
some supermarkets and retailers are currently reviewing ways of limiting use of non-degradable bags .
tesco has started a so-called " naked deliveries " service , allowing customers to receive ordered goods without bags .
shoppers in ireland have been charged for bags since 2002 , a move which has significantly cut their usage but proposals to introduce a similar scheme in scotland were rejected .

construction of the racecourse on the site of a former open-cast mine at trimsaran is already underway .
the first racing on the ffos las course will take place in 2009 .
the project 's second phase includes an equestrian centre which will be a training venue for competitors in the 2012 london olympics .
the ffos las course will be the third in wales , along with chepstow and bangor-on-dee .
the course , with a grandstand for up to 1,000 spectators , is being built on the site of the 608-acre ffos las mine , which shut 10 years ago .
unbelievable asset planning consent was first given by carmarthenshire council in 2003 , but the application was extended and final approval was granted earlier this year .
the developers walters group describe the course as a massive regeneration project turning coal gust and slag into grass and sport .
david thursfield , director of ffos las , said the development would provide an " unbelievable asset " both for tourism and employment in the area .
the course is expected to attract horse owners and punters from as far away as ireland .
it will be wales ' equivalent of aintree , the liverpool racecourse , he said .
a hotel , pub and restaurant and up to 250 homes are also planned for the former coal mine site .
" there 's going to be around 150 construction jobs and between 50 and 100 permanent jobs in the future , " mr thursfield said .
" with the size of the site there is potential for a lot , lot more .
it 's going to be massive .
the area 's coming on in leaps and bounds . "
sixteen horse meetings a year have been scheduled for the course already by the british horse racing board .
once completed the course will be the first national hunt racecourse - with jumps - to be built in the uk for 80 years .
among those present at the launch was former wales and british lions rugby player jonathan davies who once worked at the mine .
he said : " i stand here as a very , very proud trimsaran boy .
" it 's a fantastic incredible change , with all the development in the area .
" this racecourse will bring great prosperity to the area - the area deserves it and so do the people . "
another new flat horse racing course in essex is due to open this year .

construction of the racecourse on the site of a former open-cast mine at trimsaran is already underway .
the first racing on the ffos las course will take place in 2009 .
the project 's second phase includes an equestrian centre which will be a training venue for competitors in the 2012 london olympics .
the ffos las course will be the third in wales , along with chepstow and bangor-on-dee .
the course , with a grandstand for up to 1,000 spectators , is being built on the site of the 608-acre ffos las mine , which shut 10 years ago .
unbelievable asset planning consent was first given by carmarthenshire council in 2003 , but the application was extended and final approval was granted earlier this year .
the developers walters group describe the course as a massive regeneration project turning coal gust and slag into grass and sport .
david thursfield , director of ffos las , said the development would provide an " unbelievable asset " both for tourism and employment in the area .
the course is expected to attract horse owners and punters from as far away as ireland .
it will be wales ' equivalent of aintree , the liverpool racecourse , he said .
construction of the horse racing course has already begun a hotel , pub and restaurant and up to 250 homes are also planned for the former coal mine site .
" there 's going to be around 150 construction jobs and between 50 and 100 permanent jobs in the future , " mr thursfield said .
" with the size of the site there is potential for a lot , lot more .
it 's going to be massive .
the area 's coming on in leaps and bounds . "
sixteen horse meetings a year have been scheduled for the course already by the british horse racing board .
once completed the course will be the first national hunt racecourse - with jumps - to be built in the uk for 80 years .
among those present at the launch was former wales and british lions rugby player jonathan davies who once worked at the mine .
he said : " i stand here as a very , very proud trimsaran boy .
" it 's a fantastic incredible change , with all the development in the area .
" this racecourse will bring great prosperity to the area - the area deserves it and so do the people . "
another new flat horse racing course in essex is due to open this year .

friends of the earth -lrb- foe -rrb- is unhappy at opposition from pembrokeshire coast national park for six new turbines at pendine , carmarthenshire .
foe claimed the park authority 's main objection seemed to be they would spoil the view from tenby , 8.7 miles away .
but an authority spokesman said it had a duty to " preserve and enhance the natural beauty of the park " .
the foe claimed the park was willing to support fossil fuel developments but not renewable energy .
spokesman gordon james said : " the national park authority 's main reason for objecting is that the wind turbines would be visible from parts of tenby , which is approximately 14 kilometres -lrb- 8.7 miles -rrb- away , and then , it seems , only on clear days .
" we find it bizarre that an authority that is meant to protect the natural environment should object to turbines that will help reduce the impacts of climate change and which lie outside of its boundary .
" it has not objected to the far greater visual impact of the lng facilities at milford haven - the authority appears to be willing to give the green light to large fossil fuel developments whilst fussing negatively about the lesser landscape impacts of renewable energy . "
singled-out there are five turbines already in place at parc cynog in pendine - which were granted on appeal .
the park authority has refuted the claims by the environmental campaign group .
a spokesman said its duty " obviously means looking at proposals that will have an impact on the national park " .
he added : " the park authority is not anti-renewable energy - a number of schemes have been approved with in the park area . "
he said mr james seemed to be singling out the park authority , as the council for the protection of rural wales and the countryside council for wales had also objected .
" that combined body of opinion should not be set aside and council members will , i hope , take note of the very real concerns that have been expressed , " he added .
the application will be considered by carmarthenshire council 's planning committee at a later date .

nine other marines were wounded and at least four rebels were killed during the incident on basilan island .
the clash took place as the marines were searching for an italian priest .
the priest was seized in june by kidnappers believed to be from either abu sayyaf or the moro islamic liberation front .
both groups are seeking an independent islamic state in the southern philippines .
ceasefire violation ?
the priest , named as giancarlo bossi , was seized by armed men near the coastal village of bulawan near zamboanga on 10 june .
father bossi was seized by armed men on his way to church marine spokesman lt col ariel caculitan said the marines ran into a group of some 300 armed men during their search for him , triggering the clash .
lt col caculitan said that 14 marines had been killed .
the number of rebels who died is unconfirmed , but reports vary from four to at least 20 .
initially , the military assumed that the rebels were mainly from the abu sayyaf group - the smallest but deadliest of several islamic groups fighting the philippine government .
but army officers say that abu sayyaf gunmen do not have a presence in the area where rev bossi was kidnapped .
a spokesman for the moro islamic liberation front -lrb- milf -rrb- later confirmed that some its members had been involved in the clash , despite the fact the milf is currently engaged in peace talks with the government .
mohagher iqbal , the chief negotiator for the milf , said the marines had attacked one of the group 's strongholds , violating a ceasefire agreement , and that his forces had therefore fought back .
" the incident could have been avoided if the government had co-ordinated with our forces in basilan before they actually moved in , " he told reporters .
but he denied that the milf was responsible for the beheadings , or that it was involved in the kidnapping of the priest .

the leadership of the former rebel sudan people 's liberation movement , which now runs the south , is meeting to decide its future policies .

calls to uganda are charged at a local rate , while those to khartoum are international .
the northern sudanese networks do not work very well in the south , which were cut off for during the 21-year war , which ended in 2005 .
during the conflict , aid agencies ran their operations from kenya and many southerners have more links to neighbouring countries than northern sudan , so the ugandan mobile set-up suits them very well . "
this -lsb- elections -rsb- is the most crucial issue in sudan " alex de waal sudan analyst while the north is subject to islamic sharia law , with the streets of the capital deserted after 2000 at night , alcohol and nightclubs are easily found in juba , a sleepy provincial town which is experiencing a massive building boom in case it becomes an international capital in four years ' time .
gaudy neon signs can be seen flashing in the giant mango trees which line the river nile , while huge stacks of speakers blare out the latest rap and r ' n ' b releases from kenya and the united states .
southern leader ?
under a 2005 peace deal , the splm is running south sudan until the referendum and joins president omar al-bashir 's national congress party in a government of national unity .
it has been generally assumed that the plebiscite was bound to lead to independence but splm officials are not taking that for granted .
" if we win elections , and a southerner becomes national president , we would no longer have any reason to leave , " one senior splm official who did not want to be named told the bbc news website .
the same prospect is raised by several former splm fighters .
with just two years to go before the elections are due , there is little sign of much preparation .
but splm spokesman samson kwaje is confident that the elections will take place and says his movement is taking advantage of the peace to build up nationwide structures .
" we are busy trying to transform ourselves into a fully fledged political party .
we are recruiting members nationwide , " he said .
' unpopular ' preparations for the polls are behind schedule but work has begun on a national census , which would enable officials to divide the country into constituencies .
sudan analyst alex de waal says the international community is making a serious error concentrating so much on the conflict in darfur and ignoring the polls which could transform the country .
" this is the most crucial issue in sudan , " he told the bbc news website .
although the splm was vilified in government-controlled areas during the war , mr de waal says they would win a reasonable number of votes in the north , to bolster their southern heartlands , and so could win a nationwide majority .
but could a southerner really win national elections against the ncp , which has been in power since a 1989 coup ?
" in a popular vote , the splm would defeat the ncp , but they are badly organised , " says mr de waal of the new-york based social science research council .
" the ncp is deeply unpopular . "
nevertheless , mr de waal says that no single party can hope to win an election on its own .
he says the splm must forge an alliance with one of three groups : the ncp ; the northern opposition , which it already has links to ; the non-arab groups in darfur and the east - assuming it is possible to hold elections in darfur .
mr kwaje says the splm has not yet decided which groups , if any , it will contest the elections with .
he said it would depend on the other groups ' manifestos and , of course , how capable they are of delivering votes .
on a possible alliance with the ncp , he says it depends on how the peace deal is implemented .
ruling alliance earlier this year , southern leader salva kiir made an angry speech , accusing the ncp of not keeping its side of the bargain .
some analysts say that renewed conflict is more likely than national elections . "
as of now , our only candidate is bashir " ghazi salahuddin , ncp but mr kwaje dismissed such fears and said relations between the splm and the ncp were improving .
senior ncp official ghazi salahuddin told the bbc his party was " disposed to have an alliance with the splm " .
this would probably be a winning combination of the splm 's popularity and the ncp 's organisation but who would be their presidential candidate ?
charismatic former splm leader john garang would have been a strong contender but he died just a few months after the peace deal was signed , to be replaced by the rather dour salva kiir .
if the splm is to achieve its dream of winning the presidency , it should find an alternative candidate , says mr de waal .
' attractive ' khartoum street vendor osman agrees that garang would have made a stronger candidate but says he would still prefer mr kiir to mr bashir .
he says the racial and religious differences would not be a factor in his vote .
" we are all sudanese - i trust kiir , " he said as he struggled to sell a box load of digital watches .
mr salahuddin says he sees no reason why a southerner could not become national leader in future elections but " as of now , our only candidate is bashir . "
he does admit , though that a southern leader could make unity " more attractive " .
mr kwaje says the peace deal explicitly forbids any party campaigning to remove sharia law in northern sudan but does not rule out adding that to the splm manifesto in future - if the south remains part of sudan .
he insists , though , that even if a southerner does become national president , the referendum would still be held .
" we will still give the people the chance to decide . "

southern leader ?
under a 2005 peace deal , the splm is running south sudan until the referendum and joins president omar al-bashir 's national congress party in a government of national unity .
it has been generally assumed that the plebiscite was bound to lead to independence but splm officials are not taking that for granted .
" if we win elections , and a southerner becomes national president , we would no longer have any reason to leave , " one senior splm official who did not want to be named told the bbc news website .
the same prospect is raised by several former splm fighters .
with just two years to go before the elections are due , there is little sign of much preparation .
but splm spokesman samson kwaje is confident that the elections will take place and says his movement is taking advantage of the peace to build up nationwide structures .
" we are busy trying to transform ourselves into a fully fledged political party .
we are recruiting members nationwide , " he said .
' unpopular ' preparations for the polls are behind schedule but work has begun on a national census , which would enable officials to divide the country into constituencies .
sudan analyst alex de waal says the international community is making a serious error concentrating so much on the conflict in darfur and ignoring the polls which could transform the country .
salva kiir does not have the charisma of john garang " this is the most crucial issue in sudan , " he told the bbc news website .
although the splm was vilified in government-controlled areas during the war , mr de waal says they would win a reasonable number of votes in the north , to bolster their southern heartlands , and so could win a nationwide majority .
but could a southerner really win national elections against the ncp , which has been in power since a 1989 coup ?
" in a popular vote , the splm would defeat the ncp , but they are badly organised , " says mr de waal of the new-york based social science research council .
" the ncp is deeply unpopular . "
nevertheless , mr de waal says that no single party can hope to win an election on its own .
he says the splm must forge an alliance with one of three groups : the ncp ; the northern opposition , which it already has links to ; the non-arab groups in darfur and the east - assuming it is possible to hold elections in darfur .
mr kwaje says the splm has not yet decided which groups , if any , it will contest the elections with .
he said it would depend on the other groups ' manifestos and , of course , how capable they are of delivering votes .
on a possible alliance with the ncp , he says it depends on how the peace deal is implemented .
ruling alliance earlier this year , southern leader salva kiir made an angry speech , accusing the ncp of not keeping its side of the bargain .
some analysts say that renewed conflict is more likely than national elections .
as of now , our only candidate is bashir ghazi salahuddin , ncp but mr kwaje dismissed such fears and said relations between the splm and the ncp were improving .
senior ncp official ghazi salahuddin told the bbc his party was " disposed to have an alliance with the splm " .
this would probably be a winning combination of the splm 's popularity and the ncp 's organisation but who would be their presidential candidate ?
charismatic former splm leader john garang would have been a strong contender but he died just a few months after the peace deal was signed , to be replaced by the rather dour salva kiir .
if the splm is to achieve its dream of winning the presidency , it should find an alternative candidate , says mr de waal .
' attractive ' khartoum street vendor osman agrees that garang would have made a stronger candidate but says he would still prefer mr kiir to mr bashir .
he says the racial and religious differences would not be a factor in his vote .
juba is changing from a sleepy town to a capital city " we are all sudanese - i trust kiir , " he said as he struggled to sell a box load of digital watches .
mr salahuddin says he sees no reason why a southerner could not become national leader in future elections but " as of now , our only candidate is bashir . "
he does admit , though that a southern leader could make unity " more attractive " .
mr kwaje says the peace deal explicitly forbids any party campaigning to remove sharia law in northern sudan but does not rule out adding that to the splm manifesto in future - if the south remains part of sudan .
he insists , though , that even if a southerner does become national president , the referendum would still be held .

as of now , our only candidate is bashir ghazi salahuddin , ncp but mr kwaje dismissed such fears and said relations between the splm and the ncp were improving .
senior ncp official ghazi salahuddin told the bbc his party was " disposed to have an alliance with the splm " .
this would probably be a winning combination of the splm 's popularity and the ncp 's organisation but who would be their presidential candidate ?
charismatic former splm leader john garang would have been a strong contender but he died just a few months after the peace deal was signed , to be replaced by the rather dour salva kiir .
if the splm is to achieve its dream of winning the presidency , it should find an alternative candidate , says mr de waal .
' attractive ' khartoum street vendor osman agrees that garang would have made a stronger candidate but says he would still prefer mr kiir to mr bashir .
he says the racial and religious differences would not be a factor in his vote .
juba is changing from a sleepy town to a capital city " we are all sudanese - i trust kiir , " he said as he struggled to sell a box load of digital watches .
mr salahuddin says he sees no reason why a southerner could not become national leader in future elections but " as of now , our only candidate is bashir . "
he does admit , though that a southern leader could make unity " more attractive " .
mr kwaje says the peace deal explicitly forbids any party campaigning to remove sharia law in northern sudan but does not rule out adding that to the splm manifesto in future - if the south remains part of sudan .
he insists , though , that even if a southerner does become national president , the referendum would still be held .
" we will still give the people the chance to decide . "

the leadership of the former rebel sudan people 's liberation movement , which now runs the south , is meeting to decide its future policies .
mainly animist and christian south sudan feels like a completely different country to the largely muslim , arab-speaking north .
visitors need a separate visa for the two regions and the writ of the authorities in khartoum counts for hardly anything south of the internal border .
in the southern capital , juba , the most common mobile phone network is operated from uganda , with a + 256 code , not the + 249 for khartoum .
calls to uganda are charged at a local rate , while those to khartoum are international .
the northern sudanese networks do not work very well in the south , which were cut off for during the 21-year war , which ended in 2005 .
during the conflict , aid agencies ran their operations from kenya and many southerners have more links to neighbouring countries than northern sudan , so the ugandan mobile set-up suits them very well .
this -lsb- elections -rsb- is the most crucial issue in sudan alex de waal sudan analyst while the north is subject to islamic sharia law , with the streets of the capital deserted after 2000 at night , alcohol and nightclubs are easily found in juba , a sleepy provincial town which is experiencing a massive building boom in case it becomes an international capital in four years ' time .
gaudy neon signs can be seen flashing in the giant mango trees which line the river nile , while huge stacks of speakers blare out the latest rap and r ' n ' b releases from kenya and the united states .
southern leader ?
under a 2005 peace deal , the splm is running south sudan until the referendum and joins president omar al-bashir 's national congress party in a government of national unity .
it has been generally assumed that the plebiscite was bound to lead to independence but splm officials are not taking that for granted .
" if we win elections , and a southerner becomes national president , we would no longer have any reason to leave , " one senior splm official who did not want to be named told the bbc news website .
the same prospect is raised by several former splm fighters .
with just two years to go before the elections are due , there is little sign of much preparation .
but splm spokesman samson kwaje is confident that the elections will take place and says his movement is taking advantage of the peace to build up nationwide structures .
" we are busy trying to transform ourselves into a fully fledged political party .
we are recruiting members nationwide , " he said .
' unpopular ' preparations for the polls are behind schedule but work has begun on a national census , which would enable officials to divide the country into constituencies .
sudan analyst alex de waal says the international community is making a serious error concentrating so much on the conflict in darfur and ignoring the polls which could transform the country .
salva kiir does not have the charisma of john garang " this is the most crucial issue in sudan , " he told the bbc news website .
although the splm was vilified in government-controlled areas during the war , mr de waal says they would win a reasonable number of votes in the north , to bolster their southern heartlands , and so could win a nationwide majority .
but could a southerner really win national elections against the ncp , which has been in power since a 1989 coup ?
" in a popular vote , the splm would defeat the ncp , but they are badly organised , " says mr de waal of the new-york based social science research council .
" the ncp is deeply unpopular . "
nevertheless , mr de waal says that no single party can hope to win an election on its own .
he says the splm must forge an alliance with one of three groups : the ncp ; the northern opposition , which it already has links to ; the non-arab groups in darfur and the east - assuming it is possible to hold elections in darfur .
mr kwaje says the splm has not yet decided which groups , if any , it will contest the elections with .
he said it would depend on the other groups ' manifestos and , of course , how capable they are of delivering votes .
on a possible alliance with the ncp , he says it depends on how the peace deal is implemented .
ruling alliance earlier this year , southern leader salva kiir made an angry speech , accusing the ncp of not keeping its side of the bargain .
some analysts say that renewed conflict is more likely than national elections .
as of now , our only candidate is bashir ghazi salahuddin , ncp but mr kwaje dismissed such fears and said relations between the splm and the ncp were improving .

mr kim assured consumers that the firm had taken steps to resolve concerns over many xbox 360s being returned because of faults .

the black elite console has a 120gb hard drive and outputs high definition video through a digital connection .
microsoft 's shane kim said he did not think recent reports of faulty xbox 360s would damage future sales .
speaking ahead of the e3 games show , he added there were no plans for an xbox 360 price cut , saying they were " very comfortable with the price " .
" we are selling the elite console as fast as we can make them , " he said of the black xbox 360 , but was unable to give specific sales figures .
he said microsoft felt no need to reduce prices in light of sony 's cut of $ 100 -lrb- £ 50 -rrb- from the cost of the 60gb ps3 .
" since our rivals launched last year , in the us we are neck and neck with the wii and we are just about double the sales of playstation 3 , " he added .
mr kim , microsoft 's corporate vice president of microsoft game studios , said he did not feel sony had genuinely cut prices as the firm had maintained a $ 600 -lrb- £ 300 -rrb- price point for the 80gb ps3 .
" we really feel like we are driving the next generation console market , " he said .
mr kim assured consumers that the firm had taken steps to resolve concerns over many xbox 360s being returned because of faults .
the firm has set aside more than $ 1bn -lrb- £ 500m -rrb- to cover the cost of offering extended warranties .
' remove concerns ' " it 's been somewhat positive because we had been able to remove people 's concerns and show that we are standing behind the product .
" customers have responded very well - reaction has been neutral to positive . "
a new halo 3 trailer was shown microsoft also used the e3 press conference to reaffirm its commitment to a video download service for xbox users in canada and europe .
" we 're launching in uk and ireland , france and germany first and then rolling out to other countries as soon as we can , " he said .
in the us , xbox lives ' video marketplace offers more than 2,100 hours of content from 28 networks and studios , with nearly 500 hours of high definition content .
a microsoft press conference in santa monica highlighted some of the key titles being launched on xbox 360 this year , including halo 3 and grand theft auto iv .
a new trailer for halo 3 was shown , featuring some of the first video of the single-player campaign in action .
microsoft also unveiled a " digital short film " made by neill blomkamp , who had been ear-marked for the stalled halo movie , in conjunction with peter jackson 's special effects wizards weta workshop and origami digital .
the company also trumpeted another title to move to the xbox 360 after years of nintendo and playstation exclusivity : resident evil 5 will make its debut on the console next year .
the award-winning first-person shooter gears of wars was also unveiled for windows pcs .

the number of moles may offer an indication of how quickly the body ages , a study suggests .
king 's college london scientists compared key ageing dna with the number of moles in a study of 1,800 twins .
they found the more moles a person had , the more likely their dna was to have the properties to fight off ageing .
the study , in the cancer epidemiology biomarkers and prevention journal , contrasts with the link between a high mole-count and high skin cancer risk .
moles appear in childhood and disappear from middle age onwards .
when present in large numbers they can increase the risk of melanoma , a rare form of skin cancer .
moles vary significantly in numbers and size between individuals .
it 's important people know that having a large number of moles can increase your risk of skin cancer dr kat arney , of cancer research uk the average number of moles in people with white skin is 30 but some people may have as many as 400 .
the reason for such differences between people is unknown as is the function of moles .
since moles disappear with age , scientists looked at the relationship between the number of moles and telomere length in cells , which is a good indicator of the rate of ageing in organs such as the heart , muscle , bones and arteries .
telomeres , which get shorter as we age , are bundles of dna found at the end of chromosomes in all cells and assist in the protection , replication , and stabilisation of the chromosome ends .
they have been compared with the plastic tips on shoelaces because they prevent chromosome ends from fraying and sticking to each other .
' exciting ' in the study , researchers found those with more than 100 moles had longer telomeres than those with fewer than 25 .
the difference between the two mole groups was equivalent to six to seven years of ageing .
lead researcher dr veronique bataille said : " the results of this study are very exciting as they show , for the first time , that moley people who have a slightly increased risk of melanoma may , on the other hand , have the benefit of a reduced rate of ageing .
" this could imply susceptibility to fewer age-related diseases such as heart disease or osteoporosis , for example .
further studies are needed to confirm these findings . "
dr kat arney , of cancer research uk , said : " while this is an intriguing finding and deserves further investigation , it 's important people know that having a large number of moles can increase your risk of skin cancer .
" it 's especially important to enjoy the sun safely if you have lots of moles or burn easily . "

the uk 's information commissioner richard thomas said bosses must take the personal data of both customers and staff seriously .
orange , barclays and natwest are three of the firms he has rapped this year .
the ministry of justice said prison sentences could be given to those who deliberately misuse personal data .
mr thomas received nearly 24,000 enquiries and complaints about personal information issues in 2006-07 .
his report said 56.5 % of these required only advice and guidance , while a breach was likely to have happened in 35 % of cases , of which a further 77 % resulted in remedial action .
" frankly these are inexcusable .

no .

" we 're leaving these electronic footprints right through our lives these days , " he said .
the annual report also highlighted a recent glitch on the medical training application service website which left trainee doctors ' personal details open to public view .

and in the public sector , a breach of online security in the foreign and commonwealth office meant that people hoping to come to the uk from india had their personal information visible to others .
the child support agency also gave rise to concern over its use of passwords by temporary staff .

" my message to those at the top of organisations is to respect the privacy of individuals and the integrity of the information held about them , to embrace data protection positively and to be sure you are not the business or political leader who failed to take information rights seriously . "
mr thomas said he wanted greater powers to check on companies ' behaviour , principally the right to carry out an inspection without a firm 's permission .
but a ministry of justice spokeswoman insisted the commissioner " already had adequate powers " and had received additional funding for the past two years .
a spokesman for john lewis said while the public might be concerned , data collected by stores was not used in " customer-specific ways " .

the ministry of justice said prison sentences could be given to those who deliberately misuse personal data .
mr thomas received nearly 24,000 enquiries and complaints about personal information issues in 2006-07 .
his report said 56.5 % of these required only advice and guidance , while a breach was likely to have happened in 35 % of cases , of which a further 77 % resulted in remedial action .

the institutions were hbos , alliance & leicester , royal bank of scotland , scarborough building society , clydesdale bank , natwest , united national bank , barclays bank , co-operative bank , hfc bank and nationwide building society .
the probe followed evidence from the bbc 's watchdog programme which found information including details of a bank transfer for £ 500,000 outside a nottingham branch of the royal bank of scotland .
they promised to comply with the data protection act following the investigation and can be prosecuted if they fail .
hackers target tk maxx hackers stole information from millions of customers ' payment cards after targeting tk maxx 's data centre in watford .
the information was stolen over 16 months from july 2005 and covered credit and debit card transactions as far back as december 2002 .
the cause of the theft , its full extent and effect on customers are not known , but for most people the stolen card details would no longer have been relevant .
tk maxx said it had been working to strengthen the security of its computer systems since the crime 's discovery .
the information commissioner 's office is now considering its next step in the investigation after receiving information from the company .
doctors ' website accessed by all the website used by junior doctors to apply for jobs in the nhs is being investigated after personal information was found to be visible online .

the department is carrying out its own internal investigation and will report back to the commissioner .
orange ' not secure ' mobile phone company orange was criticised for not keeping its customers ' personal information secure .
it was investigated after the ico received a complaint about the way orange processed personal information .
new staff shared user names and passwords when accessing the company it system , which meant that information could be accessed by unauthorised members of staff .
orange was ordered to sign an undertaking to comply with the rules of the data protection act .
an orange spokesman said the security of customer information was " paramount " to the company .
littlewoods unwanted mail a customer of home shopping firm littlewoods complained after trying to stop the company using her information to send her sales material .
