the french company owns about one third of nissan .
the newspaper said exploratory talks between chrysler and gm had begun . quoting automotive-industry sources , it said it was unlikely that gm , the world 's biggest carmaker , would take over the us subsidiary of daimlerchrysler outright .
both companies have declined comment on the speculation . " we often have discussions with automakers routinely , " gm spokesman tony cervone told reuters news agency .
" we do n't comment on speculation regarding discussions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was this zetsche 's last time in a chrysler ?
an alliance would mean gm and chrysler remain separate companies , but keeps open the possibility of cross-shareholding and the ability to act as a single company in product development , production and sales , the german daily said . chrysler chief executive tom lasorda said he wants to more than double global sales through new alliances , the wall street journal reported friday . advantages for both companies the initiative for the talks had come from chrysler .
sources familiar with the talks said that if a link-up were to be to gm 's advantage , the us group would contemplate such an arrangement . speculation since mid-week has driven daimlerchrysler stock higher this week , making it the top stock in frankfurt 's dax index for three straight days .
despite profit taking friday , it closed 1.3 percent higher at 54.12 euros -lrb- $ 72.45 -rrb- . chrysler is struggling with a slump in profitability as americans turn away from its range of big cars and favor imports .
the german arm of daimlerchrysler , mercedes , is in relatively healthy condition . daimlerchrysler 's chief executive dieter zetsche said he was reviewing " further strategic options " for chrysler and not ruling out any possibilities for the us carmaker 's future at an annual conference held on wednesday . automotive news europe had earlier reported top-level talks on an outright merger , but the süddeutsche zeitung said gm had too many problems of its own and would not want to bring another struggling company on board . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : dr. z 's emergency operation german and european editorials on thursday focused on major job cuts at chrysler and the announcement at daimlerchryler headquarters that a sale of the us carmaker was an option on the table .

" it all depends on what happens tomorrow night , " weber had said on friday while sitting between packed-up boxes filled with promotional material in his company 's booth at the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- , where the buzz of previous days had already disappeared as most vendors were preparing to head home . bursting at the seams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's gropius bau museum ca n't hold the entire efm one of the world 's most important trading places for movies with some 19,000 attendees and 702 films on offer , the efm picked up steam in recent years after the american film market in los angeles was moved from february to november .
the market at the cannes film festival meanwhile still rules supreme . the boom in berlin has led to some to complain that market organizers had to find a bigger venue to keep all vendors under one roof instead of spreading them out over several locations .
according to news reports , efm head beki probst has already hired a consultancy firm to help her figure out how to deal with growth of 10 percent to 15 percent next year . many meetings , slow sales ? film industry trade magazines also quoted sellers and buyers , who were not impressed with the amount of business they had done at the market this year .
but weber joined others in saying that he had no reason to complain . " we 've had a lot of meetings , " he said , adding that " yella " has been sold to several countries - including switzerland , austria , portugal , greece and britain . exportable films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie , starring german actress nina hoss , will open in germany in october " yella , " which tells the story of an east german woman who goes to west germany in search of a better life , has received good reviews in the german press even though some movie critics left the theater scratching their heads because of the film 's twisted end . trade magazines such as the hollywood reporter and screen even saw the film embarking on an international career . " the elegant quasi-thriller chic of ' yella ' could prove -lrb- petzold 's -rrb- most exportable yet , if adventurous art house buyers take the bait , " read a screen review . first europe , then the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nina hoss with her bear weber said that " yella " would first have to sell well in europe before going elsewhere . " it 's a little cold for latin america , " he said . a certain bear-shaped trophy - even nina hoss ' silver one - might change all that , of course . " it 's happened before that someone had to double their offer " after a film won awards , weber said .
" but it 's also happened that someone revised an offer because of a bad review .

the french company owns about one third of nissan .
the newspaper said exploratory talks between chrysler and gm had begun . quoting automotive-industry sources , it said it was unlikely that gm , the world 's biggest carmaker , would take over the us subsidiary of daimlerchrysler outright .
both companies have declined comment on the speculation . " we often have discussions with automakers routinely , " gm spokesman tony cervone told reuters news agency .
" we do n't comment on speculation regarding discussions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was this zetsche 's last time in a chrysler ?
an alliance would mean gm and chrysler remain separate companies , but keeps open the possibility of cross-shareholding and the ability to act as a single company in product development , production and sales , the german daily said . chrysler chief executive tom lasorda said he wants to more than double global sales through new alliances , the wall street journal reported friday . advantages for both companies the initiative for the talks had come from chrysler .
sources familiar with the talks said that if a link-up were to be to gm 's advantage , the us group would contemplate such an arrangement . speculation since mid-week has driven daimlerchrysler stock higher this week , making it the top stock in frankfurt 's dax index for three straight days .
despite profit taking friday , it closed 1.3 percent higher at 54.12 euros -lrb- $ 72.45 -rrb- . chrysler is struggling with a slump in profitability as americans turn away from its range of big cars and favor imports .
the german arm of daimlerchrysler , mercedes , is in relatively healthy condition . daimlerchrysler 's chief executive dieter zetsche said he was reviewing " further strategic options " for chrysler and not ruling out any possibilities for the us carmaker 's future at an annual conference held on wednesday . automotive news europe had earlier reported top-level talks on an outright merger , but the süddeutsche zeitung said gm had too many problems of its own and would not want to bring another struggling company on board . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : dr. z 's emergency operation german and european editorials on thursday focused on major job cuts at chrysler and the announcement at daimlerchryler headquarters that a sale of the us carmaker was an option on the table .

in french abortion clinics , however , women 's right to decide for themselves what to do with their bodies is sometimes illusory . while portugal is currently liberalizing its laws to allow abortion up to the 10th week of pregnancy , french women have already had the right since 1975 .
the law , named after then-health minister simone veil , leaves it to the woman alone to decide whether to have an abortion .
it also requires every larger hospital to have a special service for abortions .
the veil law was amended in 2001 to allow abortions up to the 12th week of pregnancy .
since then even minors may in some cases have abortions without parental consent . but , in practice , not every woman is able to take advantage of those guaranteed rights , according to francoise laurant , head of the family planning organization mouvement francais pour le planning familiale -lrb- mfpf -rrb- . many hospitals do n't have enough personal , so that , during vacation times , women wanting abortions end up on ever longer waiting lists , she said .
some women discover then that they legal time limit has passed for them to have an abortion in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simone veil , here as president of the european parliament in 1979 " sometimes , the woman is then told , ' you can still get an abortion in holland or spain , " ' laurent said .
" but often the personnel tell the woman , ' that 's your problem ! '
and there are hospitals where it 's made difficult for a woman who wants to have a second abortion . " when abortion clinics do work well , it 's usually due to a doctor 's personal commitment - often because he or she remembers that so many women used to die or fall ill from botched illegal abortions , laurent added .
new generation unaware laurant said many of the doctors currently working in french abortion clinics were part of the 1970s women 's movement as medical students .
that means they have now nearly reached retirement age .
mfpf surveyed several regions in france to get an idea of how the situation would be in a few years , she said .
the results were alarming : there wo n't be any more doctors prepared to carry out abortions within two or three years . a recently completed doctor 's thesis about the amount of time and extent to which french medical students learn about abortion and contraception also determined that information on the subjects was desperately lacking .
furthermore , new doctors find it hard to imagine what life was like for women before abortion was made legal .
doctors ' arrogance working in abortion clinics is poorly paid and held in low esteem , and is thus unappealing to young doctors .
in addition , there 's an arrogance within the medical establishment , according to gynecologist marie-laure brival . for centuries , the male body was considered the measure of all things in the medical world .
doctors only turned their attention to the singularities of the female body when they decided they wanted to do more to improve the health of unborn children , brival said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french women have the right to decide whether to give birth or abort - theoretically " even today , doctors ' volition to control a woman 's body is still very strong , " she said .
" they dictate contraceptives to women .
they make contraception the norm .
it 's really up to a woman to make decisions about her own body .
a woman 's fertility gives her the choice .
it 's sometimes very painful to decide whether one wants a child or not .
but this freedom of choice is actually women 's exclusive right . " doctors are n't alone in viewing women 's bodies in this controlling manner .
in the late 1990s , commando actions against french abortion clinics modeled on the pro-life movement in the united states increased in number : militant so-called " protectors of life " insulted women on their way to having abortions , chained themselves to operating rooms , berated personnel . france made such actions illegal in 1993 .
always an issue these days , the " protectors of life " focus on lobbying and appeal to politicians to give the unborn a legal status and right to life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese voters called for liberalization of their abortion law in a referendum the women 's movement continues to fight a woman 's right to choose across europe .
poland has become an example in this respect : for 40 years , abortion was allowed there .
now it 's only permitted in exceptional cases and the government has said it will introduce a total ban . despite the planned changes to portugal 's law , laurant said she did n't think it was time yet to relax on the abortion front .
she recounted a recent inquiry from a journalist on the legal status of abortion across europe , asking when the right would be irreversible . " i told her : ' there will never become an irreversible right , " ' laurant said .
" it 's enough for a country to go through a political change or a religious group to put the government under pressure demanding abortion is banned during important talks .

in french abortion clinics , however , women 's right to decide for themselves what to do with their bodies is sometimes illusory . while portugal is currently liberalizing its laws to allow abortion up to the 10th week of pregnancy , french women have already had the right since 1975 .
the law , named after then-health minister simone veil , leaves it to the woman alone to decide whether to have an abortion .

the veil law was amended in 2001 to allow abortions up to the 12th week of pregnancy .

mfpf surveyed several regions in france to get an idea of how the situation would be in a few years , she said .
the results were alarming : there wo n't be any more doctors prepared to carry out abortions within two or three years . a recently completed doctor 's thesis about the amount of time and extent to which french medical students learn about abortion and contraception also determined that information on the subjects was desperately lacking .
furthermore , new doctors find it hard to imagine what life was like for women before abortion was made legal .
doctors ' arrogance working in abortion clinics is poorly paid and held in low esteem , and is thus unappealing to young doctors .
in addition , there 's an arrogance within the medical establishment , according to gynecologist marie-laure brival . for centuries , the male body was considered the measure of all things in the medical world .

in french abortion clinics , however , women 's right to decide for themselves what to do with their bodies is sometimes illusory . while portugal is currently liberalizing its laws to allow abortion up to the 10th week of pregnancy , french women have already had the right since 1975 .
the law , named after then-health minister simone veil , leaves it to the woman alone to decide whether to have an abortion .
it also requires every larger hospital to have a special service for abortions .
the veil law was amended in 2001 to allow abortions up to the 12th week of pregnancy .
since then even minors may in some cases have abortions without parental consent . but , in practice , not every woman is able to take advantage of those guaranteed rights , according to francoise laurant , head of the family planning organization mouvement francais pour le planning familiale -lrb- mfpf -rrb- . many hospitals do n't have enough personal , so that , during vacation times , women wanting abortions end up on ever longer waiting lists , she said .
some women discover then that they legal time limit has passed for them to have an abortion in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simone veil , here as president of the european parliament in 1979 " sometimes , the woman is then told , ' you can still get an abortion in holland or spain , " ' laurent said .
" but often the personnel tell the woman , ' that 's your problem ! '
and there are hospitals where it 's made difficult for a woman who wants to have a second abortion . " when abortion clinics do work well , it 's usually due to a doctor 's personal commitment - often because he or she remembers that so many women used to die or fall ill from botched illegal abortions , laurent added .
new generation unaware laurant said many of the doctors currently working in french abortion clinics were part of the 1970s women 's movement as medical students .
that means they have now nearly reached retirement age .
mfpf surveyed several regions in france to get an idea of how the situation would be in a few years , she said .
the results were alarming : there wo n't be any more doctors prepared to carry out abortions within two or three years . a recently completed doctor 's thesis about the amount of time and extent to which french medical students learn about abortion and contraception also determined that information on the subjects was desperately lacking .
furthermore , new doctors find it hard to imagine what life was like for women before abortion was made legal .
doctors ' arrogance working in abortion clinics is poorly paid and held in low esteem , and is thus unappealing to young doctors .
in addition , there 's an arrogance within the medical establishment , according to gynecologist marie-laure brival . for centuries , the male body was considered the measure of all things in the medical world .
doctors only turned their attention to the singularities of the female body when they decided they wanted to do more to improve the health of unborn children , brival said .

it 's really up to a woman to make decisions about her own body .
a woman 's fertility gives her the choice .
it 's sometimes very painful to decide whether one wants a child or not .
but this freedom of choice is actually women 's exclusive right . " doctors are n't alone in viewing women 's bodies in this controlling manner .
in the late 1990s , commando actions against french abortion clinics modeled on the pro-life movement in the united states increased in number : militant so-called " protectors of life " insulted women on their way to having abortions , chained themselves to operating rooms , berated personnel . france made such actions illegal in 1993 .

vfb stuttgart moved into second place in the race for the bundesliga title on friday as they humbled eintracht frankfurt 4-0 consigning their opponents to their seventh successive match without a win . stuttgart , inspired by recently capped german international mario gomez ' 13th goal of the campaign , moved to within four points of leader schalke 04 , who play away at wolfsburg on saturday , and two points ahead of werder bremen , who have lost two on the trot including one against stuttgart but play against bottom club hamburg this weekend . bundesliga leaders schalke 04 have offered their coach mirko slomka a new contract in the hope that is just the boost required to extend their unbeaten run to 13 when they travel to middle of the league vfl wolfsburg this weekend . the 39-year-old 's contract was due to expire in june but the new deal would link the coach to the gelsenkirchen outfit - who are on a run of six successive victories - till the end of the 2008/09 season . club general manager andeas müller met slomka - who took over from ralf rangnick in january 2006 - late on wednesday to talk about his future and said he was confident that there would be no hitches . " we have agreed a deal at every level and will terminate these discussions in the next two or three weeks , but i do not see anything which would prevent him signing a new contract , " said müller . this continues the seemingly unending good news for the 1997 uefa cup winners , as they sit six points clear of second-placed werder bremen and , more significantly , 11 points in front of bayern munich in fourth . it 's not over till it 's over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka knows it will be a difficult game in wolfsburg slomka , who was formerly in charge of the club 's youth system , is taking nothing for granted as schalke seek their eighth title but first since 1958 . " we 're happy to be six points clear , " he told the club web site .
" but while we have the quality to win the league , there are another 13 games left , not two . " " we 're hoping to have lots of support in wolfsburg on saturday .
it 's going to be another very difficult game because wolfsburg are having a good spell .
but we 'll be looking to maintain our lead there and if possible even extend it .

hamburg have won just one of the last 11 games in bremen , but will likely be happy enough if they get a 1-1 draw like in the last two games in the weserstadion . a draw will not be enough for bremen , though , as they quickly need to overcome their domestic slide if they want to stay in the title race .

"
but beyond the red carpet , the somewhat less glamorous stage of the european film market is what really counts for many . michael weber 's phone started ringing when bosnian film director jasmila zbanic was handed the golden bear last year . " ' grbavica ' sold much better afterwards , " said weber , who heads the match factory , which was in charge of selling the winning film of the 2006 berlin international film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a place for deal-making : the efm 's main floor the phone probably started ringing again on saturday .
while weber 's current berlinale competition entry , " yella " by german director christian petzold , did n't pick up the top prize , its star nina hoss took home the trophy for best actress . " it all depends on what happens tomorrow night , " weber had said on friday while sitting between packed-up boxes filled with promotional material in his company 's booth at the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- , where the buzz of previous days had already disappeared as most vendors were preparing to head home . bursting at the seams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's gropius bau museum ca n't hold the entire efm one of the world 's most important trading places for movies with some 19,000 attendees and 702 films on offer , the efm picked up steam in recent years after the american film market in los angeles was moved from february to november .
the market at the cannes film festival meanwhile still rules supreme . the boom in berlin has led to some to complain that market organizers had to find a bigger venue to keep all vendors under one roof instead of spreading them out over several locations .
according to news reports , efm head beki probst has already hired a consultancy firm to help her figure out how to deal with growth of 10 percent to 15 percent next year . many meetings , slow sales ? film industry trade magazines also quoted sellers and buyers , who were not impressed with the amount of business they had done at the market this year .
but weber joined others in saying that he had no reason to complain . " we 've had a lot of meetings , " he said , adding that " yella " has been sold to several countries - including switzerland , austria , portugal , greece and britain . exportable films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie , starring german actress nina hoss , will open in germany in october " yella , " which tells the story of an east german woman who goes to west germany in search of a better life , has received good reviews in the german press even though some movie critics left the theater scratching their heads because of the film 's twisted end . trade magazines such as the hollywood reporter and screen even saw the film embarking on an international career . " the elegant quasi-thriller chic of ' yella ' could prove -lrb- petzold 's -rrb- most exportable yet , if adventurous art house buyers take the bait , " read a screen review . first europe , then the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nina hoss with her bear weber said that " yella " would first have to sell well in europe before going elsewhere . " it 's a little cold for latin america , " he said . a certain bear-shaped trophy - even nina hoss ' silver one - might change all that , of course . " it 's happened before that someone had to double their offer " after a film won awards , weber said .
" but it 's also happened that someone revised an offer because of a bad review .

reactions to the arrival of world leaders , police , journalists and protesters have been mixed in heiligendamm and the nearby town of bad doberan . free advertising to the world hartmut polzin , the mayor of bad doberan , said he is thrilled at the chance to show his town to the world . " the worldwide media attention will make this a marketing campaign which we could never afford if we had to pay for it , " he said , rattling off a list of reasons tourists should visit bad doberan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a villa dating back to 1854 had to make way for a g8 media center he 's also excited about the influx of funds he said he hopes the summit will bring to a region that has struggled economically since reunification . " the g8 summit has already had positive effects on construction here , " he said .
" our improved infrastructure will be of long-term benefit to the regional economy .
it would normally have taken many more years to complete .
but the g8-summit has accelerated the process . " seaside grandeur the neighboring village of heiligendamm is the oldest german seaside resort .
composed of white classical buildings along the promenade , it was an elegant meeting place for high society until the 1930 's .
the russian tsar and his family , composer felix mendelssohn-bartholdy , poet rainer maria rilke , queen luise of prussia , and even dictators adolf hitler and benito mussolini used to be regular guests . kempinski hotel director torsten dressler is rolling out the red carpet and looking forward to demonstrating that the grand hotel heiligendamm is the ideal venue for meetings with high prominence where international protocol and personal attention are of the utmost importance . " people are characterized by their individuality , their like and dislikes , " he said .
" one drinks a certain tea , the other a special wine .
and a third does n't like a certain type of flower .
as hoteliers , we need to find out who likes what .
we want to be super hosts . " to be a super media host , fundus investment group and kempinski hotels tore down a classical villa and a former holiday residence of the russian tsars to make room for a media center . no way in for peaceful demo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : building has begun on the fence that will surround the village and seal off the beach there 's also the question of other visitors .
in recent weeks , german politicians have expressly welcomed peaceful demonstrators to the g8 summit .
but heiligendamm was selected to host the summit because of its isolated location and limited access to the grand hotel . nevertheless , the federal government expects huge international protests to converge on the summit , just as they did in st petersburg and gleneagles in recent years . the hotel privatization of public roads and plans to demolish further classicist villas along the beach have caused loud protest in the local community , according to 70-year-old marianne prüter , who has lived in heiligendamm since 1947 . " they 're excellent at building fences ! " she said , pointing out a high-security fence currently being built around the hotel .
the barrier is 14 kilometers long -lrb- 8.7 miles -rrb- and is planned to cost some 12.4 million euros -lrb- $ 16.3 million -rrb- to erect . counting the cost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sea resort will be packed in summer this summer about 10,000 police officers from across germany will be tasked with turning away unauthorized visitors from this fence .
the air force , navy and special forces will also be providing their services to ensure the conference 's security . birgit schwebs , deputy leader of the left party in mecklenburg-western pommerania 's state parliament pointed to the expenses . " the fact is , mecklenburg is paying 13 million euros for the fence alone , " she said .
" the current official estimate is that our g8 summit in heiligendamm will cost a round 92 million euros just for security . " schwebs added that the federal government had promised to reimburse the state with 24 million euros , leaving the region with the rest of the tab . the conference 's costs are one of the main reasons locals have expressed their unhappiness with having world leaders converge on their towns . " at a time when unemployment in mecklenburg is the highest in the country and there 's no money for social welfare they 're wasting millions , " prüter said .
" the waste of public money bugs me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests also accompanied us president bush 's visit to the region last year focus on global growth " growth and responsibility " will be the summit 's main focus .
rosa klemper said the irony of growth being focus in one of germany 's least industrialized and poorest regions is n't lost on her .
she said she 'll be protesting for growth in the state hosting the leaders . " the mecklenburg population has n't yet realized that the summit is an opportunity to show the world that germany itself is still imbalanced between the east and the west , " she said . peter zimmerman -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany faces daunting agenda for eu , g8 presidencies germany will fight to revive international efforts for middle east peace , relaunch the eu constitution and advocate a gentler form of globalization when it takes over the presidencies of the eu and the g8 monday .

" in europe we 've cherished the illusion in recent years that ' we 've done enough , " ' he said in the interview to be published sunday . steiner praised berlin for making the fight against climate change a cornerstone of its six-month eu presidency , but also warned germany , the eu 's largest polluter , that it needed to do more to lower emissions . steiner 's comments echo those of the european union 's environment commissioner stavros dimas who two weeks ago said germany must " be aware of its responsibility and its position as a role model in the fight against climate change .

" yes , we favor ecology and responsibility for the future , but let us stick to what we can do , " said social democratic party head kurt beck in a speech on saturday .
" let 's stay reasonable , yes , but let 's use our technology worldwide so that other countries can grow with less co2 . " placing blame where it 's due bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steiner said it 's irresponsible of europeans to blame only china for climate change but steiner warned industrialized nations , which he said are responsible for the globe 's current climate problem , not to put the burden of lowering emissions on developing nations . " the climate problem of today was not caused by china but above all by western nations , " he said .
" so the first step has to come from us .
moreover , it 's wrong to assume that china is not interested in climate protection . " he added that china has begun implementing a plan to increase its use of renewable energy , and the united states , which is not a signatory to the kyoto protocol , is also making advances in the environmentally friendly technologies . " the americans and asians are catching up quickly and are becoming strong business competitors -lrb- with green technologies -rrb- , " steiner said .

"
but beyond the red carpet , the somewhat less glamorous stage of the european film market is what really counts for many . michael weber 's phone started ringing when bosnian film director jasmila zbanic was handed the golden bear last year . " ' grbavica ' sold much better afterwards , " said weber , who heads the match factory , which was in charge of selling the winning film of the 2006 berlin international film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a place for deal-making : the efm 's main floor the phone probably started ringing again on saturday .
while weber 's current berlinale competition entry , " yella " by german director christian petzold , did n't pick up the top prize , its star nina hoss took home the trophy for best actress . " it all depends on what happens tomorrow night , " weber had said on friday while sitting between packed-up boxes filled with promotional material in his company 's booth at the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- , where the buzz of previous days had already disappeared as most vendors were preparing to head home . bursting at the seams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's gropius bau museum ca n't hold the entire efm one of the world 's most important trading places for movies with some 19,000 attendees and 702 films on offer , the efm picked up steam in recent years after the american film market in los angeles was moved from february to november .
the market at the cannes film festival meanwhile still rules supreme . the boom in berlin has led to some to complain that market organizers had to find a bigger venue to keep all vendors under one roof instead of spreading them out over several locations .
according to news reports , efm head beki probst has already hired a consultancy firm to help her figure out how to deal with growth of 10 percent to 15 percent next year . many meetings , slow sales ? film industry trade magazines also quoted sellers and buyers , who were not impressed with the amount of business they had done at the market this year .
but weber joined others in saying that he had no reason to complain . " we 've had a lot of meetings , " he said , adding that " yella " has been sold to several countries - including switzerland , austria , portugal , greece and britain . exportable films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie , starring german actress nina hoss , will open in germany in october " yella , " which tells the story of an east german woman who goes to west germany in search of a better life , has received good reviews in the german press even though some movie critics left the theater scratching their heads because of the film 's twisted end . trade magazines such as the hollywood reporter and screen even saw the film embarking on an international career . " the elegant quasi-thriller chic of ' yella ' could prove -lrb- petzold 's -rrb- most exportable yet , if adventurous art house buyers take the bait , " read a screen review . first europe , then the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nina hoss with her bear weber said that " yella " would first have to sell well in europe before going elsewhere . " it 's a little cold for latin america , " he said . a certain bear-shaped trophy - even nina hoss ' silver one - might change all that , of course . " it 's happened before that someone had to double their offer " after a film won awards , weber said .
" but it 's also happened that someone revised an offer because of a bad review .

sweden is especially uneasy about the project .
besides environmental concerns , some swedish politicians fear it may be used for spying . gotland is a small island in the central baltic sea , just 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- off the swedish mainland .
known for its white beaches , this idyllic island is slowly but surely becoming better known for a more recent legacy : its opposition to the russian gas pipeline project . nord stream , a russian-german consortium , is planning to build a 1,200 kilometer-long pipeline that will satisfy europe 's growing demand for natural gas , courtesy of russian energy giant gazprom .
starting 2010 , the pipeline is expected to pump natural gas from russia through the baltic sea to a location near greifswald in northern germany . " the pipeline is going to go directly along the coast of gotland , " said asa andersson of the swedish world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
" the environmental impact is questionable .
nord stream has to address all possible scenarios .
so far , this has been neglected . " andersson said other routes through the baltic , possibly along previously established pipeline paths , should be examined . environmental assessment underway nord stream is currently conducting an environmental impact assessment for the project .
the consortium said it plans to present its final report to the various national authorities this fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has long been a proponent for the gas pipeline while a country has the right to impose additional requirements it doubts pipeline 's environmental safety , only states whose germany , russia , finland , denmark and sweden have the ability to veto the project .
other neighboring countries , such as poland or the baltic states , are entitled to hear the report , but have no veto powers . " all sensitive points are being carefully reviewed , " said the chairman of the shareholder ’ s board on wednesday in brussels .
he is gerhard schröder , the former chancellor of germany who enjoyed friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin . criticism from all angles despite the former chancellor 's assurances , the mega-project has been met by criticism from all sides . swedish environmental groups are especially concerned that the pipeline passes too closely along the marine reserve near gotland .
they say the construction work could stir up toxins long dormant at the bottom of the seaand harm the flora and fauna living in the waters surrounding the swedish island .
gotland 's local fisheries also fear the pipeline could interfere with their fishing nets . but the greatest concern is over tons of chemical weapons left over from world war ii at the bottom of the sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are nervous pipeline explosions , other of espionage " the munitions are a high security risk , " andersson said , adding that explosions could easily set free dangerous chemicals . nord stream , however , said the explosives would not be a danger to the pipeline and that engineers are systematically scanning the seabed along the 1,200-kilometer long route . " we are familiar with the storage sites for these munitions , " nord stream spokeman jens müller said .
" the pipeline will not run in their vicinity . " ecological , political fears christian dahlke , division head at the office of maritime traffic and hydrography , the federal agency that assesses nord stream 's environmental report for germany , said there is little reason for concern once the pipeline is built . " gazprom has grasped that this project has to be carried out along european guidelines , " he said .
" there weren ’ t any problems with pipelines in the north sea . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is afraid its supply of russian gas could be cut off in the future but that has n't stopped several german environmental groups from joining their swedish and finnish counterparts in opposing the pipeline .
warsaw has also come out against the plan , fearing moscow could cuts gas deliveries to poland in the future .
if built , the pipeline could supply up to 25 percent of europe 's natural gas supplies by 2015 . sweden 's national security concerns the pipeline has also become a security issue for the swedes .
several swedish politicians , from both the governing party and opposition , have publicly expressed concern that russian intelligence agencies could abuse the pipeline project for renewed espionage activities along sweden 's coast . dehlke , however , said that murky security concerns are unlikely to be enough to nix the project .

sweden is especially uneasy about the project .
besides environmental concerns , some swedish politicians fear it may be used for spying . gotland is a small island in the central baltic sea , just 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- off the swedish mainland .
known for its white beaches , this idyllic island is slowly but surely becoming better known for a more recent legacy : its opposition to the russian gas pipeline project . nord stream , a russian-german consortium , is planning to build a 1,200 kilometer-long pipeline that will satisfy europe 's growing demand for natural gas , courtesy of russian energy giant gazprom .
starting 2010 , the pipeline is expected to pump natural gas from russia through the baltic sea to a location near greifswald in northern germany . " the pipeline is going to go directly along the coast of gotland , " said asa andersson of the swedish world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
" the environmental impact is questionable .
nord stream has to address all possible scenarios .
so far , this has been neglected . " andersson said other routes through the baltic , possibly along previously established pipeline paths , should be examined . environmental assessment underway nord stream is currently conducting an environmental impact assessment for the project .
the consortium said it plans to present its final report to the various national authorities this fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has long been a proponent for the gas pipeline while a country has the right to impose additional requirements it doubts pipeline 's environmental safety , only states whose germany , russia , finland , denmark and sweden have the ability to veto the project .
other neighboring countries , such as poland or the baltic states , are entitled to hear the report , but have no veto powers . " all sensitive points are being carefully reviewed , " said the chairman of the shareholder ’ s board on wednesday in brussels .
he is gerhard schröder , the former chancellor of germany who enjoyed friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin . criticism from all angles despite the former chancellor 's assurances , the mega-project has been met by criticism from all sides . swedish environmental groups are especially concerned that the pipeline passes too closely along the marine reserve near gotland .
they say the construction work could stir up toxins long dormant at the bottom of the seaand harm the flora and fauna living in the waters surrounding the swedish island .
gotland 's local fisheries also fear the pipeline could interfere with their fishing nets . but the greatest concern is over tons of chemical weapons left over from world war ii at the bottom of the sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are nervous pipeline explosions , other of espionage " the munitions are a high security risk , " andersson said , adding that explosions could easily set free dangerous chemicals . nord stream , however , said the explosives would not be a danger to the pipeline and that engineers are systematically scanning the seabed along the 1,200-kilometer long route . " we are familiar with the storage sites for these munitions , " nord stream spokeman jens müller said .
" the pipeline will not run in their vicinity . " ecological , political fears christian dahlke , division head at the office of maritime traffic and hydrography , the federal agency that assesses nord stream 's environmental report for germany , said there is little reason for concern once the pipeline is built . " gazprom has grasped that this project has to be carried out along european guidelines , " he said .
" there weren ’ t any problems with pipelines in the north sea . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is afraid its supply of russian gas could be cut off in the future but that has n't stopped several german environmental groups from joining their swedish and finnish counterparts in opposing the pipeline .
warsaw has also come out against the plan , fearing moscow could cuts gas deliveries to poland in the future .
if built , the pipeline could supply up to 25 percent of europe 's natural gas supplies by 2015 . sweden 's national security concerns the pipeline has also become a security issue for the swedes .
several swedish politicians , from both the governing party and opposition , have publicly expressed concern that russian intelligence agencies could abuse the pipeline project for renewed espionage activities along sweden 's coast . dehlke , however , said that murky security concerns are unlikely to be enough to nix the project . " there have to be serious reasons , say in the area of environmental protection , for rejecting the project , " he said .

berlin 's film festival used to be a place for oscar nominees to promote themselves prior to voting .
that 's changed as the festival has turned from artistic showcase into a marketing tool for movies . the berlin international film festival is the largest of its kind in terms of attendance - selling 180,000 tickets over 10 days .
it 's now also one of the three biggest festivals in terms of deal-making , alongside cannes in may and the american film market in november . the berlinale has long been one of the big places to market and push films towards the oscars .
but recently , berlin has become little more than a cog in the machine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matt damon , martina gedeck and robert de niro on the red carpet at the berlinale when cate blanchett walked out onto the red carpet at the berlin film festival this week , the paparazzi were there in full force .

they come to the festival to push their films to a european audience .
that 's been the case since the berlin film festival began 57 years ago .
what 's changed is that berlin is now more of a stepping-stone for a movie on its way towards the academy awards , which are one of the most important financial factors for a film 's success . supporting role ? " i think , because the -lrb- oscar -rrb- nominations are out , what happens is that the berlin red carpet is just a promotion and marketing , " said dieter kosslick , the berlinale 's festival director .
" we play one role in this whole alley leading up to the oscars .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastwood 's an oscar hopeful again this year previously , oscar nominees came to berlin to get attention and win over voters .

in french abortion clinics , however , women 's right to decide for themselves what to do with their bodies is sometimes illusory . while portugal is currently liberalizing its laws to allow abortion up to the 10th week of pregnancy , french women have already had the right since 1975 .
the law , named after then-health minister simone veil , leaves it to the woman alone to decide whether to have an abortion .
it also requires every larger hospital to have a special service for abortions .
the veil law was amended in 2001 to allow abortions up to the 12th week of pregnancy .
since then even minors may in some cases have abortions without parental consent . but , in practice , not every woman is able to take advantage of those guaranteed rights , according to francoise laurant , head of the family planning organization mouvement francais pour le planning familiale -lrb- mfpf -rrb- . many hospitals do n't have enough personal , so that , during vacation times , women wanting abortions end up on ever longer waiting lists , she said .

new generation unaware laurant said many of the doctors currently working in french abortion clinics were part of the 1970s women 's movement as medical students .
that means they have now nearly reached retirement age .
mfpf surveyed several regions in france to get an idea of how the situation would be in a few years , she said .
the results were alarming : there wo n't be any more doctors prepared to carry out abortions within two or three years . a recently completed doctor 's thesis about the amount of time and extent to which french medical students learn about abortion and contraception also determined that information on the subjects was desperately lacking .
furthermore , new doctors find it hard to imagine what life was like for women before abortion was made legal .
doctors ' arrogance working in abortion clinics is poorly paid and held in low esteem , and is thus unappealing to young doctors .
in addition , there 's an arrogance within the medical establishment , according to gynecologist marie-laure brival . for centuries , the male body was considered the measure of all things in the medical world .

in french abortion clinics , however , women 's right to decide for themselves what to do with their bodies is sometimes illusory . while portugal is currently liberalizing its laws to allow abortion up to the 10th week of pregnancy , french women have already had the right since 1975 .
the law , named after then-health minister simone veil , leaves it to the woman alone to decide whether to have an abortion .
it also requires every larger hospital to have a special service for abortions .
the veil law was amended in 2001 to allow abortions up to the 12th week of pregnancy .
since then even minors may in some cases have abortions without parental consent . but , in practice , not every woman is able to take advantage of those guaranteed rights , according to francoise laurant , head of the family planning organization mouvement francais pour le planning familiale -lrb- mfpf -rrb- . many hospitals do n't have enough personal , so that , during vacation times , women wanting abortions end up on ever longer waiting lists , she said .
some women discover then that they legal time limit has passed for them to have an abortion in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simone veil , here as president of the european parliament in 1979 " sometimes , the woman is then told , ' you can still get an abortion in holland or spain , " ' laurent said .

and there are hospitals where it 's made difficult for a woman who wants to have a second abortion . " when abortion clinics do work well , it 's usually due to a doctor 's personal commitment - often because he or she remembers that so many women used to die or fall ill from botched illegal abortions , laurent added .
new generation unaware laurant said many of the doctors currently working in french abortion clinics were part of the 1970s women 's movement as medical students .
that means they have now nearly reached retirement age .
mfpf surveyed several regions in france to get an idea of how the situation would be in a few years , she said .
the results were alarming : there wo n't be any more doctors prepared to carry out abortions within two or three years . a recently completed doctor 's thesis about the amount of time and extent to which french medical students learn about abortion and contraception also determined that information on the subjects was desperately lacking .
furthermore , new doctors find it hard to imagine what life was like for women before abortion was made legal .
doctors ' arrogance working in abortion clinics is poorly paid and held in low esteem , and is thus unappealing to young doctors .
in addition , there 's an arrogance within the medical establishment , according to gynecologist marie-laure brival . for centuries , the male body was considered the measure of all things in the medical world .
doctors only turned their attention to the singularities of the female body when they decided they wanted to do more to improve the health of unborn children , brival said .

in the late 1990s , commando actions against french abortion clinics modeled on the pro-life movement in the united states increased in number : militant so-called " protectors of life " insulted women on their way to having abortions , chained themselves to operating rooms , berated personnel . france made such actions illegal in 1993 .

the french company owns about one third of nissan .
the newspaper said exploratory talks between chrysler and gm had begun . quoting automotive-industry sources , it said it was unlikely that gm , the world 's biggest carmaker , would take over the us subsidiary of daimlerchrysler outright .
both companies have declined comment on the speculation . " we often have discussions with automakers routinely , " gm spokesman tony cervone told reuters news agency .
" we do n't comment on speculation regarding discussions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was this zetsche 's last time in a chrysler ?
an alliance would mean gm and chrysler remain separate companies , but keeps open the possibility of cross-shareholding and the ability to act as a single company in product development , production and sales , the german daily said . chrysler chief executive tom lasorda said he wants to more than double global sales through new alliances , the wall street journal reported friday . advantages for both companies the initiative for the talks had come from chrysler .
sources familiar with the talks said that if a link-up were to be to gm 's advantage , the us group would contemplate such an arrangement . speculation since mid-week has driven daimlerchrysler stock higher this week , making it the top stock in frankfurt 's dax index for three straight days .
despite profit taking friday , it closed 1.3 percent higher at 54.12 euros -lrb- $ 72.45 -rrb- . chrysler is struggling with a slump in profitability as americans turn away from its range of big cars and favor imports .
the german arm of daimlerchrysler , mercedes , is in relatively healthy condition . daimlerchrysler 's chief executive dieter zetsche said he was reviewing " further strategic options " for chrysler and not ruling out any possibilities for the us carmaker 's future at an annual conference held on wednesday . automotive news europe had earlier reported top-level talks on an outright merger , but the süddeutsche zeitung said gm had too many problems of its own and would not want to bring another struggling company on board . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : dr. z 's emergency operation german and european editorials on thursday focused on major job cuts at chrysler and the announcement at daimlerchryler headquarters that a sale of the us carmaker was an option on the table .

berlin 's film festival used to be a place for oscar nominees to promote themselves prior to voting .
that 's changed as the festival has turned from artistic showcase into a marketing tool for movies . the berlin international film festival is the largest of its kind in terms of attendance - selling 180,000 tickets over 10 days .
it 's now also one of the three biggest festivals in terms of deal-making , alongside cannes in may and the american film market in november . the berlinale has long been one of the big places to market and push films towards the oscars .
but recently , berlin has become little more than a cog in the machine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matt damon , martina gedeck and robert de niro on the red carpet at the berlinale when cate blanchett walked out onto the red carpet at the berlin film festival this week , the paparazzi were there in full force .

they come to the festival to push their films to a european audience .
that 's been the case since the berlin film festival began 57 years ago .
what 's changed is that berlin is now more of a stepping-stone for a movie on its way towards the academy awards , which are one of the most important financial factors for a film 's success . supporting role ? " i think , because the -lrb- oscar -rrb- nominations are out , what happens is that the berlin red carpet is just a promotion and marketing , " said dieter kosslick , the berlinale 's festival director .

but beyond the red carpet , the somewhat less glamorous stage of the european film market is what really counts for many . michael weber 's phone started ringing when bosnian film director jasmila zbanic was handed the golden bear last year .

while weber 's current berlinale competition entry , " yella " by german director christian petzold , did n't pick up the top prize , its star nina hoss took home the trophy for best actress . " it all depends on what happens tomorrow night , " weber had said on friday while sitting between packed-up boxes filled with promotional material in his company 's booth at the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- , where the buzz of previous days had already disappeared as most vendors were preparing to head home . bursting at the seams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's gropius bau museum ca n't hold the entire efm one of the world 's most important trading places for movies with some 19,000 attendees and 702 films on offer , the efm picked up steam in recent years after the american film market in los angeles was moved from february to november .
the market at the cannes film festival meanwhile still rules supreme . the boom in berlin has led to some to complain that market organizers had to find a bigger venue to keep all vendors under one roof instead of spreading them out over several locations .
according to news reports , efm head beki probst has already hired a consultancy firm to help her figure out how to deal with growth of 10 percent to 15 percent next year . many meetings , slow sales ? film industry trade magazines also quoted sellers and buyers , who were not impressed with the amount of business they had done at the market this year .
but weber joined others in saying that he had no reason to complain . " we 've had a lot of meetings , " he said , adding that " yella " has been sold to several countries - including switzerland , austria , portugal , greece and britain . exportable films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie , starring german actress nina hoss , will open in germany in october " yella , " which tells the story of an east german woman who goes to west germany in search of a better life , has received good reviews in the german press even though some movie critics left the theater scratching their heads because of the film 's twisted end . trade magazines such as the hollywood reporter and screen even saw the film embarking on an international career . " the elegant quasi-thriller chic of ' yella ' could prove -lrb- petzold 's -rrb- most exportable yet , if adventurous art house buyers take the bait , " read a screen review . first europe , then the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nina hoss with her bear weber said that " yella " would first have to sell well in europe before going elsewhere . " it 's a little cold for latin america , " he said . a certain bear-shaped trophy - even nina hoss ' silver one - might change all that , of course . " it 's happened before that someone had to double their offer " after a film won awards , weber said .

reactions to the arrival of world leaders , police , journalists and protesters have been mixed in heiligendamm and the nearby town of bad doberan . free advertising to the world hartmut polzin , the mayor of bad doberan , said he is thrilled at the chance to show his town to the world . " the worldwide media attention will make this a marketing campaign which we could never afford if we had to pay for it , " he said , rattling off a list of reasons tourists should visit bad doberan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a villa dating back to 1854 had to make way for a g8 media center he 's also excited about the influx of funds he said he hopes the summit will bring to a region that has struggled economically since reunification . " the g8 summit has already had positive effects on construction here , " he said .
" our improved infrastructure will be of long-term benefit to the regional economy .
it would normally have taken many more years to complete .
but the g8-summit has accelerated the process . " seaside grandeur the neighboring village of heiligendamm is the oldest german seaside resort .
composed of white classical buildings along the promenade , it was an elegant meeting place for high society until the 1930 's .
the russian tsar and his family , composer felix mendelssohn-bartholdy , poet rainer maria rilke , queen luise of prussia , and even dictators adolf hitler and benito mussolini used to be regular guests . kempinski hotel director torsten dressler is rolling out the red carpet and looking forward to demonstrating that the grand hotel heiligendamm is the ideal venue for meetings with high prominence where international protocol and personal attention are of the utmost importance . " people are characterized by their individuality , their like and dislikes , " he said .
" one drinks a certain tea , the other a special wine .
and a third does n't like a certain type of flower .
as hoteliers , we need to find out who likes what .
we want to be super hosts . " to be a super media host , fundus investment group and kempinski hotels tore down a classical villa and a former holiday residence of the russian tsars to make room for a media center . no way in for peaceful demo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : building has begun on the fence that will surround the village and seal off the beach there 's also the question of other visitors .
in recent weeks , german politicians have expressly welcomed peaceful demonstrators to the g8 summit .
but heiligendamm was selected to host the summit because of its isolated location and limited access to the grand hotel . nevertheless , the federal government expects huge international protests to converge on the summit , just as they did in st petersburg and gleneagles in recent years . the hotel privatization of public roads and plans to demolish further classicist villas along the beach have caused loud protest in the local community , according to 70-year-old marianne prüter , who has lived in heiligendamm since 1947 . " they 're excellent at building fences ! " she said , pointing out a high-security fence currently being built around the hotel .
the barrier is 14 kilometers long -lrb- 8.7 miles -rrb- and is planned to cost some 12.4 million euros -lrb- $ 16.3 million -rrb- to erect . counting the cost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sea resort will be packed in summer this summer about 10,000 police officers from across germany will be tasked with turning away unauthorized visitors from this fence .
the air force , navy and special forces will also be providing their services to ensure the conference 's security . birgit schwebs , deputy leader of the left party in mecklenburg-western pommerania 's state parliament pointed to the expenses . " the fact is , mecklenburg is paying 13 million euros for the fence alone , " she said .
" the current official estimate is that our g8 summit in heiligendamm will cost a round 92 million euros just for security . " schwebs added that the federal government had promised to reimburse the state with 24 million euros , leaving the region with the rest of the tab . the conference 's costs are one of the main reasons locals have expressed their unhappiness with having world leaders converge on their towns . " at a time when unemployment in mecklenburg is the highest in the country and there 's no money for social welfare they 're wasting millions , " prüter said .
" the waste of public money bugs me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests also accompanied us president bush 's visit to the region last year focus on global growth " growth and responsibility " will be the summit 's main focus .
rosa klemper said the irony of growth being focus in one of germany 's least industrialized and poorest regions is n't lost on her .
she said she 'll be protesting for growth in the state hosting the leaders . " the mecklenburg population has n't yet realized that the summit is an opportunity to show the world that germany itself is still imbalanced between the east and the west , " she said . peter zimmerman -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany faces daunting agenda for eu , g8 presidencies germany will fight to revive international efforts for middle east peace , relaunch the eu constitution and advocate a gentler form of globalization when it takes over the presidencies of the eu and the g8 monday .

sweden is especially uneasy about the project .
besides environmental concerns , some swedish politicians fear it may be used for spying . gotland is a small island in the central baltic sea , just 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- off the swedish mainland .
known for its white beaches , this idyllic island is slowly but surely becoming better known for a more recent legacy : its opposition to the russian gas pipeline project . nord stream , a russian-german consortium , is planning to build a 1,200 kilometer-long pipeline that will satisfy europe 's growing demand for natural gas , courtesy of russian energy giant gazprom .
starting 2010 , the pipeline is expected to pump natural gas from russia through the baltic sea to a location near greifswald in northern germany . " the pipeline is going to go directly along the coast of gotland , " said asa andersson of the swedish world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
" the environmental impact is questionable .
nord stream has to address all possible scenarios .
so far , this has been neglected . " andersson said other routes through the baltic , possibly along previously established pipeline paths , should be examined . environmental assessment underway nord stream is currently conducting an environmental impact assessment for the project .
the consortium said it plans to present its final report to the various national authorities this fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has long been a proponent for the gas pipeline while a country has the right to impose additional requirements it doubts pipeline 's environmental safety , only states whose germany , russia , finland , denmark and sweden have the ability to veto the project .
other neighboring countries , such as poland or the baltic states , are entitled to hear the report , but have no veto powers . " all sensitive points are being carefully reviewed , " said the chairman of the shareholder ’ s board on wednesday in brussels .
he is gerhard schröder , the former chancellor of germany who enjoyed friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin . criticism from all angles despite the former chancellor 's assurances , the mega-project has been met by criticism from all sides . swedish environmental groups are especially concerned that the pipeline passes too closely along the marine reserve near gotland .
they say the construction work could stir up toxins long dormant at the bottom of the seaand harm the flora and fauna living in the waters surrounding the swedish island .
gotland 's local fisheries also fear the pipeline could interfere with their fishing nets . but the greatest concern is over tons of chemical weapons left over from world war ii at the bottom of the sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are nervous pipeline explosions , other of espionage " the munitions are a high security risk , " andersson said , adding that explosions could easily set free dangerous chemicals . nord stream , however , said the explosives would not be a danger to the pipeline and that engineers are systematically scanning the seabed along the 1,200-kilometer long route . " we are familiar with the storage sites for these munitions , " nord stream spokeman jens müller said .
" the pipeline will not run in their vicinity . " ecological , political fears christian dahlke , division head at the office of maritime traffic and hydrography , the federal agency that assesses nord stream 's environmental report for germany , said there is little reason for concern once the pipeline is built . " gazprom has grasped that this project has to be carried out along european guidelines , " he said .
" there weren ’ t any problems with pipelines in the north sea . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is afraid its supply of russian gas could be cut off in the future but that has n't stopped several german environmental groups from joining their swedish and finnish counterparts in opposing the pipeline .
warsaw has also come out against the plan , fearing moscow could cuts gas deliveries to poland in the future .
if built , the pipeline could supply up to 25 percent of europe 's natural gas supplies by 2015 . sweden 's national security concerns the pipeline has also become a security issue for the swedes .
several swedish politicians , from both the governing party and opposition , have publicly expressed concern that russian intelligence agencies could abuse the pipeline project for renewed espionage activities along sweden 's coast . dehlke , however , said that murky security concerns are unlikely to be enough to nix the project . " there have to be serious reasons , say in the area of environmental protection , for rejecting the project , " he said .

reactions to the arrival of world leaders , police , journalists and protesters have been mixed in heiligendamm and the nearby town of bad doberan . free advertising to the world hartmut polzin , the mayor of bad doberan , said he is thrilled at the chance to show his town to the world . " the worldwide media attention will make this a marketing campaign which we could never afford if we had to pay for it , " he said , rattling off a list of reasons tourists should visit bad doberan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a villa dating back to 1854 had to make way for a g8 media center he 's also excited about the influx of funds he said he hopes the summit will bring to a region that has struggled economically since reunification . " the g8 summit has already had positive effects on construction here , " he said .
" our improved infrastructure will be of long-term benefit to the regional economy .
it would normally have taken many more years to complete .
but the g8-summit has accelerated the process . " seaside grandeur the neighboring village of heiligendamm is the oldest german seaside resort .
composed of white classical buildings along the promenade , it was an elegant meeting place for high society until the 1930 's .
the russian tsar and his family , composer felix mendelssohn-bartholdy , poet rainer maria rilke , queen luise of prussia , and even dictators adolf hitler and benito mussolini used to be regular guests . kempinski hotel director torsten dressler is rolling out the red carpet and looking forward to demonstrating that the grand hotel heiligendamm is the ideal venue for meetings with high prominence where international protocol and personal attention are of the utmost importance . " people are characterized by their individuality , their like and dislikes , " he said .
" one drinks a certain tea , the other a special wine .
and a third does n't like a certain type of flower .
as hoteliers , we need to find out who likes what .
we want to be super hosts . " to be a super media host , fundus investment group and kempinski hotels tore down a classical villa and a former holiday residence of the russian tsars to make room for a media center . no way in for peaceful demo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : building has begun on the fence that will surround the village and seal off the beach there 's also the question of other visitors .
in recent weeks , german politicians have expressly welcomed peaceful demonstrators to the g8 summit .
but heiligendamm was selected to host the summit because of its isolated location and limited access to the grand hotel . nevertheless , the federal government expects huge international protests to converge on the summit , just as they did in st petersburg and gleneagles in recent years . the hotel privatization of public roads and plans to demolish further classicist villas along the beach have caused loud protest in the local community , according to 70-year-old marianne prüter , who has lived in heiligendamm since 1947 . " they 're excellent at building fences ! " she said , pointing out a high-security fence currently being built around the hotel .
the barrier is 14 kilometers long -lrb- 8.7 miles -rrb- and is planned to cost some 12.4 million euros -lrb- $ 16.3 million -rrb- to erect . counting the cost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sea resort will be packed in summer this summer about 10,000 police officers from across germany will be tasked with turning away unauthorized visitors from this fence .
the air force , navy and special forces will also be providing their services to ensure the conference 's security . birgit schwebs , deputy leader of the left party in mecklenburg-western pommerania 's state parliament pointed to the expenses .

the french company owns about one third of nissan .
the newspaper said exploratory talks between chrysler and gm had begun . quoting automotive-industry sources , it said it was unlikely that gm , the world 's biggest carmaker , would take over the us subsidiary of daimlerchrysler outright .
both companies have declined comment on the speculation . " we often have discussions with automakers routinely , " gm spokesman tony cervone told reuters news agency .
" we do n't comment on speculation regarding discussions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was this zetsche 's last time in a chrysler ?
an alliance would mean gm and chrysler remain separate companies , but keeps open the possibility of cross-shareholding and the ability to act as a single company in product development , production and sales , the german daily said . chrysler chief executive tom lasorda said he wants to more than double global sales through new alliances , the wall street journal reported friday . advantages for both companies the initiative for the talks had come from chrysler .
sources familiar with the talks said that if a link-up were to be to gm 's advantage , the us group would contemplate such an arrangement . speculation since mid-week has driven daimlerchrysler stock higher this week , making it the top stock in frankfurt 's dax index for three straight days .
despite profit taking friday , it closed 1.3 percent higher at 54.12 euros -lrb- $ 72.45 -rrb- . chrysler is struggling with a slump in profitability as americans turn away from its range of big cars and favor imports .
the german arm of daimlerchrysler , mercedes , is in relatively healthy condition . daimlerchrysler 's chief executive dieter zetsche said he was reviewing " further strategic options " for chrysler and not ruling out any possibilities for the us carmaker 's future at an annual conference held on wednesday . automotive news europe had earlier reported top-level talks on an outright merger , but the süddeutsche zeitung said gm had too many problems of its own and would not want to bring another struggling company on board . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : dr. z 's emergency operation german and european editorials on thursday focused on major job cuts at chrysler and the announcement at daimlerchryler headquarters that a sale of the us carmaker was an option on the table .

reactions to the arrival of world leaders , police , journalists and protesters have been mixed in heiligendamm and the nearby town of bad doberan . free advertising to the world hartmut polzin , the mayor of bad doberan , said he is thrilled at the chance to show his town to the world . " the worldwide media attention will make this a marketing campaign which we could never afford if we had to pay for it , " he said , rattling off a list of reasons tourists should visit bad doberan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a villa dating back to 1854 had to make way for a g8 media center he 's also excited about the influx of funds he said he hopes the summit will bring to a region that has struggled economically since reunification . " the g8 summit has already had positive effects on construction here , " he said .
" our improved infrastructure will be of long-term benefit to the regional economy .
it would normally have taken many more years to complete .
but the g8-summit has accelerated the process . " seaside grandeur the neighboring village of heiligendamm is the oldest german seaside resort .
composed of white classical buildings along the promenade , it was an elegant meeting place for high society until the 1930 's .
the russian tsar and his family , composer felix mendelssohn-bartholdy , poet rainer maria rilke , queen luise of prussia , and even dictators adolf hitler and benito mussolini used to be regular guests . kempinski hotel director torsten dressler is rolling out the red carpet and looking forward to demonstrating that the grand hotel heiligendamm is the ideal venue for meetings with high prominence where international protocol and personal attention are of the utmost importance . " people are characterized by their individuality , their like and dislikes , " he said .
" one drinks a certain tea , the other a special wine .
and a third does n't like a certain type of flower .
as hoteliers , we need to find out who likes what .
we want to be super hosts . " to be a super media host , fundus investment group and kempinski hotels tore down a classical villa and a former holiday residence of the russian tsars to make room for a media center . no way in for peaceful demo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : building has begun on the fence that will surround the village and seal off the beach there 's also the question of other visitors .
in recent weeks , german politicians have expressly welcomed peaceful demonstrators to the g8 summit .
but heiligendamm was selected to host the summit because of its isolated location and limited access to the grand hotel . nevertheless , the federal government expects huge international protests to converge on the summit , just as they did in st petersburg and gleneagles in recent years . the hotel privatization of public roads and plans to demolish further classicist villas along the beach have caused loud protest in the local community , according to 70-year-old marianne prüter , who has lived in heiligendamm since 1947 . " they 're excellent at building fences ! " she said , pointing out a high-security fence currently being built around the hotel .
the barrier is 14 kilometers long -lrb- 8.7 miles -rrb- and is planned to cost some 12.4 million euros -lrb- $ 16.3 million -rrb- to erect . counting the cost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sea resort will be packed in summer this summer about 10,000 police officers from across germany will be tasked with turning away unauthorized visitors from this fence .
the air force , navy and special forces will also be providing their services to ensure the conference 's security . birgit schwebs , deputy leader of the left party in mecklenburg-western pommerania 's state parliament pointed to the expenses . " the fact is , mecklenburg is paying 13 million euros for the fence alone , " she said .
" the current official estimate is that our g8 summit in heiligendamm will cost a round 92 million euros just for security . " schwebs added that the federal government had promised to reimburse the state with 24 million euros , leaving the region with the rest of the tab . the conference 's costs are one of the main reasons locals have expressed their unhappiness with having world leaders converge on their towns . " at a time when unemployment in mecklenburg is the highest in the country and there 's no money for social welfare they 're wasting millions , " prüter said .
" the waste of public money bugs me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests also accompanied us president bush 's visit to the region last year focus on global growth " growth and responsibility " will be the summit 's main focus .
rosa klemper said the irony of growth being focus in one of germany 's least industrialized and poorest regions is n't lost on her .
she said she 'll be protesting for growth in the state hosting the leaders . " the mecklenburg population has n't yet realized that the summit is an opportunity to show the world that germany itself is still imbalanced between the east and the west , " she said . peter zimmerman -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany faces daunting agenda for eu , g8 presidencies germany will fight to revive international efforts for middle east peace , relaunch the eu constitution and advocate a gentler form of globalization when it takes over the presidencies of the eu and the g8 monday .

vfb stuttgart moved into second place in the race for the bundesliga title on friday as they humbled eintracht frankfurt 4-0 consigning their opponents to their seventh successive match without a win . stuttgart , inspired by recently capped german international mario gomez ' 13th goal of the campaign , moved to within four points of leader schalke 04 , who play away at wolfsburg on saturday , and two points ahead of werder bremen , who have lost two on the trot including one against stuttgart but play against bottom club hamburg this weekend . bundesliga leaders schalke 04 have offered their coach mirko slomka a new contract in the hope that is just the boost required to extend their unbeaten run to 13 when they travel to middle of the league vfl wolfsburg this weekend . the 39-year-old 's contract was due to expire in june but the new deal would link the coach to the gelsenkirchen outfit - who are on a run of six successive victories - till the end of the 2008/09 season . club general manager andeas müller met slomka - who took over from ralf rangnick in january 2006 - late on wednesday to talk about his future and said he was confident that there would be no hitches . " we have agreed a deal at every level and will terminate these discussions in the next two or three weeks , but i do not see anything which would prevent him signing a new contract , " said müller . this continues the seemingly unending good news for the 1997 uefa cup winners , as they sit six points clear of second-placed werder bremen and , more significantly , 11 points in front of bayern munich in fourth . it 's not over till it 's over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka knows it will be a difficult game in wolfsburg slomka , who was formerly in charge of the club 's youth system , is taking nothing for granted as schalke seek their eighth title but first since 1958 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 17.02.2007 right to abortion remains elusive in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women get abortions in neighboring countries when waiting lists are too long france has one of the most liberal abortion laws in europe - in theory .
in french abortion clinics , however , women 's right to decide for themselves what to do with their bodies is sometimes illusory . while portugal is currently liberalizing its laws to allow abortion up to the 10th week of pregnancy , french women have already had the right since 1975 .
the law , named after then-health minister simone veil , leaves it to the woman alone to decide whether to have an abortion .
it also requires every larger hospital to have a special service for abortions .
the veil law was amended in 2001 to allow abortions up to the 12th week of pregnancy .
since then even minors may in some cases have abortions without parental consent . but , in practice , not every woman is able to take advantage of those guaranteed rights , according to francoise laurant , head of the family planning organization mouvement francais pour le planning familiale -lrb- mfpf -rrb- . many hospitals do n't have enough personal , so that , during vacation times , women wanting abortions end up on ever longer waiting lists , she said .
some women discover then that they legal time limit has passed for them to have an abortion in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simone veil , here as president of the european parliament in 1979 " sometimes , the woman is then told , ' you can still get an abortion in holland or spain , " ' laurent said .
" but often the personnel tell the woman , ' that 's your problem ! '
and there are hospitals where it 's made difficult for a woman who wants to have a second abortion . " when abortion clinics do work well , it 's usually due to a doctor 's personal commitment - often because he or she remembers that so many women used to die or fall ill from botched illegal abortions , laurent added .
new generation unaware laurant said many of the doctors currently working in french abortion clinics were part of the 1970s women 's movement as medical students .
that means they have now nearly reached retirement age .
mfpf surveyed several regions in france to get an idea of how the situation would be in a few years , she said .
the results were alarming : there wo n't be any more doctors prepared to carry out abortions within two or three years . a recently completed doctor 's thesis about the amount of time and extent to which french medical students learn about abortion and contraception also determined that information on the subjects was desperately lacking .
furthermore , new doctors find it hard to imagine what life was like for women before abortion was made legal .
doctors ' arrogance working in abortion clinics is poorly paid and held in low esteem , and is thus unappealing to young doctors .
in addition , there 's an arrogance within the medical establishment , according to gynecologist marie-laure brival . for centuries , the male body was considered the measure of all things in the medical world .
doctors only turned their attention to the singularities of the female body when they decided they wanted to do more to improve the health of unborn children , brival said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french women have the right to decide whether to give birth or abort - theoretically " even today , doctors ' volition to control a woman 's body is still very strong , " she said .
" they dictate contraceptives to women .
they make contraception the norm .
it 's really up to a woman to make decisions about her own body .
a woman 's fertility gives her the choice .
it 's sometimes very painful to decide whether one wants a child or not .
but this freedom of choice is actually women 's exclusive right . " doctors are n't alone in viewing women 's bodies in this controlling manner .
in the late 1990s , commando actions against french abortion clinics modeled on the pro-life movement in the united states increased in number : militant so-called " protectors of life " insulted women on their way to having abortions , chained themselves to operating rooms , berated personnel . france made such actions illegal in 1993 .
always an issue these days , the " protectors of life " focus on lobbying and appeal to politicians to give the unborn a legal status and right to life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese voters called for liberalization of their abortion law in a referendum the women 's movement continues to fight a woman 's right to choose across europe .
poland has become an example in this respect : for 40 years , abortion was allowed there .
now it 's only permitted in exceptional cases and the government has said it will introduce a total ban . despite the planned changes to portugal 's law , laurant said she did n't think it was time yet to relax on the abortion front .
she recounted a recent inquiry from a journalist on the legal status of abortion across europe , asking when the right would be irreversible . " i told her : ' there will never become an irreversible right , " ' laurant said .
" it 's enough for a country to go through a political change or a religious group to put the government under pressure demanding abortion is banned during important talks .
and then it 's all over for women .

in french abortion clinics , however , women 's right to decide for themselves what to do with their bodies is sometimes illusory . while portugal is currently liberalizing its laws to allow abortion up to the 10th week of pregnancy , french women have already had the right since 1975 .
the law , named after then-health minister simone veil , leaves it to the woman alone to decide whether to have an abortion .
it also requires every larger hospital to have a special service for abortions .
the veil law was amended in 2001 to allow abortions up to the 12th week of pregnancy .
since then even minors may in some cases have abortions without parental consent . but , in practice , not every woman is able to take advantage of those guaranteed rights , according to francoise laurant , head of the family planning organization mouvement francais pour le planning familiale -lrb- mfpf -rrb- . many hospitals do n't have enough personal , so that , during vacation times , women wanting abortions end up on ever longer waiting lists , she said .

new generation unaware laurant said many of the doctors currently working in french abortion clinics were part of the 1970s women 's movement as medical students .
that means they have now nearly reached retirement age .
mfpf surveyed several regions in france to get an idea of how the situation would be in a few years , she said .
the results were alarming : there wo n't be any more doctors prepared to carry out abortions within two or three years . a recently completed doctor 's thesis about the amount of time and extent to which french medical students learn about abortion and contraception also determined that information on the subjects was desperately lacking .
furthermore , new doctors find it hard to imagine what life was like for women before abortion was made legal .
doctors ' arrogance working in abortion clinics is poorly paid and held in low esteem , and is thus unappealing to young doctors .
in addition , there 's an arrogance within the medical establishment , according to gynecologist marie-laure brival . for centuries , the male body was considered the measure of all things in the medical world .
doctors only turned their attention to the singularities of the female body when they decided they wanted to do more to improve the health of unborn children , brival said .

in french abortion clinics , however , women 's right to decide for themselves what to do with their bodies is sometimes illusory . while portugal is currently liberalizing its laws to allow abortion up to the 10th week of pregnancy , french women have already had the right since 1975 .
the law , named after then-health minister simone veil , leaves it to the woman alone to decide whether to have an abortion .
it also requires every larger hospital to have a special service for abortions .
the veil law was amended in 2001 to allow abortions up to the 12th week of pregnancy .
since then even minors may in some cases have abortions without parental consent . but , in practice , not every woman is able to take advantage of those guaranteed rights , according to francoise laurant , head of the family planning organization mouvement francais pour le planning familiale -lrb- mfpf -rrb- . many hospitals do n't have enough personal , so that , during vacation times , women wanting abortions end up on ever longer waiting lists , she said .
some women discover then that they legal time limit has passed for them to have an abortion in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simone veil , here as president of the european parliament in 1979 " sometimes , the woman is then told , ' you can still get an abortion in holland or spain , " ' laurent said .
" but often the personnel tell the woman , ' that 's your problem ! '
and there are hospitals where it 's made difficult for a woman who wants to have a second abortion . " when abortion clinics do work well , it 's usually due to a doctor 's personal commitment - often because he or she remembers that so many women used to die or fall ill from botched illegal abortions , laurent added .
new generation unaware laurant said many of the doctors currently working in french abortion clinics were part of the 1970s women 's movement as medical students .
that means they have now nearly reached retirement age .
mfpf surveyed several regions in france to get an idea of how the situation would be in a few years , she said .
the results were alarming : there wo n't be any more doctors prepared to carry out abortions within two or three years . a recently completed doctor 's thesis about the amount of time and extent to which french medical students learn about abortion and contraception also determined that information on the subjects was desperately lacking .
furthermore , new doctors find it hard to imagine what life was like for women before abortion was made legal .
doctors ' arrogance working in abortion clinics is poorly paid and held in low esteem , and is thus unappealing to young doctors .
in addition , there 's an arrogance within the medical establishment , according to gynecologist marie-laure brival . for centuries , the male body was considered the measure of all things in the medical world .
doctors only turned their attention to the singularities of the female body when they decided they wanted to do more to improve the health of unborn children , brival said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french women have the right to decide whether to give birth or abort - theoretically " even today , doctors ' volition to control a woman 's body is still very strong , " she said .
" they dictate contraceptives to women .
they make contraception the norm .
it 's really up to a woman to make decisions about her own body .
a woman 's fertility gives her the choice .
it 's sometimes very painful to decide whether one wants a child or not .
but this freedom of choice is actually women 's exclusive right . " doctors are n't alone in viewing women 's bodies in this controlling manner .
in the late 1990s , commando actions against french abortion clinics modeled on the pro-life movement in the united states increased in number : militant so-called " protectors of life " insulted women on their way to having abortions , chained themselves to operating rooms , berated personnel . france made such actions illegal in 1993 .
always an issue these days , the " protectors of life " focus on lobbying and appeal to politicians to give the unborn a legal status and right to life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese voters called for liberalization of their abortion law in a referendum the women 's movement continues to fight a woman 's right to choose across europe .
poland has become an example in this respect : for 40 years , abortion was allowed there .
now it 's only permitted in exceptional cases and the government has said it will introduce a total ban . despite the planned changes to portugal 's law , laurant said she did n't think it was time yet to relax on the abortion front .
she recounted a recent inquiry from a journalist on the legal status of abortion across europe , asking when the right would be irreversible . " i told her : ' there will never become an irreversible right , " ' laurant said .
" it 's enough for a country to go through a political change or a religious group to put the government under pressure demanding abortion is banned during important talks .
and then it 's all over for women .

reactions to the arrival of world leaders , police , journalists and protesters have been mixed in heiligendamm and the nearby town of bad doberan . free advertising to the world hartmut polzin , the mayor of bad doberan , said he is thrilled at the chance to show his town to the world .

" our improved infrastructure will be of long-term benefit to the regional economy .
it would normally have taken many more years to complete .
but the g8-summit has accelerated the process . " seaside grandeur the neighboring village of heiligendamm is the oldest german seaside resort .
composed of white classical buildings along the promenade , it was an elegant meeting place for high society until the 1930 's .
the russian tsar and his family , composer felix mendelssohn-bartholdy , poet rainer maria rilke , queen luise of prussia , and even dictators adolf hitler and benito mussolini used to be regular guests . kempinski hotel director torsten dressler is rolling out the red carpet and looking forward to demonstrating that the grand hotel heiligendamm is the ideal venue for meetings with high prominence where international protocol and personal attention are of the utmost importance . " people are characterized by their individuality , their like and dislikes , " he said .
" one drinks a certain tea , the other a special wine .

as hoteliers , we need to find out who likes what .

in recent weeks , german politicians have expressly welcomed peaceful demonstrators to the g8 summit .
but heiligendamm was selected to host the summit because of its isolated location and limited access to the grand hotel . nevertheless , the federal government expects huge international protests to converge on the summit , just as they did in st petersburg and gleneagles in recent years . the hotel privatization of public roads and plans to demolish further classicist villas along the beach have caused loud protest in the local community , according to 70-year-old marianne prüter , who has lived in heiligendamm since 1947 . " they 're excellent at building fences ! " she said , pointing out a high-security fence currently being built around the hotel .
the barrier is 14 kilometers long -lrb- 8.7 miles -rrb- and is planned to cost some 12.4 million euros -lrb- $ 16.3 million -rrb- to erect . counting the cost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sea resort will be packed in summer this summer about 10,000 police officers from across germany will be tasked with turning away unauthorized visitors from this fence .

" the fact is , mecklenburg is paying 13 million euros for the fence alone , " she said .
" the current official estimate is that our g8 summit in heiligendamm will cost a round 92 million euros just for security . " schwebs added that the federal government had promised to reimburse the state with 24 million euros , leaving the region with the rest of the tab . the conference 's costs are one of the main reasons locals have expressed their unhappiness with having world leaders converge on their towns .

poland has become an example in this respect : for 40 years , abortion was allowed there .
now it 's only permitted in exceptional cases and the government has said it will introduce a total ban . despite the planned changes to portugal 's law , laurant said she did n't think it was time yet to relax on the abortion front .
she recounted a recent inquiry from a journalist on the legal status of abortion across europe , asking when the right would be irreversible . " i told her : ' there will never become an irreversible right , " ' laurant said .
" it 's enough for a country to go through a political change or a religious group to put the government under pressure demanding abortion is banned during important talks .

"
but beyond the red carpet , the somewhat less glamorous stage of the european film market is what really counts for many . michael weber 's phone started ringing when bosnian film director jasmila zbanic was handed the golden bear last year . " ' grbavica ' sold much better afterwards , " said weber , who heads the match factory , which was in charge of selling the winning film of the 2006 berlin international film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a place for deal-making : the efm 's main floor the phone probably started ringing again on saturday .
while weber 's current berlinale competition entry , " yella " by german director christian petzold , did n't pick up the top prize , its star nina hoss took home the trophy for best actress . " it all depends on what happens tomorrow night , " weber had said on friday while sitting between packed-up boxes filled with promotional material in his company 's booth at the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- , where the buzz of previous days had already disappeared as most vendors were preparing to head home . bursting at the seams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's gropius bau museum ca n't hold the entire efm one of the world 's most important trading places for movies with some 19,000 attendees and 702 films on offer , the efm picked up steam in recent years after the american film market in los angeles was moved from february to november .
the market at the cannes film festival meanwhile still rules supreme . the boom in berlin has led to some to complain that market organizers had to find a bigger venue to keep all vendors under one roof instead of spreading them out over several locations .
according to news reports , efm head beki probst has already hired a consultancy firm to help her figure out how to deal with growth of 10 percent to 15 percent next year . many meetings , slow sales ? film industry trade magazines also quoted sellers and buyers , who were not impressed with the amount of business they had done at the market this year .
but weber joined others in saying that he had no reason to complain . " we 've had a lot of meetings , " he said , adding that " yella " has been sold to several countries - including switzerland , austria , portugal , greece and britain . exportable films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie , starring german actress nina hoss , will open in germany in october " yella , " which tells the story of an east german woman who goes to west germany in search of a better life , has received good reviews in the german press even though some movie critics left the theater scratching their heads because of the film 's twisted end . trade magazines such as the hollywood reporter and screen even saw the film embarking on an international career . " the elegant quasi-thriller chic of ' yella ' could prove -lrb- petzold 's -rrb- most exportable yet , if adventurous art house buyers take the bait , " read a screen review . first europe , then the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nina hoss with her bear weber said that " yella " would first have to sell well in europe before going elsewhere . " it 's a little cold for latin america , " he said . a certain bear-shaped trophy - even nina hoss ' silver one - might change all that , of course . " it 's happened before that someone had to double their offer " after a film won awards , weber said .

the french company owns about one third of nissan .
the newspaper said exploratory talks between chrysler and gm had begun . quoting automotive-industry sources , it said it was unlikely that gm , the world 's biggest carmaker , would take over the us subsidiary of daimlerchrysler outright .
both companies have declined comment on the speculation . " we often have discussions with automakers routinely , " gm spokesman tony cervone told reuters news agency .
" we do n't comment on speculation regarding discussions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was this zetsche 's last time in a chrysler ?
an alliance would mean gm and chrysler remain separate companies , but keeps open the possibility of cross-shareholding and the ability to act as a single company in product development , production and sales , the german daily said . chrysler chief executive tom lasorda said he wants to more than double global sales through new alliances , the wall street journal reported friday . advantages for both companies the initiative for the talks had come from chrysler .
sources familiar with the talks said that if a link-up were to be to gm 's advantage , the us group would contemplate such an arrangement . speculation since mid-week has driven daimlerchrysler stock higher this week , making it the top stock in frankfurt 's dax index for three straight days .
despite profit taking friday , it closed 1.3 percent higher at 54.12 euros -lrb- $ 72.45 -rrb- . chrysler is struggling with a slump in profitability as americans turn away from its range of big cars and favor imports .
the german arm of daimlerchrysler , mercedes , is in relatively healthy condition . daimlerchrysler 's chief executive dieter zetsche said he was reviewing " further strategic options " for chrysler and not ruling out any possibilities for the us carmaker 's future at an annual conference held on wednesday . automotive news europe had earlier reported top-level talks on an outright merger , but the süddeutsche zeitung said gm had too many problems of its own and would not want to bring another struggling company on board . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : dr. z 's emergency operation german and european editorials on thursday focused on major job cuts at chrysler and the announcement at daimlerchryler headquarters that a sale of the us carmaker was an option on the table .

in french abortion clinics , however , women 's right to decide for themselves what to do with their bodies is sometimes illusory . while portugal is currently liberalizing its laws to allow abortion up to the 10th week of pregnancy , french women have already had the right since 1975 .
the law , named after then-health minister simone veil , leaves it to the woman alone to decide whether to have an abortion .
it also requires every larger hospital to have a special service for abortions .
the veil law was amended in 2001 to allow abortions up to the 12th week of pregnancy .
since then even minors may in some cases have abortions without parental consent . but , in practice , not every woman is able to take advantage of those guaranteed rights , according to francoise laurant , head of the family planning organization mouvement francais pour le planning familiale -lrb- mfpf -rrb- . many hospitals do n't have enough personal , so that , during vacation times , women wanting abortions end up on ever longer waiting lists , she said .
some women discover then that they legal time limit has passed for them to have an abortion in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simone veil , here as president of the european parliament in 1979 " sometimes , the woman is then told , ' you can still get an abortion in holland or spain , " ' laurent said .
" but often the personnel tell the woman , ' that 's your problem ! '
and there are hospitals where it 's made difficult for a woman who wants to have a second abortion . " when abortion clinics do work well , it 's usually due to a doctor 's personal commitment - often because he or she remembers that so many women used to die or fall ill from botched illegal abortions , laurent added .
new generation unaware laurant said many of the doctors currently working in french abortion clinics were part of the 1970s women 's movement as medical students .
that means they have now nearly reached retirement age .
mfpf surveyed several regions in france to get an idea of how the situation would be in a few years , she said .
the results were alarming : there wo n't be any more doctors prepared to carry out abortions within two or three years . a recently completed doctor 's thesis about the amount of time and extent to which french medical students learn about abortion and contraception also determined that information on the subjects was desperately lacking .
furthermore , new doctors find it hard to imagine what life was like for women before abortion was made legal .
doctors ' arrogance working in abortion clinics is poorly paid and held in low esteem , and is thus unappealing to young doctors .
in addition , there 's an arrogance within the medical establishment , according to gynecologist marie-laure brival . for centuries , the male body was considered the measure of all things in the medical world .
doctors only turned their attention to the singularities of the female body when they decided they wanted to do more to improve the health of unborn children , brival said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french women have the right to decide whether to give birth or abort - theoretically " even today , doctors ' volition to control a woman 's body is still very strong , " she said .
" they dictate contraceptives to women .
they make contraception the norm .
it 's really up to a woman to make decisions about her own body .
a woman 's fertility gives her the choice .
it 's sometimes very painful to decide whether one wants a child or not .
but this freedom of choice is actually women 's exclusive right . " doctors are n't alone in viewing women 's bodies in this controlling manner .
in the late 1990s , commando actions against french abortion clinics modeled on the pro-life movement in the united states increased in number : militant so-called " protectors of life " insulted women on their way to having abortions , chained themselves to operating rooms , berated personnel . france made such actions illegal in 1993 .
always an issue these days , the " protectors of life " focus on lobbying and appeal to politicians to give the unborn a legal status and right to life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese voters called for liberalization of their abortion law in a referendum the women 's movement continues to fight a woman 's right to choose across europe .
poland has become an example in this respect : for 40 years , abortion was allowed there .
now it 's only permitted in exceptional cases and the government has said it will introduce a total ban . despite the planned changes to portugal 's law , laurant said she did n't think it was time yet to relax on the abortion front .
she recounted a recent inquiry from a journalist on the legal status of abortion across europe , asking when the right would be irreversible . " i told her : ' there will never become an irreversible right , " ' laurant said .
" it 's enough for a country to go through a political change or a religious group to put the government under pressure demanding abortion is banned during important talks .
and then it 's all over for women .

vfb stuttgart moved into second place in the race for the bundesliga title on friday as they humbled eintracht frankfurt 4-0 consigning their opponents to their seventh successive match without a win . stuttgart , inspired by recently capped german international mario gomez ' 13th goal of the campaign , moved to within four points of leader schalke 04 , who play away at wolfsburg on saturday , and two points ahead of werder bremen , who have lost two on the trot including one against stuttgart but play against bottom club hamburg this weekend . bundesliga leaders schalke 04 have offered their coach mirko slomka a new contract in the hope that is just the boost required to extend their unbeaten run to 13 when they travel to middle of the league vfl wolfsburg this weekend . the 39-year-old 's contract was due to expire in june but the new deal would link the coach to the gelsenkirchen outfit - who are on a run of six successive victories - till the end of the 2008/09 season . club general manager andeas müller met slomka - who took over from ralf rangnick in january 2006 - late on wednesday to talk about his future and said he was confident that there would be no hitches . " we have agreed a deal at every level and will terminate these discussions in the next two or three weeks , but i do not see anything which would prevent him signing a new contract , " said müller . this continues the seemingly unending good news for the 1997 uefa cup winners , as they sit six points clear of second-placed werder bremen and , more significantly , 11 points in front of bayern munich in fourth . it 's not over till it 's over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka knows it will be a difficult game in wolfsburg slomka , who was formerly in charge of the club 's youth system , is taking nothing for granted as schalke seek their eighth title but first since 1958 . " we 're happy to be six points clear , " he told the club web site .
" but while we have the quality to win the league , there are another 13 games left , not two . " " we 're hoping to have lots of support in wolfsburg on saturday .
it 's going to be another very difficult game because wolfsburg are having a good spell .
but we 'll be looking to maintain our lead there and if possible even extend it .
we want to carry on winning , " slomka said . schalke wo n't have it easy , however , with wolfsburg losing just once in the last nine visits of schalke to their volkswagen arena . a morale boost werder bremen meanwhile host hamburg sv on saturday after their rousing 3-0 uefa cup win over ajax on wednesday to boost morale following consecutive bundesliga defeats including a 2-0 home loss to schalke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this has n't been a great season for hamburg while hamburg lie at the bottom of the table , their hopes were revived last weekend when they beat borussia dortmund 3-0 for their second season win . but they badly need to follow up on this win in order to avoid a first relegation from the bundesliga since the league was founded in 1963 . " bremen versus hamburg is always an exciting game , " said hamburg coach huub stevens .
" we want to build on our good game against dortmund and i am convinced that we will play a good match in bremen as well . ' stevens has restored order in the team , suspending forward danijel luboja for the game for disciplinary reasons .
hamburg have won just one of the last 11 games in bremen , but will likely be happy enough if they get a 1-1 draw like in the last two games in the weserstadion . a draw will not be enough for bremen , though , as they quickly need to overcome their domestic slide if they want to stay in the title race . " we did n't show our true potential in the last games , " insisted sports director klaus allofs . solid defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's strength is in its solid defense bayern travel to lowly alemannia aachen on saturday having last weekend earned their first victory in four attempts since the winter break in beating arminia bielefeld 1-0 . it was ottmar hitzfeld 's first victory in his second spell as munich coach , having led them to the 2001 champions league title , following the departure of felix magath at the beginning of the month . " in my opinion , the fact we 've made progress was as important as the three points , " the 58-year-old said at the time saying that clean sheets were what mattered in football . " you only succeed as a team with a solid defense .
that 's the fundamental element in winning matches .

vfb stuttgart moved into second place in the race for the bundesliga title on friday as they humbled eintracht frankfurt 4-0 consigning their opponents to their seventh successive match without a win . stuttgart , inspired by recently capped german international mario gomez ' 13th goal of the campaign , moved to within four points of leader schalke 04 , who play away at wolfsburg on saturday , and two points ahead of werder bremen , who have lost two on the trot including one against stuttgart but play against bottom club hamburg this weekend . bundesliga leaders schalke 04 have offered their coach mirko slomka a new contract in the hope that is just the boost required to extend their unbeaten run to 13 when they travel to middle of the league vfl wolfsburg this weekend . the 39-year-old 's contract was due to expire in june but the new deal would link the coach to the gelsenkirchen outfit - who are on a run of six successive victories - till the end of the 2008/09 season . club general manager andeas müller met slomka - who took over from ralf rangnick in january 2006 - late on wednesday to talk about his future and said he was confident that there would be no hitches . " we have agreed a deal at every level and will terminate these discussions in the next two or three weeks , but i do not see anything which would prevent him signing a new contract , " said müller . this continues the seemingly unending good news for the 1997 uefa cup winners , as they sit six points clear of second-placed werder bremen and , more significantly , 11 points in front of bayern munich in fourth . it 's not over till it 's over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka knows it will be a difficult game in wolfsburg slomka , who was formerly in charge of the club 's youth system , is taking nothing for granted as schalke seek their eighth title but first since 1958 . " we 're happy to be six points clear , " he told the club web site .
" but while we have the quality to win the league , there are another 13 games left , not two . " " we 're hoping to have lots of support in wolfsburg on saturday .
it 's going to be another very difficult game because wolfsburg are having a good spell .
but we 'll be looking to maintain our lead there and if possible even extend it .
we want to carry on winning , " slomka said . schalke wo n't have it easy , however , with wolfsburg losing just once in the last nine visits of schalke to their volkswagen arena . a morale boost werder bremen meanwhile host hamburg sv on saturday after their rousing 3-0 uefa cup win over ajax on wednesday to boost morale following consecutive bundesliga defeats including a 2-0 home loss to schalke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this has n't been a great season for hamburg while hamburg lie at the bottom of the table , their hopes were revived last weekend when they beat borussia dortmund 3-0 for their second season win . but they badly need to follow up on this win in order to avoid a first relegation from the bundesliga since the league was founded in 1963 . " bremen versus hamburg is always an exciting game , " said hamburg coach huub stevens .
" we want to build on our good game against dortmund and i am convinced that we will play a good match in bremen as well . ' stevens has restored order in the team , suspending forward danijel luboja for the game for disciplinary reasons .
hamburg have won just one of the last 11 games in bremen , but will likely be happy enough if they get a 1-1 draw like in the last two games in the weserstadion . a draw will not be enough for bremen , though , as they quickly need to overcome their domestic slide if they want to stay in the title race . " we did n't show our true potential in the last games , " insisted sports director klaus allofs . solid defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's strength is in its solid defense bayern travel to lowly alemannia aachen on saturday having last weekend earned their first victory in four attempts since the winter break in beating arminia bielefeld 1-0 . it was ottmar hitzfeld 's first victory in his second spell as munich coach , having led them to the 2001 champions league title , following the departure of felix magath at the beginning of the month . " in my opinion , the fact we 've made progress was as important as the three points , " the 58-year-old said at the time saying that clean sheets were what mattered in football . " you only succeed as a team with a solid defense .
that 's the fundamental element in winning matches .

in french abortion clinics , however , women 's right to decide for themselves what to do with their bodies is sometimes illusory . while portugal is currently liberalizing its laws to allow abortion up to the 10th week of pregnancy , french women have already had the right since 1975 .
the law , named after then-health minister simone veil , leaves it to the woman alone to decide whether to have an abortion .
it also requires every larger hospital to have a special service for abortions .
the veil law was amended in 2001 to allow abortions up to the 12th week of pregnancy .
since then even minors may in some cases have abortions without parental consent . but , in practice , not every woman is able to take advantage of those guaranteed rights , according to francoise laurant , head of the family planning organization mouvement francais pour le planning familiale -lrb- mfpf -rrb- . many hospitals do n't have enough personal , so that , during vacation times , women wanting abortions end up on ever longer waiting lists , she said .

furthermore , new doctors find it hard to imagine what life was like for women before abortion was made legal .

" in europe we 've cherished the illusion in recent years that ' we 've done enough , " ' he said in the interview to be published sunday . steiner praised berlin for making the fight against climate change a cornerstone of its six-month eu presidency , but also warned germany , the eu 's largest polluter , that it needed to do more to lower emissions . steiner 's comments echo those of the european union 's environment commissioner stavros dimas who two weeks ago said germany must " be aware of its responsibility and its position as a role model in the fight against climate change . " setting realistic goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission saw its climate goals watered down largely at the behest of the country 's automotive and other industries , german politicians have called for the eu to set manageable and realistic climate change goals as the timeline set by the 1990 kyoto protocol comes to an end in 2012 . the european commission presented a far-reaching plan to curb co2 emissions across the 27-member bloc by 20 percent by 2020 , a goal that was met with skepticism in germany . " yes , we favor ecology and responsibility for the future , but let us stick to what we can do , " said social democratic party head kurt beck in a speech on saturday .
" let 's stay reasonable , yes , but let 's use our technology worldwide so that other countries can grow with less co2 . " placing blame where it 's due bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steiner said it 's irresponsible of europeans to blame only china for climate change but steiner warned industrialized nations , which he said are responsible for the globe 's current climate problem , not to put the burden of lowering emissions on developing nations . " the climate problem of today was not caused by china but above all by western nations , " he said .
" so the first step has to come from us .
moreover , it 's wrong to assume that china is not interested in climate protection .

" in europe we 've cherished the illusion in recent years that ' we 've done enough , " ' he said in the interview to be published sunday . steiner praised berlin for making the fight against climate change a cornerstone of its six-month eu presidency , but also warned germany , the eu 's largest polluter , that it needed to do more to lower emissions . steiner 's comments echo those of the european union 's environment commissioner stavros dimas who two weeks ago said germany must " be aware of its responsibility and its position as a role model in the fight against climate change . " setting realistic goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission saw its climate goals watered down largely at the behest of the country 's automotive and other industries , german politicians have called for the eu to set manageable and realistic climate change goals as the timeline set by the 1990 kyoto protocol comes to an end in 2012 . the european commission presented a far-reaching plan to curb co2 emissions across the 27-member bloc by 20 percent by 2020 , a goal that was met with skepticism in germany . " yes , we favor ecology and responsibility for the future , but let us stick to what we can do , " said social democratic party head kurt beck in a speech on saturday .
" let 's stay reasonable , yes , but let 's use our technology worldwide so that other countries can grow with less co2 . " placing blame where it 's due bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steiner said it 's irresponsible of europeans to blame only china for climate change but steiner warned industrialized nations , which he said are responsible for the globe 's current climate problem , not to put the burden of lowering emissions on developing nations . " the climate problem of today was not caused by china but above all by western nations , " he said .
" so the first step has to come from us .
moreover , it 's wrong to assume that china is not interested in climate protection .

the french company owns about one third of nissan .
the newspaper said exploratory talks between chrysler and gm had begun . quoting automotive-industry sources , it said it was unlikely that gm , the world 's biggest carmaker , would take over the us subsidiary of daimlerchrysler outright .
both companies have declined comment on the speculation . " we often have discussions with automakers routinely , " gm spokesman tony cervone told reuters news agency .

sources familiar with the talks said that if a link-up were to be to gm 's advantage , the us group would contemplate such an arrangement . speculation since mid-week has driven daimlerchrysler stock higher this week , making it the top stock in frankfurt 's dax index for three straight days .
despite profit taking friday , it closed 1.3 percent higher at 54.12 euros -lrb- $ 72.45 -rrb- . chrysler is struggling with a slump in profitability as americans turn away from its range of big cars and favor imports .
the german arm of daimlerchrysler , mercedes , is in relatively healthy condition . daimlerchrysler 's chief executive dieter zetsche said he was reviewing " further strategic options " for chrysler and not ruling out any possibilities for the us carmaker 's future at an annual conference held on wednesday . automotive news europe had earlier reported top-level talks on an outright merger , but the süddeutsche zeitung said gm had too many problems of its own and would not want to bring another struggling company on board . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : dr. z 's emergency operation german and european editorials on thursday focused on major job cuts at chrysler and the announcement at daimlerchryler headquarters that a sale of the us carmaker was an option on the table .

berlin 's film festival used to be a place for oscar nominees to promote themselves prior to voting .
that 's changed as the festival has turned from artistic showcase into a marketing tool for movies . the berlin international film festival is the largest of its kind in terms of attendance - selling 180,000 tickets over 10 days .
it 's now also one of the three biggest festivals in terms of deal-making , alongside cannes in may and the american film market in november . the berlinale has long been one of the big places to market and push films towards the oscars .
but recently , berlin has become little more than a cog in the machine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matt damon , martina gedeck and robert de niro on the red carpet at the berlinale when cate blanchett walked out onto the red carpet at the berlin film festival this week , the paparazzi were there in full force .
jennifer lopez , clint eastwood , matt damon and robert de niro also got superstar treatment as they screened their movies at germany 's annual film bash . the stars are out in berlin and they 're out for a reason .
they come to the festival to push their films to a european audience .
that 's been the case since the berlin film festival began 57 years ago .
what 's changed is that berlin is now more of a stepping-stone for a movie on its way towards the academy awards , which are one of the most important financial factors for a film 's success . supporting role ? " i think , because the -lrb- oscar -rrb- nominations are out , what happens is that the berlin red carpet is just a promotion and marketing , " said dieter kosslick , the berlinale 's festival director .
" we play one role in this whole alley leading up to the oscars .
but we are still happy and if you see our program , there is no lack of oscar-nominated people like robert de niro , like judi dench , like cate blanchett who are here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastwood 's an oscar hopeful again this year previously , oscar nominees came to berlin to get attention and win over voters .
the academy awards used to be handed out in late march , giving berlin a more prominent role in the lead-up , allowing voters to take into account the reception movies got in germany . " before , when the oscars were one month later , our role was a little bit stronger , because the nominations were n't out at this time , " kosslick said . but now that hollywood 's biggest prizes are handed out in the last week of february , the final votes have already been cast before the first movie in berlin is projected onto the screen . siamese brothers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film posters at the festival 's main drag kosslick has embraced this , saying that instead of an artistic showcase , the berlinale becomes more of a marketing tool .
that 's given the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- , which takes place during the festival , a big boost .
it 's now one of the three biggest film markets of the year - along side cannes , and the american film market . " the market is just for the professionals while the rest of the festival is open to the public , but i always say that the festival and the market are tied to each other , " said beki probst , who heads the efm .
" it 's like two siamese brothers growing together .
the market actually gives the structure to all those people to permit them to do business .
like any other market , whether you are selling apples or films , the market is for the sellers to meet buyers .

vfb stuttgart moved into second place in the race for the bundesliga title on friday as they humbled eintracht frankfurt 4-0 consigning their opponents to their seventh successive match without a win . stuttgart , inspired by recently capped german international mario gomez ' 13th goal of the campaign , moved to within four points of leader schalke 04 , who play away at wolfsburg on saturday , and two points ahead of werder bremen , who have lost two on the trot including one against stuttgart but play against bottom club hamburg this weekend . bundesliga leaders schalke 04 have offered their coach mirko slomka a new contract in the hope that is just the boost required to extend their unbeaten run to 13 when they travel to middle of the league vfl wolfsburg this weekend . the 39-year-old 's contract was due to expire in june but the new deal would link the coach to the gelsenkirchen outfit - who are on a run of six successive victories - till the end of the 2008/09 season . club general manager andeas müller met slomka - who took over from ralf rangnick in january 2006 - late on wednesday to talk about his future and said he was confident that there would be no hitches . " we have agreed a deal at every level and will terminate these discussions in the next two or three weeks , but i do not see anything which would prevent him signing a new contract , " said müller . this continues the seemingly unending good news for the 1997 uefa cup winners , as they sit six points clear of second-placed werder bremen and , more significantly , 11 points in front of bayern munich in fourth . it 's not over till it 's over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka knows it will be a difficult game in wolfsburg slomka , who was formerly in charge of the club 's youth system , is taking nothing for granted as schalke seek their eighth title but first since 1958 . " we 're happy to be six points clear , " he told the club web site .
" but while we have the quality to win the league , there are another 13 games left , not two . " " we 're hoping to have lots of support in wolfsburg on saturday .
it 's going to be another very difficult game because wolfsburg are having a good spell .
but we 'll be looking to maintain our lead there and if possible even extend it .
we want to carry on winning , " slomka said . schalke wo n't have it easy , however , with wolfsburg losing just once in the last nine visits of schalke to their volkswagen arena . a morale boost werder bremen meanwhile host hamburg sv on saturday after their rousing 3-0 uefa cup win over ajax on wednesday to boost morale following consecutive bundesliga defeats including a 2-0 home loss to schalke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this has n't been a great season for hamburg while hamburg lie at the bottom of the table , their hopes were revived last weekend when they beat borussia dortmund 3-0 for their second season win . but they badly need to follow up on this win in order to avoid a first relegation from the bundesliga since the league was founded in 1963 . " bremen versus hamburg is always an exciting game , " said hamburg coach huub stevens .
" we want to build on our good game against dortmund and i am convinced that we will play a good match in bremen as well . ' stevens has restored order in the team , suspending forward danijel luboja for the game for disciplinary reasons .
hamburg have won just one of the last 11 games in bremen , but will likely be happy enough if they get a 1-1 draw like in the last two games in the weserstadion . a draw will not be enough for bremen , though , as they quickly need to overcome their domestic slide if they want to stay in the title race . " we did n't show our true potential in the last games , " insisted sports director klaus allofs . solid defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's strength is in its solid defense bayern travel to lowly alemannia aachen on saturday having last weekend earned their first victory in four attempts since the winter break in beating arminia bielefeld 1-0 . it was ottmar hitzfeld 's first victory in his second spell as munich coach , having led them to the 2001 champions league title , following the departure of felix magath at the beginning of the month . " in my opinion , the fact we 've made progress was as important as the three points , " the 58-year-old said at the time saying that clean sheets were what mattered in football .

vfb stuttgart moved into second place in the race for the bundesliga title on friday as they humbled eintracht frankfurt 4-0 consigning their opponents to their seventh successive match without a win . stuttgart , inspired by recently capped german international mario gomez ' 13th goal of the campaign , moved to within four points of leader schalke 04 , who play away at wolfsburg on saturday , and two points ahead of werder bremen , who have lost two on the trot including one against stuttgart but play against bottom club hamburg this weekend . bundesliga leaders schalke 04 have offered their coach mirko slomka a new contract in the hope that is just the boost required to extend their unbeaten run to 13 when they travel to middle of the league vfl wolfsburg this weekend . the 39-year-old 's contract was due to expire in june but the new deal would link the coach to the gelsenkirchen outfit - who are on a run of six successive victories - till the end of the 2008/09 season . club general manager andeas müller met slomka - who took over from ralf rangnick in january 2006 - late on wednesday to talk about his future and said he was confident that there would be no hitches . " we have agreed a deal at every level and will terminate these discussions in the next two or three weeks , but i do not see anything which would prevent him signing a new contract , " said müller . this continues the seemingly unending good news for the 1997 uefa cup winners , as they sit six points clear of second-placed werder bremen and , more significantly , 11 points in front of bayern munich in fourth . it 's not over till it 's over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka knows it will be a difficult game in wolfsburg slomka , who was formerly in charge of the club 's youth system , is taking nothing for granted as schalke seek their eighth title but first since 1958 .

" we want to build on our good game against dortmund and i am convinced that we will play a good match in bremen as well . ' stevens has restored order in the team , suspending forward danijel luboja for the game for disciplinary reasons .
hamburg have won just one of the last 11 games in bremen , but will likely be happy enough if they get a 1-1 draw like in the last two games in the weserstadion . a draw will not be enough for bremen , though , as they quickly need to overcome their domestic slide if they want to stay in the title race .

"
but beyond the red carpet , the somewhat less glamorous stage of the european film market is what really counts for many . michael weber 's phone started ringing when bosnian film director jasmila zbanic was handed the golden bear last year . " ' grbavica ' sold much better afterwards , " said weber , who heads the match factory , which was in charge of selling the winning film of the 2006 berlin international film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a place for deal-making : the efm 's main floor the phone probably started ringing again on saturday .
while weber 's current berlinale competition entry , " yella " by german director christian petzold , did n't pick up the top prize , its star nina hoss took home the trophy for best actress . " it all depends on what happens tomorrow night , " weber had said on friday while sitting between packed-up boxes filled with promotional material in his company 's booth at the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- , where the buzz of previous days had already disappeared as most vendors were preparing to head home . bursting at the seams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's gropius bau museum ca n't hold the entire efm one of the world 's most important trading places for movies with some 19,000 attendees and 702 films on offer , the efm picked up steam in recent years after the american film market in los angeles was moved from february to november .
the market at the cannes film festival meanwhile still rules supreme . the boom in berlin has led to some to complain that market organizers had to find a bigger venue to keep all vendors under one roof instead of spreading them out over several locations .
according to news reports , efm head beki probst has already hired a consultancy firm to help her figure out how to deal with growth of 10 percent to 15 percent next year . many meetings , slow sales ? film industry trade magazines also quoted sellers and buyers , who were not impressed with the amount of business they had done at the market this year .
but weber joined others in saying that he had no reason to complain . " we 've had a lot of meetings , " he said , adding that " yella " has been sold to several countries - including switzerland , austria , portugal , greece and britain . exportable films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie , starring german actress nina hoss , will open in germany in october " yella , " which tells the story of an east german woman who goes to west germany in search of a better life , has received good reviews in the german press even though some movie critics left the theater scratching their heads because of the film 's twisted end . trade magazines such as the hollywood reporter and screen even saw the film embarking on an international career . " the elegant quasi-thriller chic of ' yella ' could prove -lrb- petzold 's -rrb- most exportable yet , if adventurous art house buyers take the bait , " read a screen review . first europe , then the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nina hoss with her bear weber said that " yella " would first have to sell well in europe before going elsewhere . " it 's a little cold for latin america , " he said . a certain bear-shaped trophy - even nina hoss ' silver one - might change all that , of course . " it 's happened before that someone had to double their offer " after a film won awards , weber said .
" but it 's also happened that someone revised an offer because of a bad review .

that 's been the case since the berlin film festival began 57 years ago .
what 's changed is that berlin is now more of a stepping-stone for a movie on its way towards the academy awards , which are one of the most important financial factors for a film 's success . supporting role ? " i think , because the -lrb- oscar -rrb- nominations are out , what happens is that the berlin red carpet is just a promotion and marketing , " said dieter kosslick , the berlinale 's festival director .

" before , when the oscars were one month later , our role was a little bit stronger , because the nominations were n't out at this time , " kosslick said . but now that hollywood 's biggest prizes are handed out in the last week of february , the final votes have already been cast before the first movie in berlin is projected onto the screen . siamese brothers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film posters at the festival 's main drag kosslick has embraced this , saying that instead of an artistic showcase , the berlinale becomes more of a marketing tool .

the french company owns about one third of nissan .
the newspaper said exploratory talks between chrysler and gm had begun . quoting automotive-industry sources , it said it was unlikely that gm , the world 's biggest carmaker , would take over the us subsidiary of daimlerchrysler outright .
both companies have declined comment on the speculation . " we often have discussions with automakers routinely , " gm spokesman tony cervone told reuters news agency .
" we do n't comment on speculation regarding discussions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was this zetsche 's last time in a chrysler ?
an alliance would mean gm and chrysler remain separate companies , but keeps open the possibility of cross-shareholding and the ability to act as a single company in product development , production and sales , the german daily said . chrysler chief executive tom lasorda said he wants to more than double global sales through new alliances , the wall street journal reported friday . advantages for both companies the initiative for the talks had come from chrysler .
sources familiar with the talks said that if a link-up were to be to gm 's advantage , the us group would contemplate such an arrangement . speculation since mid-week has driven daimlerchrysler stock higher this week , making it the top stock in frankfurt 's dax index for three straight days .
despite profit taking friday , it closed 1.3 percent higher at 54.12 euros -lrb- $ 72.45 -rrb- . chrysler is struggling with a slump in profitability as americans turn away from its range of big cars and favor imports .
the german arm of daimlerchrysler , mercedes , is in relatively healthy condition . daimlerchrysler 's chief executive dieter zetsche said he was reviewing " further strategic options " for chrysler and not ruling out any possibilities for the us carmaker 's future at an annual conference held on wednesday . automotive news europe had earlier reported top-level talks on an outright merger , but the süddeutsche zeitung said gm had too many problems of its own and would not want to bring another struggling company on board . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : dr. z 's emergency operation german and european editorials on thursday focused on major job cuts at chrysler and the announcement at daimlerchryler headquarters that a sale of the us carmaker was an option on the table .

berlin 's film festival used to be a place for oscar nominees to promote themselves prior to voting .
that 's changed as the festival has turned from artistic showcase into a marketing tool for movies . the berlin international film festival is the largest of its kind in terms of attendance - selling 180,000 tickets over 10 days .
it 's now also one of the three biggest festivals in terms of deal-making , alongside cannes in may and the american film market in november . the berlinale has long been one of the big places to market and push films towards the oscars .
but recently , berlin has become little more than a cog in the machine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matt damon , martina gedeck and robert de niro on the red carpet at the berlinale when cate blanchett walked out onto the red carpet at the berlin film festival this week , the paparazzi were there in full force .

they come to the festival to push their films to a european audience .
that 's been the case since the berlin film festival began 57 years ago .
what 's changed is that berlin is now more of a stepping-stone for a movie on its way towards the academy awards , which are one of the most important financial factors for a film 's success . supporting role ? " i think , because the -lrb- oscar -rrb- nominations are out , what happens is that the berlin red carpet is just a promotion and marketing , " said dieter kosslick , the berlinale 's festival director .
" we play one role in this whole alley leading up to the oscars .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastwood 's an oscar hopeful again this year previously , oscar nominees came to berlin to get attention and win over voters .
the academy awards used to be handed out in late march , giving berlin a more prominent role in the lead-up , allowing voters to take into account the reception movies got in germany . " before , when the oscars were one month later , our role was a little bit stronger , because the nominations were n't out at this time , " kosslick said . but now that hollywood 's biggest prizes are handed out in the last week of february , the final votes have already been cast before the first movie in berlin is projected onto the screen . siamese brothers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film posters at the festival 's main drag kosslick has embraced this , saying that instead of an artistic showcase , the berlinale becomes more of a marketing tool .
that 's given the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- , which takes place during the festival , a big boost .
it 's now one of the three biggest film markets of the year - along side cannes , and the american film market . " the market is just for the professionals while the rest of the festival is open to the public , but i always say that the festival and the market are tied to each other , " said beki probst , who heads the efm .

"
but beyond the red carpet , the somewhat less glamorous stage of the european film market is what really counts for many . michael weber 's phone started ringing when bosnian film director jasmila zbanic was handed the golden bear last year . " ' grbavica ' sold much better afterwards , " said weber , who heads the match factory , which was in charge of selling the winning film of the 2006 berlin international film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a place for deal-making : the efm 's main floor the phone probably started ringing again on saturday .
while weber 's current berlinale competition entry , " yella " by german director christian petzold , did n't pick up the top prize , its star nina hoss took home the trophy for best actress . " it all depends on what happens tomorrow night , " weber had said on friday while sitting between packed-up boxes filled with promotional material in his company 's booth at the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- , where the buzz of previous days had already disappeared as most vendors were preparing to head home . bursting at the seams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's gropius bau museum ca n't hold the entire efm one of the world 's most important trading places for movies with some 19,000 attendees and 702 films on offer , the efm picked up steam in recent years after the american film market in los angeles was moved from february to november .
the market at the cannes film festival meanwhile still rules supreme . the boom in berlin has led to some to complain that market organizers had to find a bigger venue to keep all vendors under one roof instead of spreading them out over several locations .
according to news reports , efm head beki probst has already hired a consultancy firm to help her figure out how to deal with growth of 10 percent to 15 percent next year . many meetings , slow sales ? film industry trade magazines also quoted sellers and buyers , who were not impressed with the amount of business they had done at the market this year .
but weber joined others in saying that he had no reason to complain . " we 've had a lot of meetings , " he said , adding that " yella " has been sold to several countries - including switzerland , austria , portugal , greece and britain . exportable films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie , starring german actress nina hoss , will open in germany in october " yella , " which tells the story of an east german woman who goes to west germany in search of a better life , has received good reviews in the german press even though some movie critics left the theater scratching their heads because of the film 's twisted end . trade magazines such as the hollywood reporter and screen even saw the film embarking on an international career . " the elegant quasi-thriller chic of ' yella ' could prove -lrb- petzold 's -rrb- most exportable yet , if adventurous art house buyers take the bait , " read a screen review . first europe , then the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nina hoss with her bear weber said that " yella " would first have to sell well in europe before going elsewhere . " it 's a little cold for latin america , " he said . a certain bear-shaped trophy - even nina hoss ' silver one - might change all that , of course . " it 's happened before that someone had to double their offer " after a film won awards , weber said .
" but it 's also happened that someone revised an offer because of a bad review .

" in europe we 've cherished the illusion in recent years that ' we 've done enough , " ' he said in the interview to be published sunday . steiner praised berlin for making the fight against climate change a cornerstone of its six-month eu presidency , but also warned germany , the eu 's largest polluter , that it needed to do more to lower emissions . steiner 's comments echo those of the european union 's environment commissioner stavros dimas who two weeks ago said germany must " be aware of its responsibility and its position as a role model in the fight against climate change . " setting realistic goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission saw its climate goals watered down largely at the behest of the country 's automotive and other industries , german politicians have called for the eu to set manageable and realistic climate change goals as the timeline set by the 1990 kyoto protocol comes to an end in 2012 . the european commission presented a far-reaching plan to curb co2 emissions across the 27-member bloc by 20 percent by 2020 , a goal that was met with skepticism in germany . " yes , we favor ecology and responsibility for the future , but let us stick to what we can do , " said social democratic party head kurt beck in a speech on saturday .
" let 's stay reasonable , yes , but let 's use our technology worldwide so that other countries can grow with less co2 . " placing blame where it 's due bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steiner said it 's irresponsible of europeans to blame only china for climate change but steiner warned industrialized nations , which he said are responsible for the globe 's current climate problem , not to put the burden of lowering emissions on developing nations . " the climate problem of today was not caused by china but above all by western nations , " he said .
" so the first step has to come from us .
moreover , it 's wrong to assume that china is not interested in climate protection . " he added that china has begun implementing a plan to increase its use of renewable energy , and the united states , which is not a signatory to the kyoto protocol , is also making advances in the environmentally friendly technologies . " the americans and asians are catching up quickly and are becoming strong business competitors -lrb- with green technologies -rrb- , " steiner said .

in french abortion clinics , however , women 's right to decide for themselves what to do with their bodies is sometimes illusory . while portugal is currently liberalizing its laws to allow abortion up to the 10th week of pregnancy , french women have already had the right since 1975 .
the law , named after then-health minister simone veil , leaves it to the woman alone to decide whether to have an abortion .
it also requires every larger hospital to have a special service for abortions .
the veil law was amended in 2001 to allow abortions up to the 12th week of pregnancy .
since then even minors may in some cases have abortions without parental consent . but , in practice , not every woman is able to take advantage of those guaranteed rights , according to francoise laurant , head of the family planning organization mouvement francais pour le planning familiale -lrb- mfpf -rrb- . many hospitals do n't have enough personal , so that , during vacation times , women wanting abortions end up on ever longer waiting lists , she said .
some women discover then that they legal time limit has passed for them to have an abortion in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simone veil , here as president of the european parliament in 1979 " sometimes , the woman is then told , ' you can still get an abortion in holland or spain , " ' laurent said .
" but often the personnel tell the woman , ' that 's your problem ! '
and there are hospitals where it 's made difficult for a woman who wants to have a second abortion . " when abortion clinics do work well , it 's usually due to a doctor 's personal commitment - often because he or she remembers that so many women used to die or fall ill from botched illegal abortions , laurent added .
new generation unaware laurant said many of the doctors currently working in french abortion clinics were part of the 1970s women 's movement as medical students .
that means they have now nearly reached retirement age .
mfpf surveyed several regions in france to get an idea of how the situation would be in a few years , she said .
the results were alarming : there wo n't be any more doctors prepared to carry out abortions within two or three years . a recently completed doctor 's thesis about the amount of time and extent to which french medical students learn about abortion and contraception also determined that information on the subjects was desperately lacking .
furthermore , new doctors find it hard to imagine what life was like for women before abortion was made legal .
doctors ' arrogance working in abortion clinics is poorly paid and held in low esteem , and is thus unappealing to young doctors .
in addition , there 's an arrogance within the medical establishment , according to gynecologist marie-laure brival . for centuries , the male body was considered the measure of all things in the medical world .
doctors only turned their attention to the singularities of the female body when they decided they wanted to do more to improve the health of unborn children , brival said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french women have the right to decide whether to give birth or abort - theoretically " even today , doctors ' volition to control a woman 's body is still very strong , " she said .
" they dictate contraceptives to women .
they make contraception the norm .
it 's really up to a woman to make decisions about her own body .
a woman 's fertility gives her the choice .
it 's sometimes very painful to decide whether one wants a child or not .
but this freedom of choice is actually women 's exclusive right . " doctors are n't alone in viewing women 's bodies in this controlling manner .
in the late 1990s , commando actions against french abortion clinics modeled on the pro-life movement in the united states increased in number : militant so-called " protectors of life " insulted women on their way to having abortions , chained themselves to operating rooms , berated personnel . france made such actions illegal in 1993 .
always an issue these days , the " protectors of life " focus on lobbying and appeal to politicians to give the unborn a legal status and right to life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese voters called for liberalization of their abortion law in a referendum the women 's movement continues to fight a woman 's right to choose across europe .
poland has become an example in this respect : for 40 years , abortion was allowed there .
now it 's only permitted in exceptional cases and the government has said it will introduce a total ban . despite the planned changes to portugal 's law , laurant said she did n't think it was time yet to relax on the abortion front .
she recounted a recent inquiry from a journalist on the legal status of abortion across europe , asking when the right would be irreversible . " i told her : ' there will never become an irreversible right , " ' laurant said .
" it 's enough for a country to go through a political change or a religious group to put the government under pressure demanding abortion is banned during important talks .
and then it 's all over for women .

sweden is especially uneasy about the project .
besides environmental concerns , some swedish politicians fear it may be used for spying . gotland is a small island in the central baltic sea , just 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- off the swedish mainland .
known for its white beaches , this idyllic island is slowly but surely becoming better known for a more recent legacy : its opposition to the russian gas pipeline project . nord stream , a russian-german consortium , is planning to build a 1,200 kilometer-long pipeline that will satisfy europe 's growing demand for natural gas , courtesy of russian energy giant gazprom .
starting 2010 , the pipeline is expected to pump natural gas from russia through the baltic sea to a location near greifswald in northern germany . " the pipeline is going to go directly along the coast of gotland , " said asa andersson of the swedish world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
" the environmental impact is questionable .
nord stream has to address all possible scenarios .
so far , this has been neglected . " andersson said other routes through the baltic , possibly along previously established pipeline paths , should be examined . environmental assessment underway nord stream is currently conducting an environmental impact assessment for the project .
the consortium said it plans to present its final report to the various national authorities this fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has long been a proponent for the gas pipeline while a country has the right to impose additional requirements it doubts pipeline 's environmental safety , only states whose germany , russia , finland , denmark and sweden have the ability to veto the project .
other neighboring countries , such as poland or the baltic states , are entitled to hear the report , but have no veto powers . " all sensitive points are being carefully reviewed , " said the chairman of the shareholder ’ s board on wednesday in brussels .
he is gerhard schröder , the former chancellor of germany who enjoyed friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin . criticism from all angles despite the former chancellor 's assurances , the mega-project has been met by criticism from all sides . swedish environmental groups are especially concerned that the pipeline passes too closely along the marine reserve near gotland .
they say the construction work could stir up toxins long dormant at the bottom of the seaand harm the flora and fauna living in the waters surrounding the swedish island .
gotland 's local fisheries also fear the pipeline could interfere with their fishing nets . but the greatest concern is over tons of chemical weapons left over from world war ii at the bottom of the sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are nervous pipeline explosions , other of espionage " the munitions are a high security risk , " andersson said , adding that explosions could easily set free dangerous chemicals . nord stream , however , said the explosives would not be a danger to the pipeline and that engineers are systematically scanning the seabed along the 1,200-kilometer long route . " we are familiar with the storage sites for these munitions , " nord stream spokeman jens müller said .
" the pipeline will not run in their vicinity . " ecological , political fears christian dahlke , division head at the office of maritime traffic and hydrography , the federal agency that assesses nord stream 's environmental report for germany , said there is little reason for concern once the pipeline is built . " gazprom has grasped that this project has to be carried out along european guidelines , " he said .
" there weren ’ t any problems with pipelines in the north sea . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is afraid its supply of russian gas could be cut off in the future but that has n't stopped several german environmental groups from joining their swedish and finnish counterparts in opposing the pipeline .
warsaw has also come out against the plan , fearing moscow could cuts gas deliveries to poland in the future .
if built , the pipeline could supply up to 25 percent of europe 's natural gas supplies by 2015 . sweden 's national security concerns the pipeline has also become a security issue for the swedes .
several swedish politicians , from both the governing party and opposition , have publicly expressed concern that russian intelligence agencies could abuse the pipeline project for renewed espionage activities along sweden 's coast . dehlke , however , said that murky security concerns are unlikely to be enough to nix the project . " there have to be serious reasons , say in the area of environmental protection , for rejecting the project , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 17.02.2007 right to abortion remains elusive in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women get abortions in neighboring countries when waiting lists are too long france has one of the most liberal abortion laws in europe - in theory .
in french abortion clinics , however , women 's right to decide for themselves what to do with their bodies is sometimes illusory . while portugal is currently liberalizing its laws to allow abortion up to the 10th week of pregnancy , french women have already had the right since 1975 .
the law , named after then-health minister simone veil , leaves it to the woman alone to decide whether to have an abortion .
it also requires every larger hospital to have a special service for abortions .
the veil law was amended in 2001 to allow abortions up to the 12th week of pregnancy .
since then even minors may in some cases have abortions without parental consent . but , in practice , not every woman is able to take advantage of those guaranteed rights , according to francoise laurant , head of the family planning organization mouvement francais pour le planning familiale -lrb- mfpf -rrb- . many hospitals do n't have enough personal , so that , during vacation times , women wanting abortions end up on ever longer waiting lists , she said .
some women discover then that they legal time limit has passed for them to have an abortion in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simone veil , here as president of the european parliament in 1979 " sometimes , the woman is then told , ' you can still get an abortion in holland or spain , " ' laurent said .
" but often the personnel tell the woman , ' that 's your problem ! '
and there are hospitals where it 's made difficult for a woman who wants to have a second abortion . " when abortion clinics do work well , it 's usually due to a doctor 's personal commitment - often because he or she remembers that so many women used to die or fall ill from botched illegal abortions , laurent added .
new generation unaware laurant said many of the doctors currently working in french abortion clinics were part of the 1970s women 's movement as medical students .
that means they have now nearly reached retirement age .
mfpf surveyed several regions in france to get an idea of how the situation would be in a few years , she said .
the results were alarming : there wo n't be any more doctors prepared to carry out abortions within two or three years . a recently completed doctor 's thesis about the amount of time and extent to which french medical students learn about abortion and contraception also determined that information on the subjects was desperately lacking .
furthermore , new doctors find it hard to imagine what life was like for women before abortion was made legal .
doctors ' arrogance working in abortion clinics is poorly paid and held in low esteem , and is thus unappealing to young doctors .
in addition , there 's an arrogance within the medical establishment , according to gynecologist marie-laure brival . for centuries , the male body was considered the measure of all things in the medical world .
doctors only turned their attention to the singularities of the female body when they decided they wanted to do more to improve the health of unborn children , brival said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french women have the right to decide whether to give birth or abort - theoretically " even today , doctors ' volition to control a woman 's body is still very strong , " she said .
" they dictate contraceptives to women .
they make contraception the norm .
it 's really up to a woman to make decisions about her own body .
a woman 's fertility gives her the choice .
it 's sometimes very painful to decide whether one wants a child or not .
but this freedom of choice is actually women 's exclusive right . " doctors are n't alone in viewing women 's bodies in this controlling manner .
in the late 1990s , commando actions against french abortion clinics modeled on the pro-life movement in the united states increased in number : militant so-called " protectors of life " insulted women on their way to having abortions , chained themselves to operating rooms , berated personnel . france made such actions illegal in 1993 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 17.02.2007 right to abortion remains elusive in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women get abortions in neighboring countries when waiting lists are too long france has one of the most liberal abortion laws in europe - in theory .
in french abortion clinics , however , women 's right to decide for themselves what to do with their bodies is sometimes illusory . while portugal is currently liberalizing its laws to allow abortion up to the 10th week of pregnancy , french women have already had the right since 1975 .
the law , named after then-health minister simone veil , leaves it to the woman alone to decide whether to have an abortion .
it also requires every larger hospital to have a special service for abortions .
the veil law was amended in 2001 to allow abortions up to the 12th week of pregnancy .
since then even minors may in some cases have abortions without parental consent . but , in practice , not every woman is able to take advantage of those guaranteed rights , according to francoise laurant , head of the family planning organization mouvement francais pour le planning familiale -lrb- mfpf -rrb- . many hospitals do n't have enough personal , so that , during vacation times , women wanting abortions end up on ever longer waiting lists , she said .
some women discover then that they legal time limit has passed for them to have an abortion in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simone veil , here as president of the european parliament in 1979 " sometimes , the woman is then told , ' you can still get an abortion in holland or spain , " ' laurent said .
" but often the personnel tell the woman , ' that 's your problem ! '
and there are hospitals where it 's made difficult for a woman who wants to have a second abortion . " when abortion clinics do work well , it 's usually due to a doctor 's personal commitment - often because he or she remembers that so many women used to die or fall ill from botched illegal abortions , laurent added .
new generation unaware laurant said many of the doctors currently working in french abortion clinics were part of the 1970s women 's movement as medical students .
that means they have now nearly reached retirement age .
mfpf surveyed several regions in france to get an idea of how the situation would be in a few years , she said .

in french abortion clinics , however , women 's right to decide for themselves what to do with their bodies is sometimes illusory . while portugal is currently liberalizing its laws to allow abortion up to the 10th week of pregnancy , french women have already had the right since 1975 .
the law , named after then-health minister simone veil , leaves it to the woman alone to decide whether to have an abortion .
it also requires every larger hospital to have a special service for abortions .
the veil law was amended in 2001 to allow abortions up to the 12th week of pregnancy .

in french abortion clinics , however , women 's right to decide for themselves what to do with their bodies is sometimes illusory . while portugal is currently liberalizing its laws to allow abortion up to the 10th week of pregnancy , french women have already had the right since 1975 .
the law , named after then-health minister simone veil , leaves it to the woman alone to decide whether to have an abortion .
it also requires every larger hospital to have a special service for abortions .
the veil law was amended in 2001 to allow abortions up to the 12th week of pregnancy .
since then even minors may in some cases have abortions without parental consent . but , in practice , not every woman is able to take advantage of those guaranteed rights , according to francoise laurant , head of the family planning organization mouvement francais pour le planning familiale -lrb- mfpf -rrb- . many hospitals do n't have enough personal , so that , during vacation times , women wanting abortions end up on ever longer waiting lists , she said .
some women discover then that they legal time limit has passed for them to have an abortion in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simone veil , here as president of the european parliament in 1979 " sometimes , the woman is then told , ' you can still get an abortion in holland or spain , " ' laurent said .
" but often the personnel tell the woman , ' that 's your problem ! '
and there are hospitals where it 's made difficult for a woman who wants to have a second abortion . " when abortion clinics do work well , it 's usually due to a doctor 's personal commitment - often because he or she remembers that so many women used to die or fall ill from botched illegal abortions , laurent added .
new generation unaware laurant said many of the doctors currently working in french abortion clinics were part of the 1970s women 's movement as medical students .
that means they have now nearly reached retirement age .
mfpf surveyed several regions in france to get an idea of how the situation would be in a few years , she said .
the results were alarming : there wo n't be any more doctors prepared to carry out abortions within two or three years . a recently completed doctor 's thesis about the amount of time and extent to which french medical students learn about abortion and contraception also determined that information on the subjects was desperately lacking .
furthermore , new doctors find it hard to imagine what life was like for women before abortion was made legal .
doctors ' arrogance working in abortion clinics is poorly paid and held in low esteem , and is thus unappealing to young doctors .
in addition , there 's an arrogance within the medical establishment , according to gynecologist marie-laure brival . for centuries , the male body was considered the measure of all things in the medical world .
doctors only turned their attention to the singularities of the female body when they decided they wanted to do more to improve the health of unborn children , brival said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french women have the right to decide whether to give birth or abort - theoretically " even today , doctors ' volition to control a woman 's body is still very strong , " she said .
" they dictate contraceptives to women .
they make contraception the norm .
it 's really up to a woman to make decisions about her own body .
a woman 's fertility gives her the choice .
it 's sometimes very painful to decide whether one wants a child or not .
but this freedom of choice is actually women 's exclusive right . " doctors are n't alone in viewing women 's bodies in this controlling manner .
in the late 1990s , commando actions against french abortion clinics modeled on the pro-life movement in the united states increased in number : militant so-called " protectors of life " insulted women on their way to having abortions , chained themselves to operating rooms , berated personnel . france made such actions illegal in 1993 .
always an issue these days , the " protectors of life " focus on lobbying and appeal to politicians to give the unborn a legal status and right to life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese voters called for liberalization of their abortion law in a referendum the women 's movement continues to fight a woman 's right to choose across europe .
poland has become an example in this respect : for 40 years , abortion was allowed there .
now it 's only permitted in exceptional cases and the government has said it will introduce a total ban . despite the planned changes to portugal 's law , laurant said she did n't think it was time yet to relax on the abortion front .
she recounted a recent inquiry from a journalist on the legal status of abortion across europe , asking when the right would be irreversible . " i told her : ' there will never become an irreversible right , " ' laurant said .
" it 's enough for a country to go through a political change or a religious group to put the government under pressure demanding abortion is banned during important talks .

berlin 's film festival used to be a place for oscar nominees to promote themselves prior to voting .
that 's changed as the festival has turned from artistic showcase into a marketing tool for movies . the berlin international film festival is the largest of its kind in terms of attendance - selling 180,000 tickets over 10 days .
it 's now also one of the three biggest festivals in terms of deal-making , alongside cannes in may and the american film market in november . the berlinale has long been one of the big places to market and push films towards the oscars .
but recently , berlin has become little more than a cog in the machine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matt damon , martina gedeck and robert de niro on the red carpet at the berlinale when cate blanchett walked out onto the red carpet at the berlin film festival this week , the paparazzi were there in full force .
jennifer lopez , clint eastwood , matt damon and robert de niro also got superstar treatment as they screened their movies at germany 's annual film bash . the stars are out in berlin and they 're out for a reason .
they come to the festival to push their films to a european audience .
that 's been the case since the berlin film festival began 57 years ago .
what 's changed is that berlin is now more of a stepping-stone for a movie on its way towards the academy awards , which are one of the most important financial factors for a film 's success . supporting role ? " i think , because the -lrb- oscar -rrb- nominations are out , what happens is that the berlin red carpet is just a promotion and marketing , " said dieter kosslick , the berlinale 's festival director .
" we play one role in this whole alley leading up to the oscars .
but we are still happy and if you see our program , there is no lack of oscar-nominated people like robert de niro , like judi dench , like cate blanchett who are here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastwood 's an oscar hopeful again this year previously , oscar nominees came to berlin to get attention and win over voters .
the academy awards used to be handed out in late march , giving berlin a more prominent role in the lead-up , allowing voters to take into account the reception movies got in germany . " before , when the oscars were one month later , our role was a little bit stronger , because the nominations were n't out at this time , " kosslick said . but now that hollywood 's biggest prizes are handed out in the last week of february , the final votes have already been cast before the first movie in berlin is projected onto the screen . siamese brothers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film posters at the festival 's main drag kosslick has embraced this , saying that instead of an artistic showcase , the berlinale becomes more of a marketing tool .
that 's given the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- , which takes place during the festival , a big boost .
it 's now one of the three biggest film markets of the year - along side cannes , and the american film market . " the market is just for the professionals while the rest of the festival is open to the public , but i always say that the festival and the market are tied to each other , " said beki probst , who heads the efm .
" it 's like two siamese brothers growing together .
the market actually gives the structure to all those people to permit them to do business .

the french company owns about one third of nissan .
the newspaper said exploratory talks between chrysler and gm had begun . quoting automotive-industry sources , it said it was unlikely that gm , the world 's biggest carmaker , would take over the us subsidiary of daimlerchrysler outright .
both companies have declined comment on the speculation . " we often have discussions with automakers routinely , " gm spokesman tony cervone told reuters news agency .
" we do n't comment on speculation regarding discussions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was this zetsche 's last time in a chrysler ?
an alliance would mean gm and chrysler remain separate companies , but keeps open the possibility of cross-shareholding and the ability to act as a single company in product development , production and sales , the german daily said . chrysler chief executive tom lasorda said he wants to more than double global sales through new alliances , the wall street journal reported friday . advantages for both companies the initiative for the talks had come from chrysler .
sources familiar with the talks said that if a link-up were to be to gm 's advantage , the us group would contemplate such an arrangement . speculation since mid-week has driven daimlerchrysler stock higher this week , making it the top stock in frankfurt 's dax index for three straight days .
despite profit taking friday , it closed 1.3 percent higher at 54.12 euros -lrb- $ 72.45 -rrb- . chrysler is struggling with a slump in profitability as americans turn away from its range of big cars and favor imports .
the german arm of daimlerchrysler , mercedes , is in relatively healthy condition . daimlerchrysler 's chief executive dieter zetsche said he was reviewing " further strategic options " for chrysler and not ruling out any possibilities for the us carmaker 's future at an annual conference held on wednesday . automotive news europe had earlier reported top-level talks on an outright merger , but the süddeutsche zeitung said gm had too many problems of its own and would not want to bring another struggling company on board . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : dr. z 's emergency operation german and european editorials on thursday focused on major job cuts at chrysler and the announcement at daimlerchryler headquarters that a sale of the us carmaker was an option on the table .

" in europe we 've cherished the illusion in recent years that ' we 've done enough , " ' he said in the interview to be published sunday . steiner praised berlin for making the fight against climate change a cornerstone of its six-month eu presidency , but also warned germany , the eu 's largest polluter , that it needed to do more to lower emissions . steiner 's comments echo those of the european union 's environment commissioner stavros dimas who two weeks ago said germany must " be aware of its responsibility and its position as a role model in the fight against climate change .

vfb stuttgart moved into second place in the race for the bundesliga title on friday as they humbled eintracht frankfurt 4-0 consigning their opponents to their seventh successive match without a win . stuttgart , inspired by recently capped german international mario gomez ' 13th goal of the campaign , moved to within four points of leader schalke 04 , who play away at wolfsburg on saturday , and two points ahead of werder bremen , who have lost two on the trot including one against stuttgart but play against bottom club hamburg this weekend . bundesliga leaders schalke 04 have offered their coach mirko slomka a new contract in the hope that is just the boost required to extend their unbeaten run to 13 when they travel to middle of the league vfl wolfsburg this weekend . the 39-year-old 's contract was due to expire in june but the new deal would link the coach to the gelsenkirchen outfit - who are on a run of six successive victories - till the end of the 2008/09 season . club general manager andeas müller met slomka - who took over from ralf rangnick in january 2006 - late on wednesday to talk about his future and said he was confident that there would be no hitches . " we have agreed a deal at every level and will terminate these discussions in the next two or three weeks , but i do not see anything which would prevent him signing a new contract , " said müller . this continues the seemingly unending good news for the 1997 uefa cup winners , as they sit six points clear of second-placed werder bremen and , more significantly , 11 points in front of bayern munich in fourth . it 's not over till it 's over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka knows it will be a difficult game in wolfsburg slomka , who was formerly in charge of the club 's youth system , is taking nothing for granted as schalke seek their eighth title but first since 1958 . " we 're happy to be six points clear , " he told the club web site .
" but while we have the quality to win the league , there are another 13 games left , not two . " " we 're hoping to have lots of support in wolfsburg on saturday .

berlin 's film festival used to be a place for oscar nominees to promote themselves prior to voting .
that 's changed as the festival has turned from artistic showcase into a marketing tool for movies . the berlin international film festival is the largest of its kind in terms of attendance - selling 180,000 tickets over 10 days .
it 's now also one of the three biggest festivals in terms of deal-making , alongside cannes in may and the american film market in november . the berlinale has long been one of the big places to market and push films towards the oscars .
but recently , berlin has become little more than a cog in the machine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matt damon , martina gedeck and robert de niro on the red carpet at the berlinale when cate blanchett walked out onto the red carpet at the berlin film festival this week , the paparazzi were there in full force .
jennifer lopez , clint eastwood , matt damon and robert de niro also got superstar treatment as they screened their movies at germany 's annual film bash . the stars are out in berlin and they 're out for a reason .
they come to the festival to push their films to a european audience .
that 's been the case since the berlin film festival began 57 years ago .
what 's changed is that berlin is now more of a stepping-stone for a movie on its way towards the academy awards , which are one of the most important financial factors for a film 's success . supporting role ? " i think , because the -lrb- oscar -rrb- nominations are out , what happens is that the berlin red carpet is just a promotion and marketing , " said dieter kosslick , the berlinale 's festival director .
" we play one role in this whole alley leading up to the oscars .
but we are still happy and if you see our program , there is no lack of oscar-nominated people like robert de niro , like judi dench , like cate blanchett who are here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastwood 's an oscar hopeful again this year previously , oscar nominees came to berlin to get attention and win over voters .
the academy awards used to be handed out in late march , giving berlin a more prominent role in the lead-up , allowing voters to take into account the reception movies got in germany . " before , when the oscars were one month later , our role was a little bit stronger , because the nominations were n't out at this time , " kosslick said . but now that hollywood 's biggest prizes are handed out in the last week of february , the final votes have already been cast before the first movie in berlin is projected onto the screen . siamese brothers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film posters at the festival 's main drag kosslick has embraced this , saying that instead of an artistic showcase , the berlinale becomes more of a marketing tool .
that 's given the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- , which takes place during the festival , a big boost .
it 's now one of the three biggest film markets of the year - along side cannes , and the american film market . " the market is just for the professionals while the rest of the festival is open to the public , but i always say that the festival and the market are tied to each other , " said beki probst , who heads the efm .
" it 's like two siamese brothers growing together .
the market actually gives the structure to all those people to permit them to do business .
like any other market , whether you are selling apples or films , the market is for the sellers to meet buyers .

vfb stuttgart moved into second place in the race for the bundesliga title on friday as they humbled eintracht frankfurt 4-0 consigning their opponents to their seventh successive match without a win . stuttgart , inspired by recently capped german international mario gomez ' 13th goal of the campaign , moved to within four points of leader schalke 04 , who play away at wolfsburg on saturday , and two points ahead of werder bremen , who have lost two on the trot including one against stuttgart but play against bottom club hamburg this weekend . bundesliga leaders schalke 04 have offered their coach mirko slomka a new contract in the hope that is just the boost required to extend their unbeaten run to 13 when they travel to middle of the league vfl wolfsburg this weekend . the 39-year-old 's contract was due to expire in june but the new deal would link the coach to the gelsenkirchen outfit - who are on a run of six successive victories - till the end of the 2008/09 season . club general manager andeas müller met slomka - who took over from ralf rangnick in january 2006 - late on wednesday to talk about his future and said he was confident that there would be no hitches . " we have agreed a deal at every level and will terminate these discussions in the next two or three weeks , but i do not see anything which would prevent him signing a new contract , " said müller . this continues the seemingly unending good news for the 1997 uefa cup winners , as they sit six points clear of second-placed werder bremen and , more significantly , 11 points in front of bayern munich in fourth . it 's not over till it 's over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka knows it will be a difficult game in wolfsburg slomka , who was formerly in charge of the club 's youth system , is taking nothing for granted as schalke seek their eighth title but first since 1958 .

hamburg have won just one of the last 11 games in bremen , but will likely be happy enough if they get a 1-1 draw like in the last two games in the weserstadion . a draw will not be enough for bremen , though , as they quickly need to overcome their domestic slide if they want to stay in the title race .

"
but beyond the red carpet , the somewhat less glamorous stage of the european film market is what really counts for many . michael weber 's phone started ringing when bosnian film director jasmila zbanic was handed the golden bear last year . " ' grbavica ' sold much better afterwards , " said weber , who heads the match factory , which was in charge of selling the winning film of the 2006 berlin international film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a place for deal-making : the efm 's main floor the phone probably started ringing again on saturday .
while weber 's current berlinale competition entry , " yella " by german director christian petzold , did n't pick up the top prize , its star nina hoss took home the trophy for best actress .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 17.02.2007 right to abortion remains elusive in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women get abortions in neighboring countries when waiting lists are too long france has one of the most liberal abortion laws in europe - in theory .
in french abortion clinics , however , women 's right to decide for themselves what to do with their bodies is sometimes illusory . while portugal is currently liberalizing its laws to allow abortion up to the 10th week of pregnancy , french women have already had the right since 1975 .
the law , named after then-health minister simone veil , leaves it to the woman alone to decide whether to have an abortion .
it also requires every larger hospital to have a special service for abortions .
the veil law was amended in 2001 to allow abortions up to the 12th week of pregnancy .
since then even minors may in some cases have abortions without parental consent . but , in practice , not every woman is able to take advantage of those guaranteed rights , according to francoise laurant , head of the family planning organization mouvement francais pour le planning familiale -lrb- mfpf -rrb- . many hospitals do n't have enough personal , so that , during vacation times , women wanting abortions end up on ever longer waiting lists , she said .
some women discover then that they legal time limit has passed for them to have an abortion in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simone veil , here as president of the european parliament in 1979 " sometimes , the woman is then told , ' you can still get an abortion in holland or spain , " ' laurent said .
" but often the personnel tell the woman , ' that 's your problem ! '
and there are hospitals where it 's made difficult for a woman who wants to have a second abortion . " when abortion clinics do work well , it 's usually due to a doctor 's personal commitment - often because he or she remembers that so many women used to die or fall ill from botched illegal abortions , laurent added .
new generation unaware laurant said many of the doctors currently working in french abortion clinics were part of the 1970s women 's movement as medical students .
that means they have now nearly reached retirement age .
mfpf surveyed several regions in france to get an idea of how the situation would be in a few years , she said .
the results were alarming : there wo n't be any more doctors prepared to carry out abortions within two or three years . a recently completed doctor 's thesis about the amount of time and extent to which french medical students learn about abortion and contraception also determined that information on the subjects was desperately lacking .
furthermore , new doctors find it hard to imagine what life was like for women before abortion was made legal .
doctors ' arrogance working in abortion clinics is poorly paid and held in low esteem , and is thus unappealing to young doctors .
in addition , there 's an arrogance within the medical establishment , according to gynecologist marie-laure brival . for centuries , the male body was considered the measure of all things in the medical world .
doctors only turned their attention to the singularities of the female body when they decided they wanted to do more to improve the health of unborn children , brival said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french women have the right to decide whether to give birth or abort - theoretically " even today , doctors ' volition to control a woman 's body is still very strong , " she said .
" they dictate contraceptives to women .
they make contraception the norm .
it 's really up to a woman to make decisions about her own body .
a woman 's fertility gives her the choice .
it 's sometimes very painful to decide whether one wants a child or not .
but this freedom of choice is actually women 's exclusive right . " doctors are n't alone in viewing women 's bodies in this controlling manner .
in the late 1990s , commando actions against french abortion clinics modeled on the pro-life movement in the united states increased in number : militant so-called " protectors of life " insulted women on their way to having abortions , chained themselves to operating rooms , berated personnel . france made such actions illegal in 1993 .
always an issue these days , the " protectors of life " focus on lobbying and appeal to politicians to give the unborn a legal status and right to life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese voters called for liberalization of their abortion law in a referendum the women 's movement continues to fight a woman 's right to choose across europe .
poland has become an example in this respect : for 40 years , abortion was allowed there .
now it 's only permitted in exceptional cases and the government has said it will introduce a total ban . despite the planned changes to portugal 's law , laurant said she did n't think it was time yet to relax on the abortion front .
she recounted a recent inquiry from a journalist on the legal status of abortion across europe , asking when the right would be irreversible . " i told her : ' there will never become an irreversible right , " ' laurant said .
" it 's enough for a country to go through a political change or a religious group to put the government under pressure demanding abortion is banned during important talks .
and then it 's all over for women .

the french company owns about one third of nissan .
the newspaper said exploratory talks between chrysler and gm had begun . quoting automotive-industry sources , it said it was unlikely that gm , the world 's biggest carmaker , would take over the us subsidiary of daimlerchrysler outright .
both companies have declined comment on the speculation . " we often have discussions with automakers routinely , " gm spokesman tony cervone told reuters news agency .
" we do n't comment on speculation regarding discussions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was this zetsche 's last time in a chrysler ?
an alliance would mean gm and chrysler remain separate companies , but keeps open the possibility of cross-shareholding and the ability to act as a single company in product development , production and sales , the german daily said . chrysler chief executive tom lasorda said he wants to more than double global sales through new alliances , the wall street journal reported friday . advantages for both companies the initiative for the talks had come from chrysler .
sources familiar with the talks said that if a link-up were to be to gm 's advantage , the us group would contemplate such an arrangement . speculation since mid-week has driven daimlerchrysler stock higher this week , making it the top stock in frankfurt 's dax index for three straight days .
despite profit taking friday , it closed 1.3 percent higher at 54.12 euros -lrb- $ 72.45 -rrb- . chrysler is struggling with a slump in profitability as americans turn away from its range of big cars and favor imports .
the german arm of daimlerchrysler , mercedes , is in relatively healthy condition . daimlerchrysler 's chief executive dieter zetsche said he was reviewing " further strategic options " for chrysler and not ruling out any possibilities for the us carmaker 's future at an annual conference held on wednesday . automotive news europe had earlier reported top-level talks on an outright merger , but the süddeutsche zeitung said gm had too many problems of its own and would not want to bring another struggling company on board . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : dr. z 's emergency operation german and european editorials on thursday focused on major job cuts at chrysler and the announcement at daimlerchryler headquarters that a sale of the us carmaker was an option on the table .

sweden is especially uneasy about the project .
besides environmental concerns , some swedish politicians fear it may be used for spying . gotland is a small island in the central baltic sea , just 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- off the swedish mainland .
known for its white beaches , this idyllic island is slowly but surely becoming better known for a more recent legacy : its opposition to the russian gas pipeline project . nord stream , a russian-german consortium , is planning to build a 1,200 kilometer-long pipeline that will satisfy europe 's growing demand for natural gas , courtesy of russian energy giant gazprom .
starting 2010 , the pipeline is expected to pump natural gas from russia through the baltic sea to a location near greifswald in northern germany . " the pipeline is going to go directly along the coast of gotland , " said asa andersson of the swedish world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
" the environmental impact is questionable .
nord stream has to address all possible scenarios .
so far , this has been neglected . " andersson said other routes through the baltic , possibly along previously established pipeline paths , should be examined . environmental assessment underway nord stream is currently conducting an environmental impact assessment for the project .
the consortium said it plans to present its final report to the various national authorities this fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has long been a proponent for the gas pipeline while a country has the right to impose additional requirements it doubts pipeline 's environmental safety , only states whose germany , russia , finland , denmark and sweden have the ability to veto the project .
other neighboring countries , such as poland or the baltic states , are entitled to hear the report , but have no veto powers . " all sensitive points are being carefully reviewed , " said the chairman of the shareholder ’ s board on wednesday in brussels .
he is gerhard schröder , the former chancellor of germany who enjoyed friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin . criticism from all angles despite the former chancellor 's assurances , the mega-project has been met by criticism from all sides . swedish environmental groups are especially concerned that the pipeline passes too closely along the marine reserve near gotland .
they say the construction work could stir up toxins long dormant at the bottom of the seaand harm the flora and fauna living in the waters surrounding the swedish island .
gotland 's local fisheries also fear the pipeline could interfere with their fishing nets . but the greatest concern is over tons of chemical weapons left over from world war ii at the bottom of the sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are nervous pipeline explosions , other of espionage " the munitions are a high security risk , " andersson said , adding that explosions could easily set free dangerous chemicals . nord stream , however , said the explosives would not be a danger to the pipeline and that engineers are systematically scanning the seabed along the 1,200-kilometer long route . " we are familiar with the storage sites for these munitions , " nord stream spokeman jens müller said .
" the pipeline will not run in their vicinity . " ecological , political fears christian dahlke , division head at the office of maritime traffic and hydrography , the federal agency that assesses nord stream 's environmental report for germany , said there is little reason for concern once the pipeline is built . " gazprom has grasped that this project has to be carried out along european guidelines , " he said .
" there weren ’ t any problems with pipelines in the north sea . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is afraid its supply of russian gas could be cut off in the future but that has n't stopped several german environmental groups from joining their swedish and finnish counterparts in opposing the pipeline .

if built , the pipeline could supply up to 25 percent of europe 's natural gas supplies by 2015 . sweden 's national security concerns the pipeline has also become a security issue for the swedes .
several swedish politicians , from both the governing party and opposition , have publicly expressed concern that russian intelligence agencies could abuse the pipeline project for renewed espionage activities along sweden 's coast . dehlke , however , said that murky security concerns are unlikely to be enough to nix the project . " there have to be serious reasons , say in the area of environmental protection , for rejecting the project , " he said .

he is gerhard schröder , the former chancellor of germany who enjoyed friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin . criticism from all angles despite the former chancellor 's assurances , the mega-project has been met by criticism from all sides . swedish environmental groups are especially concerned that the pipeline passes too closely along the marine reserve near gotland .
they say the construction work could stir up toxins long dormant at the bottom of the seaand harm the flora and fauna living in the waters surrounding the swedish island .
gotland 's local fisheries also fear the pipeline could interfere with their fishing nets . but the greatest concern is over tons of chemical weapons left over from world war ii at the bottom of the sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are nervous pipeline explosions , other of espionage " the munitions are a high security risk , " andersson said , adding that explosions could easily set free dangerous chemicals . nord stream , however , said the explosives would not be a danger to the pipeline and that engineers are systematically scanning the seabed along the 1,200-kilometer long route . " we are familiar with the storage sites for these munitions , " nord stream spokeman jens müller said .
" the pipeline will not run in their vicinity . " ecological , political fears christian dahlke , division head at the office of maritime traffic and hydrography , the federal agency that assesses nord stream 's environmental report for germany , said there is little reason for concern once the pipeline is built . " gazprom has grasped that this project has to be carried out along european guidelines , " he said .
" there weren ’ t any problems with pipelines in the north sea . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is afraid its supply of russian gas could be cut off in the future but that has n't stopped several german environmental groups from joining their swedish and finnish counterparts in opposing the pipeline .
warsaw has also come out against the plan , fearing moscow could cuts gas deliveries to poland in the future .
if built , the pipeline could supply up to 25 percent of europe 's natural gas supplies by 2015 . sweden 's national security concerns the pipeline has also become a security issue for the swedes .
several swedish politicians , from both the governing party and opposition , have publicly expressed concern that russian intelligence agencies could abuse the pipeline project for renewed espionage activities along sweden 's coast . dehlke , however , said that murky security concerns are unlikely to be enough to nix the project . " there have to be serious reasons , say in the area of environmental protection , for rejecting the project , " he said .

sweden is especially uneasy about the project .
besides environmental concerns , some swedish politicians fear it may be used for spying . gotland is a small island in the central baltic sea , just 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- off the swedish mainland .
known for its white beaches , this idyllic island is slowly but surely becoming better known for a more recent legacy : its opposition to the russian gas pipeline project . nord stream , a russian-german consortium , is planning to build a 1,200 kilometer-long pipeline that will satisfy europe 's growing demand for natural gas , courtesy of russian energy giant gazprom .
starting 2010 , the pipeline is expected to pump natural gas from russia through the baltic sea to a location near greifswald in northern germany . " the pipeline is going to go directly along the coast of gotland , " said asa andersson of the swedish world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
" the environmental impact is questionable .
nord stream has to address all possible scenarios .
so far , this has been neglected . " andersson said other routes through the baltic , possibly along previously established pipeline paths , should be examined . environmental assessment underway nord stream is currently conducting an environmental impact assessment for the project .
the consortium said it plans to present its final report to the various national authorities this fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has long been a proponent for the gas pipeline while a country has the right to impose additional requirements it doubts pipeline 's environmental safety , only states whose germany , russia , finland , denmark and sweden have the ability to veto the project .
other neighboring countries , such as poland or the baltic states , are entitled to hear the report , but have no veto powers . " all sensitive points are being carefully reviewed , " said the chairman of the shareholder ’ s board on wednesday in brussels .
he is gerhard schröder , the former chancellor of germany who enjoyed friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin . criticism from all angles despite the former chancellor 's assurances , the mega-project has been met by criticism from all sides . swedish environmental groups are especially concerned that the pipeline passes too closely along the marine reserve near gotland .
they say the construction work could stir up toxins long dormant at the bottom of the seaand harm the flora and fauna living in the waters surrounding the swedish island .
gotland 's local fisheries also fear the pipeline could interfere with their fishing nets . but the greatest concern is over tons of chemical weapons left over from world war ii at the bottom of the sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are nervous pipeline explosions , other of espionage " the munitions are a high security risk , " andersson said , adding that explosions could easily set free dangerous chemicals . nord stream , however , said the explosives would not be a danger to the pipeline and that engineers are systematically scanning the seabed along the 1,200-kilometer long route . " we are familiar with the storage sites for these munitions , " nord stream spokeman jens müller said .
" the pipeline will not run in their vicinity . " ecological , political fears christian dahlke , division head at the office of maritime traffic and hydrography , the federal agency that assesses nord stream 's environmental report for germany , said there is little reason for concern once the pipeline is built . " gazprom has grasped that this project has to be carried out along european guidelines , " he said .
" there weren ’ t any problems with pipelines in the north sea . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is afraid its supply of russian gas could be cut off in the future but that has n't stopped several german environmental groups from joining their swedish and finnish counterparts in opposing the pipeline .
warsaw has also come out against the plan , fearing moscow could cuts gas deliveries to poland in the future .
if built , the pipeline could supply up to 25 percent of europe 's natural gas supplies by 2015 . sweden 's national security concerns the pipeline has also become a security issue for the swedes .
several swedish politicians , from both the governing party and opposition , have publicly expressed concern that russian intelligence agencies could abuse the pipeline project for renewed espionage activities along sweden 's coast . dehlke , however , said that murky security concerns are unlikely to be enough to nix the project . " there have to be serious reasons , say in the area of environmental protection , for rejecting the project , " he said .

sweden is especially uneasy about the project .
besides environmental concerns , some swedish politicians fear it may be used for spying . gotland is a small island in the central baltic sea , just 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- off the swedish mainland .
known for its white beaches , this idyllic island is slowly but surely becoming better known for a more recent legacy : its opposition to the russian gas pipeline project . nord stream , a russian-german consortium , is planning to build a 1,200 kilometer-long pipeline that will satisfy europe 's growing demand for natural gas , courtesy of russian energy giant gazprom .
starting 2010 , the pipeline is expected to pump natural gas from russia through the baltic sea to a location near greifswald in northern germany . " the pipeline is going to go directly along the coast of gotland , " said asa andersson of the swedish world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
" the environmental impact is questionable .
nord stream has to address all possible scenarios .
so far , this has been neglected . " andersson said other routes through the baltic , possibly along previously established pipeline paths , should be examined . environmental assessment underway nord stream is currently conducting an environmental impact assessment for the project .
the consortium said it plans to present its final report to the various national authorities this fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has long been a proponent for the gas pipeline while a country has the right to impose additional requirements it doubts pipeline 's environmental safety , only states whose germany , russia , finland , denmark and sweden have the ability to veto the project .
other neighboring countries , such as poland or the baltic states , are entitled to hear the report , but have no veto powers . " all sensitive points are being carefully reviewed , " said the chairman of the shareholder ’ s board on wednesday in brussels .
he is gerhard schröder , the former chancellor of germany who enjoyed friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin . criticism from all angles despite the former chancellor 's assurances , the mega-project has been met by criticism from all sides . swedish environmental groups are especially concerned that the pipeline passes too closely along the marine reserve near gotland .
they say the construction work could stir up toxins long dormant at the bottom of the seaand harm the flora and fauna living in the waters surrounding the swedish island .
gotland 's local fisheries also fear the pipeline could interfere with their fishing nets . but the greatest concern is over tons of chemical weapons left over from world war ii at the bottom of the sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are nervous pipeline explosions , other of espionage " the munitions are a high security risk , " andersson said , adding that explosions could easily set free dangerous chemicals . nord stream , however , said the explosives would not be a danger to the pipeline and that engineers are systematically scanning the seabed along the 1,200-kilometer long route . " we are familiar with the storage sites for these munitions , " nord stream spokeman jens müller said .
" the pipeline will not run in their vicinity . " ecological , political fears christian dahlke , division head at the office of maritime traffic and hydrography , the federal agency that assesses nord stream 's environmental report for germany , said there is little reason for concern once the pipeline is built . " gazprom has grasped that this project has to be carried out along european guidelines , " he said .
" there weren ’ t any problems with pipelines in the north sea . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is afraid its supply of russian gas could be cut off in the future but that has n't stopped several german environmental groups from joining their swedish and finnish counterparts in opposing the pipeline .
warsaw has also come out against the plan , fearing moscow could cuts gas deliveries to poland in the future .
if built , the pipeline could supply up to 25 percent of europe 's natural gas supplies by 2015 . sweden 's national security concerns the pipeline has also become a security issue for the swedes .
several swedish politicians , from both the governing party and opposition , have publicly expressed concern that russian intelligence agencies could abuse the pipeline project for renewed espionage activities along sweden 's coast . dehlke , however , said that murky security concerns are unlikely to be enough to nix the project . " there have to be serious reasons , say in the area of environmental protection , for rejecting the project , " he said .

sweden is especially uneasy about the project .
besides environmental concerns , some swedish politicians fear it may be used for spying . gotland is a small island in the central baltic sea , just 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- off the swedish mainland .
known for its white beaches , this idyllic island is slowly but surely becoming better known for a more recent legacy : its opposition to the russian gas pipeline project . nord stream , a russian-german consortium , is planning to build a 1,200 kilometer-long pipeline that will satisfy europe 's growing demand for natural gas , courtesy of russian energy giant gazprom .
starting 2010 , the pipeline is expected to pump natural gas from russia through the baltic sea to a location near greifswald in northern germany . " the pipeline is going to go directly along the coast of gotland , " said asa andersson of the swedish world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
" the environmental impact is questionable .
nord stream has to address all possible scenarios .
so far , this has been neglected . " andersson said other routes through the baltic , possibly along previously established pipeline paths , should be examined . environmental assessment underway nord stream is currently conducting an environmental impact assessment for the project .
the consortium said it plans to present its final report to the various national authorities this fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has long been a proponent for the gas pipeline while a country has the right to impose additional requirements it doubts pipeline 's environmental safety , only states whose germany , russia , finland , denmark and sweden have the ability to veto the project .
other neighboring countries , such as poland or the baltic states , are entitled to hear the report , but have no veto powers . " all sensitive points are being carefully reviewed , " said the chairman of the shareholder ’ s board on wednesday in brussels .
he is gerhard schröder , the former chancellor of germany who enjoyed friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin . criticism from all angles despite the former chancellor 's assurances , the mega-project has been met by criticism from all sides . swedish environmental groups are especially concerned that the pipeline passes too closely along the marine reserve near gotland .
they say the construction work could stir up toxins long dormant at the bottom of the seaand harm the flora and fauna living in the waters surrounding the swedish island .
gotland 's local fisheries also fear the pipeline could interfere with their fishing nets . but the greatest concern is over tons of chemical weapons left over from world war ii at the bottom of the sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are nervous pipeline explosions , other of espionage " the munitions are a high security risk , " andersson said , adding that explosions could easily set free dangerous chemicals . nord stream , however , said the explosives would not be a danger to the pipeline and that engineers are systematically scanning the seabed along the 1,200-kilometer long route . " we are familiar with the storage sites for these munitions , " nord stream spokeman jens müller said .
" the pipeline will not run in their vicinity . " ecological , political fears christian dahlke , division head at the office of maritime traffic and hydrography , the federal agency that assesses nord stream 's environmental report for germany , said there is little reason for concern once the pipeline is built . " gazprom has grasped that this project has to be carried out along european guidelines , " he said .
" there weren ’ t any problems with pipelines in the north sea . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is afraid its supply of russian gas could be cut off in the future but that has n't stopped several german environmental groups from joining their swedish and finnish counterparts in opposing the pipeline .

if built , the pipeline could supply up to 25 percent of europe 's natural gas supplies by 2015 . sweden 's national security concerns the pipeline has also become a security issue for the swedes .
several swedish politicians , from both the governing party and opposition , have publicly expressed concern that russian intelligence agencies could abuse the pipeline project for renewed espionage activities along sweden 's coast . dehlke , however , said that murky security concerns are unlikely to be enough to nix the project .

sweden is especially uneasy about the project .
besides environmental concerns , some swedish politicians fear it may be used for spying . gotland is a small island in the central baltic sea , just 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- off the swedish mainland .
known for its white beaches , this idyllic island is slowly but surely becoming better known for a more recent legacy : its opposition to the russian gas pipeline project . nord stream , a russian-german consortium , is planning to build a 1,200 kilometer-long pipeline that will satisfy europe 's growing demand for natural gas , courtesy of russian energy giant gazprom .
starting 2010 , the pipeline is expected to pump natural gas from russia through the baltic sea to a location near greifswald in northern germany . " the pipeline is going to go directly along the coast of gotland , " said asa andersson of the swedish world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
" the environmental impact is questionable .
nord stream has to address all possible scenarios .
so far , this has been neglected . " andersson said other routes through the baltic , possibly along previously established pipeline paths , should be examined . environmental assessment underway nord stream is currently conducting an environmental impact assessment for the project .
the consortium said it plans to present its final report to the various national authorities this fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has long been a proponent for the gas pipeline while a country has the right to impose additional requirements it doubts pipeline 's environmental safety , only states whose germany , russia , finland , denmark and sweden have the ability to veto the project .
other neighboring countries , such as poland or the baltic states , are entitled to hear the report , but have no veto powers . " all sensitive points are being carefully reviewed , " said the chairman of the shareholder ’ s board on wednesday in brussels .
he is gerhard schröder , the former chancellor of germany who enjoyed friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin . criticism from all angles despite the former chancellor 's assurances , the mega-project has been met by criticism from all sides . swedish environmental groups are especially concerned that the pipeline passes too closely along the marine reserve near gotland .
they say the construction work could stir up toxins long dormant at the bottom of the seaand harm the flora and fauna living in the waters surrounding the swedish island .
gotland 's local fisheries also fear the pipeline could interfere with their fishing nets . but the greatest concern is over tons of chemical weapons left over from world war ii at the bottom of the sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are nervous pipeline explosions , other of espionage " the munitions are a high security risk , " andersson said , adding that explosions could easily set free dangerous chemicals . nord stream , however , said the explosives would not be a danger to the pipeline and that engineers are systematically scanning the seabed along the 1,200-kilometer long route . " we are familiar with the storage sites for these munitions , " nord stream spokeman jens müller said .
" the pipeline will not run in their vicinity . " ecological , political fears christian dahlke , division head at the office of maritime traffic and hydrography , the federal agency that assesses nord stream 's environmental report for germany , said there is little reason for concern once the pipeline is built . " gazprom has grasped that this project has to be carried out along european guidelines , " he said .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is afraid its supply of russian gas could be cut off in the future but that has n't stopped several german environmental groups from joining their swedish and finnish counterparts in opposing the pipeline .

if built , the pipeline could supply up to 25 percent of europe 's natural gas supplies by 2015 . sweden 's national security concerns the pipeline has also become a security issue for the swedes .
several swedish politicians , from both the governing party and opposition , have publicly expressed concern that russian intelligence agencies could abuse the pipeline project for renewed espionage activities along sweden 's coast . dehlke , however , said that murky security concerns are unlikely to be enough to nix the project .

reactions to the arrival of world leaders , police , journalists and protesters have been mixed in heiligendamm and the nearby town of bad doberan . free advertising to the world hartmut polzin , the mayor of bad doberan , said he is thrilled at the chance to show his town to the world . " the worldwide media attention will make this a marketing campaign which we could never afford if we had to pay for it , " he said , rattling off a list of reasons tourists should visit bad doberan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a villa dating back to 1854 had to make way for a g8 media center he 's also excited about the influx of funds he said he hopes the summit will bring to a region that has struggled economically since reunification . " the g8 summit has already had positive effects on construction here , " he said .
" our improved infrastructure will be of long-term benefit to the regional economy .
it would normally have taken many more years to complete .
but the g8-summit has accelerated the process . " seaside grandeur the neighboring village of heiligendamm is the oldest german seaside resort .
composed of white classical buildings along the promenade , it was an elegant meeting place for high society until the 1930 's .
the russian tsar and his family , composer felix mendelssohn-bartholdy , poet rainer maria rilke , queen luise of prussia , and even dictators adolf hitler and benito mussolini used to be regular guests . kempinski hotel director torsten dressler is rolling out the red carpet and looking forward to demonstrating that the grand hotel heiligendamm is the ideal venue for meetings with high prominence where international protocol and personal attention are of the utmost importance . " people are characterized by their individuality , their like and dislikes , " he said .
" one drinks a certain tea , the other a special wine .
and a third does n't like a certain type of flower .
as hoteliers , we need to find out who likes what .
we want to be super hosts . " to be a super media host , fundus investment group and kempinski hotels tore down a classical villa and a former holiday residence of the russian tsars to make room for a media center . no way in for peaceful demo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : building has begun on the fence that will surround the village and seal off the beach there 's also the question of other visitors .
in recent weeks , german politicians have expressly welcomed peaceful demonstrators to the g8 summit .
but heiligendamm was selected to host the summit because of its isolated location and limited access to the grand hotel . nevertheless , the federal government expects huge international protests to converge on the summit , just as they did in st petersburg and gleneagles in recent years . the hotel privatization of public roads and plans to demolish further classicist villas along the beach have caused loud protest in the local community , according to 70-year-old marianne prüter , who has lived in heiligendamm since 1947 . " they 're excellent at building fences ! " she said , pointing out a high-security fence currently being built around the hotel .
the barrier is 14 kilometers long -lrb- 8.7 miles -rrb- and is planned to cost some 12.4 million euros -lrb- $ 16.3 million -rrb- to erect . counting the cost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sea resort will be packed in summer this summer about 10,000 police officers from across germany will be tasked with turning away unauthorized visitors from this fence .
the air force , navy and special forces will also be providing their services to ensure the conference 's security . birgit schwebs , deputy leader of the left party in mecklenburg-western pommerania 's state parliament pointed to the expenses . " the fact is , mecklenburg is paying 13 million euros for the fence alone , " she said .
" the current official estimate is that our g8 summit in heiligendamm will cost a round 92 million euros just for security . " schwebs added that the federal government had promised to reimburse the state with 24 million euros , leaving the region with the rest of the tab . the conference 's costs are one of the main reasons locals have expressed their unhappiness with having world leaders converge on their towns . " at a time when unemployment in mecklenburg is the highest in the country and there 's no money for social welfare they 're wasting millions , " prüter said .
" the waste of public money bugs me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests also accompanied us president bush 's visit to the region last year focus on global growth " growth and responsibility " will be the summit 's main focus .
rosa klemper said the irony of growth being focus in one of germany 's least industrialized and poorest regions is n't lost on her .
she said she 'll be protesting for growth in the state hosting the leaders . " the mecklenburg population has n't yet realized that the summit is an opportunity to show the world that germany itself is still imbalanced between the east and the west , " she said . peter zimmerman -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany faces daunting agenda for eu , g8 presidencies germany will fight to revive international efforts for middle east peace , relaunch the eu constitution and advocate a gentler form of globalization when it takes over the presidencies of the eu and the g8 monday .

besides environmental concerns , some swedish politicians fear it may be used for spying . gotland is a small island in the central baltic sea , just 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- off the swedish mainland .
known for its white beaches , this idyllic island is slowly but surely becoming better known for a more recent legacy : its opposition to the russian gas pipeline project . nord stream , a russian-german consortium , is planning to build a 1,200 kilometer-long pipeline that will satisfy europe 's growing demand for natural gas , courtesy of russian energy giant gazprom .
starting 2010 , the pipeline is expected to pump natural gas from russia through the baltic sea to a location near greifswald in northern germany . " the pipeline is going to go directly along the coast of gotland , " said asa andersson of the swedish world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
" the environmental impact is questionable .
nord stream has to address all possible scenarios .
so far , this has been neglected . " andersson said other routes through the baltic , possibly along previously established pipeline paths , should be examined . environmental assessment underway nord stream is currently conducting an environmental impact assessment for the project .
the consortium said it plans to present its final report to the various national authorities this fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has long been a proponent for the gas pipeline while a country has the right to impose additional requirements it doubts pipeline 's environmental safety , only states whose germany , russia , finland , denmark and sweden have the ability to veto the project .
other neighboring countries , such as poland or the baltic states , are entitled to hear the report , but have no veto powers . " all sensitive points are being carefully reviewed , " said the chairman of the shareholder ’ s board on wednesday in brussels .
he is gerhard schröder , the former chancellor of germany who enjoyed friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin . criticism from all angles despite the former chancellor 's assurances , the mega-project has been met by criticism from all sides . swedish environmental groups are especially concerned that the pipeline passes too closely along the marine reserve near gotland .
they say the construction work could stir up toxins long dormant at the bottom of the seaand harm the flora and fauna living in the waters surrounding the swedish island .
gotland 's local fisheries also fear the pipeline could interfere with their fishing nets . but the greatest concern is over tons of chemical weapons left over from world war ii at the bottom of the sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are nervous pipeline explosions , other of espionage " the munitions are a high security risk , " andersson said , adding that explosions could easily set free dangerous chemicals . nord stream , however , said the explosives would not be a danger to the pipeline and that engineers are systematically scanning the seabed along the 1,200-kilometer long route . " we are familiar with the storage sites for these munitions , " nord stream spokeman jens müller said .
" the pipeline will not run in their vicinity . " ecological , political fears christian dahlke , division head at the office of maritime traffic and hydrography , the federal agency that assesses nord stream 's environmental report for germany , said there is little reason for concern once the pipeline is built .

if built , the pipeline could supply up to 25 percent of europe 's natural gas supplies by 2015 . sweden 's national security concerns the pipeline has also become a security issue for the swedes .
several swedish politicians , from both the governing party and opposition , have publicly expressed concern that russian intelligence agencies could abuse the pipeline project for renewed espionage activities along sweden 's coast . dehlke , however , said that murky security concerns are unlikely to be enough to nix the project .

sweden is especially uneasy about the project .
besides environmental concerns , some swedish politicians fear it may be used for spying . gotland is a small island in the central baltic sea , just 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- off the swedish mainland .
known for its white beaches , this idyllic island is slowly but surely becoming better known for a more recent legacy : its opposition to the russian gas pipeline project . nord stream , a russian-german consortium , is planning to build a 1,200 kilometer-long pipeline that will satisfy europe 's growing demand for natural gas , courtesy of russian energy giant gazprom .
starting 2010 , the pipeline is expected to pump natural gas from russia through the baltic sea to a location near greifswald in northern germany . " the pipeline is going to go directly along the coast of gotland , " said asa andersson of the swedish world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
" the environmental impact is questionable .
nord stream has to address all possible scenarios .
so far , this has been neglected . " andersson said other routes through the baltic , possibly along previously established pipeline paths , should be examined . environmental assessment underway nord stream is currently conducting an environmental impact assessment for the project .
the consortium said it plans to present its final report to the various national authorities this fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has long been a proponent for the gas pipeline while a country has the right to impose additional requirements it doubts pipeline 's environmental safety , only states whose germany , russia , finland , denmark and sweden have the ability to veto the project .
other neighboring countries , such as poland or the baltic states , are entitled to hear the report , but have no veto powers . " all sensitive points are being carefully reviewed , " said the chairman of the shareholder ’ s board on wednesday in brussels .

" the worldwide media attention will make this a marketing campaign which we could never afford if we had to pay for it , " he said , rattling off a list of reasons tourists should visit bad doberan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a villa dating back to 1854 had to make way for a g8 media center he 's also excited about the influx of funds he said he hopes the summit will bring to a region that has struggled economically since reunification . " the g8 summit has already had positive effects on construction here , " he said .
" our improved infrastructure will be of long-term benefit to the regional economy .
it would normally have taken many more years to complete .
but the g8-summit has accelerated the process . " seaside grandeur the neighboring village of heiligendamm is the oldest german seaside resort .
composed of white classical buildings along the promenade , it was an elegant meeting place for high society until the 1930 's .
the russian tsar and his family , composer felix mendelssohn-bartholdy , poet rainer maria rilke , queen luise of prussia , and even dictators adolf hitler and benito mussolini used to be regular guests . kempinski hotel director torsten dressler is rolling out the red carpet and looking forward to demonstrating that the grand hotel heiligendamm is the ideal venue for meetings with high prominence where international protocol and personal attention are of the utmost importance . " people are characterized by their individuality , their like and dislikes , " he said .
" one drinks a certain tea , the other a special wine .
and a third does n't like a certain type of flower .
as hoteliers , we need to find out who likes what .
we want to be super hosts . " to be a super media host , fundus investment group and kempinski hotels tore down a classical villa and a former holiday residence of the russian tsars to make room for a media center . no way in for peaceful demo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : building has begun on the fence that will surround the village and seal off the beach there 's also the question of other visitors .
in recent weeks , german politicians have expressly welcomed peaceful demonstrators to the g8 summit .
but heiligendamm was selected to host the summit because of its isolated location and limited access to the grand hotel . nevertheless , the federal government expects huge international protests to converge on the summit , just as they did in st petersburg and gleneagles in recent years . the hotel privatization of public roads and plans to demolish further classicist villas along the beach have caused loud protest in the local community , according to 70-year-old marianne prüter , who has lived in heiligendamm since 1947 . " they 're excellent at building fences ! " she said , pointing out a high-security fence currently being built around the hotel .
the barrier is 14 kilometers long -lrb- 8.7 miles -rrb- and is planned to cost some 12.4 million euros -lrb- $ 16.3 million -rrb- to erect . counting the cost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sea resort will be packed in summer this summer about 10,000 police officers from across germany will be tasked with turning away unauthorized visitors from this fence .
the air force , navy and special forces will also be providing their services to ensure the conference 's security . birgit schwebs , deputy leader of the left party in mecklenburg-western pommerania 's state parliament pointed to the expenses . " the fact is , mecklenburg is paying 13 million euros for the fence alone , " she said .
" the current official estimate is that our g8 summit in heiligendamm will cost a round 92 million euros just for security . " schwebs added that the federal government had promised to reimburse the state with 24 million euros , leaving the region with the rest of the tab . the conference 's costs are one of the main reasons locals have expressed their unhappiness with having world leaders converge on their towns . " at a time when unemployment in mecklenburg is the highest in the country and there 's no money for social welfare they 're wasting millions , " prüter said .
" the waste of public money bugs me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests also accompanied us president bush 's visit to the region last year focus on global growth " growth and responsibility " will be the summit 's main focus .
rosa klemper said the irony of growth being focus in one of germany 's least industrialized and poorest regions is n't lost on her .
she said she 'll be protesting for growth in the state hosting the leaders . " the mecklenburg population has n't yet realized that the summit is an opportunity to show the world that germany itself is still imbalanced between the east and the west , " she said . peter zimmerman -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany faces daunting agenda for eu , g8 presidencies germany will fight to revive international efforts for middle east peace , relaunch the eu constitution and advocate a gentler form of globalization when it takes over the presidencies of the eu and the g8 monday .

berlin 's film festival used to be a place for oscar nominees to promote themselves prior to voting .
that 's changed as the festival has turned from artistic showcase into a marketing tool for movies . the berlin international film festival is the largest of its kind in terms of attendance - selling 180,000 tickets over 10 days .
it 's now also one of the three biggest festivals in terms of deal-making , alongside cannes in may and the american film market in november . the berlinale has long been one of the big places to market and push films towards the oscars .
but recently , berlin has become little more than a cog in the machine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matt damon , martina gedeck and robert de niro on the red carpet at the berlinale when cate blanchett walked out onto the red carpet at the berlin film festival this week , the paparazzi were there in full force .
jennifer lopez , clint eastwood , matt damon and robert de niro also got superstar treatment as they screened their movies at germany 's annual film bash . the stars are out in berlin and they 're out for a reason .
they come to the festival to push their films to a european audience .
that 's been the case since the berlin film festival began 57 years ago .
what 's changed is that berlin is now more of a stepping-stone for a movie on its way towards the academy awards , which are one of the most important financial factors for a film 's success . supporting role ? " i think , because the -lrb- oscar -rrb- nominations are out , what happens is that the berlin red carpet is just a promotion and marketing , " said dieter kosslick , the berlinale 's festival director .
" we play one role in this whole alley leading up to the oscars .
but we are still happy and if you see our program , there is no lack of oscar-nominated people like robert de niro , like judi dench , like cate blanchett who are here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastwood 's an oscar hopeful again this year previously , oscar nominees came to berlin to get attention and win over voters .
the academy awards used to be handed out in late march , giving berlin a more prominent role in the lead-up , allowing voters to take into account the reception movies got in germany . " before , when the oscars were one month later , our role was a little bit stronger , because the nominations were n't out at this time , " kosslick said . but now that hollywood 's biggest prizes are handed out in the last week of february , the final votes have already been cast before the first movie in berlin is projected onto the screen . siamese brothers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film posters at the festival 's main drag kosslick has embraced this , saying that instead of an artistic showcase , the berlinale becomes more of a marketing tool .
that 's given the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- , which takes place during the festival , a big boost .
it 's now one of the three biggest film markets of the year - along side cannes , and the american film market . " the market is just for the professionals while the rest of the festival is open to the public , but i always say that the festival and the market are tied to each other , " said beki probst , who heads the efm .
" it 's like two siamese brothers growing together .
the market actually gives the structure to all those people to permit them to do business .
like any other market , whether you are selling apples or films , the market is for the sellers to meet buyers .

in french abortion clinics , however , women 's right to decide for themselves what to do with their bodies is sometimes illusory . while portugal is currently liberalizing its laws to allow abortion up to the 10th week of pregnancy , french women have already had the right since 1975 .
the law , named after then-health minister simone veil , leaves it to the woman alone to decide whether to have an abortion .
it also requires every larger hospital to have a special service for abortions .
the veil law was amended in 2001 to allow abortions up to the 12th week of pregnancy .
since then even minors may in some cases have abortions without parental consent . but , in practice , not every woman is able to take advantage of those guaranteed rights , according to francoise laurant , head of the family planning organization mouvement francais pour le planning familiale -lrb- mfpf -rrb- . many hospitals do n't have enough personal , so that , during vacation times , women wanting abortions end up on ever longer waiting lists , she said .
some women discover then that they legal time limit has passed for them to have an abortion in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simone veil , here as president of the european parliament in 1979 " sometimes , the woman is then told , ' you can still get an abortion in holland or spain , " ' laurent said .
" but often the personnel tell the woman , ' that 's your problem ! '
and there are hospitals where it 's made difficult for a woman who wants to have a second abortion . " when abortion clinics do work well , it 's usually due to a doctor 's personal commitment - often because he or she remembers that so many women used to die or fall ill from botched illegal abortions , laurent added .
new generation unaware laurant said many of the doctors currently working in french abortion clinics were part of the 1970s women 's movement as medical students .
that means they have now nearly reached retirement age .
mfpf surveyed several regions in france to get an idea of how the situation would be in a few years , she said .
the results were alarming : there wo n't be any more doctors prepared to carry out abortions within two or three years . a recently completed doctor 's thesis about the amount of time and extent to which french medical students learn about abortion and contraception also determined that information on the subjects was desperately lacking .
furthermore , new doctors find it hard to imagine what life was like for women before abortion was made legal .
doctors ' arrogance working in abortion clinics is poorly paid and held in low esteem , and is thus unappealing to young doctors .
in addition , there 's an arrogance within the medical establishment , according to gynecologist marie-laure brival . for centuries , the male body was considered the measure of all things in the medical world .
doctors only turned their attention to the singularities of the female body when they decided they wanted to do more to improve the health of unborn children , brival said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french women have the right to decide whether to give birth or abort - theoretically " even today , doctors ' volition to control a woman 's body is still very strong , " she said .
" they dictate contraceptives to women .
they make contraception the norm .
it 's really up to a woman to make decisions about her own body .
a woman 's fertility gives her the choice .
it 's sometimes very painful to decide whether one wants a child or not .
but this freedom of choice is actually women 's exclusive right . " doctors are n't alone in viewing women 's bodies in this controlling manner .
in the late 1990s , commando actions against french abortion clinics modeled on the pro-life movement in the united states increased in number : militant so-called " protectors of life " insulted women on their way to having abortions , chained themselves to operating rooms , berated personnel . france made such actions illegal in 1993 .
always an issue these days , the " protectors of life " focus on lobbying and appeal to politicians to give the unborn a legal status and right to life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese voters called for liberalization of their abortion law in a referendum the women 's movement continues to fight a woman 's right to choose across europe .
poland has become an example in this respect : for 40 years , abortion was allowed there .
now it 's only permitted in exceptional cases and the government has said it will introduce a total ban . despite the planned changes to portugal 's law , laurant said she did n't think it was time yet to relax on the abortion front .
she recounted a recent inquiry from a journalist on the legal status of abortion across europe , asking when the right would be irreversible . " i told her : ' there will never become an irreversible right , " ' laurant said .
" it 's enough for a country to go through a political change or a religious group to put the government under pressure demanding abortion is banned during important talks .
and then it 's all over for women .

" in europe we 've cherished the illusion in recent years that ' we 've done enough , " ' he said in the interview to be published sunday . steiner praised berlin for making the fight against climate change a cornerstone of its six-month eu presidency , but also warned germany , the eu 's largest polluter , that it needed to do more to lower emissions . steiner 's comments echo those of the european union 's environment commissioner stavros dimas who two weeks ago said germany must " be aware of its responsibility and its position as a role model in the fight against climate change . " setting realistic goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission saw its climate goals watered down largely at the behest of the country 's automotive and other industries , german politicians have called for the eu to set manageable and realistic climate change goals as the timeline set by the 1990 kyoto protocol comes to an end in 2012 . the european commission presented a far-reaching plan to curb co2 emissions across the 27-member bloc by 20 percent by 2020 , a goal that was met with skepticism in germany . " yes , we favor ecology and responsibility for the future , but let us stick to what we can do , " said social democratic party head kurt beck in a speech on saturday .
" let 's stay reasonable , yes , but let 's use our technology worldwide so that other countries can grow with less co2 . " placing blame where it 's due bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steiner said it 's irresponsible of europeans to blame only china for climate change but steiner warned industrialized nations , which he said are responsible for the globe 's current climate problem , not to put the burden of lowering emissions on developing nations . " the climate problem of today was not caused by china but above all by western nations , " he said .
" so the first step has to come from us .
moreover , it 's wrong to assume that china is not interested in climate protection . " he added that china has begun implementing a plan to increase its use of renewable energy , and the united states , which is not a signatory to the kyoto protocol , is also making advances in the environmentally friendly technologies . " the americans and asians are catching up quickly and are becoming strong business competitors -lrb- with green technologies -rrb- , " steiner said .
" we 've only been looking at china through brown smog colored glasses , but there are already cities being planned -lrb- in china -rrb- that will have zero co2 emissions .

" in europe we 've cherished the illusion in recent years that ' we 've done enough , " ' he said in the interview to be published sunday . steiner praised berlin for making the fight against climate change a cornerstone of its six-month eu presidency , but also warned germany , the eu 's largest polluter , that it needed to do more to lower emissions . steiner 's comments echo those of the european union 's environment commissioner stavros dimas who two weeks ago said germany must " be aware of its responsibility and its position as a role model in the fight against climate change . " setting realistic goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission saw its climate goals watered down largely at the behest of the country 's automotive and other industries , german politicians have called for the eu to set manageable and realistic climate change goals as the timeline set by the 1990 kyoto protocol comes to an end in 2012 . the european commission presented a far-reaching plan to curb co2 emissions across the 27-member bloc by 20 percent by 2020 , a goal that was met with skepticism in germany . " yes , we favor ecology and responsibility for the future , but let us stick to what we can do , " said social democratic party head kurt beck in a speech on saturday .
" let 's stay reasonable , yes , but let 's use our technology worldwide so that other countries can grow with less co2 . " placing blame where it 's due bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steiner said it 's irresponsible of europeans to blame only china for climate change but steiner warned industrialized nations , which he said are responsible for the globe 's current climate problem , not to put the burden of lowering emissions on developing nations . " the climate problem of today was not caused by china but above all by western nations , " he said .
" so the first step has to come from us .
moreover , it 's wrong to assume that china is not interested in climate protection . " he added that china has begun implementing a plan to increase its use of renewable energy , and the united states , which is not a signatory to the kyoto protocol , is also making advances in the environmentally friendly technologies . " the americans and asians are catching up quickly and are becoming strong business competitors -lrb- with green technologies -rrb- , " steiner said .
" we 've only been looking at china through brown smog colored glasses , but there are already cities being planned -lrb- in china -rrb- that will have zero co2 emissions .

vfb stuttgart moved into second place in the race for the bundesliga title on friday as they humbled eintracht frankfurt 4-0 consigning their opponents to their seventh successive match without a win . stuttgart , inspired by recently capped german international mario gomez ' 13th goal of the campaign , moved to within four points of leader schalke 04 , who play away at wolfsburg on saturday , and two points ahead of werder bremen , who have lost two on the trot including one against stuttgart but play against bottom club hamburg this weekend . bundesliga leaders schalke 04 have offered their coach mirko slomka a new contract in the hope that is just the boost required to extend their unbeaten run to 13 when they travel to middle of the league vfl wolfsburg this weekend . the 39-year-old 's contract was due to expire in june but the new deal would link the coach to the gelsenkirchen outfit - who are on a run of six successive victories - till the end of the 2008/09 season . club general manager andeas müller met slomka - who took over from ralf rangnick in january 2006 - late on wednesday to talk about his future and said he was confident that there would be no hitches . " we have agreed a deal at every level and will terminate these discussions in the next two or three weeks , but i do not see anything which would prevent him signing a new contract , " said müller . this continues the seemingly unending good news for the 1997 uefa cup winners , as they sit six points clear of second-placed werder bremen and , more significantly , 11 points in front of bayern munich in fourth . it 's not over till it 's over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka knows it will be a difficult game in wolfsburg slomka , who was formerly in charge of the club 's youth system , is taking nothing for granted as schalke seek their eighth title but first since 1958 . " we 're happy to be six points clear , " he told the club web site .
" but while we have the quality to win the league , there are another 13 games left , not two . " " we 're hoping to have lots of support in wolfsburg on saturday .
it 's going to be another very difficult game because wolfsburg are having a good spell .
but we 'll be looking to maintain our lead there and if possible even extend it .
we want to carry on winning , " slomka said . schalke wo n't have it easy , however , with wolfsburg losing just once in the last nine visits of schalke to their volkswagen arena . a morale boost werder bremen meanwhile host hamburg sv on saturday after their rousing 3-0 uefa cup win over ajax on wednesday to boost morale following consecutive bundesliga defeats including a 2-0 home loss to schalke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this has n't been a great season for hamburg while hamburg lie at the bottom of the table , their hopes were revived last weekend when they beat borussia dortmund 3-0 for their second season win . but they badly need to follow up on this win in order to avoid a first relegation from the bundesliga since the league was founded in 1963 . " bremen versus hamburg is always an exciting game , " said hamburg coach huub stevens .
" we want to build on our good game against dortmund and i am convinced that we will play a good match in bremen as well . ' stevens has restored order in the team , suspending forward danijel luboja for the game for disciplinary reasons .
hamburg have won just one of the last 11 games in bremen , but will likely be happy enough if they get a 1-1 draw like in the last two games in the weserstadion . a draw will not be enough for bremen , though , as they quickly need to overcome their domestic slide if they want to stay in the title race .

" in my opinion , the fact we 've made progress was as important as the three points , " the 58-year-old said at the time saying that clean sheets were what mattered in football . " you only succeed as a team with a solid defense .

berlin 's film festival used to be a place for oscar nominees to promote themselves prior to voting .
that 's changed as the festival has turned from artistic showcase into a marketing tool for movies . the berlin international film festival is the largest of its kind in terms of attendance - selling 180,000 tickets over 10 days .
it 's now also one of the three biggest festivals in terms of deal-making , alongside cannes in may and the american film market in november . the berlinale has long been one of the big places to market and push films towards the oscars .
but recently , berlin has become little more than a cog in the machine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matt damon , martina gedeck and robert de niro on the red carpet at the berlinale when cate blanchett walked out onto the red carpet at the berlin film festival this week , the paparazzi were there in full force .
jennifer lopez , clint eastwood , matt damon and robert de niro also got superstar treatment as they screened their movies at germany 's annual film bash . the stars are out in berlin and they 're out for a reason .
they come to the festival to push their films to a european audience .
that 's been the case since the berlin film festival began 57 years ago .
what 's changed is that berlin is now more of a stepping-stone for a movie on its way towards the academy awards , which are one of the most important financial factors for a film 's success . supporting role ? " i think , because the -lrb- oscar -rrb- nominations are out , what happens is that the berlin red carpet is just a promotion and marketing , " said dieter kosslick , the berlinale 's festival director .
" we play one role in this whole alley leading up to the oscars .
but we are still happy and if you see our program , there is no lack of oscar-nominated people like robert de niro , like judi dench , like cate blanchett who are here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastwood 's an oscar hopeful again this year previously , oscar nominees came to berlin to get attention and win over voters .
the academy awards used to be handed out in late march , giving berlin a more prominent role in the lead-up , allowing voters to take into account the reception movies got in germany . " before , when the oscars were one month later , our role was a little bit stronger , because the nominations were n't out at this time , " kosslick said . but now that hollywood 's biggest prizes are handed out in the last week of february , the final votes have already been cast before the first movie in berlin is projected onto the screen . siamese brothers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film posters at the festival 's main drag kosslick has embraced this , saying that instead of an artistic showcase , the berlinale becomes more of a marketing tool .
that 's given the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- , which takes place during the festival , a big boost .
it 's now one of the three biggest film markets of the year - along side cannes , and the american film market . " the market is just for the professionals while the rest of the festival is open to the public , but i always say that the festival and the market are tied to each other , " said beki probst , who heads the efm .
" it 's like two siamese brothers growing together .
the market actually gives the structure to all those people to permit them to do business .
like any other market , whether you are selling apples or films , the market is for the sellers to meet buyers .

sweden is especially uneasy about the project .
besides environmental concerns , some swedish politicians fear it may be used for spying . gotland is a small island in the central baltic sea , just 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- off the swedish mainland .
known for its white beaches , this idyllic island is slowly but surely becoming better known for a more recent legacy : its opposition to the russian gas pipeline project . nord stream , a russian-german consortium , is planning to build a 1,200 kilometer-long pipeline that will satisfy europe 's growing demand for natural gas , courtesy of russian energy giant gazprom .
starting 2010 , the pipeline is expected to pump natural gas from russia through the baltic sea to a location near greifswald in northern germany . " the pipeline is going to go directly along the coast of gotland , " said asa andersson of the swedish world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
" the environmental impact is questionable .
nord stream has to address all possible scenarios .
so far , this has been neglected . " andersson said other routes through the baltic , possibly along previously established pipeline paths , should be examined . environmental assessment underway nord stream is currently conducting an environmental impact assessment for the project .
the consortium said it plans to present its final report to the various national authorities this fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has long been a proponent for the gas pipeline while a country has the right to impose additional requirements it doubts pipeline 's environmental safety , only states whose germany , russia , finland , denmark and sweden have the ability to veto the project .
other neighboring countries , such as poland or the baltic states , are entitled to hear the report , but have no veto powers . " all sensitive points are being carefully reviewed , " said the chairman of the shareholder ’ s board on wednesday in brussels .
he is gerhard schröder , the former chancellor of germany who enjoyed friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin . criticism from all angles despite the former chancellor 's assurances , the mega-project has been met by criticism from all sides . swedish environmental groups are especially concerned that the pipeline passes too closely along the marine reserve near gotland .
they say the construction work could stir up toxins long dormant at the bottom of the seaand harm the flora and fauna living in the waters surrounding the swedish island .
gotland 's local fisheries also fear the pipeline could interfere with their fishing nets . but the greatest concern is over tons of chemical weapons left over from world war ii at the bottom of the sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are nervous pipeline explosions , other of espionage " the munitions are a high security risk , " andersson said , adding that explosions could easily set free dangerous chemicals . nord stream , however , said the explosives would not be a danger to the pipeline and that engineers are systematically scanning the seabed along the 1,200-kilometer long route . " we are familiar with the storage sites for these munitions , " nord stream spokeman jens müller said .
" the pipeline will not run in their vicinity . " ecological , political fears christian dahlke , division head at the office of maritime traffic and hydrography , the federal agency that assesses nord stream 's environmental report for germany , said there is little reason for concern once the pipeline is built . " gazprom has grasped that this project has to be carried out along european guidelines , " he said .
" there weren ’ t any problems with pipelines in the north sea . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is afraid its supply of russian gas could be cut off in the future but that has n't stopped several german environmental groups from joining their swedish and finnish counterparts in opposing the pipeline .
warsaw has also come out against the plan , fearing moscow could cuts gas deliveries to poland in the future .
if built , the pipeline could supply up to 25 percent of europe 's natural gas supplies by 2015 . sweden 's national security concerns the pipeline has also become a security issue for the swedes .
several swedish politicians , from both the governing party and opposition , have publicly expressed concern that russian intelligence agencies could abuse the pipeline project for renewed espionage activities along sweden 's coast . dehlke , however , said that murky security concerns are unlikely to be enough to nix the project . " there have to be serious reasons , say in the area of environmental protection , for rejecting the project , " he said .
" the window for that is very tight .

"
but beyond the red carpet , the somewhat less glamorous stage of the european film market is what really counts for many . michael weber 's phone started ringing when bosnian film director jasmila zbanic was handed the golden bear last year . " ' grbavica ' sold much better afterwards , " said weber , who heads the match factory , which was in charge of selling the winning film of the 2006 berlin international film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a place for deal-making : the efm 's main floor the phone probably started ringing again on saturday .
while weber 's current berlinale competition entry , " yella " by german director christian petzold , did n't pick up the top prize , its star nina hoss took home the trophy for best actress . " it all depends on what happens tomorrow night , " weber had said on friday while sitting between packed-up boxes filled with promotional material in his company 's booth at the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- , where the buzz of previous days had already disappeared as most vendors were preparing to head home . bursting at the seams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's gropius bau museum ca n't hold the entire efm one of the world 's most important trading places for movies with some 19,000 attendees and 702 films on offer , the efm picked up steam in recent years after the american film market in los angeles was moved from february to november .
the market at the cannes film festival meanwhile still rules supreme . the boom in berlin has led to some to complain that market organizers had to find a bigger venue to keep all vendors under one roof instead of spreading them out over several locations .
according to news reports , efm head beki probst has already hired a consultancy firm to help her figure out how to deal with growth of 10 percent to 15 percent next year . many meetings , slow sales ? film industry trade magazines also quoted sellers and buyers , who were not impressed with the amount of business they had done at the market this year .
but weber joined others in saying that he had no reason to complain . " we 've had a lot of meetings , " he said , adding that " yella " has been sold to several countries - including switzerland , austria , portugal , greece and britain . exportable films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie , starring german actress nina hoss , will open in germany in october " yella , " which tells the story of an east german woman who goes to west germany in search of a better life , has received good reviews in the german press even though some movie critics left the theater scratching their heads because of the film 's twisted end . trade magazines such as the hollywood reporter and screen even saw the film embarking on an international career . " the elegant quasi-thriller chic of ' yella ' could prove -lrb- petzold 's -rrb- most exportable yet , if adventurous art house buyers take the bait , " read a screen review . first europe , then the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nina hoss with her bear weber said that " yella " would first have to sell well in europe before going elsewhere . " it 's a little cold for latin america , " he said . a certain bear-shaped trophy - even nina hoss ' silver one - might change all that , of course . " it 's happened before that someone had to double their offer " after a film won awards , weber said .

vfb stuttgart moved into second place in the race for the bundesliga title on friday as they humbled eintracht frankfurt 4-0 consigning their opponents to their seventh successive match without a win . stuttgart , inspired by recently capped german international mario gomez ' 13th goal of the campaign , moved to within four points of leader schalke 04 , who play away at wolfsburg on saturday , and two points ahead of werder bremen , who have lost two on the trot including one against stuttgart but play against bottom club hamburg this weekend . bundesliga leaders schalke 04 have offered their coach mirko slomka a new contract in the hope that is just the boost required to extend their unbeaten run to 13 when they travel to middle of the league vfl wolfsburg this weekend . the 39-year-old 's contract was due to expire in june but the new deal would link the coach to the gelsenkirchen outfit - who are on a run of six successive victories - till the end of the 2008/09 season . club general manager andeas müller met slomka - who took over from ralf rangnick in january 2006 - late on wednesday to talk about his future and said he was confident that there would be no hitches . " we have agreed a deal at every level and will terminate these discussions in the next two or three weeks , but i do not see anything which would prevent him signing a new contract , " said müller . this continues the seemingly unending good news for the 1997 uefa cup winners , as they sit six points clear of second-placed werder bremen and , more significantly , 11 points in front of bayern munich in fourth . it 's not over till it 's over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka knows it will be a difficult game in wolfsburg slomka , who was formerly in charge of the club 's youth system , is taking nothing for granted as schalke seek their eighth title but first since 1958 .

hamburg have won just one of the last 11 games in bremen , but will likely be happy enough if they get a 1-1 draw like in the last two games in the weserstadion . a draw will not be enough for bremen , though , as they quickly need to overcome their domestic slide if they want to stay in the title race .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 17.02.2007 right to abortion remains elusive in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women get abortions in neighboring countries when waiting lists are too long france has one of the most liberal abortion laws in europe - in theory .
in french abortion clinics , however , women 's right to decide for themselves what to do with their bodies is sometimes illusory . while portugal is currently liberalizing its laws to allow abortion up to the 10th week of pregnancy , french women have already had the right since 1975 .
the law , named after then-health minister simone veil , leaves it to the woman alone to decide whether to have an abortion .
it also requires every larger hospital to have a special service for abortions .
the veil law was amended in 2001 to allow abortions up to the 12th week of pregnancy .
since then even minors may in some cases have abortions without parental consent . but , in practice , not every woman is able to take advantage of those guaranteed rights , according to francoise laurant , head of the family planning organization mouvement francais pour le planning familiale -lrb- mfpf -rrb- . many hospitals do n't have enough personal , so that , during vacation times , women wanting abortions end up on ever longer waiting lists , she said .
some women discover then that they legal time limit has passed for them to have an abortion in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simone veil , here as president of the european parliament in 1979 " sometimes , the woman is then told , ' you can still get an abortion in holland or spain , " ' laurent said .
" but often the personnel tell the woman , ' that 's your problem ! '
and there are hospitals where it 's made difficult for a woman who wants to have a second abortion . " when abortion clinics do work well , it 's usually due to a doctor 's personal commitment - often because he or she remembers that so many women used to die or fall ill from botched illegal abortions , laurent added .
new generation unaware laurant said many of the doctors currently working in french abortion clinics were part of the 1970s women 's movement as medical students .
that means they have now nearly reached retirement age .
mfpf surveyed several regions in france to get an idea of how the situation would be in a few years , she said .
the results were alarming : there wo n't be any more doctors prepared to carry out abortions within two or three years . a recently completed doctor 's thesis about the amount of time and extent to which french medical students learn about abortion and contraception also determined that information on the subjects was desperately lacking .
furthermore , new doctors find it hard to imagine what life was like for women before abortion was made legal .
doctors ' arrogance working in abortion clinics is poorly paid and held in low esteem , and is thus unappealing to young doctors .
in addition , there 's an arrogance within the medical establishment , according to gynecologist marie-laure brival . for centuries , the male body was considered the measure of all things in the medical world .
doctors only turned their attention to the singularities of the female body when they decided they wanted to do more to improve the health of unborn children , brival said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french women have the right to decide whether to give birth or abort - theoretically " even today , doctors ' volition to control a woman 's body is still very strong , " she said .
" they dictate contraceptives to women .
they make contraception the norm .
it 's really up to a woman to make decisions about her own body .
a woman 's fertility gives her the choice .
it 's sometimes very painful to decide whether one wants a child or not .
but this freedom of choice is actually women 's exclusive right . " doctors are n't alone in viewing women 's bodies in this controlling manner .
in the late 1990s , commando actions against french abortion clinics modeled on the pro-life movement in the united states increased in number : militant so-called " protectors of life " insulted women on their way to having abortions , chained themselves to operating rooms , berated personnel . france made such actions illegal in 1993 .
always an issue these days , the " protectors of life " focus on lobbying and appeal to politicians to give the unborn a legal status and right to life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese voters called for liberalization of their abortion law in a referendum the women 's movement continues to fight a woman 's right to choose across europe .
poland has become an example in this respect : for 40 years , abortion was allowed there .
now it 's only permitted in exceptional cases and the government has said it will introduce a total ban . despite the planned changes to portugal 's law , laurant said she did n't think it was time yet to relax on the abortion front .
she recounted a recent inquiry from a journalist on the legal status of abortion across europe , asking when the right would be irreversible . " i told her : ' there will never become an irreversible right , " ' laurant said .
" it 's enough for a country to go through a political change or a religious group to put the government under pressure demanding abortion is banned during important talks .
and then it 's all over for women .

"
but beyond the red carpet , the somewhat less glamorous stage of the european film market is what really counts for many . michael weber 's phone started ringing when bosnian film director jasmila zbanic was handed the golden bear last year . " ' grbavica ' sold much better afterwards , " said weber , who heads the match factory , which was in charge of selling the winning film of the 2006 berlin international film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a place for deal-making : the efm 's main floor the phone probably started ringing again on saturday .
while weber 's current berlinale competition entry , " yella " by german director christian petzold , did n't pick up the top prize , its star nina hoss took home the trophy for best actress . " it all depends on what happens tomorrow night , " weber had said on friday while sitting between packed-up boxes filled with promotional material in his company 's booth at the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- , where the buzz of previous days had already disappeared as most vendors were preparing to head home . bursting at the seams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's gropius bau museum ca n't hold the entire efm one of the world 's most important trading places for movies with some 19,000 attendees and 702 films on offer , the efm picked up steam in recent years after the american film market in los angeles was moved from february to november .
the market at the cannes film festival meanwhile still rules supreme . the boom in berlin has led to some to complain that market organizers had to find a bigger venue to keep all vendors under one roof instead of spreading them out over several locations .
according to news reports , efm head beki probst has already hired a consultancy firm to help her figure out how to deal with growth of 10 percent to 15 percent next year . many meetings , slow sales ? film industry trade magazines also quoted sellers and buyers , who were not impressed with the amount of business they had done at the market this year .
but weber joined others in saying that he had no reason to complain . " we 've had a lot of meetings , " he said , adding that " yella " has been sold to several countries - including switzerland , austria , portugal , greece and britain . exportable films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie , starring german actress nina hoss , will open in germany in october " yella , " which tells the story of an east german woman who goes to west germany in search of a better life , has received good reviews in the german press even though some movie critics left the theater scratching their heads because of the film 's twisted end . trade magazines such as the hollywood reporter and screen even saw the film embarking on an international career . " the elegant quasi-thriller chic of ' yella ' could prove -lrb- petzold 's -rrb- most exportable yet , if adventurous art house buyers take the bait , " read a screen review . first europe , then the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nina hoss with her bear weber said that " yella " would first have to sell well in europe before going elsewhere . " it 's a little cold for latin america , " he said . a certain bear-shaped trophy - even nina hoss ' silver one - might change all that , of course . " it 's happened before that someone had to double their offer " after a film won awards , weber said .

in french abortion clinics , however , women 's right to decide for themselves what to do with their bodies is sometimes illusory . while portugal is currently liberalizing its laws to allow abortion up to the 10th week of pregnancy , french women have already had the right since 1975 .
the law , named after then-health minister simone veil , leaves it to the woman alone to decide whether to have an abortion .
it also requires every larger hospital to have a special service for abortions .
the veil law was amended in 2001 to allow abortions up to the 12th week of pregnancy .
since then even minors may in some cases have abortions without parental consent . but , in practice , not every woman is able to take advantage of those guaranteed rights , according to francoise laurant , head of the family planning organization mouvement francais pour le planning familiale -lrb- mfpf -rrb- . many hospitals do n't have enough personal , so that , during vacation times , women wanting abortions end up on ever longer waiting lists , she said .
some women discover then that they legal time limit has passed for them to have an abortion in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simone veil , here as president of the european parliament in 1979 " sometimes , the woman is then told , ' you can still get an abortion in holland or spain , " ' laurent said .
" but often the personnel tell the woman , ' that 's your problem ! '
and there are hospitals where it 's made difficult for a woman who wants to have a second abortion . " when abortion clinics do work well , it 's usually due to a doctor 's personal commitment - often because he or she remembers that so many women used to die or fall ill from botched illegal abortions , laurent added .
new generation unaware laurant said many of the doctors currently working in french abortion clinics were part of the 1970s women 's movement as medical students .
that means they have now nearly reached retirement age .
mfpf surveyed several regions in france to get an idea of how the situation would be in a few years , she said .
the results were alarming : there wo n't be any more doctors prepared to carry out abortions within two or three years . a recently completed doctor 's thesis about the amount of time and extent to which french medical students learn about abortion and contraception also determined that information on the subjects was desperately lacking .
furthermore , new doctors find it hard to imagine what life was like for women before abortion was made legal .
doctors ' arrogance working in abortion clinics is poorly paid and held in low esteem , and is thus unappealing to young doctors .
in addition , there 's an arrogance within the medical establishment , according to gynecologist marie-laure brival . for centuries , the male body was considered the measure of all things in the medical world .
doctors only turned their attention to the singularities of the female body when they decided they wanted to do more to improve the health of unborn children , brival said .

in the late 1990s , commando actions against french abortion clinics modeled on the pro-life movement in the united states increased in number : militant so-called " protectors of life " insulted women on their way to having abortions , chained themselves to operating rooms , berated personnel . france made such actions illegal in 1993 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 17.02.2007 right to abortion remains elusive in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some women get abortions in neighboring countries when waiting lists are too long france has one of the most liberal abortion laws in europe - in theory .
in french abortion clinics , however , women 's right to decide for themselves what to do with their bodies is sometimes illusory . while portugal is currently liberalizing its laws to allow abortion up to the 10th week of pregnancy , french women have already had the right since 1975 .
the law , named after then-health minister simone veil , leaves it to the woman alone to decide whether to have an abortion .
it also requires every larger hospital to have a special service for abortions .
the veil law was amended in 2001 to allow abortions up to the 12th week of pregnancy .
since then even minors may in some cases have abortions without parental consent . but , in practice , not every woman is able to take advantage of those guaranteed rights , according to francoise laurant , head of the family planning organization mouvement francais pour le planning familiale -lrb- mfpf -rrb- . many hospitals do n't have enough personal , so that , during vacation times , women wanting abortions end up on ever longer waiting lists , she said .
some women discover then that they legal time limit has passed for them to have an abortion in france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simone veil , here as president of the european parliament in 1979 " sometimes , the woman is then told , ' you can still get an abortion in holland or spain , " ' laurent said .
" but often the personnel tell the woman , ' that 's your problem ! '
and there are hospitals where it 's made difficult for a woman who wants to have a second abortion . " when abortion clinics do work well , it 's usually due to a doctor 's personal commitment - often because he or she remembers that so many women used to die or fall ill from botched illegal abortions , laurent added .
new generation unaware laurant said many of the doctors currently working in french abortion clinics were part of the 1970s women 's movement as medical students .
that means they have now nearly reached retirement age .
mfpf surveyed several regions in france to get an idea of how the situation would be in a few years , she said .
the results were alarming : there wo n't be any more doctors prepared to carry out abortions within two or three years . a recently completed doctor 's thesis about the amount of time and extent to which french medical students learn about abortion and contraception also determined that information on the subjects was desperately lacking .
furthermore , new doctors find it hard to imagine what life was like for women before abortion was made legal .
doctors ' arrogance working in abortion clinics is poorly paid and held in low esteem , and is thus unappealing to young doctors .
in addition , there 's an arrogance within the medical establishment , according to gynecologist marie-laure brival . for centuries , the male body was considered the measure of all things in the medical world .
doctors only turned their attention to the singularities of the female body when they decided they wanted to do more to improve the health of unborn children , brival said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french women have the right to decide whether to give birth or abort - theoretically " even today , doctors ' volition to control a woman 's body is still very strong , " she said .
" they dictate contraceptives to women .
they make contraception the norm .
it 's really up to a woman to make decisions about her own body .
a woman 's fertility gives her the choice .
it 's sometimes very painful to decide whether one wants a child or not .
but this freedom of choice is actually women 's exclusive right . " doctors are n't alone in viewing women 's bodies in this controlling manner .
in the late 1990s , commando actions against french abortion clinics modeled on the pro-life movement in the united states increased in number : militant so-called " protectors of life " insulted women on their way to having abortions , chained themselves to operating rooms , berated personnel . france made such actions illegal in 1993 .
always an issue these days , the " protectors of life " focus on lobbying and appeal to politicians to give the unborn a legal status and right to life .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese voters called for liberalization of their abortion law in a referendum the women 's movement continues to fight a woman 's right to choose across europe .
poland has become an example in this respect : for 40 years , abortion was allowed there .
now it 's only permitted in exceptional cases and the government has said it will introduce a total ban . despite the planned changes to portugal 's law , laurant said she did n't think it was time yet to relax on the abortion front .
she recounted a recent inquiry from a journalist on the legal status of abortion across europe , asking when the right would be irreversible . " i told her : ' there will never become an irreversible right , " ' laurant said .
" it 's enough for a country to go through a political change or a religious group to put the government under pressure demanding abortion is banned during important talks .
and then it 's all over for women .

"
but beyond the red carpet , the somewhat less glamorous stage of the european film market is what really counts for many . michael weber 's phone started ringing when bosnian film director jasmila zbanic was handed the golden bear last year . " ' grbavica ' sold much better afterwards , " said weber , who heads the match factory , which was in charge of selling the winning film of the 2006 berlin international film festival . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a place for deal-making : the efm 's main floor the phone probably started ringing again on saturday .
while weber 's current berlinale competition entry , " yella " by german director christian petzold , did n't pick up the top prize , its star nina hoss took home the trophy for best actress . " it all depends on what happens tomorrow night , " weber had said on friday while sitting between packed-up boxes filled with promotional material in his company 's booth at the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- , where the buzz of previous days had already disappeared as most vendors were preparing to head home . bursting at the seams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's gropius bau museum ca n't hold the entire efm one of the world 's most important trading places for movies with some 19,000 attendees and 702 films on offer , the efm picked up steam in recent years after the american film market in los angeles was moved from february to november .
the market at the cannes film festival meanwhile still rules supreme . the boom in berlin has led to some to complain that market organizers had to find a bigger venue to keep all vendors under one roof instead of spreading them out over several locations .
according to news reports , efm head beki probst has already hired a consultancy firm to help her figure out how to deal with growth of 10 percent to 15 percent next year . many meetings , slow sales ? film industry trade magazines also quoted sellers and buyers , who were not impressed with the amount of business they had done at the market this year .
but weber joined others in saying that he had no reason to complain . " we 've had a lot of meetings , " he said , adding that " yella " has been sold to several countries - including switzerland , austria , portugal , greece and britain . exportable films bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie , starring german actress nina hoss , will open in germany in october " yella , " which tells the story of an east german woman who goes to west germany in search of a better life , has received good reviews in the german press even though some movie critics left the theater scratching their heads because of the film 's twisted end . trade magazines such as the hollywood reporter and screen even saw the film embarking on an international career . " the elegant quasi-thriller chic of ' yella ' could prove -lrb- petzold 's -rrb- most exportable yet , if adventurous art house buyers take the bait , " read a screen review . first europe , then the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nina hoss with her bear weber said that " yella " would first have to sell well in europe before going elsewhere . " it 's a little cold for latin america , " he said . a certain bear-shaped trophy - even nina hoss ' silver one - might change all that , of course . " it 's happened before that someone had to double their offer " after a film won awards , weber said .

sweden is especially uneasy about the project .
besides environmental concerns , some swedish politicians fear it may be used for spying . gotland is a small island in the central baltic sea , just 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- off the swedish mainland .
known for its white beaches , this idyllic island is slowly but surely becoming better known for a more recent legacy : its opposition to the russian gas pipeline project . nord stream , a russian-german consortium , is planning to build a 1,200 kilometer-long pipeline that will satisfy europe 's growing demand for natural gas , courtesy of russian energy giant gazprom .
starting 2010 , the pipeline is expected to pump natural gas from russia through the baltic sea to a location near greifswald in northern germany . " the pipeline is going to go directly along the coast of gotland , " said asa andersson of the swedish world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
" the environmental impact is questionable .
nord stream has to address all possible scenarios .
so far , this has been neglected . " andersson said other routes through the baltic , possibly along previously established pipeline paths , should be examined . environmental assessment underway nord stream is currently conducting an environmental impact assessment for the project .
the consortium said it plans to present its final report to the various national authorities this fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has long been a proponent for the gas pipeline while a country has the right to impose additional requirements it doubts pipeline 's environmental safety , only states whose germany , russia , finland , denmark and sweden have the ability to veto the project .
other neighboring countries , such as poland or the baltic states , are entitled to hear the report , but have no veto powers . " all sensitive points are being carefully reviewed , " said the chairman of the shareholder ’ s board on wednesday in brussels .
he is gerhard schröder , the former chancellor of germany who enjoyed friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin . criticism from all angles despite the former chancellor 's assurances , the mega-project has been met by criticism from all sides . swedish environmental groups are especially concerned that the pipeline passes too closely along the marine reserve near gotland .
they say the construction work could stir up toxins long dormant at the bottom of the seaand harm the flora and fauna living in the waters surrounding the swedish island .
gotland 's local fisheries also fear the pipeline could interfere with their fishing nets . but the greatest concern is over tons of chemical weapons left over from world war ii at the bottom of the sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are nervous pipeline explosions , other of espionage " the munitions are a high security risk , " andersson said , adding that explosions could easily set free dangerous chemicals . nord stream , however , said the explosives would not be a danger to the pipeline and that engineers are systematically scanning the seabed along the 1,200-kilometer long route . " we are familiar with the storage sites for these munitions , " nord stream spokeman jens müller said .
" the pipeline will not run in their vicinity . " ecological , political fears christian dahlke , division head at the office of maritime traffic and hydrography , the federal agency that assesses nord stream 's environmental report for germany , said there is little reason for concern once the pipeline is built . " gazprom has grasped that this project has to be carried out along european guidelines , " he said .
" there weren ’ t any problems with pipelines in the north sea . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is afraid its supply of russian gas could be cut off in the future but that has n't stopped several german environmental groups from joining their swedish and finnish counterparts in opposing the pipeline .
warsaw has also come out against the plan , fearing moscow could cuts gas deliveries to poland in the future .
if built , the pipeline could supply up to 25 percent of europe 's natural gas supplies by 2015 . sweden 's national security concerns the pipeline has also become a security issue for the swedes .
several swedish politicians , from both the governing party and opposition , have publicly expressed concern that russian intelligence agencies could abuse the pipeline project for renewed espionage activities along sweden 's coast . dehlke , however , said that murky security concerns are unlikely to be enough to nix the project . " there have to be serious reasons , say in the area of environmental protection , for rejecting the project , " he said .

hamburg have won just one of the last 11 games in bremen , but will likely be happy enough if they get a 1-1 draw like in the last two games in the weserstadion . a draw will not be enough for bremen , though , as they quickly need to overcome their domestic slide if they want to stay in the title race .

vfb stuttgart moved into second place in the race for the bundesliga title on friday as they humbled eintracht frankfurt 4-0 consigning their opponents to their seventh successive match without a win . stuttgart , inspired by recently capped german international mario gomez ' 13th goal of the campaign , moved to within four points of leader schalke 04 , who play away at wolfsburg on saturday , and two points ahead of werder bremen , who have lost two on the trot including one against stuttgart but play against bottom club hamburg this weekend . bundesliga leaders schalke 04 have offered their coach mirko slomka a new contract in the hope that is just the boost required to extend their unbeaten run to 13 when they travel to middle of the league vfl wolfsburg this weekend . the 39-year-old 's contract was due to expire in june but the new deal would link the coach to the gelsenkirchen outfit - who are on a run of six successive victories - till the end of the 2008/09 season . club general manager andeas müller met slomka - who took over from ralf rangnick in january 2006 - late on wednesday to talk about his future and said he was confident that there would be no hitches . " we have agreed a deal at every level and will terminate these discussions in the next two or three weeks , but i do not see anything which would prevent him signing a new contract , " said müller . this continues the seemingly unending good news for the 1997 uefa cup winners , as they sit six points clear of second-placed werder bremen and , more significantly , 11 points in front of bayern munich in fourth . it 's not over till it 's over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slomka knows it will be a difficult game in wolfsburg slomka , who was formerly in charge of the club 's youth system , is taking nothing for granted as schalke seek their eighth title but first since 1958 . " we 're happy to be six points clear , " he told the club web site .
" but while we have the quality to win the league , there are another 13 games left , not two . " " we 're hoping to have lots of support in wolfsburg on saturday .
it 's going to be another very difficult game because wolfsburg are having a good spell .
but we 'll be looking to maintain our lead there and if possible even extend it .
we want to carry on winning , " slomka said . schalke wo n't have it easy , however , with wolfsburg losing just once in the last nine visits of schalke to their volkswagen arena . a morale boost werder bremen meanwhile host hamburg sv on saturday after their rousing 3-0 uefa cup win over ajax on wednesday to boost morale following consecutive bundesliga defeats including a 2-0 home loss to schalke . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this has n't been a great season for hamburg while hamburg lie at the bottom of the table , their hopes were revived last weekend when they beat borussia dortmund 3-0 for their second season win . but they badly need to follow up on this win in order to avoid a first relegation from the bundesliga since the league was founded in 1963 . " bremen versus hamburg is always an exciting game , " said hamburg coach huub stevens .
" we want to build on our good game against dortmund and i am convinced that we will play a good match in bremen as well . ' stevens has restored order in the team , suspending forward danijel luboja for the game for disciplinary reasons .
hamburg have won just one of the last 11 games in bremen , but will likely be happy enough if they get a 1-1 draw like in the last two games in the weserstadion . a draw will not be enough for bremen , though , as they quickly need to overcome their domestic slide if they want to stay in the title race . " we did n't show our true potential in the last games , " insisted sports director klaus allofs . solid defense bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's strength is in its solid defense bayern travel to lowly alemannia aachen on saturday having last weekend earned their first victory in four attempts since the winter break in beating arminia bielefeld 1-0 . it was ottmar hitzfeld 's first victory in his second spell as munich coach , having led them to the 2001 champions league title , following the departure of felix magath at the beginning of the month . " in my opinion , the fact we 've made progress was as important as the three points , " the 58-year-old said at the time saying that clean sheets were what mattered in football . " you only succeed as a team with a solid defense .
that 's the fundamental element in winning matches . " on bayern 's selection front , brazilian defender lucio and italian midfielder martin demichelis are unavailable but french defender willy sagnol is expected to return after sitting out the bielefeld game with a knee problem . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : european soccer clubs need to share the wealth the decision to cancel soccer in saxony this weekend was made out of a lack of viable , short-term alternatives , says dw-world.de 's nick amies .

sweden is especially uneasy about the project .
besides environmental concerns , some swedish politicians fear it may be used for spying . gotland is a small island in the central baltic sea , just 150 kilometers -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- off the swedish mainland .
known for its white beaches , this idyllic island is slowly but surely becoming better known for a more recent legacy : its opposition to the russian gas pipeline project . nord stream , a russian-german consortium , is planning to build a 1,200 kilometer-long pipeline that will satisfy europe 's growing demand for natural gas , courtesy of russian energy giant gazprom .
starting 2010 , the pipeline is expected to pump natural gas from russia through the baltic sea to a location near greifswald in northern germany . " the pipeline is going to go directly along the coast of gotland , " said asa andersson of the swedish world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
" the environmental impact is questionable .
nord stream has to address all possible scenarios .
so far , this has been neglected . " andersson said other routes through the baltic , possibly along previously established pipeline paths , should be examined . environmental assessment underway nord stream is currently conducting an environmental impact assessment for the project .

he is gerhard schröder , the former chancellor of germany who enjoyed friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin . criticism from all angles despite the former chancellor 's assurances , the mega-project has been met by criticism from all sides . swedish environmental groups are especially concerned that the pipeline passes too closely along the marine reserve near gotland .
they say the construction work could stir up toxins long dormant at the bottom of the seaand harm the flora and fauna living in the waters surrounding the swedish island .
gotland 's local fisheries also fear the pipeline could interfere with their fishing nets . but the greatest concern is over tons of chemical weapons left over from world war ii at the bottom of the sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are nervous pipeline explosions , other of espionage " the munitions are a high security risk , " andersson said , adding that explosions could easily set free dangerous chemicals . nord stream , however , said the explosives would not be a danger to the pipeline and that engineers are systematically scanning the seabed along the 1,200-kilometer long route . " we are familiar with the storage sites for these munitions , " nord stream spokeman jens müller said .
" the pipeline will not run in their vicinity . " ecological , political fears christian dahlke , division head at the office of maritime traffic and hydrography , the federal agency that assesses nord stream 's environmental report for germany , said there is little reason for concern once the pipeline is built . " gazprom has grasped that this project has to be carried out along european guidelines , " he said .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is afraid its supply of russian gas could be cut off in the future but that has n't stopped several german environmental groups from joining their swedish and finnish counterparts in opposing the pipeline .

if built , the pipeline could supply up to 25 percent of europe 's natural gas supplies by 2015 . sweden 's national security concerns the pipeline has also become a security issue for the swedes .
several swedish politicians , from both the governing party and opposition , have publicly expressed concern that russian intelligence agencies could abuse the pipeline project for renewed espionage activities along sweden 's coast . dehlke , however , said that murky security concerns are unlikely to be enough to nix the project .

starting 2010 , the pipeline is expected to pump natural gas from russia through the baltic sea to a location near greifswald in northern germany . " the pipeline is going to go directly along the coast of gotland , " said asa andersson of the swedish world wildlife fund -lrb- wwf -rrb- .
" the environmental impact is questionable .
nord stream has to address all possible scenarios .
so far , this has been neglected . " andersson said other routes through the baltic , possibly along previously established pipeline paths , should be examined . environmental assessment underway nord stream is currently conducting an environmental impact assessment for the project .
the consortium said it plans to present its final report to the various national authorities this fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has long been a proponent for the gas pipeline while a country has the right to impose additional requirements it doubts pipeline 's environmental safety , only states whose germany , russia , finland , denmark and sweden have the ability to veto the project .
other neighboring countries , such as poland or the baltic states , are entitled to hear the report , but have no veto powers . " all sensitive points are being carefully reviewed , " said the chairman of the shareholder ’ s board on wednesday in brussels .
he is gerhard schröder , the former chancellor of germany who enjoyed friendly ties with russian president vladimir putin . criticism from all angles despite the former chancellor 's assurances , the mega-project has been met by criticism from all sides . swedish environmental groups are especially concerned that the pipeline passes too closely along the marine reserve near gotland .
they say the construction work could stir up toxins long dormant at the bottom of the seaand harm the flora and fauna living in the waters surrounding the swedish island .
gotland 's local fisheries also fear the pipeline could interfere with their fishing nets . but the greatest concern is over tons of chemical weapons left over from world war ii at the bottom of the sea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some are nervous pipeline explosions , other of espionage " the munitions are a high security risk , " andersson said , adding that explosions could easily set free dangerous chemicals . nord stream , however , said the explosives would not be a danger to the pipeline and that engineers are systematically scanning the seabed along the 1,200-kilometer long route . " we are familiar with the storage sites for these munitions , " nord stream spokeman jens müller said .
" the pipeline will not run in their vicinity . " ecological , political fears christian dahlke , division head at the office of maritime traffic and hydrography , the federal agency that assesses nord stream 's environmental report for germany , said there is little reason for concern once the pipeline is built . " gazprom has grasped that this project has to be carried out along european guidelines , " he said .
" there weren ’ t any problems with pipelines in the north sea . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is afraid its supply of russian gas could be cut off in the future but that has n't stopped several german environmental groups from joining their swedish and finnish counterparts in opposing the pipeline .
warsaw has also come out against the plan , fearing moscow could cuts gas deliveries to poland in the future .
if built , the pipeline could supply up to 25 percent of europe 's natural gas supplies by 2015 . sweden 's national security concerns the pipeline has also become a security issue for the swedes .
several swedish politicians , from both the governing party and opposition , have publicly expressed concern that russian intelligence agencies could abuse the pipeline project for renewed espionage activities along sweden 's coast . dehlke , however , said that murky security concerns are unlikely to be enough to nix the project . " there have to be serious reasons , say in the area of environmental protection , for rejecting the project , " he said .

berlin 's film festival used to be a place for oscar nominees to promote themselves prior to voting .
that 's changed as the festival has turned from artistic showcase into a marketing tool for movies . the berlin international film festival is the largest of its kind in terms of attendance - selling 180,000 tickets over 10 days .
it 's now also one of the three biggest festivals in terms of deal-making , alongside cannes in may and the american film market in november . the berlinale has long been one of the big places to market and push films towards the oscars .
but recently , berlin has become little more than a cog in the machine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matt damon , martina gedeck and robert de niro on the red carpet at the berlinale when cate blanchett walked out onto the red carpet at the berlin film festival this week , the paparazzi were there in full force .
jennifer lopez , clint eastwood , matt damon and robert de niro also got superstar treatment as they screened their movies at germany 's annual film bash . the stars are out in berlin and they 're out for a reason .
they come to the festival to push their films to a european audience .
that 's been the case since the berlin film festival began 57 years ago .
what 's changed is that berlin is now more of a stepping-stone for a movie on its way towards the academy awards , which are one of the most important financial factors for a film 's success . supporting role ? " i think , because the -lrb- oscar -rrb- nominations are out , what happens is that the berlin red carpet is just a promotion and marketing , " said dieter kosslick , the berlinale 's festival director .
" we play one role in this whole alley leading up to the oscars .
but we are still happy and if you see our program , there is no lack of oscar-nominated people like robert de niro , like judi dench , like cate blanchett who are here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastwood 's an oscar hopeful again this year previously , oscar nominees came to berlin to get attention and win over voters .
the academy awards used to be handed out in late march , giving berlin a more prominent role in the lead-up , allowing voters to take into account the reception movies got in germany . " before , when the oscars were one month later , our role was a little bit stronger , because the nominations were n't out at this time , " kosslick said . but now that hollywood 's biggest prizes are handed out in the last week of february , the final votes have already been cast before the first movie in berlin is projected onto the screen . siamese brothers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film posters at the festival 's main drag kosslick has embraced this , saying that instead of an artistic showcase , the berlinale becomes more of a marketing tool .
that 's given the european film market -lrb- efm -rrb- , which takes place during the festival , a big boost .
it 's now one of the three biggest film markets of the year - along side cannes , and the american film market . " the market is just for the professionals while the rest of the festival is open to the public , but i always say that the festival and the market are tied to each other , " said beki probst , who heads the efm .
" it 's like two siamese brothers growing together .
the market actually gives the structure to all those people to permit them to do business .
like any other market , whether you are selling apples or films , the market is for the sellers to meet buyers .

berlin 's film festival used to be a place for oscar nominees to promote themselves prior to voting .
that 's changed as the festival has turned from artistic showcase into a marketing tool for movies . the berlin international film festival is the largest of its kind in terms of attendance - selling 180,000 tickets over 10 days .
it 's now also one of the three biggest festivals in terms of deal-making , alongside cannes in may and the american film market in november . the berlinale has long been one of the big places to market and push films towards the oscars .
but recently , berlin has become little more than a cog in the machine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matt damon , martina gedeck and robert de niro on the red carpet at the berlinale when cate blanchett walked out onto the red carpet at the berlin film festival this week , the paparazzi were there in full force .

they come to the festival to push their films to a european audience .
that 's been the case since the berlin film festival began 57 years ago .
what 's changed is that berlin is now more of a stepping-stone for a movie on its way towards the academy awards , which are one of the most important financial factors for a film 's success . supporting role ? " i think , because the -lrb- oscar -rrb- nominations are out , what happens is that the berlin red carpet is just a promotion and marketing , " said dieter kosslick , the berlinale 's festival director .
" we play one role in this whole alley leading up to the oscars .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastwood 's an oscar hopeful again this year previously , oscar nominees came to berlin to get attention and win over voters .

" before , when the oscars were one month later , our role was a little bit stronger , because the nominations were n't out at this time , " kosslick said . but now that hollywood 's biggest prizes are handed out in the last week of february , the final votes have already been cast before the first movie in berlin is projected onto the screen . siamese brothers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film posters at the festival 's main drag kosslick has embraced this , saying that instead of an artistic showcase , the berlinale becomes more of a marketing tool .

" in europe we 've cherished the illusion in recent years that ' we 've done enough , " ' he said in the interview to be published sunday . steiner praised berlin for making the fight against climate change a cornerstone of its six-month eu presidency , but also warned germany , the eu 's largest polluter , that it needed to do more to lower emissions . steiner 's comments echo those of the european union 's environment commissioner stavros dimas who two weeks ago said germany must " be aware of its responsibility and its position as a role model in the fight against climate change . " setting realistic goals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission saw its climate goals watered down largely at the behest of the country 's automotive and other industries , german politicians have called for the eu to set manageable and realistic climate change goals as the timeline set by the 1990 kyoto protocol comes to an end in 2012 . the european commission presented a far-reaching plan to curb co2 emissions across the 27-member bloc by 20 percent by 2020 , a goal that was met with skepticism in germany . " yes , we favor ecology and responsibility for the future , but let us stick to what we can do , " said social democratic party head kurt beck in a speech on saturday .
" let 's stay reasonable , yes , but let 's use our technology worldwide so that other countries can grow with less co2 . " placing blame where it 's due bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steiner said it 's irresponsible of europeans to blame only china for climate change but steiner warned industrialized nations , which he said are responsible for the globe 's current climate problem , not to put the burden of lowering emissions on developing nations . " the climate problem of today was not caused by china but above all by western nations , " he said .
" so the first step has to come from us .
moreover , it 's wrong to assume that china is not interested in climate protection . " he added that china has begun implementing a plan to increase its use of renewable energy , and the united states , which is not a signatory to the kyoto protocol , is also making advances in the environmentally friendly technologies . " the americans and asians are catching up quickly and are becoming strong business competitors -lrb- with green technologies -rrb- , " steiner said .

the french company owns about one third of nissan .
the newspaper said exploratory talks between chrysler and gm had begun . quoting automotive-industry sources , it said it was unlikely that gm , the world 's biggest carmaker , would take over the us subsidiary of daimlerchrysler outright .
both companies have declined comment on the speculation . " we often have discussions with automakers routinely , " gm spokesman tony cervone told reuters news agency .
" we do n't comment on speculation regarding discussions . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was this zetsche 's last time in a chrysler ?
an alliance would mean gm and chrysler remain separate companies , but keeps open the possibility of cross-shareholding and the ability to act as a single company in product development , production and sales , the german daily said . chrysler chief executive tom lasorda said he wants to more than double global sales through new alliances , the wall street journal reported friday . advantages for both companies the initiative for the talks had come from chrysler .
sources familiar with the talks said that if a link-up were to be to gm 's advantage , the us group would contemplate such an arrangement . speculation since mid-week has driven daimlerchrysler stock higher this week , making it the top stock in frankfurt 's dax index for three straight days .
despite profit taking friday , it closed 1.3 percent higher at 54.12 euros -lrb- $ 72.45 -rrb- . chrysler is struggling with a slump in profitability as americans turn away from its range of big cars and favor imports .
the german arm of daimlerchrysler , mercedes , is in relatively healthy condition . daimlerchrysler 's chief executive dieter zetsche said he was reviewing " further strategic options " for chrysler and not ruling out any possibilities for the us carmaker 's future at an annual conference held on wednesday . automotive news europe had earlier reported top-level talks on an outright merger , but the süddeutsche zeitung said gm had too many problems of its own and would not want to bring another struggling company on board . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de press review : dr. z 's emergency operation german and european editorials on thursday focused on major job cuts at chrysler and the announcement at daimlerchryler headquarters that a sale of the us carmaker was an option on the table .

admiral sir jonathon band appealed for the cash - a third of the navy 's annual operating budget - to spend on new ships , at a journalists ' briefing .
bbc defence correspondent paul wood said sir jonathon told reporters the navy " does n't come for nothing " .
last year the army 's head , gen sir richard dannatt , claimed his troops were " at the limit of their capacity " .
' special asset ' paul wood said sir jonathon had argued that britain faced a choice between remaining as a first division sea-going nation or , as the officer put it , turning into belgium .
with the government committed to an active foreign policy , the extra cash was essential to safeguard future capabilities and deliver an extra two aircraft carriers , he believed .
" the navy is a very special asset , and if you want to use it , it does n't come for nothing , " he told the journalists . "
give me two carriers and just less than a billion and i will be off your back , a happy boy " admiral sir jonathon band " we 're at a scale now that requires a certain amount of investment to maintain .
" you ca n't do deterrence unless you are a really professional outfit . "
sir jonathon also said that he had raised the issue privately with the prime minister and the chancellor .
he summarised his position to journalists by saying : " give me two carriers and just less than a billion and i will be off your back , a happy boy . "
he was not warning of an immediate collapse in the navy nor of any threat to the uk 's ability to keep ships at sea .
new ships during a speech in plymouth in january , prime minister tony blair committed the forces to the fight against global terrorism and the alliance with the us .
the ministry of defence said the navy had been given 28 new ships in the past decade .
in a statement issued later through the mod , sir jonathon insisted he was not criticising present funding levels but wanted to inform the debate about future funding of the armed forces .
" as the prime minister has said , if we as a nation are to extend what our armed forces can do , the public needs to feel comfortable with the economic choices needed to make that happen , " he said .
vice-admiral john mcanally , former commandant of the royal college of defence studies and president of the royal naval association , said further cuts could challenge activities like intercepting drug traffickers in the caribbean and guarding oil platforms in iraq .
" warfare has changed , warfare 's always changing but navies have not become less important .
the sea is a physical world wide web - 90 % of everything that comes in or out of this country comes by sea . "
equipment shortages sir jonathon is not the first senior officer to make an appeal for more resources to help meet the demands made of the services .
in december his predecessor , admiral sir alan west , warned that equipment shortages could cost lives .
" i could see us in a position where we could have british servicemen 's - that is navy , army and air force - lives being lost because we have not made the sort of investments in things like the aircraft carrier . "
and army chief sir richard has also been keen to point out that worries over equipment shortages affect his service too .
in september 2006 he said his troops could " only just cope " with their commitments .

' special asset ' paul wood said sir jonathon had argued that britain faced a choice between remaining as a first division sea-going nation or , as the officer put it , turning into belgium .
with the government committed to an active foreign policy , the extra cash was essential to safeguard future capabilities and deliver an extra two aircraft carriers , he believed .
" the navy is a very special asset , and if you want to use it , it does n't come for nothing , " he told the journalists .
give me two carriers and just less than a billion and i will be off your back , a happy boy admiral sir jonathon band " we 're at a scale now that requires a certain amount of investment to maintain .
" you ca n't do deterrence unless you are a really professional outfit . "
sir jonathon also said that he had raised the issue privately with the prime minister and the chancellor .
he summarised his position to journalists by saying : " give me two carriers and just less than a billion and i will be off your back , a happy boy . "
he was not warning of an immediate collapse in the navy nor of any threat to the uk 's ability to keep ships at sea .
new ships during a speech in plymouth in january , prime minister tony blair committed the forces to the fight against global terrorism and the alliance with the us .
the ministry of defence said the navy had been given 28 new ships in the past decade .
in a statement issued later through the mod , sir jonathon insisted he was not criticising present funding levels but wanted to inform the debate about future funding of the armed forces .
" as the prime minister has said , if we as a nation are to extend what our armed forces can do , the public needs to feel comfortable with the economic choices needed to make that happen , " he said .
vice-admiral john mcanally , former commandant of the royal college of defence studies and president of the royal naval association , said further cuts could challenge activities like intercepting drug traffickers in the caribbean and guarding oil platforms in iraq .
" warfare has changed , warfare 's always changing but navies have not become less important .
the sea is a physical world wide web - 90 % of everything that comes in or out of this country comes by sea . "
equipment shortages sir jonathon is not the first senior officer to make an appeal for more resources to help meet the demands made of the services .
in december his predecessor , admiral sir alan west , warned that equipment shortages could cost lives .
" i could see us in a position where we could have british servicemen 's - that is navy , army and air force - lives being lost because we have not made the sort of investments in things like the aircraft carrier . "
and army chief sir richard has also been keen to point out that worries over equipment shortages affect his service too .
in september 2006 he said his troops could " only just cope " with their commitments .

admiral sir jonathon band appealed for the cash - a third of the navy 's annual operating budget - to spend on new ships , at a journalists ' briefing .
bbc defence correspondent paul wood said sir jonathon told reporters the navy " does n't come for nothing " .
last year the army 's head , gen sir richard dannatt , claimed his troops were " at the limit of their capacity " .
' special asset ' paul wood said sir jonathon had argued that britain faced a choice between remaining as a first division sea-going nation or , as the officer put it , turning into belgium .
with the government committed to an active foreign policy , the extra cash was essential to safeguard future capabilities and deliver an extra two aircraft carriers , he believed .
" the navy is a very special asset , and if you want to use it , it does n't come for nothing , " he told the journalists .
give me two carriers and just less than a billion and i will be off your back , a happy boy admiral sir jonathon band " we 're at a scale now that requires a certain amount of investment to maintain .
" you ca n't do deterrence unless you are a really professional outfit . "
sir jonathon also said that he had raised the issue privately with the prime minister and the chancellor .
he summarised his position to journalists by saying : " give me two carriers and just less than a billion and i will be off your back , a happy boy . "

the document would set out global policies including who should be in charge of plans to deflect any object .
it is the brainchild of the association of space explorers , a professional body for astronauts and cosmonauts .
at the moment , nasa is monitoring 127 near-earth objects -lrb- neo -rrb- that have a possibility of hitting the earth .
the association has asked a group of scientists , lawyers , diplomats and insurance experts to draw up the recommendations .
the group will have its first meeting in strasbourg in may this year .
it is hoped the final document will be presented to the un in 2009 .
" we believe there needs to be a decision process spelled out and adopted by the united nations , " said dr russell schweickart , one of the apollo 9 astronauts and founder of the association of space explorers .
known threat the threat of an asteroid hitting the earth is being taken more and more seriously as more and more neos are found .
in the us , congress has charged nasa with the task of starting a more detailed search for life-threatening space rocks .
" congress has said that nasa 's efforts to date are not sufficient to the threat , " said the us space agency 's dr steven chesley .
" they have changed nasa 's targets so that the cataloguing and tracking of asteroids is part of its mandate . "
congress has asked the agency to mount a much more aggressive survey .
at the moment , nasa tracks all objects greater than 700m -lrb- 2,300ft -rrb- in diameter .
the agency 's new goal is to track all objects greater than 70m -lrb- 230ft -rrb- in diameter .
to do this , the agency needs to use a new suite of telescopes .
alternatives include building a new nasa-owned system or investing in other proposed telescopes such as the large synoptic survey telescope -lrb- lsst -rrb- or the panoramic survey telescope & rapid response system -lrb- pan-starrs -rrb- .
pan-starrs is a wide-field telescope being developed at the university of hawaii , whilst the lsst is a proposed ground-based instrument being developed by the not-for-profit lsst corporation based in the us .
nasa estimates that there are about 20,000 potentially threatening asteroids yet to be discovered .
" out of those thousands , there will be without question many that look like they might hit the earth with a high enough probability that the public and everyone else will be concerned , " said dr schweickart .
" this has gone from being an esoteric statistical argument to talking about real events , " added dr david morrison , an astronomer at the nasa 's ames research center .
future plans the un draft treaty would establish who should be in charge in the event of an asteroid heading towards earth , who would pay for relief efforts and the policies that should be adopted .
in addition , it would set out possible plans to deflect the object .
ideas could include hitting the asteroid with a spacecraft or rocket to deflect its orbit .
other less destructive proposals include a " gravity tug " that would simply hover over the asteroid and use gravity as a " towline " to change its path .
but any decision to deflect an neo could come with its own set of conundrums for the un , as changing its path may simply alter its final target .
" it 's important to understand when you start to deflect an asteroid that certain countries are going to have accept an increase in risk to their populations in order to take the risk to zero for everyone , " said dr schweickart .
it is difficult decisions like this that can only be addressed by the un , the association of space explorers believes .
and it is under no illusion that the process can be sorted out quickly .
" you have to act when things look like they are going to happen - if you wait until you know for certain , it 's too late , " said dr schweickart .
experts who will draw up the treaty include lord rees , the english astronomer royal and head of the royal society ; the ex-director of science at the european space agency , roger bonnet ; and former uk government advisor sir crispin tickell .
the proposals were outlined at the american association for the advancement of science -lrb- aaas -rrb- annual meeting in san francisco , us .

the document would set out global policies including who should be in charge of plans to deflect any object .
it is the brainchild of the association of space explorers , a professional body for astronauts and cosmonauts .
at the moment , nasa is monitoring 127 near-earth objects -lrb- neo -rrb- that have a possibility of hitting the earth .
the association has asked a group of scientists , lawyers , diplomats and insurance experts to draw up the recommendations .
the group will have its first meeting in strasbourg in may this year .
it is hoped the final document will be presented to the un in 2009 .
" we believe there needs to be a decision process spelled out and adopted by the united nations , " said dr russell schweickart , one of the apollo 9 astronauts and founder of the association of space explorers .
known threat the threat of an asteroid hitting the earth is being taken more and more seriously as more and more neos are found .
in the us , congress has charged nasa with the task of starting a more detailed search for life-threatening space rocks .
" congress has said that nasa 's efforts to date are not sufficient to the threat , " said the us space agency 's dr steven chesley .
" they have changed nasa 's targets so that the cataloguing and tracking of asteroids is part of its mandate . "
congress has asked the agency to mount a much more aggressive survey .
at the moment , nasa tracks all objects greater than 700m -lrb- 2,300ft -rrb- in diameter .
the agency 's new goal is to track all objects greater than 70m -lrb- 230ft -rrb- in diameter .
to do this , the agency needs to use a new suite of telescopes .
alternatives include building a new nasa-owned system or investing in other proposed telescopes such as the large synoptic survey telescope -lrb- lsst -rrb- or the panoramic survey telescope & rapid response system -lrb- pan-starrs -rrb- .
pan-starrs is a wide-field telescope being developed at the university of hawaii , whilst the lsst is a proposed ground-based instrument being developed by the not-for-profit lsst corporation based in the us .
nasa estimates that there are about 20,000 potentially threatening asteroids yet to be discovered .
" out of those thousands , there will be without question many that look like they might hit the earth with a high enough probability that the public and everyone else will be concerned , " said dr schweickart .
" this has gone from being an esoteric statistical argument to talking about real events , " added dr david morrison , an astronomer at the nasa 's ames research center .
future plans the un draft treaty would establish who should be in charge in the event of an asteroid heading towards earth , who would pay for relief efforts and the policies that should be adopted .
in addition , it would set out possible plans to deflect the object .
ideas could include hitting the asteroid with a spacecraft or rocket to deflect its orbit .
other less destructive proposals include a " gravity tug " that would simply hover over the asteroid and use gravity as a " towline " to change its path .
but any decision to deflect an neo could come with its own set of conundrums for the un , as changing its path may simply alter its final target .
" it 's important to understand when you start to deflect an asteroid that certain countries are going to have accept an increase in risk to their populations in order to take the risk to zero for everyone , " said dr schweickart .
it is difficult decisions like this that can only be addressed by the un , the association of space explorers believes .
and it is under no illusion that the process can be sorted out quickly .
" you have to act when things look like they are going to happen - if you wait until you know for certain , it 's too late , " said dr schweickart .
experts who will draw up the treaty include lord rees , the english astronomer royal and head of the royal society ; the ex-director of science at the european space agency , roger bonnet ; and former uk government advisor sir crispin tickell .

in a documentary to be shown on bbc wales on tuesday , the former llanelli and british lions no 8 is shown undertaking the dore programme .
the 34-year-old decided to try the treatment because two of his three children are also dyslexic .
" i did n't want them to go through what i did as a child at school , " he said .

the cerebellum is tangerine-sized part of the brain which co-ordinates movement and balance .
quinnell decided to try the treatment , which has been both praised and criticised by academics and educational experts , because he read very slowly and had trouble spelling and writing .
" i 've had fans throw autographs back in my face because i 've spelt their name wrong , " he says in the programme , called quinnell 's last test .
before undertaking the treatment , which costs around £ 1,700 , quinnell had never been able to send an e-mail , use a computer or even write a note for school for any of his three children .
his wife nicola began writing her husband 's cheques just two weeks after she met him and had been filling in forms and writing his correspondence ever since .

bbc wales producer sally davies said at first quinnell 's busy schedule as a rugby pundit and after-dinner speaker prevented him from regularly doing the exercises and he made little progress " but as that classic quinnell determination kicked in he realised his life was changing , " said ms davies .

the " iconic " £ 25m building , the works , would house a theatre , gallery and workshops on llanelli 's coast .
it is one of three welsh bids and 23 in the uk to be shortlisted for a share of £ 140m from the big lottery fund 's living landmarks programme .
mr edwards , who is fronting the bid , said it would be a major boost for the arts in west wales .

carmarthenshire council is seeking £ 18m in lottery cash towards the cost .
mr edwards told the launch : " lots of schemes i 'm asked to back have lots of merits , but from the moment i saw this i was impressed .

" there is very obvious gap in the market - we need to get to a position where people are easily convinced that it will add to llanelli 's life and to west wales .
" llanelli because of the economic struggle some years ago has taken a while to come through the process of regeneration and it is well on its way now - i feel this would be the icing on the cake . "
almost 200 bids were originally put forward and each of the 23 on the shortlist have been given money to develop their plans .
a decision on the successful applications is expected around october .
the works would be sited on the town 's old castle works site boarding the millennium coastal park .

the " iconic " £ 25m building , the works , would house a theatre , gallery and workshops on llanelli 's coast .
it is one of three welsh bids and 23 in the uk to be shortlisted for a share of £ 140m from the big lottery fund 's living landmarks programme .
mr edwards , who is fronting the bid , said it would be a major boost for the arts in west wales .
details of the development were unveiled at the national botanic garden of wales .
carmarthenshire council is seeking £ 18m in lottery cash towards the cost .
mr edwards told the launch : " lots of schemes i 'm asked to back have lots of merits , but from the moment i saw this i was impressed .
" i instantly felt it was not just worth backing , but worth pursuing until it becomes a reality . "
it will add to llanelli 's life and to west wales " huw edwards " the great thing that commends this project is the fact for me it 's so transparently inclusive .
" this provides a facility for all sectors and i can image it being widely used by local schools , drawing in people from the elderly community and offering a range of activities that bring people in .
" there is very obvious gap in the market - we need to get to a position where people are easily convinced that it will add to llanelli 's life and to west wales .
" llanelli because of the economic struggle some years ago has taken a while to come through the process of regeneration and it is well on its way now - i feel this would be the icing on the cake . "
almost 200 bids were originally put forward and each of the 23 on the shortlist have been given money to develop their plans .
a decision on the successful applications is expected around october .
the works would be sited on the town 's old castle works site boarding the millennium coastal park .
council leader meryl gravell said : " this is the next key stage in long-term regeneration plans for carmarthenshire .
" it will fill a cultural void - a little sister for the wales millennium centre .
" it already has major support - the works will be an iconic building . "

many are worried that the story of how , under his leadership , the island struggled for independence - and how , after defeat by the french , he went into exile in london - may be forgotten .
unusually outside the tourist season , a snake of cars was trailing slowly into the hills of central corsica .
the sky was cloudless , and the peaks of the mountains snow-capped .
the air was clean and fresh .
occasionally , a cow wandered across a hairpin bend - one of corsica 's happy , and uneconomic cows , a far cry from the industrial dairies of italy , a few miles across the hazy med , past the island of elba . "

it was here that the father of the corsican nation , and one of the greatest men in european history , was born .
but we have come to mark his death - an event that occurred precisely 200 years ago , in london .
the london connection pasquale di paoli was the che guevara of the 18th century - probably the greatest fighter for freedom of that century , an inspiration to democrats everywhere , a soldier who succeeded in liberating corsica from the oppressive rule of the genoese .
but general paoli was also an intellectual .
opposing taxation without representation , he wrote a constitution for his fledgling nation that inspired the framers of the american constitution - indeed , several towns in the us are named after paoli .
he was praised by pioneers of liberty like voltaire , rousseau and hume .
the young scottish writer james boswell was put on the map not by his biography of dr johnson , but by his travelogue and biography of paoli , which became europe 's first international bestseller , rocketing boswell to fame . "
the power of the paoli legend is able , two centuries after his death , to unite the fragmented political factions of contemporary corsica " pasquale di paoli 's granite home overlooks a steep and staggeringly picturesque valley - the very essence of romanticism .
it 's here that paoli 's remains were returned from london 100 years ago .
arrogant i watched as the dignitaries - including the village mayor with his tricolour sash of the french republic - stepped into a small mausoleum that 's still hung with elaborate victorian black-bead and silver lace wreaths .
as cameras clacked , a local journalist leant towards me and whispered , " you see the two politicians in the middle - they 've never been photographed together before ! "
this was interesting : it meant that the power of the paoli legend is able , two centuries after his death , to unite the fragmented political factions of contemporary corsica .
it 's still a turbulent island - sometimes described as having europe 's " third independence war " - after those of northern ireland and the spanish basque country .
bombs go off constantly , and although the all-important tourist industry is rarely affected , nothing can paper over the continuing unrest .
for , although paoli successfully ejected the genoese , his pioneering democracy was soon destroyed - by france .

i was the only englishman present .
i 'd come to research a book about paoli , but i was disappointed that no official representative of the uk had turned up .
corsican nationalists claim that paoli is almost written out of official french history - but why have the british so forgotten our adopted son ?
for , after the french took corsica , paoli was welcomed in england as a hero , met the king , was granted a state pension , and entered the highest circles of english intellectual society .
pragmatic for two years in the 1790s , the curious anglo-corsican kingdom , now almost forgotten , saw paoli back in corsica , supported by the british crown and navy - indeed , nelson lost his eye fighting the french here .
but the tide of geopolitics turned against paoli , and the hero died , again in exile , in london , where he was commemorated - like one of our own national heroes - in westminster abbey .
by then , at the end of his life , pasquale di paoli had become an admirer of britain 's pragmatic , unwritten democracy , monarchy and all .
after a lunch combining champagne with peasant corsican wild boar sausage , i chatted with the urbane paul giacobbi , one of corsica 's top politicians .
" yes , you british are pragmatic , " mr giacobbi told me .
" that 's how you got peace in northern ireland .
ex-terrorists invited to form a regional government - shocking !
no , we french are obsessed with rigid principles .
but at the same time , we 're insecure . "

the moor 's head was adopted by paoli as the emblem of corsica in 1762 many are worried that the story of how , under his leadership , the island struggled for independence - and how , after defeat by the french , he went into exile in london - may be forgotten .
unusually outside the tourist season , a snake of cars was trailing slowly into the hills of central corsica .
the sky was cloudless , and the peaks of the mountains snow-capped .
the air was clean and fresh .
occasionally , a cow wandered across a hairpin bend - one of corsica 's happy , and uneconomic cows , a far cry from the industrial dairies of italy , a few miles across the hazy med , past the island of elba .
he wrote a constitution for his fledgling nation that inspired the framers of the american constitution - indeed , several towns in the us are named after paoli the cars caused a traffic jam in the mountain village of morosaglia , and dignitaries and ordinary folk climbed out to mingle before an ancient , three-storey , stone house .
it was here that the father of the corsican nation , and one of the greatest men in european history , was born .
but we have come to mark his death - an event that occurred precisely 200 years ago , in london .
the london connection pasquale di paoli was the che guevara of the 18th century - probably the greatest fighter for freedom of that century , an inspiration to democrats everywhere , a soldier who succeeded in liberating corsica from the oppressive rule of the genoese .
the 1970 's saw the re-birth of armed resistance against the french but general paoli was also an intellectual .
opposing taxation without representation , he wrote a constitution for his fledgling nation that inspired the framers of the american constitution - indeed , several towns in the us are named after paoli .
he was praised by pioneers of liberty like voltaire , rousseau and hume .
the young scottish writer james boswell was put on the map not by his biography of dr johnson , but by his travelogue and biography of paoli , which became europe 's first international bestseller , rocketing boswell to fame .
the power of the paoli legend is able , two centuries after his death , to unite the fragmented political factions of contemporary corsica pasquale di paoli 's granite home overlooks a steep and staggeringly picturesque valley - the very essence of romanticism .
it 's here that paoli 's remains were returned from london 100 years ago .
arrogant i watched as the dignitaries - including the village mayor with his tricolour sash of the french republic - stepped into a small mausoleum that 's still hung with elaborate victorian black-bead and silver lace wreaths .
as cameras clacked , a local journalist leant towards me and whispered , " you see the two politicians in the middle - they 've never been photographed together before ! "
this was interesting : it meant that the power of the paoli legend is able , two centuries after his death , to unite the fragmented political factions of contemporary corsica .
it 's still a turbulent island - sometimes described as having europe 's " third independence war " - after those of northern ireland and the spanish basque country .
bombs go off constantly , and although the all-important tourist industry is rarely affected , nothing can paper over the continuing unrest .
for , although paoli successfully ejected the genoese , his pioneering democracy was soon destroyed - by france .
once independent , corsica is now a poor and often despised french province .
and france 's arrogant rule resulted , in the 1970s , in the rebirth of armed resistance .
adopted son we moved to church for mass , celebrated in part by the village priest , l 'abbé mondoloni , one of corsica 's most outspoken supporters of independence .
a charismatic firebrand , he told me after the mass with glittering eyes that france was " occupying " corsica .
white corsican flags with their politically incorrect black moor 's heads were waved , and songs intoned in corsican .
i observed that the official representative of the french state frigidly spoke to no-one .
he may have been remembering that nine years back , one of his predecessors was assassinated on the anniversary of paoli 's death .
i was the only englishman present .
i 'd come to research a book about paoli , but i was disappointed that no official representative of the uk had turned up .
corsican nationalists claim that paoli is almost written out of official french history - but why have the british so forgotten our adopted son ?
for , after the french took corsica , paoli was welcomed in england as a hero , met the king , was granted a state pension , and entered the highest circles of english intellectual society .
pragmatic for two years in the 1790s , the curious anglo-corsican kingdom , now almost forgotten , saw paoli back in corsica , supported by the british crown and navy - indeed , nelson lost his eye fighting the french here .
paoli spent his last days far from corsica , dying in london but the tide of geopolitics turned against paoli , and the hero died , again in exile , in london , where he was commemorated - like one of our own national heroes - in westminster abbey .
by then , at the end of his life , pasquale di paoli had become an admirer of britain 's pragmatic , unwritten democracy , monarchy and all .
after a lunch combining champagne with peasant corsican wild boar sausage , i chatted with the urbane paul giacobbi , one of corsica 's top politicians .
" yes , you british are pragmatic , " mr giacobbi told me .
" that 's how you got peace in northern ireland .
ex-terrorists invited to form a regional government - shocking !
no , we french are obsessed with rigid principles .
but at the same time , we 're insecure . "
" and that , " he concluded , " is why corsica is still in such a mess . "
