23 , dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen comments that much of the bitter criticism of this year 's show misses the point . it was n't beautiful .
but beauty 's as important in the new world of art as vegetables are for a cannibal .
it 's all about changing viewing habits , connecting the dots and unleashing a tempest of perception .
medicine 's not meant to taste good - it only works if it tastes bitter , as the proverb goes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen the documenta 12 - the highlight of the 2007 art summer - was a complete success in that regard .
a badly stuffed giraffe from the west bank meant to signify the mideast conflict was on display , as was a sculpture made from old chinese doors that collapsed after a storm .
ai weiwei , the artist responsible , stayed cool and was thrilled that the price of his artwork had just doubled .
note : a glitch is also art .
and : art stems from communication .
it 's not a new but an important insight that art does not speak for itself - it has to be talked about .
the documenta began with great expectations .
some wrote that nothing less than an " artistic world revolution " was about to take place .
the revolution did n't happen - the documenta triggered angry protests , especially abroad .
it was called consternation kitsch , irrelevant , boring - a well-known british critic spoke of the worst exhibition he had ever seen .
this was partly due to the fact that the documenta curators intentionally did without the current art heroes , such as damien hirst or german superstars neo rauch and daniel richter , whose paintings are sold before they 've dried .
but was it a mistake not to invite celebrities ?
people may be upset about the theory overkill , but it actually elevates the makers of documenta : the attempt to distinguish oneself from the fashion of the art world , which turns everyone into a celebrity as soon as a russian oil magnate spends enormous sums on artists that nobody had heard of yesterday and that nobody will know tomorrow .
the documenta offered a massive repertoire with 500 often very political works by artists , also from africa , latin america and asia .
there was much to discover .
this year , changing viewing habits also were meant to be open for an african artist 's approach to the issue of migration or an argentine artist 's work on sexual violence .
a little note on the side : 50 percent of the artists on display were women , finally doing away with the prejudice that there are only a few good female artists .
it 's also interesting that this " worst exhibition " attracted more people than ever .
the fact that people from all over the world gathered in kassel alone is an experience - a cosmopolitan audience in a provincial german town .
culture in germany is decentralized - it does n't always have to be berlin , hamburg or munich .
germany is an art trend-setter ; no other country has such a high density of museums and important exhibitions .
german art is also the most expensive .
there 's a saying in the art world : artworks above deck may come from the us , but the lingua franca in the engine room of art is german .
this summer of art also showed more than ever that it 's no longer just the classic , somewhat older , educated classes who are interested in art and the art boom - it 's becoming a mass phenomenon for young people .
sure , that 's also partly because of the insane sums that are paid for art these days and because artists are now as glamorous as pop or movie stars .
celebrities such as hirst long ago entered the yellow press , which also reports on what art which movie star has just bought at what price .
in short : art is chic .
but there 's more : the artist with all his quirks , unpredictability and fundamental refusal to conform has become an inspiring figure in times of a controlled and monitored world : look , i might lead a boring life , but a different one is also possible .
young people who are fascinated by fashion and style are inevitably also interested in modern art .
that 's happening despite the fact that art in search of provocation , art that tries to focus on complex theories of perception , art like that on display in kassel does n't make it easy for the audience .
the documenta makers have shown courage to ask the right questions and explain the context .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 24.09.2007 opinion : the beauty of documenta 12 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while kassel prepares for its next five-year beauty sleep after the end of the documenta on sunday , sept .
23 , dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen comments that much of the bitter criticism of this year 's show misses the point . it was n't beautiful .
but beauty 's as important in the new world of art as vegetables are for a cannibal .
it 's all about changing viewing habits , connecting the dots and unleashing a tempest of perception .
medicine 's not meant to taste good - it only works if it tastes bitter , as the proverb goes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen the documenta 12 - the highlight of the 2007 art summer - was a complete success in that regard .
a badly stuffed giraffe from the west bank meant to signify the mideast conflict was on display , as was a sculpture made from old chinese doors that collapsed after a storm .
ai weiwei , the artist responsible , stayed cool and was thrilled that the price of his artwork had just doubled .
note : a glitch is also art .
and : art stems from communication .
it 's not a new but an important insight that art does not speak for itself - it has to be talked about .
the documenta began with great expectations .
some wrote that nothing less than an " artistic world revolution " was about to take place .
the revolution did n't happen - the documenta triggered angry protests , especially abroad .
it was called consternation kitsch , irrelevant , boring - a well-known british critic spoke of the worst exhibition he had ever seen .
this was partly due to the fact that the documenta curators intentionally did without the current art heroes , such as damien hirst or german superstars neo rauch and daniel richter , whose paintings are sold before they 've dried .
but was it a mistake not to invite celebrities ?
people may be upset about the theory overkill , but it actually elevates the makers of documenta : the attempt to distinguish oneself from the fashion of the art world , which turns everyone into a celebrity as soon as a russian oil magnate spends enormous sums on artists that nobody had heard of yesterday and that nobody will know tomorrow .
the documenta offered a massive repertoire with 500 often very political works by artists , also from africa , latin america and asia .
there was much to discover .
this year , changing viewing habits also were meant to be open for an african artist 's approach to the issue of migration or an argentine artist 's work on sexual violence .
a little note on the side : 50 percent of the artists on display were women , finally doing away with the prejudice that there are only a few good female artists .
it 's also interesting that this " worst exhibition " attracted more people than ever .
the fact that people from all over the world gathered in kassel alone is an experience - a cosmopolitan audience in a provincial german town .
culture in germany is decentralized - it does n't always have to be berlin , hamburg or munich .
germany is an art trend-setter ; no other country has such a high density of museums and important exhibitions .
german art is also the most expensive .
there 's a saying in the art world : artworks above deck may come from the us , but the lingua franca in the engine room of art is german .
this summer of art also showed more than ever that it 's no longer just the classic , somewhat older , educated classes who are interested in art and the art boom - it 's becoming a mass phenomenon for young people .
sure , that 's also partly because of the insane sums that are paid for art these days and because artists are now as glamorous as pop or movie stars .
celebrities such as hirst long ago entered the yellow press , which also reports on what art which movie star has just bought at what price .
in short : art is chic .
but there 's more : the artist with all his quirks , unpredictability and fundamental refusal to conform has become an inspiring figure in times of a controlled and monitored world : look , i might lead a boring life , but a different one is also possible .
young people who are fascinated by fashion and style are inevitably also interested in modern art .
that 's happening despite the fact that art in search of provocation , art that tries to focus on complex theories of perception , art like that on display in kassel does n't make it easy for the audience .
the documenta makers have shown courage to ask the right questions and explain the context .
one has to conclude this summer art fairy tale by saying : it was n't beautiful .
it ca n't be beautiful .
but it helped .

merkel , a strong advocate of reaching an agreement within the un framework , added that new york and the un headquarters were the right places to discuss these issues .

24 , that the net wages of german workers fell last year to their lowest level in 20 years .
the average net pay check - after the deduction of taxes , social contributions and taking into account price developments in the past year - amounted to 15,845 euros -lrb- $ 22,357 -rrb- , the paper said .
that was almost the same as in 1986 , when the average net salary was 15,785 euros .

even though her foreign policy advisers told her not to , and despite political pressure from beijing , madame merkel opened the chancellery doors to the dalai lama for the very first time .
at the end of the day , the german chancellor , in contrast to many other world leaders , acted in agreement with her stated beliefs : that human rights - in this case , of tibetans - should not be sacrificed on the altar of china 's economic promise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel ignored advisers , inviting the dalai lama to berlin the financial times deutschland wondered if merkel 's decision was n't a result of her personal history of growing up under east germany 's repressive communist regime .
" angela merkel has earned our respect , " the paper wrote .
" when it comes to political face-offs , merkel often seems fuzzy , offering up riddles when questioned on a given stance .
but when it comes to protecting human rights , she takes a clear stance .
perhaps it is the legacy of her biography as an ex-ddr citizen .
in any case , it is a bold move . " when it comes to foreign policy , chancellor angela merkel has shown herself as principled and dogged , wrote the mitteldeutsche zeitung from halle .
" neither -lsb- predecessors -rsb- helmut kohl nor gerhard schröder took such a consistent interest in human rights questions as the chancellor from east germany .
the private meeting with the dalai lama plumbs new depths of german foreign policy . … the decades-old calls to support human- and civic rights - outside of sunday sermons - are finally being taken seriously by a german head of government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one paper criticized schröder 's approach to the china-tibet problem the westdeutsche zeitung from düsseldorf warned business that their fear of losing chinese business over friendship with the dalai lama is " out of place . … businesses have to get used to the idea that they lost their best worker when gerhard schröder left office .
foreign policy needs to be more than just the perception of economic and security interests . … the steadiness with which angela merkel stands up for human rights against russia and even china has earned her a portion of the respect the voters gave her . finally the luxemburger wort took time to point out that tibet can not really be considered an " enemy " of china , given the dalai lama 's limited demands on beijing .
" since 1959 , -lsb- the dalai lama -rsb- has been living in exile in india and has never preached violence against the occupying chinese .
he gave up the demand for tibetan independence long ago , and now only seeks autonomous status within china 's borders .
so , berlin has not made an alliance with beijing 's enemies . "
nonetheless merkel 's decision to meet with its leader is an important symbolic act , the paper wrote . compiled by dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , a spokesman at germany 's foreign ministry , martin jäger , said berlin also called for the release of demonstrators taken into custody by police and that opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi should be released from house arrest .
the german government welcomed " the peaceful course of demonstrations " and noted its support for " any peaceful expression of opinions " in myanmar .
" if the government of myanmar is serious about its reform plans , then it must not prevent this expression of opinions , " jäger said at a news conference .
over the weekend and on monday , the protests that erupted five weeks ago escalated , with tens of thousands demonstrating on monday against 45 years of army rule .
it was the biggest protest since a student-led movement almost two decades ago which was crushed by the generals who control the nation of 53 million .
media reports say 100,000 people participated in monday 's demonstrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist monks on the march against the military goverment monks and nuns have recently been in the forefront of the protest movement , which began as civilian anger at last month 's sharp fuel price increases .
in the capital yangon , five columns of monks in maroon robes marched from the shwedagon pagoda , the devoutly buddhist country 's holiest shrine , to the city center where thousands of people filled five blocks .
myanmar 's 400,000 monks are revered by the public , posing a problem for the generals in how to handle the unrest .
detentions while the protests have been largely peaceful , a watchdog group on monday said the country 's military rulers have detained 218 people over the protests , sometimes subjecting them to beatings during interrogations .

she is now under house arrest .
news of her appearance spread rapidly and was seen initially as a sign the military was being flexible .
however , on sunday , police moved fire engines , police vans and dozens of police to the entrance of her street and refused to let a group of 200 marching monks through .
censorship and suppression journalists trying to cover the event have been the victims of government censorship and violence , according to reporters with borders and the burma media association .

24 , after chancellor angela merkel 's visit with the dalai lama angered china .
beijing cancelled two high-level meetings in apparent retaliation . in an attempt to assuage china 's anger at the meeting between merkel and the tibetan spiritual leader , merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen phoned china 's ambassador to germany to assure him of the chancellor 's desire to pursue close bilateral ties . " he called the chinese ambassador in berlin today to inform him about the talks with the dalai lama but also to make clear that this conversation is something totally natural .
it should be possible without harming german-chinese ties , " german government spokesman thomas steg said at a press conference in berlin . " heusgen assured the ambassador that we share great interest in continuing , intensifying and promoting our good ties with china , " steg said , saying that he believed these would not suffer serious damage as a result of sunday 's unprecedented meeting . however , he added that merkel believes " human rights can not be sacrificed for economic reasons . " cancellations berlin announced on monday that beijing had called off a standing breakfast meeting between the countries ' foreign ministers in new york on the sidelines of the annual un general assembly because of " scheduling difficulties . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese-german relations have taken a hit , but not likely a serious one , experts say justice minister brigitte zypries was stood up by chinese officials on sunday at a bilateral justice forum , but she said she was also trying to reschedule and mitigate diplomatic fallout . " we hope that this dialog will not suffer lasting damage , " she said . foreign affairs spokesman martin jäger said berlin is trying to find a suitable time for a meeting in new york between foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his chinese counterpart yang jiechi this week . " we have heard from the chinese side that this breakfast will not be able to take place this year because of time constraints , " jäger said . cultural autonomy merkel signaled that she supported the dalai lama 's quest for cultural autonomy for the himalayan region , sticking to the course she steered during a visit to china in august in which she readily tackled human rights issues . tibet has been under chinese authority since the mid-1700s .
it had varying degrees of autonomy until the chinese communist party arrived in 1950 .
after a failed revolt by tibetans against the chinese in 1959 , the dalai lama fled to india . he has repeatedly called for tibetan self-rule . saving face ? frank umbach , the head of the research unit on china at the german council on foreign relations , told the news agency afp that beijing 's indignant response could prove to be a storm in a teacup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin says it wants close bilateral ties , despite differences over tibet " it is very important for china to save face , and the reaction is hardly surprising if you take into account china 's track record in such cases , " he said , referring to china 's stance toward france in the 1990s when it sold weaponry to taiwan .
he did not think there would be lasting damage from the incident . " merkel has been very consistent and predictable on human rights towards china and also russia , " he said .
" and over the past two years , there has been a 180-degree turn among european union members and a new consensus has emerged . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , where she 'll attend a un climate conference and speak before the world body 's general assembly for the first time . in her weekly video podcast , merkel said saturday that it was crucial for world leaders to reach an agreement on climate protection at a december summit on the indonesian island of bali .
the current kyoto protocol will expire in 2012 .
" we can all see that , in view of extreme weather situations , flooding and drought disasters , forest fires and famines , that climate change is a global task that concerns us all , " she said .
" the industrial states must take a higher responsibility in this , but developing countries also must do justice to their responsibility . "
will us sidestep negotiations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel manage to show bush the way to the un ?
merkel , a strong advocate of reaching an agreement within the un framework , added that new york and the un headquarters were the right places to discuss these issues .
us president george w. bush , who has refused to sign the kyoto protocol , is hosting his own conference on climate change in washington later in the week .
german climate activists called on merkel to do everything in her power to prevent the us from sidestepping the un negotiations .
" this trip is her first real test as self-proclaimed climate protector on the international scene , " brigitte behrens , the executive director of greenpeace germany , told german news agency dpa .
german industry worried about merkel 's demands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry leaders think technology exports is the way to go about climate protection speaking at the un climate summit on monday , merkel is also expected to call for halving co2 emissions by the middle of the current century , according to government officials , dpa reported .
german business leaders meanwhile expressed concern about merkel 's push for more climate protection .
" merkel is endangering german jobs , " jürgen thumann , the president of the federation of german industries , said in the monday edition of german business magazine wirtschaftswoche .
thumann added that germany could do more to combat climate change by exporting state-of-the-art energy technologies .
the conference will be the biggest ever on climate control , with some 150 states and about 80 heads of state or government in attendance .
security council still sensitive issue bildunterschrift : will germany get a seat at this table ?
german government officials meanwhile have remained tight-lipped about whether merkel will address the issue of a permanent seat for germany in the un security council .
while her predecessor was very vocal about getting germany a place at the world 's top decision-making body , merkel is expected to express germany 's " readiness to take on responsibility . "
according to news reports , german officials have now said that they would be willing to accept an interim solution that would allow germany , india , japan , brazil and representatives from africa to join the security council for 10 to 15 years while a long-term solution is found .
meeting some , avoiding others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will sit in this chair shortly after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad merkel will also hold talks with a number of leaders during her visit to the un .
she is scheduled to meet with un secretary general ban ki moon and brazilian president lula da silva , among others .
while her 15-minute time slot to address the general assembly on tuesday comes just a few speakers after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , she is expected to avoid an encounter with the iranian leader . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

23 , dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen comments that much of the bitter criticism of this year 's show misses the point . it was n't beautiful .
but beauty 's as important in the new world of art as vegetables are for a cannibal .
it 's all about changing viewing habits , connecting the dots and unleashing a tempest of perception .
medicine 's not meant to taste good - it only works if it tastes bitter , as the proverb goes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen the documenta 12 - the highlight of the 2007 art summer - was a complete success in that regard .
a badly stuffed giraffe from the west bank meant to signify the mideast conflict was on display , as was a sculpture made from old chinese doors that collapsed after a storm .
ai weiwei , the artist responsible , stayed cool and was thrilled that the price of his artwork had just doubled .
note : a glitch is also art .
and : art stems from communication .
it 's not a new but an important insight that art does not speak for itself - it has to be talked about .
the documenta began with great expectations .
some wrote that nothing less than an " artistic world revolution " was about to take place .
the revolution did n't happen - the documenta triggered angry protests , especially abroad .
it was called consternation kitsch , irrelevant , boring - a well-known british critic spoke of the worst exhibition he had ever seen .
this was partly due to the fact that the documenta curators intentionally did without the current art heroes , such as damien hirst or german superstars neo rauch and daniel richter , whose paintings are sold before they 've dried .
but was it a mistake not to invite celebrities ?
people may be upset about the theory overkill , but it actually elevates the makers of documenta : the attempt to distinguish oneself from the fashion of the art world , which turns everyone into a celebrity as soon as a russian oil magnate spends enormous sums on artists that nobody had heard of yesterday and that nobody will know tomorrow .
the documenta offered a massive repertoire with 500 often very political works by artists , also from africa , latin america and asia .
there was much to discover .
this year , changing viewing habits also were meant to be open for an african artist 's approach to the issue of migration or an argentine artist 's work on sexual violence .
a little note on the side : 50 percent of the artists on display were women , finally doing away with the prejudice that there are only a few good female artists .
it 's also interesting that this " worst exhibition " attracted more people than ever .
the fact that people from all over the world gathered in kassel alone is an experience - a cosmopolitan audience in a provincial german town .
culture in germany is decentralized - it does n't always have to be berlin , hamburg or munich .
germany is an art trend-setter ; no other country has such a high density of museums and important exhibitions .
german art is also the most expensive .
there 's a saying in the art world : artworks above deck may come from the us , but the lingua franca in the engine room of art is german .
this summer of art also showed more than ever that it 's no longer just the classic , somewhat older , educated classes who are interested in art and the art boom - it 's becoming a mass phenomenon for young people .
sure , that 's also partly because of the insane sums that are paid for art these days and because artists are now as glamorous as pop or movie stars .
celebrities such as hirst long ago entered the yellow press , which also reports on what art which movie star has just bought at what price .
in short : art is chic .
but there 's more : the artist with all his quirks , unpredictability and fundamental refusal to conform has become an inspiring figure in times of a controlled and monitored world : look , i might lead a boring life , but a different one is also possible .
young people who are fascinated by fashion and style are inevitably also interested in modern art .
that 's happening despite the fact that art in search of provocation , art that tries to focus on complex theories of perception , art like that on display in kassel does n't make it easy for the audience .
the documenta makers have shown courage to ask the right questions and explain the context .
one has to conclude this summer art fairy tale by saying : it was n't beautiful .
it ca n't be beautiful .

23 , dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen comments that much of the bitter criticism of this year 's show misses the point . it was n't beautiful .
but beauty 's as important in the new world of art as vegetables are for a cannibal .
it 's all about changing viewing habits , connecting the dots and unleashing a tempest of perception .
medicine 's not meant to taste good - it only works if it tastes bitter , as the proverb goes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen the documenta 12 - the highlight of the 2007 art summer - was a complete success in that regard .
a badly stuffed giraffe from the west bank meant to signify the mideast conflict was on display , as was a sculpture made from old chinese doors that collapsed after a storm .
ai weiwei , the artist responsible , stayed cool and was thrilled that the price of his artwork had just doubled .
note : a glitch is also art .
and : art stems from communication .
it 's not a new but an important insight that art does not speak for itself - it has to be talked about .
the documenta began with great expectations .
some wrote that nothing less than an " artistic world revolution " was about to take place .
the revolution did n't happen - the documenta triggered angry protests , especially abroad .
it was called consternation kitsch , irrelevant , boring - a well-known british critic spoke of the worst exhibition he had ever seen .
this was partly due to the fact that the documenta curators intentionally did without the current art heroes , such as damien hirst or german superstars neo rauch and daniel richter , whose paintings are sold before they 've dried .
but was it a mistake not to invite celebrities ?
people may be upset about the theory overkill , but it actually elevates the makers of documenta : the attempt to distinguish oneself from the fashion of the art world , which turns everyone into a celebrity as soon as a russian oil magnate spends enormous sums on artists that nobody had heard of yesterday and that nobody will know tomorrow .
the documenta offered a massive repertoire with 500 often very political works by artists , also from africa , latin america and asia .
there was much to discover .
this year , changing viewing habits also were meant to be open for an african artist 's approach to the issue of migration or an argentine artist 's work on sexual violence .
a little note on the side : 50 percent of the artists on display were women , finally doing away with the prejudice that there are only a few good female artists .
it 's also interesting that this " worst exhibition " attracted more people than ever .
the fact that people from all over the world gathered in kassel alone is an experience - a cosmopolitan audience in a provincial german town .
culture in germany is decentralized - it does n't always have to be berlin , hamburg or munich .
germany is an art trend-setter ; no other country has such a high density of museums and important exhibitions .
german art is also the most expensive .
there 's a saying in the art world : artworks above deck may come from the us , but the lingua franca in the engine room of art is german .
this summer of art also showed more than ever that it 's no longer just the classic , somewhat older , educated classes who are interested in art and the art boom - it 's becoming a mass phenomenon for young people .
sure , that 's also partly because of the insane sums that are paid for art these days and because artists are now as glamorous as pop or movie stars .
celebrities such as hirst long ago entered the yellow press , which also reports on what art which movie star has just bought at what price .
in short : art is chic .
but there 's more : the artist with all his quirks , unpredictability and fundamental refusal to conform has become an inspiring figure in times of a controlled and monitored world : look , i might lead a boring life , but a different one is also possible .
young people who are fascinated by fashion and style are inevitably also interested in modern art .
that 's happening despite the fact that art in search of provocation , art that tries to focus on complex theories of perception , art like that on display in kassel does n't make it easy for the audience .
the documenta makers have shown courage to ask the right questions and explain the context .
one has to conclude this summer art fairy tale by saying : it was n't beautiful .
it ca n't be beautiful .

24 , a spokesman at germany 's foreign ministry , martin jäger , said berlin also called for the release of demonstrators taken into custody by police and that opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi should be released from house arrest .
the german government welcomed " the peaceful course of demonstrations " and noted its support for " any peaceful expression of opinions " in myanmar .
" if the government of myanmar is serious about its reform plans , then it must not prevent this expression of opinions , " jäger said at a news conference .
over the weekend and on monday , the protests that erupted five weeks ago escalated , with tens of thousands demonstrating on monday against 45 years of army rule .
it was the biggest protest since a student-led movement almost two decades ago which was crushed by the generals who control the nation of 53 million .
media reports say 100,000 people participated in monday 's demonstrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist monks on the march against the military goverment monks and nuns have recently been in the forefront of the protest movement , which began as civilian anger at last month 's sharp fuel price increases .
in the capital yangon , five columns of monks in maroon robes marched from the shwedagon pagoda , the devoutly buddhist country 's holiest shrine , to the city center where thousands of people filled five blocks .
myanmar 's 400,000 monks are revered by the public , posing a problem for the generals in how to handle the unrest .
detentions while the protests have been largely peaceful , a watchdog group on monday said the country 's military rulers have detained 218 people over the protests , sometimes subjecting them to beatings during interrogations .
" activists have not only been beaten while in detention , but have also been under extreme physical and mental torture , " bo kyi , head of the thailand-based assistance association for political prisoners -lrb- burma -rrb- , told the afp news agency .
once a political prisoner himself , bo kyi said 46 of those detained are being held in squalid conditions at a police base in yangon .
international rights groups have alleged that abuse and torture are common in myanmar 's prisons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many protesters have shouted support for detained democracy leader aung san suu kyi the country 's most famous detainee , democracy icon suu kyi , made her first appearance in public in four years on saturday , who has spent 12 of the last 18 years in some type of confinement .
she is now under house arrest .
news of her appearance spread rapidly and was seen initially as a sign the military was being flexible .
however , on sunday , police moved fire engines , police vans and dozens of police to the entrance of her street and refused to let a group of 200 marching monks through .
censorship and suppression journalists trying to cover the event have been the victims of government censorship and violence , according to reporters with borders and the burma media association .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi in 2003 in a press release , the two groups said the government was trying to prevent journalists from covering the protests and that there have been at least 24 " serious violations " of the freedom to report news and information since aug .
19 .

24 , a spokesman at germany 's foreign ministry , martin jäger , said berlin also called for the release of demonstrators taken into custody by police and that opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi should be released from house arrest .
the german government welcomed " the peaceful course of demonstrations " and noted its support for " any peaceful expression of opinions " in myanmar .
" if the government of myanmar is serious about its reform plans , then it must not prevent this expression of opinions , " jäger said at a news conference .
over the weekend and on monday , the protests that erupted five weeks ago escalated , with tens of thousands demonstrating on monday against 45 years of army rule .
it was the biggest protest since a student-led movement almost two decades ago which was crushed by the generals who control the nation of 53 million .
media reports say 100,000 people participated in monday 's demonstrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist monks on the march against the military goverment monks and nuns have recently been in the forefront of the protest movement , which began as civilian anger at last month 's sharp fuel price increases .
in the capital yangon , five columns of monks in maroon robes marched from the shwedagon pagoda , the devoutly buddhist country 's holiest shrine , to the city center where thousands of people filled five blocks .
myanmar 's 400,000 monks are revered by the public , posing a problem for the generals in how to handle the unrest .
detentions while the protests have been largely peaceful , a watchdog group on monday said the country 's military rulers have detained 218 people over the protests , sometimes subjecting them to beatings during interrogations .
" activists have not only been beaten while in detention , but have also been under extreme physical and mental torture , " bo kyi , head of the thailand-based assistance association for political prisoners -lrb- burma -rrb- , told the afp news agency .

she is now under house arrest .
news of her appearance spread rapidly and was seen initially as a sign the military was being flexible .
however , on sunday , police moved fire engines , police vans and dozens of police to the entrance of her street and refused to let a group of 200 marching monks through .
censorship and suppression journalists trying to cover the event have been the victims of government censorship and violence , according to reporters with borders and the burma media association .

at the end of the day , the german chancellor , in contrast to many other world leaders , acted in agreement with her stated beliefs : that human rights - in this case , of tibetans - should not be sacrificed on the altar of china 's economic promise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel ignored advisers , inviting the dalai lama to berlin the financial times deutschland wondered if merkel 's decision was n't a result of her personal history of growing up under east germany 's repressive communist regime .
" angela merkel has earned our respect , " the paper wrote .
" when it comes to political face-offs , merkel often seems fuzzy , offering up riddles when questioned on a given stance .
but when it comes to protecting human rights , she takes a clear stance .
perhaps it is the legacy of her biography as an ex-ddr citizen .
in any case , it is a bold move . " when it comes to foreign policy , chancellor angela merkel has shown herself as principled and dogged , wrote the mitteldeutsche zeitung from halle .
" neither -lsb- predecessors -rsb- helmut kohl nor gerhard schröder took such a consistent interest in human rights questions as the chancellor from east germany .
the private meeting with the dalai lama plumbs new depths of german foreign policy . … the decades-old calls to support human- and civic rights - outside of sunday sermons - are finally being taken seriously by a german head of government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one paper criticized schröder 's approach to the china-tibet problem the westdeutsche zeitung from düsseldorf warned business that their fear of losing chinese business over friendship with the dalai lama is " out of place . … businesses have to get used to the idea that they lost their best worker when gerhard schröder left office .
foreign policy needs to be more than just the perception of economic and security interests . … the steadiness with which angela merkel stands up for human rights against russia and even china has earned her a portion of the respect the voters gave her . finally the luxemburger wort took time to point out that tibet can not really be considered an " enemy " of china , given the dalai lama 's limited demands on beijing .
" since 1959 , -lsb- the dalai lama -rsb- has been living in exile in india and has never preached violence against the occupying chinese .
he gave up the demand for tibetan independence long ago , and now only seeks autonomous status within china 's borders .
so , berlin has not made an alliance with beijing 's enemies . "
nonetheless merkel 's decision to meet with its leader is an important symbolic act , the paper wrote . compiled by dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , a spokesman at germany 's foreign ministry , martin jäger , said berlin also called for the release of demonstrators taken into custody by police and that opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi should be released from house arrest .
the german government welcomed " the peaceful course of demonstrations " and noted its support for " any peaceful expression of opinions " in myanmar .
" if the government of myanmar is serious about its reform plans , then it must not prevent this expression of opinions , " jäger said at a news conference .
over the weekend and on monday , the protests that erupted five weeks ago escalated , with tens of thousands demonstrating on monday against 45 years of army rule .
it was the biggest protest since a student-led movement almost two decades ago which was crushed by the generals who control the nation of 53 million .
media reports say 100,000 people participated in monday 's demonstrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist monks on the march against the military goverment monks and nuns have recently been in the forefront of the protest movement , which began as civilian anger at last month 's sharp fuel price increases .
in the capital yangon , five columns of monks in maroon robes marched from the shwedagon pagoda , the devoutly buddhist country 's holiest shrine , to the city center where thousands of people filled five blocks .
myanmar 's 400,000 monks are revered by the public , posing a problem for the generals in how to handle the unrest .
detentions while the protests have been largely peaceful , a watchdog group on monday said the country 's military rulers have detained 218 people over the protests , sometimes subjecting them to beatings during interrogations .
" activists have not only been beaten while in detention , but have also been under extreme physical and mental torture , " bo kyi , head of the thailand-based assistance association for political prisoners -lrb- burma -rrb- , told the afp news agency .
once a political prisoner himself , bo kyi said 46 of those detained are being held in squalid conditions at a police base in yangon .

23 , dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen comments that much of the bitter criticism of this year 's show misses the point . it was n't beautiful .
but beauty 's as important in the new world of art as vegetables are for a cannibal .
it 's all about changing viewing habits , connecting the dots and unleashing a tempest of perception .
medicine 's not meant to taste good - it only works if it tastes bitter , as the proverb goes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen the documenta 12 - the highlight of the 2007 art summer - was a complete success in that regard .
a badly stuffed giraffe from the west bank meant to signify the mideast conflict was on display , as was a sculpture made from old chinese doors that collapsed after a storm .
ai weiwei , the artist responsible , stayed cool and was thrilled that the price of his artwork had just doubled .
note : a glitch is also art .
and : art stems from communication .
it 's not a new but an important insight that art does not speak for itself - it has to be talked about .
the documenta began with great expectations .
some wrote that nothing less than an " artistic world revolution " was about to take place .
the revolution did n't happen - the documenta triggered angry protests , especially abroad .
it was called consternation kitsch , irrelevant , boring - a well-known british critic spoke of the worst exhibition he had ever seen .
this was partly due to the fact that the documenta curators intentionally did without the current art heroes , such as damien hirst or german superstars neo rauch and daniel richter , whose paintings are sold before they 've dried .
but was it a mistake not to invite celebrities ?
people may be upset about the theory overkill , but it actually elevates the makers of documenta : the attempt to distinguish oneself from the fashion of the art world , which turns everyone into a celebrity as soon as a russian oil magnate spends enormous sums on artists that nobody had heard of yesterday and that nobody will know tomorrow .
the documenta offered a massive repertoire with 500 often very political works by artists , also from africa , latin america and asia .
there was much to discover .
this year , changing viewing habits also were meant to be open for an african artist 's approach to the issue of migration or an argentine artist 's work on sexual violence .
a little note on the side : 50 percent of the artists on display were women , finally doing away with the prejudice that there are only a few good female artists .
it 's also interesting that this " worst exhibition " attracted more people than ever .
the fact that people from all over the world gathered in kassel alone is an experience - a cosmopolitan audience in a provincial german town .
culture in germany is decentralized - it does n't always have to be berlin , hamburg or munich .
germany is an art trend-setter ; no other country has such a high density of museums and important exhibitions .
german art is also the most expensive .
there 's a saying in the art world : artworks above deck may come from the us , but the lingua franca in the engine room of art is german .
this summer of art also showed more than ever that it 's no longer just the classic , somewhat older , educated classes who are interested in art and the art boom - it 's becoming a mass phenomenon for young people .
sure , that 's also partly because of the insane sums that are paid for art these days and because artists are now as glamorous as pop or movie stars .
celebrities such as hirst long ago entered the yellow press , which also reports on what art which movie star has just bought at what price .
in short : art is chic .
but there 's more : the artist with all his quirks , unpredictability and fundamental refusal to conform has become an inspiring figure in times of a controlled and monitored world : look , i might lead a boring life , but a different one is also possible .
young people who are fascinated by fashion and style are inevitably also interested in modern art .
that 's happening despite the fact that art in search of provocation , art that tries to focus on complex theories of perception , art like that on display in kassel does n't make it easy for the audience .
the documenta makers have shown courage to ask the right questions and explain the context .
one has to conclude this summer art fairy tale by saying : it was n't beautiful .

23 , dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen comments that much of the bitter criticism of this year 's show misses the point . it was n't beautiful .
but beauty 's as important in the new world of art as vegetables are for a cannibal .
it 's all about changing viewing habits , connecting the dots and unleashing a tempest of perception .
medicine 's not meant to taste good - it only works if it tastes bitter , as the proverb goes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen the documenta 12 - the highlight of the 2007 art summer - was a complete success in that regard .
a badly stuffed giraffe from the west bank meant to signify the mideast conflict was on display , as was a sculpture made from old chinese doors that collapsed after a storm .
ai weiwei , the artist responsible , stayed cool and was thrilled that the price of his artwork had just doubled .
note : a glitch is also art .
and : art stems from communication .
it 's not a new but an important insight that art does not speak for itself - it has to be talked about .
the documenta began with great expectations .
some wrote that nothing less than an " artistic world revolution " was about to take place .
the revolution did n't happen - the documenta triggered angry protests , especially abroad .
it was called consternation kitsch , irrelevant , boring - a well-known british critic spoke of the worst exhibition he had ever seen .
this was partly due to the fact that the documenta curators intentionally did without the current art heroes , such as damien hirst or german superstars neo rauch and daniel richter , whose paintings are sold before they 've dried .
but was it a mistake not to invite celebrities ?
people may be upset about the theory overkill , but it actually elevates the makers of documenta : the attempt to distinguish oneself from the fashion of the art world , which turns everyone into a celebrity as soon as a russian oil magnate spends enormous sums on artists that nobody had heard of yesterday and that nobody will know tomorrow .
the documenta offered a massive repertoire with 500 often very political works by artists , also from africa , latin america and asia .
there was much to discover .
this year , changing viewing habits also were meant to be open for an african artist 's approach to the issue of migration or an argentine artist 's work on sexual violence .
a little note on the side : 50 percent of the artists on display were women , finally doing away with the prejudice that there are only a few good female artists .
it 's also interesting that this " worst exhibition " attracted more people than ever .
the fact that people from all over the world gathered in kassel alone is an experience - a cosmopolitan audience in a provincial german town .
culture in germany is decentralized - it does n't always have to be berlin , hamburg or munich .
germany is an art trend-setter ; no other country has such a high density of museums and important exhibitions .
german art is also the most expensive .
there 's a saying in the art world : artworks above deck may come from the us , but the lingua franca in the engine room of art is german .
this summer of art also showed more than ever that it 's no longer just the classic , somewhat older , educated classes who are interested in art and the art boom - it 's becoming a mass phenomenon for young people .
sure , that 's also partly because of the insane sums that are paid for art these days and because artists are now as glamorous as pop or movie stars .
celebrities such as hirst long ago entered the yellow press , which also reports on what art which movie star has just bought at what price .
in short : art is chic .
but there 's more : the artist with all his quirks , unpredictability and fundamental refusal to conform has become an inspiring figure in times of a controlled and monitored world : look , i might lead a boring life , but a different one is also possible .
young people who are fascinated by fashion and style are inevitably also interested in modern art .
that 's happening despite the fact that art in search of provocation , art that tries to focus on complex theories of perception , art like that on display in kassel does n't make it easy for the audience .
the documenta makers have shown courage to ask the right questions and explain the context .
one has to conclude this summer art fairy tale by saying : it was n't beautiful .
it ca n't be beautiful .
but it helped .

23 , dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen comments that much of the bitter criticism of this year 's show misses the point . it was n't beautiful .
but beauty 's as important in the new world of art as vegetables are for a cannibal .
it 's all about changing viewing habits , connecting the dots and unleashing a tempest of perception .
medicine 's not meant to taste good - it only works if it tastes bitter , as the proverb goes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen the documenta 12 - the highlight of the 2007 art summer - was a complete success in that regard .
a badly stuffed giraffe from the west bank meant to signify the mideast conflict was on display , as was a sculpture made from old chinese doors that collapsed after a storm .
ai weiwei , the artist responsible , stayed cool and was thrilled that the price of his artwork had just doubled .
note : a glitch is also art .
and : art stems from communication .
it 's not a new but an important insight that art does not speak for itself - it has to be talked about .
the documenta began with great expectations .
some wrote that nothing less than an " artistic world revolution " was about to take place .
the revolution did n't happen - the documenta triggered angry protests , especially abroad .
it was called consternation kitsch , irrelevant , boring - a well-known british critic spoke of the worst exhibition he had ever seen .
this was partly due to the fact that the documenta curators intentionally did without the current art heroes , such as damien hirst or german superstars neo rauch and daniel richter , whose paintings are sold before they 've dried .
but was it a mistake not to invite celebrities ?
people may be upset about the theory overkill , but it actually elevates the makers of documenta : the attempt to distinguish oneself from the fashion of the art world , which turns everyone into a celebrity as soon as a russian oil magnate spends enormous sums on artists that nobody had heard of yesterday and that nobody will know tomorrow .
the documenta offered a massive repertoire with 500 often very political works by artists , also from africa , latin america and asia .
there was much to discover .
this year , changing viewing habits also were meant to be open for an african artist 's approach to the issue of migration or an argentine artist 's work on sexual violence .
a little note on the side : 50 percent of the artists on display were women , finally doing away with the prejudice that there are only a few good female artists .
it 's also interesting that this " worst exhibition " attracted more people than ever .
the fact that people from all over the world gathered in kassel alone is an experience - a cosmopolitan audience in a provincial german town .
culture in germany is decentralized - it does n't always have to be berlin , hamburg or munich .
germany is an art trend-setter ; no other country has such a high density of museums and important exhibitions .
german art is also the most expensive .
there 's a saying in the art world : artworks above deck may come from the us , but the lingua franca in the engine room of art is german .
this summer of art also showed more than ever that it 's no longer just the classic , somewhat older , educated classes who are interested in art and the art boom - it 's becoming a mass phenomenon for young people .
sure , that 's also partly because of the insane sums that are paid for art these days and because artists are now as glamorous as pop or movie stars .
celebrities such as hirst long ago entered the yellow press , which also reports on what art which movie star has just bought at what price .
in short : art is chic .
but there 's more : the artist with all his quirks , unpredictability and fundamental refusal to conform has become an inspiring figure in times of a controlled and monitored world : look , i might lead a boring life , but a different one is also possible .
young people who are fascinated by fashion and style are inevitably also interested in modern art .
that 's happening despite the fact that art in search of provocation , art that tries to focus on complex theories of perception , art like that on display in kassel does n't make it easy for the audience .
the documenta makers have shown courage to ask the right questions and explain the context .
one has to conclude this summer art fairy tale by saying : it was n't beautiful .
it ca n't be beautiful .
but it helped .

24 , where she 'll attend a un climate conference and speak before the world body 's general assembly for the first time . in her weekly video podcast , merkel said saturday that it was crucial for world leaders to reach an agreement on climate protection at a december summit on the indonesian island of bali .
the current kyoto protocol will expire in 2012 .
" we can all see that , in view of extreme weather situations , flooding and drought disasters , forest fires and famines , that climate change is a global task that concerns us all , " she said .
" the industrial states must take a higher responsibility in this , but developing countries also must do justice to their responsibility . "
will us sidestep negotiations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel manage to show bush the way to the un ?
merkel , a strong advocate of reaching an agreement within the un framework , added that new york and the un headquarters were the right places to discuss these issues .
us president george w. bush , who has refused to sign the kyoto protocol , is hosting his own conference on climate change in washington later in the week .
german climate activists called on merkel to do everything in her power to prevent the us from sidestepping the un negotiations .
" this trip is her first real test as self-proclaimed climate protector on the international scene , " brigitte behrens , the executive director of greenpeace germany , told german news agency dpa .

german business leaders meanwhile expressed concern about merkel 's push for more climate protection .
" merkel is endangering german jobs , " jürgen thumann , the president of the federation of german industries , said in the monday edition of german business magazine wirtschaftswoche .
thumann added that germany could do more to combat climate change by exporting state-of-the-art energy technologies .
the conference will be the biggest ever on climate control , with some 150 states and about 80 heads of state or government in attendance .
security council still sensitive issue bildunterschrift : will germany get a seat at this table ?
german government officials meanwhile have remained tight-lipped about whether merkel will address the issue of a permanent seat for germany in the un security council .
while her predecessor was very vocal about getting germany a place at the world 's top decision-making body , merkel is expected to express germany 's " readiness to take on responsibility . "
according to news reports , german officials have now said that they would be willing to accept an interim solution that would allow germany , india , japan , brazil and representatives from africa to join the security council for 10 to 15 years while a long-term solution is found .
meeting some , avoiding others bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will sit in this chair shortly after iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad merkel will also hold talks with a number of leaders during her visit to the un .
she is scheduled to meet with un secretary general ban ki moon and brazilian president lula da silva , among others .

while her predecessor was very vocal about getting germany a place at the world 's top decision-making body , merkel is expected to express germany 's " readiness to take on responsibility . "
according to news reports , german officials have now said that they would be willing to accept an interim solution that would allow germany , india , japan , brazil and representatives from africa to join the security council for 10 to 15 years while a long-term solution is found .

24 , where she 'll attend a un climate conference and speak before the world body 's general assembly for the first time . in her weekly video podcast , merkel said saturday that it was crucial for world leaders to reach an agreement on climate protection at a december summit on the indonesian island of bali .
the current kyoto protocol will expire in 2012 .
" we can all see that , in view of extreme weather situations , flooding and drought disasters , forest fires and famines , that climate change is a global task that concerns us all , " she said .
" the industrial states must take a higher responsibility in this , but developing countries also must do justice to their responsibility . "
will us sidestep negotiations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel manage to show bush the way to the un ?
merkel , a strong advocate of reaching an agreement within the un framework , added that new york and the un headquarters were the right places to discuss these issues .
us president george w. bush , who has refused to sign the kyoto protocol , is hosting his own conference on climate change in washington later in the week .
german climate activists called on merkel to do everything in her power to prevent the us from sidestepping the un negotiations .
" this trip is her first real test as self-proclaimed climate protector on the international scene , " brigitte behrens , the executive director of greenpeace germany , told german news agency dpa .

german business leaders meanwhile expressed concern about merkel 's push for more climate protection .
" merkel is endangering german jobs , " jürgen thumann , the president of the federation of german industries , said in the monday edition of german business magazine wirtschaftswoche .
thumann added that germany could do more to combat climate change by exporting state-of-the-art energy technologies .
the conference will be the biggest ever on climate control , with some 150 states and about 80 heads of state or government in attendance .

23 , dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen comments that much of the bitter criticism of this year 's show misses the point . it was n't beautiful .
but beauty 's as important in the new world of art as vegetables are for a cannibal .
it 's all about changing viewing habits , connecting the dots and unleashing a tempest of perception .
medicine 's not meant to taste good - it only works if it tastes bitter , as the proverb goes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen the documenta 12 - the highlight of the 2007 art summer - was a complete success in that regard .
a badly stuffed giraffe from the west bank meant to signify the mideast conflict was on display , as was a sculpture made from old chinese doors that collapsed after a storm .
ai weiwei , the artist responsible , stayed cool and was thrilled that the price of his artwork had just doubled .
note : a glitch is also art .
and : art stems from communication .
it 's not a new but an important insight that art does not speak for itself - it has to be talked about .
the documenta began with great expectations .
some wrote that nothing less than an " artistic world revolution " was about to take place .
the revolution did n't happen - the documenta triggered angry protests , especially abroad .
it was called consternation kitsch , irrelevant , boring - a well-known british critic spoke of the worst exhibition he had ever seen .
this was partly due to the fact that the documenta curators intentionally did without the current art heroes , such as damien hirst or german superstars neo rauch and daniel richter , whose paintings are sold before they 've dried .
but was it a mistake not to invite celebrities ?
people may be upset about the theory overkill , but it actually elevates the makers of documenta : the attempt to distinguish oneself from the fashion of the art world , which turns everyone into a celebrity as soon as a russian oil magnate spends enormous sums on artists that nobody had heard of yesterday and that nobody will know tomorrow .
the documenta offered a massive repertoire with 500 often very political works by artists , also from africa , latin america and asia .
there was much to discover .
this year , changing viewing habits also were meant to be open for an african artist 's approach to the issue of migration or an argentine artist 's work on sexual violence .
a little note on the side : 50 percent of the artists on display were women , finally doing away with the prejudice that there are only a few good female artists .
it 's also interesting that this " worst exhibition " attracted more people than ever .
the fact that people from all over the world gathered in kassel alone is an experience - a cosmopolitan audience in a provincial german town .
culture in germany is decentralized - it does n't always have to be berlin , hamburg or munich .
germany is an art trend-setter ; no other country has such a high density of museums and important exhibitions .
german art is also the most expensive .
there 's a saying in the art world : artworks above deck may come from the us , but the lingua franca in the engine room of art is german .
this summer of art also showed more than ever that it 's no longer just the classic , somewhat older , educated classes who are interested in art and the art boom - it 's becoming a mass phenomenon for young people .
sure , that 's also partly because of the insane sums that are paid for art these days and because artists are now as glamorous as pop or movie stars .
celebrities such as hirst long ago entered the yellow press , which also reports on what art which movie star has just bought at what price .
in short : art is chic .
but there 's more : the artist with all his quirks , unpredictability and fundamental refusal to conform has become an inspiring figure in times of a controlled and monitored world : look , i might lead a boring life , but a different one is also possible .
young people who are fascinated by fashion and style are inevitably also interested in modern art .
that 's happening despite the fact that art in search of provocation , art that tries to focus on complex theories of perception , art like that on display in kassel does n't make it easy for the audience .
the documenta makers have shown courage to ask the right questions and explain the context .
one has to conclude this summer art fairy tale by saying : it was n't beautiful .
it ca n't be beautiful .
but it helped .

23 , dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen comments that much of the bitter criticism of this year 's show misses the point . it was n't beautiful .
but beauty 's as important in the new world of art as vegetables are for a cannibal .
it 's all about changing viewing habits , connecting the dots and unleashing a tempest of perception .
medicine 's not meant to taste good - it only works if it tastes bitter , as the proverb goes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen the documenta 12 - the highlight of the 2007 art summer - was a complete success in that regard .
a badly stuffed giraffe from the west bank meant to signify the mideast conflict was on display , as was a sculpture made from old chinese doors that collapsed after a storm .
ai weiwei , the artist responsible , stayed cool and was thrilled that the price of his artwork had just doubled .
note : a glitch is also art .
and : art stems from communication .
it 's not a new but an important insight that art does not speak for itself - it has to be talked about .
the documenta began with great expectations .
some wrote that nothing less than an " artistic world revolution " was about to take place .
the revolution did n't happen - the documenta triggered angry protests , especially abroad .
it was called consternation kitsch , irrelevant , boring - a well-known british critic spoke of the worst exhibition he had ever seen .
this was partly due to the fact that the documenta curators intentionally did without the current art heroes , such as damien hirst or german superstars neo rauch and daniel richter , whose paintings are sold before they 've dried .
but was it a mistake not to invite celebrities ?
people may be upset about the theory overkill , but it actually elevates the makers of documenta : the attempt to distinguish oneself from the fashion of the art world , which turns everyone into a celebrity as soon as a russian oil magnate spends enormous sums on artists that nobody had heard of yesterday and that nobody will know tomorrow .
the documenta offered a massive repertoire with 500 often very political works by artists , also from africa , latin america and asia .
there was much to discover .
this year , changing viewing habits also were meant to be open for an african artist 's approach to the issue of migration or an argentine artist 's work on sexual violence .
a little note on the side : 50 percent of the artists on display were women , finally doing away with the prejudice that there are only a few good female artists .
it 's also interesting that this " worst exhibition " attracted more people than ever .
the fact that people from all over the world gathered in kassel alone is an experience - a cosmopolitan audience in a provincial german town .
culture in germany is decentralized - it does n't always have to be berlin , hamburg or munich .
germany is an art trend-setter ; no other country has such a high density of museums and important exhibitions .
german art is also the most expensive .
there 's a saying in the art world : artworks above deck may come from the us , but the lingua franca in the engine room of art is german .
this summer of art also showed more than ever that it 's no longer just the classic , somewhat older , educated classes who are interested in art and the art boom - it 's becoming a mass phenomenon for young people .
sure , that 's also partly because of the insane sums that are paid for art these days and because artists are now as glamorous as pop or movie stars .
celebrities such as hirst long ago entered the yellow press , which also reports on what art which movie star has just bought at what price .
in short : art is chic .
but there 's more : the artist with all his quirks , unpredictability and fundamental refusal to conform has become an inspiring figure in times of a controlled and monitored world : look , i might lead a boring life , but a different one is also possible .
young people who are fascinated by fashion and style are inevitably also interested in modern art .
that 's happening despite the fact that art in search of provocation , art that tries to focus on complex theories of perception , art like that on display in kassel does n't make it easy for the audience .
the documenta makers have shown courage to ask the right questions and explain the context .
one has to conclude this summer art fairy tale by saying : it was n't beautiful .
it ca n't be beautiful .

beijing cancelled two high-level meetings in apparent retaliation . in an attempt to assuage china 's anger at the meeting between merkel and the tibetan spiritual leader , merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen phoned china 's ambassador to germany to assure him of the chancellor 's desire to pursue close bilateral ties .

it should be possible without harming german-chinese ties , " german government spokesman thomas steg said at a press conference in berlin .

24 , a spokesman at germany 's foreign ministry , martin jäger , said berlin also called for the release of demonstrators taken into custody by police and that opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi should be released from house arrest .
the german government welcomed " the peaceful course of demonstrations " and noted its support for " any peaceful expression of opinions " in myanmar .
" if the government of myanmar is serious about its reform plans , then it must not prevent this expression of opinions , " jäger said at a news conference .
over the weekend and on monday , the protests that erupted five weeks ago escalated , with tens of thousands demonstrating on monday against 45 years of army rule .
it was the biggest protest since a student-led movement almost two decades ago which was crushed by the generals who control the nation of 53 million .
media reports say 100,000 people participated in monday 's demonstrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist monks on the march against the military goverment monks and nuns have recently been in the forefront of the protest movement , which began as civilian anger at last month 's sharp fuel price increases .
in the capital yangon , five columns of monks in maroon robes marched from the shwedagon pagoda , the devoutly buddhist country 's holiest shrine , to the city center where thousands of people filled five blocks .
myanmar 's 400,000 monks are revered by the public , posing a problem for the generals in how to handle the unrest .
detentions while the protests have been largely peaceful , a watchdog group on monday said the country 's military rulers have detained 218 people over the protests , sometimes subjecting them to beatings during interrogations .
" activists have not only been beaten while in detention , but have also been under extreme physical and mental torture , " bo kyi , head of the thailand-based assistance association for political prisoners -lrb- burma -rrb- , told the afp news agency .
once a political prisoner himself , bo kyi said 46 of those detained are being held in squalid conditions at a police base in yangon .
international rights groups have alleged that abuse and torture are common in myanmar 's prisons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many protesters have shouted support for detained democracy leader aung san suu kyi the country 's most famous detainee , democracy icon suu kyi , made her first appearance in public in four years on saturday , who has spent 12 of the last 18 years in some type of confinement .
she is now under house arrest .
news of her appearance spread rapidly and was seen initially as a sign the military was being flexible .
however , on sunday , police moved fire engines , police vans and dozens of police to the entrance of her street and refused to let a group of 200 marching monks through .
censorship and suppression journalists trying to cover the event have been the victims of government censorship and violence , according to reporters with borders and the burma media association .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi in 2003 in a press release , the two groups said the government was trying to prevent journalists from covering the protests and that there have been at least 24 " serious violations " of the freedom to report news and information since aug .
19 .
no visas have been granted to foreign journalists since the beginning of the demonstrations .
government media outlets , on the other hand , have accused foreign journalists of creating unrest .
they have described the protesters as violent agitators . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

24 , a spokesman at germany 's foreign ministry , martin jäger , said berlin also called for the release of demonstrators taken into custody by police and that opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi should be released from house arrest .
the german government welcomed " the peaceful course of demonstrations " and noted its support for " any peaceful expression of opinions " in myanmar .
" if the government of myanmar is serious about its reform plans , then it must not prevent this expression of opinions , " jäger said at a news conference .
over the weekend and on monday , the protests that erupted five weeks ago escalated , with tens of thousands demonstrating on monday against 45 years of army rule .
it was the biggest protest since a student-led movement almost two decades ago which was crushed by the generals who control the nation of 53 million .
media reports say 100,000 people participated in monday 's demonstrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist monks on the march against the military goverment monks and nuns have recently been in the forefront of the protest movement , which began as civilian anger at last month 's sharp fuel price increases .
in the capital yangon , five columns of monks in maroon robes marched from the shwedagon pagoda , the devoutly buddhist country 's holiest shrine , to the city center where thousands of people filled five blocks .
myanmar 's 400,000 monks are revered by the public , posing a problem for the generals in how to handle the unrest .
detentions while the protests have been largely peaceful , a watchdog group on monday said the country 's military rulers have detained 218 people over the protests , sometimes subjecting them to beatings during interrogations .
" activists have not only been beaten while in detention , but have also been under extreme physical and mental torture , " bo kyi , head of the thailand-based assistance association for political prisoners -lrb- burma -rrb- , told the afp news agency .
once a political prisoner himself , bo kyi said 46 of those detained are being held in squalid conditions at a police base in yangon .
international rights groups have alleged that abuse and torture are common in myanmar 's prisons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many protesters have shouted support for detained democracy leader aung san suu kyi the country 's most famous detainee , democracy icon suu kyi , made her first appearance in public in four years on saturday , who has spent 12 of the last 18 years in some type of confinement .
she is now under house arrest .
news of her appearance spread rapidly and was seen initially as a sign the military was being flexible .
however , on sunday , police moved fire engines , police vans and dozens of police to the entrance of her street and refused to let a group of 200 marching monks through .
censorship and suppression journalists trying to cover the event have been the victims of government censorship and violence , according to reporters with borders and the burma media association .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi in 2003 in a press release , the two groups said the government was trying to prevent journalists from covering the protests and that there have been at least 24 " serious violations " of the freedom to report news and information since aug .
19 .
no visas have been granted to foreign journalists since the beginning of the demonstrations .
government media outlets , on the other hand , have accused foreign journalists of creating unrest .
they have described the protesters as violent agitators . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

media reports say 100,000 people participated in monday 's demonstrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist monks on the march against the military goverment monks and nuns have recently been in the forefront of the protest movement , which began as civilian anger at last month 's sharp fuel price increases .

24 , that the net wages of german workers fell last year to their lowest level in 20 years .
the average net pay check - after the deduction of taxes , social contributions and taking into account price developments in the past year - amounted to 15,845 euros -lrb- $ 22,357 -rrb- , the paper said .
that was almost the same as in 1986 , when the average net salary was 15,785 euros .
the report said that german workers paid record levels of income tax and social contributions on their gross wages last year - an average of 9,291 euros .
that marked an increase of 66 percent from 1986 .
however , over the same period , gross wages rose by just 48 percent , the paper wrote , from 22,333 euros in 1986 to 33,105 in 2006 .
inflation to blame inflation is largely to blame for the fact that workers are taking home less pay despite rising gross wages , statistics showed .
while salaries increased by 4.1 percent over the past five years , prices for the same period shot up by 7.1 percent .
" the rise in gross salaries is comparatively low because companies have shaved off extra perks such as vacation- and christmas pay , " rudolf hickel , director of the iaw told bild .
" in addition , prices are rising as are social contributions and taxes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german economy is experiencing a boom the report comes at a time when the german economy , the biggest in the euro zone , is experiencing a robust recovery after years in the doldrums and companies have begun a hiring offensive .
calls for minimum wage michael sommer , head of the dgb german trade union federation , criticized the steady decline in net wages as illustrated by the statistics .
" we need urgent action for the ' common man on the street ' - over the past years , their wallets have been emptied , " sommer told the newspaper .
the trade union leader renewed calls for introducing a national minimum wage of at least 7,50 euros an hour .
last week , german chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet agreed on legislation that paves the way for basic rates of pay for postal workers , a move that extends the industries covered by statutory pay levels without introducing a national minimum wage .
minimum wages currently apply only to the building industry and to some cleaners . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

23 , dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen comments that much of the bitter criticism of this year 's show misses the point . it was n't beautiful .
but beauty 's as important in the new world of art as vegetables are for a cannibal .
it 's all about changing viewing habits , connecting the dots and unleashing a tempest of perception .
medicine 's not meant to taste good - it only works if it tastes bitter , as the proverb goes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen the documenta 12 - the highlight of the 2007 art summer - was a complete success in that regard .
a badly stuffed giraffe from the west bank meant to signify the mideast conflict was on display , as was a sculpture made from old chinese doors that collapsed after a storm .
ai weiwei , the artist responsible , stayed cool and was thrilled that the price of his artwork had just doubled .
note : a glitch is also art .
and : art stems from communication .
it 's not a new but an important insight that art does not speak for itself - it has to be talked about .
the documenta began with great expectations .
some wrote that nothing less than an " artistic world revolution " was about to take place .
the revolution did n't happen - the documenta triggered angry protests , especially abroad .
it was called consternation kitsch , irrelevant , boring - a well-known british critic spoke of the worst exhibition he had ever seen .
this was partly due to the fact that the documenta curators intentionally did without the current art heroes , such as damien hirst or german superstars neo rauch and daniel richter , whose paintings are sold before they 've dried .
but was it a mistake not to invite celebrities ?
people may be upset about the theory overkill , but it actually elevates the makers of documenta : the attempt to distinguish oneself from the fashion of the art world , which turns everyone into a celebrity as soon as a russian oil magnate spends enormous sums on artists that nobody had heard of yesterday and that nobody will know tomorrow .
the documenta offered a massive repertoire with 500 often very political works by artists , also from africa , latin america and asia .
there was much to discover .
this year , changing viewing habits also were meant to be open for an african artist 's approach to the issue of migration or an argentine artist 's work on sexual violence .
a little note on the side : 50 percent of the artists on display were women , finally doing away with the prejudice that there are only a few good female artists .
it 's also interesting that this " worst exhibition " attracted more people than ever .
the fact that people from all over the world gathered in kassel alone is an experience - a cosmopolitan audience in a provincial german town .
culture in germany is decentralized - it does n't always have to be berlin , hamburg or munich .
germany is an art trend-setter ; no other country has such a high density of museums and important exhibitions .
german art is also the most expensive .
there 's a saying in the art world : artworks above deck may come from the us , but the lingua franca in the engine room of art is german .
this summer of art also showed more than ever that it 's no longer just the classic , somewhat older , educated classes who are interested in art and the art boom - it 's becoming a mass phenomenon for young people .
sure , that 's also partly because of the insane sums that are paid for art these days and because artists are now as glamorous as pop or movie stars .
celebrities such as hirst long ago entered the yellow press , which also reports on what art which movie star has just bought at what price .
in short : art is chic .
but there 's more : the artist with all his quirks , unpredictability and fundamental refusal to conform has become an inspiring figure in times of a controlled and monitored world : look , i might lead a boring life , but a different one is also possible .
young people who are fascinated by fashion and style are inevitably also interested in modern art .
that 's happening despite the fact that art in search of provocation , art that tries to focus on complex theories of perception , art like that on display in kassel does n't make it easy for the audience .
the documenta makers have shown courage to ask the right questions and explain the context .
one has to conclude this summer art fairy tale by saying : it was n't beautiful .
it ca n't be beautiful .
but it helped .

23 , dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen comments that much of the bitter criticism of this year 's show misses the point . it was n't beautiful .
but beauty 's as important in the new world of art as vegetables are for a cannibal .
it 's all about changing viewing habits , connecting the dots and unleashing a tempest of perception .
medicine 's not meant to taste good - it only works if it tastes bitter , as the proverb goes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen the documenta 12 - the highlight of the 2007 art summer - was a complete success in that regard .
a badly stuffed giraffe from the west bank meant to signify the mideast conflict was on display , as was a sculpture made from old chinese doors that collapsed after a storm .
ai weiwei , the artist responsible , stayed cool and was thrilled that the price of his artwork had just doubled .
note : a glitch is also art .
and : art stems from communication .
it 's not a new but an important insight that art does not speak for itself - it has to be talked about .
the documenta began with great expectations .
some wrote that nothing less than an " artistic world revolution " was about to take place .
the revolution did n't happen - the documenta triggered angry protests , especially abroad .
it was called consternation kitsch , irrelevant , boring - a well-known british critic spoke of the worst exhibition he had ever seen .
this was partly due to the fact that the documenta curators intentionally did without the current art heroes , such as damien hirst or german superstars neo rauch and daniel richter , whose paintings are sold before they 've dried .
but was it a mistake not to invite celebrities ?
people may be upset about the theory overkill , but it actually elevates the makers of documenta : the attempt to distinguish oneself from the fashion of the art world , which turns everyone into a celebrity as soon as a russian oil magnate spends enormous sums on artists that nobody had heard of yesterday and that nobody will know tomorrow .
the documenta offered a massive repertoire with 500 often very political works by artists , also from africa , latin america and asia .
there was much to discover .
this year , changing viewing habits also were meant to be open for an african artist 's approach to the issue of migration or an argentine artist 's work on sexual violence .
a little note on the side : 50 percent of the artists on display were women , finally doing away with the prejudice that there are only a few good female artists .
it 's also interesting that this " worst exhibition " attracted more people than ever .
the fact that people from all over the world gathered in kassel alone is an experience - a cosmopolitan audience in a provincial german town .
culture in germany is decentralized - it does n't always have to be berlin , hamburg or munich .
germany is an art trend-setter ; no other country has such a high density of museums and important exhibitions .
german art is also the most expensive .
there 's a saying in the art world : artworks above deck may come from the us , but the lingua franca in the engine room of art is german .
this summer of art also showed more than ever that it 's no longer just the classic , somewhat older , educated classes who are interested in art and the art boom - it 's becoming a mass phenomenon for young people .
sure , that 's also partly because of the insane sums that are paid for art these days and because artists are now as glamorous as pop or movie stars .
celebrities such as hirst long ago entered the yellow press , which also reports on what art which movie star has just bought at what price .
in short : art is chic .
but there 's more : the artist with all his quirks , unpredictability and fundamental refusal to conform has become an inspiring figure in times of a controlled and monitored world : look , i might lead a boring life , but a different one is also possible .
young people who are fascinated by fashion and style are inevitably also interested in modern art .
that 's happening despite the fact that art in search of provocation , art that tries to focus on complex theories of perception , art like that on display in kassel does n't make it easy for the audience .
the documenta makers have shown courage to ask the right questions and explain the context .
one has to conclude this summer art fairy tale by saying : it was n't beautiful .
it ca n't be beautiful .

24 , after chancellor angela merkel 's visit with the dalai lama angered china .
beijing cancelled two high-level meetings in apparent retaliation . in an attempt to assuage china 's anger at the meeting between merkel and the tibetan spiritual leader , merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen phoned china 's ambassador to germany to assure him of the chancellor 's desire to pursue close bilateral ties . " he called the chinese ambassador in berlin today to inform him about the talks with the dalai lama but also to make clear that this conversation is something totally natural .
it should be possible without harming german-chinese ties , " german government spokesman thomas steg said at a press conference in berlin . " heusgen assured the ambassador that we share great interest in continuing , intensifying and promoting our good ties with china , " steg said , saying that he believed these would not suffer serious damage as a result of sunday 's unprecedented meeting . however , he added that merkel believes " human rights can not be sacrificed for economic reasons . " cancellations berlin announced on monday that beijing had called off a standing breakfast meeting between the countries ' foreign ministers in new york on the sidelines of the annual un general assembly because of " scheduling difficulties . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese-german relations have taken a hit , but not likely a serious one , experts say justice minister brigitte zypries was stood up by chinese officials on sunday at a bilateral justice forum , but she said she was also trying to reschedule and mitigate diplomatic fallout . " we hope that this dialog will not suffer lasting damage , " she said . foreign affairs spokesman martin jäger said berlin is trying to find a suitable time for a meeting in new york between foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his chinese counterpart yang jiechi this week . " we have heard from the chinese side that this breakfast will not be able to take place this year because of time constraints , " jäger said . cultural autonomy merkel signaled that she supported the dalai lama 's quest for cultural autonomy for the himalayan region , sticking to the course she steered during a visit to china in august in which she readily tackled human rights issues . tibet has been under chinese authority since the mid-1700s .
it had varying degrees of autonomy until the chinese communist party arrived in 1950 .
after a failed revolt by tibetans against the chinese in 1959 , the dalai lama fled to india . he has repeatedly called for tibetan self-rule . saving face ? frank umbach , the head of the research unit on china at the german council on foreign relations , told the news agency afp that beijing 's indignant response could prove to be a storm in a teacup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin says it wants close bilateral ties , despite differences over tibet " it is very important for china to save face , and the reaction is hardly surprising if you take into account china 's track record in such cases , " he said , referring to china 's stance toward france in the 1990s when it sold weaponry to taiwan .
he did not think there would be lasting damage from the incident . " merkel has been very consistent and predictable on human rights towards china and also russia , " he said .
" and over the past two years , there has been a 180-degree turn among european union members and a new consensus has emerged . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

23 , dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen comments that much of the bitter criticism of this year 's show misses the point . it was n't beautiful .
but beauty 's as important in the new world of art as vegetables are for a cannibal .
it 's all about changing viewing habits , connecting the dots and unleashing a tempest of perception .
medicine 's not meant to taste good - it only works if it tastes bitter , as the proverb goes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen the documenta 12 - the highlight of the 2007 art summer - was a complete success in that regard .
a badly stuffed giraffe from the west bank meant to signify the mideast conflict was on display , as was a sculpture made from old chinese doors that collapsed after a storm .
ai weiwei , the artist responsible , stayed cool and was thrilled that the price of his artwork had just doubled .
note : a glitch is also art .
and : art stems from communication .
it 's not a new but an important insight that art does not speak for itself - it has to be talked about .
the documenta began with great expectations .
some wrote that nothing less than an " artistic world revolution " was about to take place .
the revolution did n't happen - the documenta triggered angry protests , especially abroad .
it was called consternation kitsch , irrelevant , boring - a well-known british critic spoke of the worst exhibition he had ever seen .
this was partly due to the fact that the documenta curators intentionally did without the current art heroes , such as damien hirst or german superstars neo rauch and daniel richter , whose paintings are sold before they 've dried .
but was it a mistake not to invite celebrities ?
people may be upset about the theory overkill , but it actually elevates the makers of documenta : the attempt to distinguish oneself from the fashion of the art world , which turns everyone into a celebrity as soon as a russian oil magnate spends enormous sums on artists that nobody had heard of yesterday and that nobody will know tomorrow .
the documenta offered a massive repertoire with 500 often very political works by artists , also from africa , latin america and asia .
there was much to discover .
this year , changing viewing habits also were meant to be open for an african artist 's approach to the issue of migration or an argentine artist 's work on sexual violence .
a little note on the side : 50 percent of the artists on display were women , finally doing away with the prejudice that there are only a few good female artists .
it 's also interesting that this " worst exhibition " attracted more people than ever .
the fact that people from all over the world gathered in kassel alone is an experience - a cosmopolitan audience in a provincial german town .
culture in germany is decentralized - it does n't always have to be berlin , hamburg or munich .
germany is an art trend-setter ; no other country has such a high density of museums and important exhibitions .
german art is also the most expensive .
there 's a saying in the art world : artworks above deck may come from the us , but the lingua franca in the engine room of art is german .
this summer of art also showed more than ever that it 's no longer just the classic , somewhat older , educated classes who are interested in art and the art boom - it 's becoming a mass phenomenon for young people .
sure , that 's also partly because of the insane sums that are paid for art these days and because artists are now as glamorous as pop or movie stars .
celebrities such as hirst long ago entered the yellow press , which also reports on what art which movie star has just bought at what price .
in short : art is chic .
but there 's more : the artist with all his quirks , unpredictability and fundamental refusal to conform has become an inspiring figure in times of a controlled and monitored world : look , i might lead a boring life , but a different one is also possible .
young people who are fascinated by fashion and style are inevitably also interested in modern art .
that 's happening despite the fact that art in search of provocation , art that tries to focus on complex theories of perception , art like that on display in kassel does n't make it easy for the audience .
the documenta makers have shown courage to ask the right questions and explain the context .
one has to conclude this summer art fairy tale by saying : it was n't beautiful .
it ca n't be beautiful .
but it helped .

23 , dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen comments that much of the bitter criticism of this year 's show misses the point . it was n't beautiful .
but beauty 's as important in the new world of art as vegetables are for a cannibal .
it 's all about changing viewing habits , connecting the dots and unleashing a tempest of perception .
medicine 's not meant to taste good - it only works if it tastes bitter , as the proverb goes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen the documenta 12 - the highlight of the 2007 art summer - was a complete success in that regard .
a badly stuffed giraffe from the west bank meant to signify the mideast conflict was on display , as was a sculpture made from old chinese doors that collapsed after a storm .
ai weiwei , the artist responsible , stayed cool and was thrilled that the price of his artwork had just doubled .
note : a glitch is also art .
and : art stems from communication .
it 's not a new but an important insight that art does not speak for itself - it has to be talked about .
the documenta began with great expectations .
some wrote that nothing less than an " artistic world revolution " was about to take place .
the revolution did n't happen - the documenta triggered angry protests , especially abroad .
it was called consternation kitsch , irrelevant , boring - a well-known british critic spoke of the worst exhibition he had ever seen .
this was partly due to the fact that the documenta curators intentionally did without the current art heroes , such as damien hirst or german superstars neo rauch and daniel richter , whose paintings are sold before they 've dried .
but was it a mistake not to invite celebrities ?
people may be upset about the theory overkill , but it actually elevates the makers of documenta : the attempt to distinguish oneself from the fashion of the art world , which turns everyone into a celebrity as soon as a russian oil magnate spends enormous sums on artists that nobody had heard of yesterday and that nobody will know tomorrow .
the documenta offered a massive repertoire with 500 often very political works by artists , also from africa , latin america and asia .
there was much to discover .
this year , changing viewing habits also were meant to be open for an african artist 's approach to the issue of migration or an argentine artist 's work on sexual violence .
a little note on the side : 50 percent of the artists on display were women , finally doing away with the prejudice that there are only a few good female artists .
it 's also interesting that this " worst exhibition " attracted more people than ever .
the fact that people from all over the world gathered in kassel alone is an experience - a cosmopolitan audience in a provincial german town .
culture in germany is decentralized - it does n't always have to be berlin , hamburg or munich .

24 , a spokesman at germany 's foreign ministry , martin jäger , said berlin also called for the release of demonstrators taken into custody by police and that opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi should be released from house arrest .
the german government welcomed " the peaceful course of demonstrations " and noted its support for " any peaceful expression of opinions " in myanmar .
" if the government of myanmar is serious about its reform plans , then it must not prevent this expression of opinions , " jäger said at a news conference .
over the weekend and on monday , the protests that erupted five weeks ago escalated , with tens of thousands demonstrating on monday against 45 years of army rule .
it was the biggest protest since a student-led movement almost two decades ago which was crushed by the generals who control the nation of 53 million .
media reports say 100,000 people participated in monday 's demonstrations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buddhist monks on the march against the military goverment monks and nuns have recently been in the forefront of the protest movement , which began as civilian anger at last month 's sharp fuel price increases .
in the capital yangon , five columns of monks in maroon robes marched from the shwedagon pagoda , the devoutly buddhist country 's holiest shrine , to the city center where thousands of people filled five blocks .
myanmar 's 400,000 monks are revered by the public , posing a problem for the generals in how to handle the unrest .
detentions while the protests have been largely peaceful , a watchdog group on monday said the country 's military rulers have detained 218 people over the protests , sometimes subjecting them to beatings during interrogations .
" activists have not only been beaten while in detention , but have also been under extreme physical and mental torture , " bo kyi , head of the thailand-based assistance association for political prisoners -lrb- burma -rrb- , told the afp news agency .
once a political prisoner himself , bo kyi said 46 of those detained are being held in squalid conditions at a police base in yangon .

she is now under house arrest .
news of her appearance spread rapidly and was seen initially as a sign the military was being flexible .
however , on sunday , police moved fire engines , police vans and dozens of police to the entrance of her street and refused to let a group of 200 marching monks through .
censorship and suppression journalists trying to cover the event have been the victims of government censorship and violence , according to reporters with borders and the burma media association .

24 , a spokesman at germany 's foreign ministry , martin jäger , said berlin also called for the release of demonstrators taken into custody by police and that opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi should be released from house arrest .
the german government welcomed " the peaceful course of demonstrations " and noted its support for " any peaceful expression of opinions " in myanmar .
" if the government of myanmar is serious about its reform plans , then it must not prevent this expression of opinions , " jäger said at a news conference .
over the weekend and on monday , the protests that erupted five weeks ago escalated , with tens of thousands demonstrating on monday against 45 years of army rule .

24 , after chancellor angela merkel 's visit with the dalai lama angered china .
beijing cancelled two high-level meetings in apparent retaliation . in an attempt to assuage china 's anger at the meeting between merkel and the tibetan spiritual leader , merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen phoned china 's ambassador to germany to assure him of the chancellor 's desire to pursue close bilateral ties . " he called the chinese ambassador in berlin today to inform him about the talks with the dalai lama but also to make clear that this conversation is something totally natural .

24 , that the net wages of german workers fell last year to their lowest level in 20 years .
the average net pay check - after the deduction of taxes , social contributions and taking into account price developments in the past year - amounted to 15,845 euros -lrb- $ 22,357 -rrb- , the paper said .
that was almost the same as in 1986 , when the average net salary was 15,785 euros .
the report said that german workers paid record levels of income tax and social contributions on their gross wages last year - an average of 9,291 euros .
that marked an increase of 66 percent from 1986 .
however , over the same period , gross wages rose by just 48 percent , the paper wrote , from 22,333 euros in 1986 to 33,105 in 2006 .
inflation to blame inflation is largely to blame for the fact that workers are taking home less pay despite rising gross wages , statistics showed .
while salaries increased by 4.1 percent over the past five years , prices for the same period shot up by 7.1 percent .
" the rise in gross salaries is comparatively low because companies have shaved off extra perks such as vacation- and christmas pay , " rudolf hickel , director of the iaw told bild .
" in addition , prices are rising as are social contributions and taxes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german economy is experiencing a boom the report comes at a time when the german economy , the biggest in the euro zone , is experiencing a robust recovery after years in the doldrums and companies have begun a hiring offensive .
calls for minimum wage michael sommer , head of the dgb german trade union federation , criticized the steady decline in net wages as illustrated by the statistics .
" we need urgent action for the ' common man on the street ' - over the past years , their wallets have been emptied , " sommer told the newspaper .
the trade union leader renewed calls for introducing a national minimum wage of at least 7,50 euros an hour .
last week , german chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet agreed on legislation that paves the way for basic rates of pay for postal workers , a move that extends the industries covered by statutory pay levels without introducing a national minimum wage .

no wonder then that the work is set off with warlike sounds : a continuously returning atmosphere that resolves into a nirvana-like happy ending at the end of the second movement .
the course of the symphony gives away much about gundermann 's development as a composer , such as his stays in beijing or new york , where the focus was movie music and multimedia .

24 , after chancellor angela merkel 's visit with the dalai lama angered china .
beijing cancelled two high-level meetings in apparent retaliation . in an attempt to assuage china 's anger at the meeting between merkel and the tibetan spiritual leader , merkel 's foreign policy advisor christoph heusgen phoned china 's ambassador to germany to assure him of the chancellor 's desire to pursue close bilateral ties . " he called the chinese ambassador in berlin today to inform him about the talks with the dalai lama but also to make clear that this conversation is something totally natural .
it should be possible without harming german-chinese ties , " german government spokesman thomas steg said at a press conference in berlin . " heusgen assured the ambassador that we share great interest in continuing , intensifying and promoting our good ties with china , " steg said , saying that he believed these would not suffer serious damage as a result of sunday 's unprecedented meeting . however , he added that merkel believes " human rights can not be sacrificed for economic reasons . " cancellations berlin announced on monday that beijing had called off a standing breakfast meeting between the countries ' foreign ministers in new york on the sidelines of the annual un general assembly because of " scheduling difficulties . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese-german relations have taken a hit , but not likely a serious one , experts say justice minister brigitte zypries was stood up by chinese officials on sunday at a bilateral justice forum , but she said she was also trying to reschedule and mitigate diplomatic fallout . " we hope that this dialog will not suffer lasting damage , " she said . foreign affairs spokesman martin jäger said berlin is trying to find a suitable time for a meeting in new york between foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his chinese counterpart yang jiechi this week . " we have heard from the chinese side that this breakfast will not be able to take place this year because of time constraints , " jäger said . cultural autonomy merkel signaled that she supported the dalai lama 's quest for cultural autonomy for the himalayan region , sticking to the course she steered during a visit to china in august in which she readily tackled human rights issues . tibet has been under chinese authority since the mid-1700s .
it had varying degrees of autonomy until the chinese communist party arrived in 1950 .
after a failed revolt by tibetans against the chinese in 1959 , the dalai lama fled to india . he has repeatedly called for tibetan self-rule . saving face ? frank umbach , the head of the research unit on china at the german council on foreign relations , told the news agency afp that beijing 's indignant response could prove to be a storm in a teacup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin says it wants close bilateral ties , despite differences over tibet " it is very important for china to save face , and the reaction is hardly surprising if you take into account china 's track record in such cases , " he said , referring to china 's stance toward france in the 1990s when it sold weaponry to taiwan .
he did not think there would be lasting damage from the incident . " merkel has been very consistent and predictable on human rights towards china and also russia , " he said .
" and over the past two years , there has been a 180-degree turn among european union members and a new consensus has emerged . " dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that was the word on everyone 's lips .
the quartet of middle east mediators - the us , russia , the eu and the un - are seizing on the possibility that for the first time since the collapse of former us president bill clinton 's camp david talks seven years ago there could , just could , be an opening towards peace .
the quartet , and their special envoy , former british prime minister tony blair , remained , deliberately , very cautious indeed but there is at least a sense of a path towards peace that does not look utterly blocked .
warnings tony blair said he wanted to put hope back in the middle east peace process in an " ambitious but achievable " effort to help build a palestinian state .
we all have to take risks ... -lsb- or -rsb- peace will slip further into the future ... perhaps by up to five years javier solana , eu foreign policy chief mr blair stressed the need for palestinians to create the institutions of " a serious well-functioning state " - good government , security forces and a legal and judicial system that would give hope " to ordinary people on both sides that things are going to improve " .
so russia , the eu and the un offered strong support for us secretary of state condoleezza rice and for the international meeting called for november by president george w bush .
ms rice stressed that all the key issues could be discussed and that arab states , including syria , would be among those invited .
but she also called on syria to renounce the use of violence and to accept that the purpose of an international meeting was to support israel and the palestinians in seeking a " two state solution " .
as usual from the quartet , considerable effort went into balancing pressures on , and criticism of , both the israeli and palestinian sides .
so warnings to israel : " the quartet expressed concern over conditions in gaza .
it agreed on the importance of continued emergency and humanitarian assistance without obstruction . "
and a warning to the palestinians : " the quartet further noted its grave concern over the continued rocket fire from gaza into israel . "
work together just before the meeting , the eu foreign policy chief , javier solana , one of the quartet members , told me that the next few months represented " a rare opportunity " .
" we all have to take risks , " he said , while cautioning against too much optimism .
mr solana warned that if this chance was missed , things would not just stay as they were .
" peace will slip further into the future ... perhaps by up to five years , " he said .
the thrust of the meeting , and of mr blair 's first appearance as envoy was clear : let 's all work together to give peace a chance .

but now the welsh assembly government is working on a new strategy which involves working with nature rather than against it .
this may involve some areas being flooded in order to protect other communities .
environment minister jane davidson has ordered a fresh look at policy in the wake of flooding this summer .
she has ordered a three-year programme to refresh flooding policy , with the aim of developing a new strategy which involves " working with nature , rather than against it " .
" the trigger for it was having the latest evidence which suggests that within the next 100 years sea levels will rise by 1 metre and there will be a 20 % increase in flooding risk , " she tells bbc wales ' eye on wales programme .
she said that one solution would be to look to countries like malaysia as an example and use playing fields as storage ponds in the event of flooding .
" when we see over the last few years that we 're already seeing small increases in flooding risk - every single one of those is a devastation for the community and individual involved , " she added . "
temporary flood storage has obvious potential , but this needs to be planned - and quite honestly , well reward " dafydd jarrett , nfu cymru but she warned : " if we 're going to have the kind of sea-level rise that is predicted , we will not be able to build walls high enough to tackle those issues effectively .
" so what we have to do is use the land to our advantage .
and it might mean sometimes that we have to allow some areas to flood in order to ensure that bigger communities further down a river do n't flood . "
roger falconer , professor of water management at cardiff university , said wales has much to learn in the area of flood risk management .
he said wales could look to the example of tropical countries like malaysia where massive , localised storms are common and they have been managing floods for decades , if not centuries .
prof falconer said : " they have large areas of playing fields , for example , which are converted into storage ponds so that when the flood comes the water goes into the storage pond . "
he said the sample principle could be adapted in wales .
' solution ' " if you look at the playing fields along the taff in cardiff , we could actually create embankments around those at a relatively low cost to turn those into flood management facilities and absorb quite a lot of the flow coming down the river . "
however , dafydd jarrett , a policy advisor for the national farmers union -lrb- nfu -rrb- cymru , said the prospect of a move towards flood risk management could be of concern .

but now the welsh assembly government is working on a new strategy which involves working with nature rather than against it .
this may involve some areas being flooded in order to protect other communities .
environment minister jane davidson has ordered a fresh look at policy in the wake of flooding this summer .
she has ordered a three-year programme to refresh flooding policy , with the aim of developing a new strategy which involves " working with nature , rather than against it " .
" the trigger for it was having the latest evidence which suggests that within the next 100 years sea levels will rise by 1 metre and there will be a 20 % increase in flooding risk , " she tells bbc wales ' eye on wales programme .
she said that one solution would be to look to countries like malaysia as an example and use playing fields as storage ponds in the event of flooding .
" when we see over the last few years that we 're already seeing small increases in flooding risk - every single one of those is a devastation for the community and individual involved , " she added .
temporary flood storage has obvious potential , but this needs to be planned - and quite honestly , well reward dafydd jarrett , nfu cymru but she warned : " if we 're going to have the kind of sea-level rise that is predicted , we will not be able to build walls high enough to tackle those issues effectively .
" so what we have to do is use the land to our advantage .
and it might mean sometimes that we have to allow some areas to flood in order to ensure that bigger communities further down a river do n't flood . "
roger falconer , professor of water management at cardiff university , said wales has much to learn in the area of flood risk management .
he said wales could look to the example of tropical countries like malaysia where massive , localised storms are common and they have been managing floods for decades , if not centuries .
prof falconer said : " they have large areas of playing fields , for example , which are converted into storage ponds so that when the flood comes the water goes into the storage pond . "
he said the sample principle could be adapted in wales .
' solution ' " if you look at the playing fields along the taff in cardiff , we could actually create embankments around those at a relatively low cost to turn those into flood management facilities and absorb quite a lot of the flow coming down the river . "
however , dafydd jarrett , a policy advisor for the national farmers union -lrb- nfu -rrb- cymru , said the prospect of a move towards flood risk management could be of concern .

their annual financial results to 31 may 2007 show that income soared 46 % to £ 200.8m , up from £ 137.2m a year before .
match income is now put at £ 3.1m a game , with total match income over the past year coming to £ 90.6m.
however , tv revenues were down on 2005/06 , when the club reached the champions league final , by £ 10m .
the figures also showed that arsenal 's operating profits before player trading and exceptional items was £ 51.2m , up from £ 13.7m the previous year .
arsenal chairman peter hill-wood said : " the best way that arsenal can continue to deliver success is by maintaining a business that pays its own way .
mihir bose blog arsenal insist there has never been a problem for manager arsene wenger if he wants to go into the transfer market bbc sports editor mihir bose " this philosophy helped establish our objectives for the club 's move away from highbury , and emirates stadium now provides arsenal with the increased income , profitability , cash generation and firm financial foundations from which we will continue to build trophy-winning arsenal teams for many years to come . "
arsenal 's income for 2006/07 moves it close to real madrid , whose turnover was £ 202m for the 2005-06 season .
and more than 90 % of the housing units at " the stadium - highbury square " development at their former stadium are already pre-sold , with final completion sales expected to comfortably exceed £ 300m .

the carmaker wants staff to give up some of their expensive benefits such as pensions and health insurance .
in return the union wants gm to commit to maintaining production in the us .
if no agreement is reached , and the union receives to assurances on job security , it has threatened that 73,000 gm factory workers will go on strike .
" we 're shocked and disappointed that general motors has failed to recognize and appreciate what our membership has contributed during the past four years , " said uaw president ron gettelfinger in a statement .
gm 's 73,000 uaw employees saw their contracts expire on friday , 14 september .
the talks are important because the uaw 's contracts with ford and chrysler will be based on the gm agreement .
the three detroit-based carmakers are trying to cut costs as they attempt to recover from combined losses of $ 15bn -lrb- £ 7.5bn -rrb- last year .
gm , ford and chrysler say that their workers , on average , cost them more than $ 30 an hour more than toyota 's .
" we are fully committed to working with the uaw to develop solutions together , " gm spokesman dan flores said .
" we will continue focusing our efforts to reach an agreement as soon as possible . "
the talks deadline has been set at 11am local time -lrb- 1500 gmt -rrb- .

picture by iain maclean the cromarty firth is steeped in legends of giants .
according to local myth , north and south sutor were two who lived on the distinctive headlands that mark the entrance to the firth .
however , the nigg fabrication yard on its northern shores was a true giant in terms of employment and the economy .
highland council is leading a series of talks on how to breathe new life into the rundown site before it falls into disrepair .
the yard was built during the 1970s to service the construction and repair of north sea oil and gas rigs and platforms .
it is a sprawling 238 acres -lrb- 96.14 hectares -rrb- site of monstrous warehouses , a dry dock and quayside .
at its height , according to highland council figures , the yard provided for 5,000 highly paid jobs and was worth £ 100m-a-year to the highlands economy .
but its success was closely tied to the oil and gas boom of the 1970s and 80s and most of the site has stood empty since 2002 .
it was offered for sale in 2005 .
the yard has been in an almost complete state of limbo since .
a report by highland council 's director of planning , john rennilson , presented to councillors in august outlined the sticking points .
firth of giants the sutors of myth were shoemakers who shared tools by throwing them to each other across the narrow entrance to the firth .
they were also said to have watched over the village of cromarty in the 1900s the firth and the port of invergordon became a base for royal navy warships and played an important role during world war i offshore wind turbines put together at nigg stretch to 146m -lrb- 479ft -rrb- from the tip of a blade to the base under the sea .
he said it was understood that kbr construction , a subsidiary of the us group haliburton , own the northern part of the site - including the oil terminal .
it also holds the long-term lease for the southern part from the wakelyn trust .
mr rennilson said kbr appeared to have no remaining commercial interest in the yard and terminal and advertised these parts for sale .
the cromarty firth port authority -lrb- cfpa -rrb- was appointed as preferred bidder in december 2005 .
however , following discussions kbr were unable to proceed with the sale as agreement could not be reached with the trust on the ground reinstatement condition in the lease .
the cfpa lost its status and after putting it back on the market kbr gave preferred bidder status to another company called dsm .
a negotiated settlement has still not been reached between kbr , the trust and dsm .
the situation led to last week 's meeting between council officials , councillors and kbr bosses , which mr rennilson described as " very useful " .
highland council has also sought talks with the trust in an effort to find a resolution .
the authority could obtain a compulsory purchase order -lrb- cpo -rrb- giving it powers to attempt to obtain land and buildings .
in his report , mr rennilson said success of a cpo was not guaranteed and it could take 18-24 months to resolve .
there have been concerns that the longer the yard is out of use , the more it will deteriorate to a point where it will be too expensive to return to full working life .
while the clock ticks , there has been no shortage of ideas of new roles for the site .
two years ago , a company which brought naval " ghost ships " from the us to the uk put forward a bid for the yard .
a firm wanted to scrap us vessels dubbed ' ghost ships ' at nigg able uk was at the time in dispute with environmental agencies over plans for a scrap yard facility in hartlepool .
environmentalists said the naval ships were carrying toxic material , which the company denied .
it was mooted that the ships could be transferred to scotland to be broken up if the dispute in hartlepool was not resolved .
the renewable energy sector may also be interested in the yard .
two experimental offshore wind turbines were put together there after being constructed elsewhere , before being floated out of cromarty into the moray firth .
and an involvement in the building and launching of more of these giants could be where nigg 's future lies .
time will tell .

according to local myth , north and south sutor were two who lived on the distinctive headlands that mark the entrance to the firth .
however , the nigg fabrication yard on its northern shores was a true giant in terms of employment and the economy .
highland council is leading a series of talks on how to breathe new life into the rundown site before it falls into disrepair .
the yard was built during the 1970s to service the construction and repair of north sea oil and gas rigs and platforms .
it is a sprawling 238 acres -lrb- 96.14 hectares -rrb- site of monstrous warehouses , a dry dock and quayside .
at its height , according to highland council figures , the yard provided for 5,000 highly paid jobs and was worth £ 100m-a-year to the highlands economy .
but its success was closely tied to the oil and gas boom of the 1970s and 80s and most of the site has stood empty since 2002 .
it was offered for sale in 2005 .
the yard has been in an almost complete state of limbo since .
a report by highland council 's director of planning , john rennilson , presented to councillors in august outlined the sticking points .
firth of giants the sutors of myth were shoemakers who shared tools by throwing them to each other across the narrow entrance to the firth .
they were also said to have watched over the village of cromarty in the 1900s the firth and the port of invergordon became a base for royal navy warships and played an important role during world war i offshore wind turbines put together at nigg stretch to 146m -lrb- 479ft -rrb- from the tip of a blade to the base under the sea .
he said it was understood that kbr construction , a subsidiary of the us group haliburton , own the northern part of the site - including the oil terminal .
it also holds the long-term lease for the southern part from the wakelyn trust .
mr rennilson said kbr appeared to have no remaining commercial interest in the yard and terminal and advertised these parts for sale .
the cromarty firth port authority -lrb- cfpa -rrb- was appointed as preferred bidder in december 2005 .
however , following discussions kbr were unable to proceed with the sale as agreement could not be reached with the trust on the ground reinstatement condition in the lease .
the cfpa lost its status and after putting it back on the market kbr gave preferred bidder status to another company called dsm .
a negotiated settlement has still not been reached between kbr , the trust and dsm .
the situation led to last week 's meeting between council officials , councillors and kbr bosses , which mr rennilson described as " very useful " .
highland council has also sought talks with the trust in an effort to find a resolution .
the authority could obtain a compulsory purchase order -lrb- cpo -rrb- giving it powers to attempt to obtain land and buildings .
in his report , mr rennilson said success of a cpo was not guaranteed and it could take 18-24 months to resolve .
there have been concerns that the longer the yard is out of use , the more it will deteriorate to a point where it will be too expensive to return to full working life .
while the clock ticks , there has been no shortage of ideas of new roles for the site .
two years ago , a company which brought naval " ghost ships " from the us to the uk put forward a bid for the yard .
able uk was at the time in dispute with environmental agencies over plans for a scrap yard facility in hartlepool .
environmentalists said the naval ships were carrying toxic material , which the company denied .
it was mooted that the ships could be transferred to scotland to be broken up if the dispute in hartlepool was not resolved .
the renewable energy sector may also be interested in the yard .
two experimental offshore wind turbines were put together there after being constructed elsewhere , before being floated out of cromarty into the moray firth .
and an involvement in the building and launching of more of these giants could be where nigg 's future lies .
time will tell .

take sony , for instance .
it owns 50 % of columbia records , the oldest and most venerable name in recorded sound .
columbia 's co-chairman , rick rubin , has joined the list of music industry executives who think that an online flat-rate subscription service is the way to combat digital piracy and file-sharing .
" you 'd pay , say , $ 19.95 -lrb- £ 10 -rrb- a month , and the music will come from anywhere you 'd like , " he told the new york times earlier this month .
" in this new world , there will be a virtual library that will be accessible from your car , from your cellphone , from your computer , from your television . "
unfortunately , no-one shared this joined-up vision of the future with sony corporation bosses , who announced just days earlier that they were closing down the company 's download store .
the decision comes as part of what is , in effect , the wholesale scrapping of sony 's entire digital music strategy .
until now , sony 's digital players had been primarily designed around its proprietary atrac audio format , although initial atrac-only players were replaced three years ago by ones that would also play mp3 files .
now it is getting rid of atrac altogether and phasing out its sony connect music store from march 2008 .
future sony players will handle a range of formats , including microsoft 's windows media audio -lrb- wma -rrb- .
' prime sub ' hopes but how likely is it that somone will realise rick rubin 's vision of an all-embracing legal digital music service ?
emusic subscriptions -lrb- uk -rrb- emusic basic : 30 song downloads a month ; £ 8.99 a month emusic plus : 50 song downloads a month ; £ 11.99 a month emusic premium : 75 song downloads a month ; £ 14.99 a month well , there are currently two types of online subscription model on offer , neither of them exactly what mr rubin has in mind .
one is available from emusic , the world 's number two digital music service with 10-11 % of the market .
for a monthly fee , customers have the right to download a certain number of songs in mp3 format without any digital rights restrictions .
music lovers can choose from 2.9 million tracks owned by 20,000 independent labels .
the snag is that none of the big four major record companies - emi , sony bmg , universal and warner - are included .

under this system , consumers essentially rent their music .
for a monthly fee , they can download as many tracks as they like , but the music sits on the computer 's hard drive and can not be transferred , although there is a more expensive service that allows copying to a compatible player .
the music lasts only as long as you keep paying the monthly subscription .
after that , the licence expires and the tracks become unplayable - unless you can crack the digital rights management -lrb- drm -rrb- that controls them .
celestial jukebox the chief executive of emusic , david pakman , is understandably keen to exalt his company 's system over any other possible kind of subscription .
but he swiftly points out the flaw in the " rubin model " of music service .
" per capita spending on music in the us in 2005 was $ 24 a year , " he says .
" music as a utility would pre-suppose that americans are prepared to spend more on music than they did then , but speculation is that it 's somewhat less than that now . "
in other words , americans probably spend in a year on music what mr rubin would like them to spend in a month - and there is no reason to believe that people in the uk or elsewhere are any different .
in any case , as far as mr pakman is concerned , his customers simply do n't want what he calls the " jukebox-in-the-sky " version of music subscription .
" we are a business that 's really focused on customers who are 25 years and older , " he says .
" we have a subscription-based system in that consumers pay monthly , but they are buying a pre-set number of downloads .
" every song , you own and can keep forever .
our age group still thinks of music in an ownership capacity .
they 're not ready to think about a rental model .
" i think it 's a long-term view .
it 's quite possible that music will be a service , but that 's really a model that 's not been adopted by consumers . "
' digital air ' the main problem with subscription-based services is that the leading name in music downloads , apple 's itunes , has managed to corner two-thirds of the market without resorting to them at all .
with most tracks retailing at 79p each and albums at £ 7.99 , apple is doing so well selling digital music as goods that the idea of music as a service still seems a long way off .
but as sales of virtual music rise , traditional record shops are looking increasingly beleaguered .
in the uk , there are only two national chains of high street record retailers left after a number of high-profile casualties .
one of those , virgin , has just changed hands and is to be rebranded as zavvi .
smaller shops , too , are going under - yet some store owners may still have the last laugh .
david killington is closing down his mr cd shop in london 's berwick street , as reported by the bbc news website in june .
but as he says , there are drawbacks to owning all your music as digitised information instead of physical artefacts .
" when -lsb- bad -rsb- times arise and you need to raise some cash , there is always a chance to sell off some rarely-played discs that can be sacrificed from your collection , " he says .
" with buying downloads , you are purchasing digital air without any resale value whatsoever . "
the idea of music subscriptions is not going to go away , and many in the music industry are hotly debating how to make it work .
the latest suggestion , from universal music group , is to make people pay through their internet service providers for the right to swap music .
but pricing levels will be crucial - or else the cost of " digital air " could well leave consumers breathless .

even a dose of bling could not save sony 's atrac format take sony , for instance .
it owns 50 % of columbia records , the oldest and most venerable name in recorded sound .
columbia 's co-chairman , rick rubin , has joined the list of music industry executives who think that an online flat-rate subscription service is the way to combat digital piracy and file-sharing .
" you 'd pay , say , $ 19.95 -lrb- £ 10 -rrb- a month , and the music will come from anywhere you 'd like , " he told the new york times earlier this month .
" in this new world , there will be a virtual library that will be accessible from your car , from your cellphone , from your computer , from your television . "
unfortunately , no-one shared this joined-up vision of the future with sony corporation bosses , who announced just days earlier that they were closing down the company 's download store .
the decision comes as part of what is , in effect , the wholesale scrapping of sony 's entire digital music strategy .
until now , sony 's digital players had been primarily designed around its proprietary atrac audio format , although initial atrac-only players were replaced three years ago by ones that would also play mp3 files .
now it is getting rid of atrac altogether and phasing out its sony connect music store from march 2008 .
future sony players will handle a range of formats , including microsoft 's windows media audio -lrb- wma -rrb- .
' prime sub ' hopes but how likely is it that somone will realise rick rubin 's vision of an all-embracing legal digital music service ?
emusic subscriptions -lrb- uk -rrb- emusic basic : 30 song downloads a month ; £ 8.99 a month emusic plus : 50 song downloads a month ; £ 11.99 a month emusic premium : 75 song downloads a month ; £ 14.99 a month well , there are currently two types of online subscription model on offer , neither of them exactly what mr rubin has in mind .
one is available from emusic , the world 's number two digital music service with 10-11 % of the market .
for a monthly fee , customers have the right to download a certain number of songs in mp3 format without any digital rights restrictions .
music lovers can choose from 2.9 million tracks owned by 20,000 independent labels .
the snag is that none of the big four major record companies - emi , sony bmg , universal and warner - are included .
napster subscriptions -lrb- uk -rrb- napster pc music service : unlimited protected downloads ; £ 9.95 a month napster to go : also allows transfer to compatible players ; £ 14.95 a month the other is offered by a number of different firms including napster , once a byword for illegal file-sharing and now one of the internet 's best-known legitimate services .
under this system , consumers essentially rent their music .
for a monthly fee , they can download as many tracks as they like , but the music sits on the computer 's hard drive and can not be transferred , although there is a more expensive service that allows copying to a compatible player .
the music lasts only as long as you keep paying the monthly subscription .
after that , the licence expires and the tracks become unplayable - unless you can crack the digital rights management -lrb- drm -rrb- that controls them .
celestial jukebox the chief executive of emusic , david pakman , is understandably keen to exalt his company 's system over any other possible kind of subscription .
but he swiftly points out the flaw in the " rubin model " of music service .
" per capita spending on music in the us in 2005 was $ 24 a year , " he says .
" music as a utility would pre-suppose that americans are prepared to spend more on music than they did then , but speculation is that it 's somewhat less than that now . "
in other words , americans probably spend in a year on music what mr rubin would like them to spend in a month - and there is no reason to believe that people in the uk or elsewhere are any different. emusic 's boss says the world is not ready for music as a utility in any case , as far as mr pakman is concerned , his customers simply do n't want what he calls the " jukebox-in-the-sky " version of music subscription .
" we are a business that 's really focused on customers who are 25 years and older , " he says .
" we have a subscription-based system in that consumers pay monthly , but they are buying a pre-set number of downloads .
" every song , you own and can keep forever .
our age group still thinks of music in an ownership capacity .
they 're not ready to think about a rental model .
" i think it 's a long-term view .
it 's quite possible that music will be a service , but that 's really a model that 's not been adopted by consumers . "
' digital air ' the main problem with subscription-based services is that the leading name in music downloads , apple 's itunes , has managed to corner two-thirds of the market without resorting to them at all .
with most tracks retailing at 79p each and albums at £ 7.99 , apple is doing so well selling digital music as goods that the idea of music as a service still seems a long way off .
but as sales of virtual music rise , traditional record shops are looking increasingly beleaguered .
david killington calls virtual music " digital air " in the uk , there are only two national chains of high street record retailers left after a number of high-profile casualties .
one of those , virgin , has just changed hands and is to be rebranded as zavvi .
smaller shops , too , are going under - yet some store owners may still have the last laugh .
david killington is closing down his mr cd shop in london 's berwick street , as reported by the bbc news website in june .
but as he says , there are drawbacks to owning all your music as digitised information instead of physical artefacts .
" when -lsb- bad -rsb- times arise and you need to raise some cash , there is always a chance to sell off some rarely-played discs that can be sacrificed from your collection , " he says .
" with buying downloads , you are purchasing digital air without any resale value whatsoever . "
the idea of music subscriptions is not going to go away , and many in the music industry are hotly debating how to make it work .
the latest suggestion , from universal music group , is to make people pay through their internet service providers for the right to swap music .
but pricing levels will be crucial - or else the cost of " digital air " could well leave consumers breathless .

' digital air ' the main problem with subscription-based services is that the leading name in music downloads , apple 's itunes , has managed to corner two-thirds of the market without resorting to them at all .
with most tracks retailing at 79p each and albums at £ 7.99 , apple is doing so well selling digital music as goods that the idea of music as a service still seems a long way off .
but as sales of virtual music rise , traditional record shops are looking increasingly beleaguered .
david killington calls virtual music " digital air " in the uk , there are only two national chains of high street record retailers left after a number of high-profile casualties .
one of those , virgin , has just changed hands and is to be rebranded as zavvi .
smaller shops , too , are going under - yet some store owners may still have the last laugh .
david killington is closing down his mr cd shop in london 's berwick street , as reported by the bbc news website in june .
but as he says , there are drawbacks to owning all your music as digitised information instead of physical artefacts .
" when -lsb- bad -rsb- times arise and you need to raise some cash , there is always a chance to sell off some rarely-played discs that can be sacrificed from your collection , " he says .
" with buying downloads , you are purchasing digital air without any resale value whatsoever . "
the idea of music subscriptions is not going to go away , and many in the music industry are hotly debating how to make it work .
the latest suggestion , from universal music group , is to make people pay through their internet service providers for the right to swap music .
but pricing levels will be crucial - or else the cost of " digital air " could well leave consumers breathless .

the quartet issued a roadmap in 2003 for an israeli-palestinian peace deal .

condoleezza rice described the arab nations as " natural invitees " but said they would have to renounce violence .
she was speaking after the four backers of the peace process - the us , eu , russia and the un - met in new york and gave support to the proposed summit .
the quartet issued a roadmap in 2003 for an israeli-palestinian peace deal .
but the roadmap has been sidelined and no apparent progress has been made towards achieving the declared aim of the process , a two-state solution .
' peaceful solution ' after sunday 's meeting , the quartet issued a statement expressing support for the proposed conference - which has been heavily promoted by the us .
quartet aims for momentum ms rice said it " would be natural " for syria , saudi arabia and 10 other arab league members to participate , but warned that attending the summit brought " certain responsibilities " .
" we hope that those who come are really committed to helping the israelis and the palestinians find a way through - and that means renouncing violence , it means working for a peaceful solution . "
syria remains technically at war with israel - egypt and jordan are the only arab states to have signed a peace treaty with israel .
bbc diplomatic correspondent jonathan marcus says the phrase " international meeting " is notable , perhaps indicating something short of a full-scale peace conference .
with the palestinians divided and with israel designating the gaza strip as hostile territory , the climate is not encouraging , he says .
high stakes the quartet also called for humanitarian assistance to gaza to continue without obstruction - a warning to israel , which has threatened to cut off vital energy supplies .

" i do n't know how many times people have added an entry in our wiki saying ' how do i get one ? ' or ' i 'd gladly pay one for a child if i could get one ' , " said mr bender .
the laptop was designed to be used in developing countries the organisation has previously hinted that they were considering selling the laptop on a give one get one basis , but not this early .
in january this year , michalis bletsas , chief connectivity officer for the project , told the bbc news website that olpc was hoping to sell the laptop to the public " next year " .
nicholas negroponte , the founder of olpc , has also previously said : " many commercial schemes have been considered and proposed that may surface in 2008 or beyond , one of which is ' buy 2 and get 1 ' . "

" we see it as a way of kick-starting the programme in the least developed countries . "
early adopter the first countries to receive the donated laptops will be cambodia , afghanistan , rwanda and haiti .
other least developed countries -lrb- ldc -rrb- , as defined by the un , will be able to bid to join the scheme .
the laptops will go on sale for two weeks through the xogiving.org website .
they will only be available for two weeks to ensure olpc can meet demand and so that machines are not diverted away from countries that have already placed orders .

he joined immediately before radio 1 launched the 15-minute news bulletin , which was a response to the creation of commercial radio in 1973 and is still in the station 's schedule now .
he remembers the way the show shook up the traditional image of radio news , the time when censors controlled its output , and how he told paul mccartney that fellow beatle john lennon had been murdered .
skinner went on to host radio 1 's top 40 and the stereo sequence i was working at radio solent in southampton and they went round all the local stations and offered people jobs .
i was there first of all as a reporter , became a presenter after about a year , and then became a producer too .
i was there until the falklands , when i was also djing .
newsbeat started in october 1973 and the original presenter was ed stewart .
it was on at 12.30 and 5.30 , 15 minutes long , and people like johnnie walker , who had the lunchtime show , absolutely hated it .
he 'd get on the air at 12 , do half an hour and then have to stop .
then we 'd come on , bleating about the news and ruining his atmosphere , and then he 'd come back on again .
' jeans and t-shirt ' in fact , newsbeat was generally totally disliked by the radio 1 ' establishment ' .
it was forced upon them by the hierarchy , and it was something to do with commercial radio opening - the first stations opened at the same time , and they did n't want radio 1 not to have a proper news service .
when john lennon was shot , i happened to have paul mccartney 's home telephone number .
i phoned and he did n't know richard skinner lennon talks in 1980 previously radio 1 had only one-minute bulletins , read by the radio 2 announcers .
they thrust us on , and very soon we realised we were doing ' real ' news , but just in a much more direct manner .
i became the showbiz editor so i did all the pop interviews .
i went over to america and appeared with telly savalas in kojak , went out with charlie 's angels , and did a month 's tour in america with david essex , reporting back when he was a big star in the mid- ' 70s .
i remember being told to go out and interview prime minister harold wilson in jeans and a t-shirt .
all the other reporters were in suits .
the prime minister said , ' oh i can see you 're not from the bbc ... '
then he added : ' oh , you are from the bbc ! '
he thought i was a commercial radio man .
when john lennon was shot , i happened to have paul mccartney 's home telephone number .
i phoned and he did n't know .
i spoke to his butler or somebody like that and he passed on the news .
about three hours later , about eight o 'clock in the morning , paul mccartney phoned me in the newsbeat office .
he said , ' thank you for telling me - i ca n't talk about this . '
so we never got an interview , but being the person to pass on that news was a bit of a weird one .
' falklands censorship ' another time i was kidnapped by the ira in belfast .
i spent all day riding a round in a taxi with a gun in my back .
they took all of my money and delivered me back to my hotel at the end .
i was in the studio , producing , at the time of the falklands war .
the worst thing about that was the censorship - every programme had government censors sitting in the control room .
we were getting raw sound feeds of the footage from the falklands and it was pretty ghastly stuff .
there was massive loss of life .
the guys would put red pencil through the scripts - they 'd tell us to cut things out .
at one point we actually threw a tape at one of the censors and said , ' you 've left us nothing here , there is no news left . '
that 's the only time we had to sign the official secrets act , and the only time i 've ever worked in that sort of situation with censorship in the studio .
it 's not a pleasant experience , to be honest .

he joined immediately before radio 1 launched the 15-minute news bulletin , which was a response to the creation of commercial radio in 1973 and is still in the station 's schedule now .
he remembers the way the show shook up the traditional image of radio news , the time when censors controlled its output , and how he told paul mccartney that fellow beatle john lennon had been murdered .
skinner went on to host radio 1 's top 40 and the stereo sequence i was working at radio solent in southampton and they went round all the local stations and offered people jobs .
i was there first of all as a reporter , became a presenter after about a year , and then became a producer too .
i was there until the falklands , when i was also djing .
newsbeat started in october 1973 and the original presenter was ed stewart .
it was on at 12.30 and 5.30 , 15 minutes long , and people like johnnie walker , who had the lunchtime show , absolutely hated it .
he 'd get on the air at 12 , do half an hour and then have to stop .
then we 'd come on , bleating about the news and ruining his atmosphere , and then he 'd come back on again .
' jeans and t-shirt ' in fact , newsbeat was generally totally disliked by the radio 1 ' establishment ' .
it was forced upon them by the hierarchy , and it was something to do with commercial radio opening - the first stations opened at the same time , and they did n't want radio 1 not to have a proper news service .
when john lennon was shot , i happened to have paul mccartney 's home telephone number .
i phoned and he did n't know richard skinner lennon talks in 1980 previously radio 1 had only one-minute bulletins , read by the radio 2 announcers .
they thrust us on , and very soon we realised we were doing ' real ' news , but just in a much more direct manner .
i became the showbiz editor so i did all the pop interviews .
i went over to america and appeared with telly savalas in kojak , went out with charlie 's angels , and did a month 's tour in america with david essex , reporting back when he was a big star in the mid- ' 70s .
i remember being told to go out and interview prime minister harold wilson in jeans and a t-shirt .
all the other reporters were in suits .
the prime minister said , ' oh i can see you 're not from the bbc ... '
then he added : ' oh , you are from the bbc ! '
he thought i was a commercial radio man .
when john lennon was shot , i happened to have paul mccartney 's home telephone number .
i phoned and he did n't know .
i spoke to his butler or somebody like that and he passed on the news .
about three hours later , about eight o 'clock in the morning , paul mccartney phoned me in the newsbeat office .
he said , ' thank you for telling me - i ca n't talk about this . '
so we never got an interview , but being the person to pass on that news was a bit of a weird one .
' falklands censorship ' another time i was kidnapped by the ira in belfast .
i spent all day riding a round in a taxi with a gun in my back .
they took all of my money and delivered me back to my hotel at the end .
i was in the studio , producing , at the time of the falklands war .
the worst thing about that was the censorship - every programme had government censors sitting in the control room .
we were getting raw sound feeds of the footage from the falklands and it was pretty ghastly stuff .
there was massive loss of life .
the guys would put red pencil through the scripts - they 'd tell us to cut things out .
at one point we actually threw a tape at one of the censors and said , ' you 've left us nothing here , there is no news left . '
that 's the only time we had to sign the official secrets act , and the only time i 've ever worked in that sort of situation with censorship in the studio .
it 's not a pleasant experience , to be honest .

to mark the anniversary , he agreed to answer a selection of questions about his career in broadcasting , which had been submitted by readers of the bbc news website .
and throughout this week , the bbc news website will be marking the 40th anniversaries of radios 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 with a series of special reports and archived audio material .
when you were on the pirate ships , did you stay on board , or were you taken out every day ?
lindsey harris , poole we actually were out there for two weeks at a time .
we went from harwich when i was on radio caroline south , and then with big l , we went out from harwich and shared the same tender boat .
so we 'd go out there , usually on a monday , stay for two weeks , then come back .
we could n't get backwards and forwards every day because we had to go through customs .
it was about an hour and a half 's trip from harwich right round to frinton , then three and a half miles out off the coast .
what was your scariest moment ?
sharon chiverton , spalding i think the scariest time was probably in 1966 .
i was out on radio caroline and we were watching bbc television .
anglia television were putting out distress calls to us saying we were drifting and we should be careful in a force 10 gale , and of course the bbc did n't really give a damn about us .
we were watching the wrong programme !
there was a crunching noise and we were taken off by the lifeguards .
i suppose , being young , you did n't realise how dangerous it could have been - we could have all drowned .
i was 10 when radio 1 launched and ca n't begin to tell you how exciting it was .
i also remember crying when you left the breakfast show .
did you choose the first record , flowers in the rain by the move ?
debbie apted , luton blackburn -lrb- left -rrb- was furious that edmonds -lrb- right -rrb- took over his show i remember crying when i left the breakfast show as well , and stabbing noel edmonds in the back !
but yes , i did choose flowers in the rain , basically because it was a hit at the time , it had a crashing noise and it was a nice lively record , and i thought that would be a good opener for the station .
i actually used to select all the music on the breakfast show - with a producer , but i had the final say in those days .
how times have changed .
were you at all prepared for the scale of fame you were catapulted into ?
robert , newbury i think so , yes .
you 've got to remember that when i did the breakfast show on there , we were getting audiences of between 19 and 20 million , and that 's a lot of people listening every morning .
top of the pops was doing enormously well as well , getting the same sort of figures .
to be a radio 1 disc jockey was on a par with the artists that we were playing .
but of course we were a monopoly .
did anything live in dlt 's beard ?
chris adams , leeds a lot of things , actually , which we ca n't go into - but it 's quite lively in there .
how is arnold the dog these days ?
bob barnes , warwick arnold , unfortunately , is not too well - he 's dead .
it would have been amazing if he had still survived because he 'd have been 43 years old by now .
he passed away at quite an elderly age , but it 's not all bad - i had him stuffed and he nods in the back of my car even to this day .
i 'm joking !
when i was about 10 , sitting round the radio listening to the chart on sunday nights was a big event .
what are your views on the charts today ?
ian gester , southend everything changes .
i 've never said to my children , ' they do n't write songs like they used to . '
they do , and there 's great music around .
the charts do n't mean as much now because there are so many different charts around , so many different radio stations , so many different genres of music .
to get in the top 40 now , you do n't have to sell many records .
nevertheless , people still love music and they always will do , and there 's some great music still made .
if you could take one soul record to a desert island , which would it be ?
jenny , london blackburn heard i 'm still waiting on the album everything is everything it would be i 'm still waiting by diana ross because it 's one that i got released as a single .
i heard it as an album track and rang up motown and said , ' i think you 've got a really big hit record here . '
they rang diana ross up and got permission to get it released , and of course it did go to number one in this country and in america as well .
also , the marvin gaye cd of what 's going on is one of the best cds ever made - absolute genius .
the second record i 'd take is probably my record of chop chop , a record ahead of its time .
what is the one song that holds the most memories for you ?
nicholas barney , llanelli i remember young , gifted and black by bob and marcia was certainly one the breakfast show made a hit out of .
i think probably in the pirate ship days , have i the right by the honeycombs - it always reminds me of radio caroline - and also tom jones ' it 's not unusual .
if you could never hear one song again , what would it be ?
daniel clements , leicester my record of chop chop .
it 's atrocious .
what do you think of the state of british radio and what would you change about it ?
emalyse , london i think it 's a shame that commercial radio is controlled by three major companies .
the state of british radio is difficult , particularly in the commercial radio sector , because there is n't enough money to go round .
probably we 've got too many radio stations now for our own good .
there 's a lot of what we call " voice-tracking " going on - people come in and for a very small amount of money , they record their links and they do n't even hear the music .
to me , that 's destroying radio in this country .
i hate it .
what advice would you give someone wanting to get into the radio industry today ?
andie riley , leeds if you think you 're particularly good and you 've got something distinctive to offer , all you 've got to do is send in a tape of yourself doing what you do best .
if you do n't think you are actually particularly good , i 'd forget about it , because it 's not one of the highest-paid jobs .
it was when i came into it in the ' 60s , but there are so many radio stations around now .
unless you 're another chris tarrant or jonathan ross , then i 'd find another form of work .
it 's a shame for me to have to say that , but that 's what i would recommend .
what did you think of smashie and nicey ?
gavin culloty , birmingham i thought smashie and nicey were great .
it was very , very funny .
they were modelled on alan freeman and myself .
smash and nice rocking again it did n't , in a strange sort of way , do us a lot of good , because i think a lot of the programme controllers thought they were employing a couple of dinosaurs , and they had a slight humour-bypass .
i still play on it today quite a bit - you know , the " pop-a-doodle-do " bit and things like that .
i never actually said any of that stuff , but i do now , not on the radio but if i go on stage .
fab fm is a station that i would really still love to work on , if i could find it .
in fact , you ai n't heard nothin ' yet !
tony blackburn 's autobiography , poptastic ! : my life in radio , has been published by cassell illustrated .

i think probably in the pirate ship days , have i the right by the honeycombs - it always reminds me of radio caroline - and also tom jones ' it 's not unusual .
if you could never hear one song again , what would it be ?
daniel clements , leicester my record of chop chop .
it 's atrocious .
what do you think of the state of british radio and what would you change about it ?
emalyse , london i think it 's a shame that commercial radio is controlled by three major companies .
the state of british radio is difficult , particularly in the commercial radio sector , because there is n't enough money to go round .
probably we 've got too many radio stations now for our own good .
there 's a lot of what we call " voice-tracking " going on - people come in and for a very small amount of money , they record their links and they do n't even hear the music .
to me , that 's destroying radio in this country .
i hate it .
what advice would you give someone wanting to get into the radio industry today ?
andie riley , leeds if you think you 're particularly good and you 've got something distinctive to offer , all you 've got to do is send in a tape of yourself doing what you do best .
if you do n't think you are actually particularly good , i 'd forget about it , because it 's not one of the highest-paid jobs .
it was when i came into it in the ' 60s , but there are so many radio stations around now .
unless you 're another chris tarrant or jonathan ross , then i 'd find another form of work .
it 's a shame for me to have to say that , but that 's what i would recommend .
what did you think of smashie and nicey ?
gavin culloty , birmingham i thought smashie and nicey were great .
it was very , very funny .
they were modelled on alan freeman and myself .
smash and nice rocking again it did n't , in a strange sort of way , do us a lot of good , because i think a lot of the programme controllers thought they were employing a couple of dinosaurs , and they had a slight humour-bypass .
i still play on it today quite a bit - you know , the " pop-a-doodle-do " bit and things like that .
i never actually said any of that stuff , but i do now , not on the radio but if i go on stage .
fab fm is a station that i would really still love to work on , if i could find it .

to mark the anniversary , he agreed to answer a selection of questions about his career in broadcasting , which had been submitted by readers of the bbc news website .
and throughout this week , the bbc news website will be marking the 40th anniversaries of radios 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 with a series of special reports and archived audio material .
when you were on the pirate ships , did you stay on board , or were you taken out every day ?
lindsey harris , poole we actually were out there for two weeks at a time .
we went from harwich when i was on radio caroline south , and then with big l , we went out from harwich and shared the same tender boat .
so we 'd go out there , usually on a monday , stay for two weeks , then come back .
we could n't get backwards and forwards every day because we had to go through customs .
it was about an hour and a half 's trip from harwich right round to frinton , then three and a half miles out off the coast .
what was your scariest moment ?
sharon chiverton , spalding i think the scariest time was probably in 1966 .
i was out on radio caroline and we were watching bbc television .
anglia television were putting out distress calls to us saying we were drifting and we should be careful in a force 10 gale , and of course the bbc did n't really give a damn about us .
we were watching the wrong programme !
there was a crunching noise and we were taken off by the lifeguards .
i suppose , being young , you did n't realise how dangerous it could have been - we could have all drowned .
i was 10 when radio 1 launched and ca n't begin to tell you how exciting it was .
i also remember crying when you left the breakfast show .
did you choose the first record , flowers in the rain by the move ?
debbie apted , luton blackburn -lrb- left -rrb- was furious that edmonds -lrb- right -rrb- took over his show i remember crying when i left the breakfast show as well , and stabbing noel edmonds in the back !
but yes , i did choose flowers in the rain , basically because it was a hit at the time , it had a crashing noise and it was a nice lively record , and i thought that would be a good opener for the station .
i actually used to select all the music on the breakfast show - with a producer , but i had the final say in those days .
how times have changed .
were you at all prepared for the scale of fame you were catapulted into ?
robert , newbury i think so , yes .
you 've got to remember that when i did the breakfast show on there , we were getting audiences of between 19 and 20 million , and that 's a lot of people listening every morning .
top of the pops was doing enormously well as well , getting the same sort of figures .
to be a radio 1 disc jockey was on a par with the artists that we were playing .
but of course we were a monopoly .
did anything live in dlt 's beard ?
chris adams , leeds a lot of things , actually , which we ca n't go into - but it 's quite lively in there .
how is arnold the dog these days ?
bob barnes , warwick arnold , unfortunately , is not too well - he 's dead .
it would have been amazing if he had still survived because he 'd have been 43 years old by now .
he passed away at quite an elderly age , but it 's not all bad - i had him stuffed and he nods in the back of my car even to this day .
i 'm joking !
when i was about 10 , sitting round the radio listening to the chart on sunday nights was a big event .
what are your views on the charts today ?
ian gester , southend everything changes .
i 've never said to my children , ' they do n't write songs like they used to . '
they do , and there 's great music around .
the charts do n't mean as much now because there are so many different charts around , so many different radio stations , so many different genres of music .
to get in the top 40 now , you do n't have to sell many records .
nevertheless , people still love music and they always will do , and there 's some great music still made .
if you could take one soul record to a desert island , which would it be ?
jenny , london blackburn heard i 'm still waiting on the album everything is everything it would be i 'm still waiting by diana ross because it 's one that i got released as a single .
i heard it as an album track and rang up motown and said , ' i think you 've got a really big hit record here . '
they rang diana ross up and got permission to get it released , and of course it did go to number one in this country and in america as well .
also , the marvin gaye cd of what 's going on is one of the best cds ever made - absolute genius .
the second record i 'd take is probably my record of chop chop , a record ahead of its time .
what is the one song that holds the most memories for you ?
nicholas barney , llanelli i remember young , gifted and black by bob and marcia was certainly one the breakfast show made a hit out of .
i think probably in the pirate ship days , have i the right by the honeycombs - it always reminds me of radio caroline - and also tom jones ' it 's not unusual .

he joined immediately before radio 1 launched the 15-minute news bulletin , which was a response to the creation of commercial radio in 1973 and is still in the station 's schedule now .
he remembers the way the show shook up the traditional image of radio news , the time when censors controlled its output , and how he told paul mccartney that fellow beatle john lennon had been murdered .
skinner went on to host radio 1 's top 40 and the stereo sequence i was working at radio solent in southampton and they went round all the local stations and offered people jobs .
i was there first of all as a reporter , became a presenter after about a year , and then became a producer too .
i was there until the falklands , when i was also djing .
newsbeat started in october 1973 and the original presenter was ed stewart .
it was on at 12.30 and 5.30 , 15 minutes long , and people like johnnie walker , who had the lunchtime show , absolutely hated it .
he 'd get on the air at 12 , do half an hour and then have to stop .
then we 'd come on , bleating about the news and ruining his atmosphere , and then he 'd come back on again .
' jeans and t-shirt ' in fact , newsbeat was generally totally disliked by the radio 1 ' establishment ' .
it was forced upon them by the hierarchy , and it was something to do with commercial radio opening - the first stations opened at the same time , and they did n't want radio 1 not to have a proper news service .
when john lennon was shot , i happened to have paul mccartney 's home telephone number .
i phoned and he did n't know richard skinner lennon talks in 1980 previously radio 1 had only one-minute bulletins , read by the radio 2 announcers .
they thrust us on , and very soon we realised we were doing ' real ' news , but just in a much more direct manner .
i became the showbiz editor so i did all the pop interviews .
i went over to america and appeared with telly savalas in kojak , went out with charlie 's angels , and did a month 's tour in america with david essex , reporting back when he was a big star in the mid- ' 70s .
i remember being told to go out and interview prime minister harold wilson in jeans and a t-shirt .
all the other reporters were in suits .
the prime minister said , ' oh i can see you 're not from the bbc ... '
then he added : ' oh , you are from the bbc ! '
he thought i was a commercial radio man .
when john lennon was shot , i happened to have paul mccartney 's home telephone number .
i phoned and he did n't know .
i spoke to his butler or somebody like that and he passed on the news .
about three hours later , about eight o 'clock in the morning , paul mccartney phoned me in the newsbeat office .
he said , ' thank you for telling me - i ca n't talk about this . '
so we never got an interview , but being the person to pass on that news was a bit of a weird one .
' falklands censorship ' another time i was kidnapped by the ira in belfast .
i spent all day riding a round in a taxi with a gun in my back .
they took all of my money and delivered me back to my hotel at the end .
i was in the studio , producing , at the time of the falklands war .
the worst thing about that was the censorship - every programme had government censors sitting in the control room .
we were getting raw sound feeds of the footage from the falklands and it was pretty ghastly stuff .
there was massive loss of life .
the guys would put red pencil through the scripts - they 'd tell us to cut things out .
at one point we actually threw a tape at one of the censors and said , ' you 've left us nothing here , there is no news left . '
that 's the only time we had to sign the official secrets act , and the only time i 've ever worked in that sort of situation with censorship in the studio .
it 's not a pleasant experience , to be honest .

to mark the anniversary , he agreed to answer a selection of questions about his career in broadcasting , which had been submitted by readers of the bbc news website .
and throughout this week , the bbc news website will be marking the 40th anniversaries of radios 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 with a series of special reports and archived audio material .
when you were on the pirate ships , did you stay on board , or were you taken out every day ?
lindsey harris , poole we actually were out there for two weeks at a time .
we went from harwich when i was on radio caroline south , and then with big l , we went out from harwich and shared the same tender boat .
so we 'd go out there , usually on a monday , stay for two weeks , then come back .
we could n't get backwards and forwards every day because we had to go through customs .
it was about an hour and a half 's trip from harwich right round to frinton , then three and a half miles out off the coast .
what was your scariest moment ?
sharon chiverton , spalding i think the scariest time was probably in 1966 .
i was out on radio caroline and we were watching bbc television .
anglia television were putting out distress calls to us saying we were drifting and we should be careful in a force 10 gale , and of course the bbc did n't really give a damn about us .
we were watching the wrong programme !
there was a crunching noise and we were taken off by the lifeguards .
i suppose , being young , you did n't realise how dangerous it could have been - we could have all drowned .
i was 10 when radio 1 launched and ca n't begin to tell you how exciting it was .
i also remember crying when you left the breakfast show .
did you choose the first record , flowers in the rain by the move ?
debbie apted , luton blackburn -lrb- left -rrb- was furious that edmonds -lrb- right -rrb- took over his show i remember crying when i left the breakfast show as well , and stabbing noel edmonds in the back !
but yes , i did choose flowers in the rain , basically because it was a hit at the time , it had a crashing noise and it was a nice lively record , and i thought that would be a good opener for the station .
i actually used to select all the music on the breakfast show - with a producer , but i had the final say in those days .
how times have changed .
were you at all prepared for the scale of fame you were catapulted into ?
robert , newbury i think so , yes .
you 've got to remember that when i did the breakfast show on there , we were getting audiences of between 19 and 20 million , and that 's a lot of people listening every morning .
top of the pops was doing enormously well as well , getting the same sort of figures .
to be a radio 1 disc jockey was on a par with the artists that we were playing .
but of course we were a monopoly .
did anything live in dlt 's beard ?
chris adams , leeds a lot of things , actually , which we ca n't go into - but it 's quite lively in there .
how is arnold the dog these days ?
bob barnes , warwick arnold , unfortunately , is not too well - he 's dead .
it would have been amazing if he had still survived because he 'd have been 43 years old by now .
he passed away at quite an elderly age , but it 's not all bad - i had him stuffed and he nods in the back of my car even to this day .
i 'm joking !
when i was about 10 , sitting round the radio listening to the chart on sunday nights was a big event .
what are your views on the charts today ?
ian gester , southend everything changes .
i 've never said to my children , ' they do n't write songs like they used to . '
they do , and there 's great music around .
the charts do n't mean as much now because there are so many different charts around , so many different radio stations , so many different genres of music .
to get in the top 40 now , you do n't have to sell many records .
nevertheless , people still love music and they always will do , and there 's some great music still made .
if you could take one soul record to a desert island , which would it be ?
jenny , london blackburn heard i 'm still waiting on the album everything is everything it would be i 'm still waiting by diana ross because it 's one that i got released as a single .
i heard it as an album track and rang up motown and said , ' i think you 've got a really big hit record here . '
they rang diana ross up and got permission to get it released , and of course it did go to number one in this country and in america as well .
also , the marvin gaye cd of what 's going on is one of the best cds ever made - absolute genius .
the second record i 'd take is probably my record of chop chop , a record ahead of its time .
what is the one song that holds the most memories for you ?
nicholas barney , llanelli i remember young , gifted and black by bob and marcia was certainly one the breakfast show made a hit out of .
i think probably in the pirate ship days , have i the right by the honeycombs - it always reminds me of radio caroline - and also tom jones ' it 's not unusual .
if you could never hear one song again , what would it be ?
daniel clements , leicester my record of chop chop .
it 's atrocious .
what do you think of the state of british radio and what would you change about it ?
emalyse , london i think it 's a shame that commercial radio is controlled by three major companies .
the state of british radio is difficult , particularly in the commercial radio sector , because there is n't enough money to go round .
probably we 've got too many radio stations now for our own good .
there 's a lot of what we call " voice-tracking " going on - people come in and for a very small amount of money , they record their links and they do n't even hear the music .
to me , that 's destroying radio in this country .
i hate it .
what advice would you give someone wanting to get into the radio industry today ?
andie riley , leeds if you think you 're particularly good and you 've got something distinctive to offer , all you 've got to do is send in a tape of yourself doing what you do best .
if you do n't think you are actually particularly good , i 'd forget about it , because it 's not one of the highest-paid jobs .
it was when i came into it in the ' 60s , but there are so many radio stations around now .
unless you 're another chris tarrant or jonathan ross , then i 'd find another form of work .
it 's a shame for me to have to say that , but that 's what i would recommend .
what did you think of smashie and nicey ?
gavin culloty , birmingham i thought smashie and nicey were great .
it was very , very funny .
they were modelled on alan freeman and myself .
smash and nice rocking again it did n't , in a strange sort of way , do us a lot of good , because i think a lot of the programme controllers thought they were employing a couple of dinosaurs , and they had a slight humour-bypass .
i still play on it today quite a bit - you know , the " pop-a-doodle-do " bit and things like that .
i never actually said any of that stuff , but i do now , not on the radio but if i go on stage .
fab fm is a station that i would really still love to work on , if i could find it .
in fact , you ai n't heard nothin ' yet !
tony blackburn 's autobiography , poptastic ! : my life in radio , has been published by cassell illustrated .

he joined immediately before radio 1 launched the 15-minute news bulletin , which was a response to the creation of commercial radio in 1973 and is still in the station 's schedule now .
he remembers the way the show shook up the traditional image of radio news , the time when censors controlled its output , and how he told paul mccartney that fellow beatle john lennon had been murdered .
skinner went on to host radio 1 's top 40 and the stereo sequence i was working at radio solent in southampton and they went round all the local stations and offered people jobs .
i was there first of all as a reporter , became a presenter after about a year , and then became a producer too .
i was there until the falklands , when i was also djing .
newsbeat started in october 1973 and the original presenter was ed stewart .
it was on at 12.30 and 5.30 , 15 minutes long , and people like johnnie walker , who had the lunchtime show , absolutely hated it .
he 'd get on the air at 12 , do half an hour and then have to stop .
then we 'd come on , bleating about the news and ruining his atmosphere , and then he 'd come back on again .
' jeans and t-shirt ' in fact , newsbeat was generally totally disliked by the radio 1 ' establishment ' .
it was forced upon them by the hierarchy , and it was something to do with commercial radio opening - the first stations opened at the same time , and they did n't want radio 1 not to have a proper news service .
when john lennon was shot , i happened to have paul mccartney 's home telephone number .
i phoned and he did n't know richard skinner lennon talks in 1980 previously radio 1 had only one-minute bulletins , read by the radio 2 announcers .
they thrust us on , and very soon we realised we were doing ' real ' news , but just in a much more direct manner .
i became the showbiz editor so i did all the pop interviews .
i went over to america and appeared with telly savalas in kojak , went out with charlie 's angels , and did a month 's tour in america with david essex , reporting back when he was a big star in the mid- ' 70s .
i remember being told to go out and interview prime minister harold wilson in jeans and a t-shirt .
all the other reporters were in suits .
the prime minister said , ' oh i can see you 're not from the bbc ... '
then he added : ' oh , you are from the bbc ! '
he thought i was a commercial radio man .
when john lennon was shot , i happened to have paul mccartney 's home telephone number .
i phoned and he did n't know .
i spoke to his butler or somebody like that and he passed on the news .
about three hours later , about eight o 'clock in the morning , paul mccartney phoned me in the newsbeat office .
he said , ' thank you for telling me - i ca n't talk about this . '
so we never got an interview , but being the person to pass on that news was a bit of a weird one .
' falklands censorship ' another time i was kidnapped by the ira in belfast .
i spent all day riding a round in a taxi with a gun in my back .
they took all of my money and delivered me back to my hotel at the end .
i was in the studio , producing , at the time of the falklands war .
the worst thing about that was the censorship - every programme had government censors sitting in the control room .
we were getting raw sound feeds of the footage from the falklands and it was pretty ghastly stuff .
there was massive loss of life .
the guys would put red pencil through the scripts - they 'd tell us to cut things out .
at one point we actually threw a tape at one of the censors and said , ' you 've left us nothing here , there is no news left . '
that 's the only time we had to sign the official secrets act , and the only time i 've ever worked in that sort of situation with censorship in the studio .
it 's not a pleasant experience , to be honest .

he joined immediately before radio 1 launched the 15-minute news bulletin , which was a response to the creation of commercial radio in 1973 and is still in the station 's schedule now .
he remembers the way the show shook up the traditional image of radio news , the time when censors controlled its output , and how he told paul mccartney that fellow beatle john lennon had been murdered .
skinner went on to host radio 1 's top 40 and the stereo sequence i was working at radio solent in southampton and they went round all the local stations and offered people jobs .
i was there first of all as a reporter , became a presenter after about a year , and then became a producer too .
i was there until the falklands , when i was also djing .
newsbeat started in october 1973 and the original presenter was ed stewart .
it was on at 12.30 and 5.30 , 15 minutes long , and people like johnnie walker , who had the lunchtime show , absolutely hated it .
he 'd get on the air at 12 , do half an hour and then have to stop .
then we 'd come on , bleating about the news and ruining his atmosphere , and then he 'd come back on again .
' jeans and t-shirt ' in fact , newsbeat was generally totally disliked by the radio 1 ' establishment ' .
it was forced upon them by the hierarchy , and it was something to do with commercial radio opening - the first stations opened at the same time , and they did n't want radio 1 not to have a proper news service .
when john lennon was shot , i happened to have paul mccartney 's home telephone number .
i phoned and he did n't know richard skinner lennon talks in 1980 previously radio 1 had only one-minute bulletins , read by the radio 2 announcers .
they thrust us on , and very soon we realised we were doing ' real ' news , but just in a much more direct manner .
i became the showbiz editor so i did all the pop interviews .
i went over to america and appeared with telly savalas in kojak , went out with charlie 's angels , and did a month 's tour in america with david essex , reporting back when he was a big star in the mid- ' 70s .
i remember being told to go out and interview prime minister harold wilson in jeans and a t-shirt .
all the other reporters were in suits .
the prime minister said , ' oh i can see you 're not from the bbc ... '
then he added : ' oh , you are from the bbc ! '

to mark the anniversary , he agreed to answer a selection of questions about his career in broadcasting , which had been submitted by readers of the bbc news website .
and throughout this week , the bbc news website will be marking the 40th anniversaries of radios 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 with a series of special reports and archived audio material .
when you were on the pirate ships , did you stay on board , or were you taken out every day ?
lindsey harris , poole we actually were out there for two weeks at a time .
we went from harwich when i was on radio caroline south , and then with big l , we went out from harwich and shared the same tender boat .
so we 'd go out there , usually on a monday , stay for two weeks , then come back .
we could n't get backwards and forwards every day because we had to go through customs .
it was about an hour and a half 's trip from harwich right round to frinton , then three and a half miles out off the coast .
what was your scariest moment ?
sharon chiverton , spalding i think the scariest time was probably in 1966 .
i was out on radio caroline and we were watching bbc television .
anglia television were putting out distress calls to us saying we were drifting and we should be careful in a force 10 gale , and of course the bbc did n't really give a damn about us .
we were watching the wrong programme !
there was a crunching noise and we were taken off by the lifeguards .
i suppose , being young , you did n't realise how dangerous it could have been - we could have all drowned .
i was 10 when radio 1 launched and ca n't begin to tell you how exciting it was .
i also remember crying when you left the breakfast show .
did you choose the first record , flowers in the rain by the move ?
debbie apted , luton blackburn -lrb- left -rrb- was furious that edmonds -lrb- right -rrb- took over his show i remember crying when i left the breakfast show as well , and stabbing noel edmonds in the back !
but yes , i did choose flowers in the rain , basically because it was a hit at the time , it had a crashing noise and it was a nice lively record , and i thought that would be a good opener for the station .
i actually used to select all the music on the breakfast show - with a producer , but i had the final say in those days .
how times have changed .
were you at all prepared for the scale of fame you were catapulted into ?
robert , newbury i think so , yes .
you 've got to remember that when i did the breakfast show on there , we were getting audiences of between 19 and 20 million , and that 's a lot of people listening every morning .
top of the pops was doing enormously well as well , getting the same sort of figures .
to be a radio 1 disc jockey was on a par with the artists that we were playing .
but of course we were a monopoly .
did anything live in dlt 's beard ?
chris adams , leeds a lot of things , actually , which we ca n't go into - but it 's quite lively in there .
how is arnold the dog these days ?
bob barnes , warwick arnold , unfortunately , is not too well - he 's dead .
it would have been amazing if he had still survived because he 'd have been 43 years old by now .
he passed away at quite an elderly age , but it 's not all bad - i had him stuffed and he nods in the back of my car even to this day .
i 'm joking !
when i was about 10 , sitting round the radio listening to the chart on sunday nights was a big event .
what are your views on the charts today ?
ian gester , southend everything changes .
i 've never said to my children , ' they do n't write songs like they used to . '
they do , and there 's great music around .
the charts do n't mean as much now because there are so many different charts around , so many different radio stations , so many different genres of music .
to get in the top 40 now , you do n't have to sell many records .
nevertheless , people still love music and they always will do , and there 's some great music still made .
if you could take one soul record to a desert island , which would it be ?
jenny , london blackburn heard i 'm still waiting on the album everything is everything it would be i 'm still waiting by diana ross because it 's one that i got released as a single .
i heard it as an album track and rang up motown and said , ' i think you 've got a really big hit record here . '
they rang diana ross up and got permission to get it released , and of course it did go to number one in this country and in america as well .
also , the marvin gaye cd of what 's going on is one of the best cds ever made - absolute genius .
the second record i 'd take is probably my record of chop chop , a record ahead of its time .
what is the one song that holds the most memories for you ?
nicholas barney , llanelli i remember young , gifted and black by bob and marcia was certainly one the breakfast show made a hit out of .
i think probably in the pirate ship days , have i the right by the honeycombs - it always reminds me of radio caroline - and also tom jones ' it 's not unusual .
if you could never hear one song again , what would it be ?
daniel clements , leicester my record of chop chop .
it 's atrocious .
what do you think of the state of british radio and what would you change about it ?
emalyse , london i think it 's a shame that commercial radio is controlled by three major companies .
the state of british radio is difficult , particularly in the commercial radio sector , because there is n't enough money to go round .
probably we 've got too many radio stations now for our own good .
there 's a lot of what we call " voice-tracking " going on - people come in and for a very small amount of money , they record their links and they do n't even hear the music .
to me , that 's destroying radio in this country .
i hate it .
what advice would you give someone wanting to get into the radio industry today ?
andie riley , leeds if you think you 're particularly good and you 've got something distinctive to offer , all you 've got to do is send in a tape of yourself doing what you do best .
if you do n't think you are actually particularly good , i 'd forget about it , because it 's not one of the highest-paid jobs .
it was when i came into it in the ' 60s , but there are so many radio stations around now .
unless you 're another chris tarrant or jonathan ross , then i 'd find another form of work .
it 's a shame for me to have to say that , but that 's what i would recommend .
what did you think of smashie and nicey ?
gavin culloty , birmingham i thought smashie and nicey were great .
it was very , very funny .
they were modelled on alan freeman and myself .
smash and nice rocking again it did n't , in a strange sort of way , do us a lot of good , because i think a lot of the programme controllers thought they were employing a couple of dinosaurs , and they had a slight humour-bypass .
i still play on it today quite a bit - you know , the " pop-a-doodle-do " bit and things like that .
i never actually said any of that stuff , but i do now , not on the radio but if i go on stage .
fab fm is a station that i would really still love to work on , if i could find it .
in fact , you ai n't heard nothin ' yet !
tony blackburn 's autobiography , poptastic ! : my life in radio , has been published by cassell illustrated .

to get in the top 40 now , you do n't have to sell many records .
nevertheless , people still love music and they always will do , and there 's some great music still made .
if you could take one soul record to a desert island , which would it be ?
jenny , london it would be i 'm still waiting by diana ross because it 's one that i got released as a single .
i heard it as an album track and rang up motown and said , ' i think you 've got a really big hit record here . '
they rang diana ross up and got permission to get it released , and of course it did go to number one in this country and in america as well .
also , the marvin gaye cd of what 's going on is one of the best cds ever made - absolute genius .
the second record i 'd take is probably my record of chop chop , a record ahead of its time .
what is the one song that holds the most memories for you ?
nicholas barney , llanelli i remember young , gifted and black by bob and marcia was certainly one the breakfast show made a hit out of .
i think probably in the pirate ship days , have i the right by the honeycombs - it always reminds me of radio caroline - and also tom jones ' it 's not unusual .
if you could never hear one song again , what would it be ?
daniel clements , leicester my record of chop chop .
it 's atrocious .
what do you think of the state of british radio and what would you change about it ?
emalyse , london i think it 's a shame that commercial radio is controlled by three major companies .
the state of british radio is difficult , particularly in the commercial radio sector , because there is n't enough money to go round .
probably we 've got too many radio stations now for our own good .
there 's a lot of what we call " voice-tracking " going on - people come in and for a very small amount of money , they record their links and they do n't even hear the music .
to me , that 's destroying radio in this country .
i hate it .
what advice would you give someone wanting to get into the radio industry today ?
andie riley , leeds if you think you 're particularly good and you 've got something distinctive to offer , all you 've got to do is send in a tape of yourself doing what you do best .
if you do n't think you are actually particularly good , i 'd forget about it , because it 's not one of the highest-paid jobs .
it was when i came into it in the ' 60s , but there are so many radio stations around now .
unless you 're another chris tarrant or jonathan ross , then i 'd find another form of work .
it 's a shame for me to have to say that , but that 's what i would recommend .
what did you think of smashie and nicey ?
gavin culloty , birmingham i thought smashie and nicey were great .
it was very , very funny .
they were modelled on alan freeman and myself .
smash and nice rocking again it did n't , in a strange sort of way , do us a lot of good , because i think a lot of the programme controllers thought they were employing a couple of dinosaurs , and they had a slight humour-bypass .
i still play on it today quite a bit - you know , the " pop-a-doodle-do " bit and things like that .
i never actually said any of that stuff , but i do now , not on the radio but if i go on stage .
fab fm is a station that i would really still love to work on , if i could find it .
in fact , you ai n't heard nothin ' yet !

by kevin young entertainment reporter , bbc news when bbc radio 1 began , 40 years ago this week , it was billed as " the swinging new radio service " for the uk .
pop fans , who had few opportunities to hear chart hits , found it essential listening .
but can it still attract young people who now have so many other distractions ?
radio 1 was not always exclusively aimed at young people .
dj mark goodier recalls ratings of " 20 million plus a week " when he joined in 1987 , a total which meant listeners of all ages were tuning in . "
the overwhelming majority of the material that chris broadcasts is within the guidelines " controller andy parfitt defends breakfast dj chris moyles " there was still -lsb- simon -rsb- bates , steve -lsb- wright -rsb- , gary -lsb- davies -rsb- , really iconic figures .
that was still a very big radio station . "
he was working with presenters " who were as famous as pop stars " , he says , and admits he could not eat his christmas dinner that year because he was so worried about his debut on boxing day .
current controller andy parfitt says radio 1 's dominance in those days came because commercial radio was " very small " , before " a sudden explosion in choice " meant audiences went elsewhere .
the well-documented overhaul of the station in the mid-90s also played a part , with veterans such as bates and dave lee travis suddenly replaced by younger talent .
types of fan now radio 1 finds itself approaching middle age and trying to lure listeners under 35 who have endless other distractions , including games consoles and the internet .
from the radio 1 archives the late john peel was one of radio 1 's launch disc jockeys mr parfitt identifies " three discrete groups of listeners " , starting with a general audience for whom " music is important but not a whole chunk of someone 's life " .
the " classic " radio 1 listener is " much more actively a music fan , probably at university with a group of friends who like particular genres " .
and finally there is " deep scenester , who thinks they know as much about the genre as the dj " .
the latest ratings show 13 million listeners aged four and above still tune in to radio 1 each week .
but nathalie schwarz , director of radio at channel 4 , fears that for many of them , " radio does n't play the same part in their lives as perhaps the generation before " .
her company is set to launch e4 radio , a national youth-oriented digital station which will " encourage its audience to shape its content " .
" internet and mobile phones are playing far more a part of young people 's daily media consumption .
" for us , it 's a real drive to provide something fresh and alternative in radio to hook them , " she says .
" it has to be driven by interactivity , a commitment to new talent and new music . "
internet ' vital ' mr parfitt agrees that " the thing never to underestimate is the dramatic impact of the web " .
he says that while the internet is a relatively recent addition to many people 's lives , for radio 1 listeners it is often " not something that 's new , but part of their life for as long as they can remember " .
" fast internet connections , either at school or at home , mean that -lsb- online -rsb- penetration is virtually 100 % for under-16s " , so radio 1 must " really focus on being part of the web " .
how and where young people listen to the radio has moved on as well , says mark story , who is managing director of radio at emap and oversees stations such as magic and kiss .
" we 've moved from being in the radio business to being in the audio business , " he says .
" it 's about any time , any place , anywhere .
" we need to think of making audio that will be compelling to young people , whether it 's listening on the tube , or -lsb- giving them -rsb- an audio guide which they keep until they go to ibiza . "
but targeting a younger audience means care is needed with the material broadcast .
and sunday times radio critic paul donovan argues " there is a lot on radio 1 which is not suitable for children " .
" it wants to use children 's enthusiasm for radio 1 when it comes to showing how popular it is , but does n't want to make any mention of when it gets reprimanded for using foul language at times when children are listening . "
last year the station was criticised by ofcom when moyles accidentally swore at a listener during a live phone call and used a derogatory term about women .
but mr parfitt dismisses the criticism , insisting the dj is " very sensitive to the time of day he 's on and the people who are listening " .
radio 1 first day highlights 0700 tony blackburn 0832 leslie crowther 1000 keith skues 1200 emperor rosko 1300 jack jackson 1400 chris denning 1500 pete murray -lrb- pictured -rrb- 1600 pete brady 1730 country meets folk 1832 scene and heard 1935 million dollar bill 2015 spotlight 1 and 2 2115 caterina valente sings 2200 pete murray 0000 sean kelly some shows simulcast on radio 2 source : radio times " the overwhelming majority of the material that chris broadcasts is within the guidelines .
" he is funny , irreverent , cheeky - a very warm broadcaster for anyone who spends any time listening to the show , and a great young broadcaster . "
as for the future of youth-targeted radio , mr parfitt says presenters provide " companionship , friendship and aspirational qualities " which he believes will remain in the coming years .
and mr story believes that whatever approach broadcasters take , they must never make sweeping assumptions according to age , especially when it comes to music .
" magic has been a radio station that is extremely successful right up to 60 , but actually it 's successful among 15- to 24-year-olds as well . "
research conducted by emap found white stripes and radiohead fans in their fifties , while jimi hendrix and the beatles were equally popular with those under-25s , he says .
" judging radio by age alone is becoming slightly old-fashioned . "

by kevin young entertainment reporter , bbc news when bbc radio 1 began , 40 years ago this week , it was billed as " the swinging new radio service " for the uk .
pop fans , who had few opportunities to hear chart hits , found it essential listening .
but can it still attract young people who now have so many other distractions ?
radio 1 was not always exclusively aimed at young people .
dj mark goodier recalls ratings of " 20 million plus a week " when he joined in 1987 , a total which meant listeners of all ages were tuning in .
the overwhelming majority of the material that chris broadcasts is within the guidelines controller andy parfitt defends breakfast dj chris moyles " there was still -lsb- simon -rsb- bates , steve -lsb- wright -rsb- , gary -lsb- davies -rsb- , really iconic figures .
that was still a very big radio station . "
he was working with presenters " who were as famous as pop stars " , he says , and admits he could not eat his christmas dinner that year because he was so worried about his debut on boxing day .
current controller andy parfitt says radio 1 's dominance in those days came because commercial radio was " very small " , before " a sudden explosion in choice " meant audiences went elsewhere .
the well-documented overhaul of the station in the mid-90s also played a part , with veterans such as bates and dave lee travis suddenly replaced by younger talent .
types of fan now radio 1 finds itself approaching middle age and trying to lure listeners under 35 who have endless other distractions , including games consoles and the internet .
from the radio 1 archives the late john peel was one of radio 1 's launch disc jockeys launch of radio 1 peel plays the fall last lennon interview top 40 show in 1987 mr parfitt identifies " three discrete groups of listeners " , starting with a general audience for whom " music is important but not a whole chunk of someone 's life " .
the " classic " radio 1 listener is " much more actively a music fan , probably at university with a group of friends who like particular genres " .
and finally there is " deep scenester , who thinks they know as much about the genre as the dj " .
the latest ratings show 13 million listeners aged four and above still tune in to radio 1 each week .
but nathalie schwarz , director of radio at channel 4 , fears that for many of them , " radio does n't play the same part in their lives as perhaps the generation before " .
her company is set to launch e4 radio , a national youth-oriented digital station which will " encourage its audience to shape its content " .
" internet and mobile phones are playing far more a part of young people 's daily media consumption .
" for us , it 's a real drive to provide something fresh and alternative in radio to hook them , " she says .
" it has to be driven by interactivity , a commitment to new talent and new music . "
internet ' vital ' mr parfitt agrees that " the thing never to underestimate is the dramatic impact of the web " .
mr parfitt , controller since 1998 , was once an arts producer for radio 4 he says that while the internet is a relatively recent addition to many people 's lives , for radio 1 listeners it is often " not something that 's new , but part of their life for as long as they can remember " .
" fast internet connections , either at school or at home , mean that -lsb- online -rsb- penetration is virtually 100 % for under-16s " , so radio 1 must " really focus on being part of the web " .
how and where young people listen to the radio has moved on as well , says mark story , who is managing director of radio at emap and oversees stations such as magic and kiss .
" we 've moved from being in the radio business to being in the audio business , " he says .
" it 's about any time , any place , anywhere .
" we need to think of making audio that will be compelling to young people , whether it 's listening on the tube , or -lsb- giving them -rsb- an audio guide which they keep until they go to ibiza . "
nathalie schwarz 's channel 4 radio is launching 10 digital stations but targeting a younger audience means care is needed with the material broadcast .
and sunday times radio critic paul donovan argues " there is a lot on radio 1 which is not suitable for children " .
" it wants to use children 's enthusiasm for radio 1 when it comes to showing how popular it is , but does n't want to make any mention of when it gets reprimanded for using foul language at times when children are listening . "
last year the station was criticised by ofcom when moyles accidentally swore at a listener during a live phone call and used a derogatory term about women .
but mr parfitt dismisses the criticism , insisting the dj is " very sensitive to the time of day he 's on and the people who are listening " .

as for the future of youth-targeted radio , mr parfitt says presenters provide " companionship , friendship and aspirational qualities " which he believes will remain in the coming years .
and mr story believes that whatever approach broadcasters take , they must never make sweeping assumptions according to age , especially when it comes to music .
" magic has been a radio station that is extremely successful right up to 60 , but actually it 's successful among 15- to 24-year-olds as well . "
research conducted by emap found white stripes and radiohead fans in their fifties , while jimi hendrix and the beatles were equally popular with those under-25s , he says .
" judging radio by age alone is becoming slightly old-fashioned . "

he was working with presenters " who were as famous as pop stars " , he says , and admits he could not eat his christmas dinner that year because he was so worried about his debut on boxing day .
current controller andy parfitt says radio 1 's dominance in those days came because commercial radio was " very small " , before " a sudden explosion in choice " meant audiences went elsewhere .
the well-documented overhaul of the station in the mid-90s also played a part , with veterans such as bates and dave lee travis suddenly replaced by younger talent .
types of fan now radio 1 finds itself approaching middle age and trying to lure listeners under 35 who have endless other distractions , including games consoles and the internet .

by kevin young entertainment reporter , bbc news when bbc radio 1 began , 40 years ago this week , it was billed as " the swinging new radio service " for the uk .
pop fans , who had few opportunities to hear chart hits , found it essential listening .
but can it still attract young people who now have so many other distractions ?
radio 1 was not always exclusively aimed at young people .
dj mark goodier recalls ratings of " 20 million plus a week " when he joined in 1987 , a total which meant listeners of all ages were tuning in .
the overwhelming majority of the material that chris broadcasts is within the guidelines controller andy parfitt defends breakfast dj chris moyles " there was still -lsb- simon -rsb- bates , steve -lsb- wright -rsb- , gary -lsb- davies -rsb- , really iconic figures .
that was still a very big radio station . "
he was working with presenters " who were as famous as pop stars " , he says , and admits he could not eat his christmas dinner that year because he was so worried about his debut on boxing day .
current controller andy parfitt says radio 1 's dominance in those days came because commercial radio was " very small " , before " a sudden explosion in choice " meant audiences went elsewhere .
the well-documented overhaul of the station in the mid-90s also played a part , with veterans such as bates and dave lee travis suddenly replaced by younger talent .
types of fan now radio 1 finds itself approaching middle age and trying to lure listeners under 35 who have endless other distractions , including games consoles and the internet .
from the radio 1 archives the late john peel was one of radio 1 's launch disc jockeys launch of radio 1 peel plays the fall last lennon interview top 40 show in 1987 mr parfitt identifies " three discrete groups of listeners " , starting with a general audience for whom " music is important but not a whole chunk of someone 's life " .
the " classic " radio 1 listener is " much more actively a music fan , probably at university with a group of friends who like particular genres " .
and finally there is " deep scenester , who thinks they know as much about the genre as the dj " .
the latest ratings show 13 million listeners aged four and above still tune in to radio 1 each week .
but nathalie schwarz , director of radio at channel 4 , fears that for many of them , " radio does n't play the same part in their lives as perhaps the generation before " .
her company is set to launch e4 radio , a national youth-oriented digital station which will " encourage its audience to shape its content " .
" internet and mobile phones are playing far more a part of young people 's daily media consumption .
" for us , it 's a real drive to provide something fresh and alternative in radio to hook them , " she says .
" it has to be driven by interactivity , a commitment to new talent and new music . "
internet ' vital ' mr parfitt agrees that " the thing never to underestimate is the dramatic impact of the web " .
mr parfitt , controller since 1998 , was once an arts producer for radio 4 he says that while the internet is a relatively recent addition to many people 's lives , for radio 1 listeners it is often " not something that 's new , but part of their life for as long as they can remember " .
" fast internet connections , either at school or at home , mean that -lsb- online -rsb- penetration is virtually 100 % for under-16s " , so radio 1 must " really focus on being part of the web " .
how and where young people listen to the radio has moved on as well , says mark story , who is managing director of radio at emap and oversees stations such as magic and kiss .
" we 've moved from being in the radio business to being in the audio business , " he says .
" it 's about any time , any place , anywhere .
" we need to think of making audio that will be compelling to young people , whether it 's listening on the tube , or -lsb- giving them -rsb- an audio guide which they keep until they go to ibiza . "

the commemoration was held at the site where a number of german officers were executed after an abortive attempt to assassinate adolf hitler in 1944 .
" it was a very moving moment , " said actor christian berkel , who was quoted in german newspaper bild am sonntag .
the makers of valkyrie were initially barred from filming on the berlin site .
positive light berkel added that cruise , director bryan singer and screenwriter christopher mcquarrie said a few words and requested the silence " out of respect for the place and out of respect for the life achievement of these people who were executed there " .
filming began on friday at the bendler block , formerly a defence ministry facility and now a memorial to third reich resistance fighters .
cruise portrays colonel claus von stauffenberg in the film , who was put to death after plotting to assassinate the nazi leader .
the german authorities ' initial ban on filming scenes at the site was due to concerns over " the dignity of the place " .
a defence ministry spokesman said the change of heart came after officials were convinced the film would portray post-war germany in a positive light .
when the ban was first imposed , speculation mounted that it was because of german hostility towards cruise 's adherence to scientology .

the deal was done in early september and for their money the new owner got a level 70 night elf rogue called zeuzo .
the price was so high because zeuzo possessed magical items , including the twin warglaives of azzinoth , owned by only a handful of warcraft 's nine million active players .
the powerful items were gained by the character 's original owner completing some of the most challenging parts of the game .
cash call world of warcraft is an online fantasy world in which players create characters and take them adventuring .
the characters gain experience and become more powerful by doing all sorts of quests -lrb- kill this , find that , deliver this -rrb- .
at the higher levels many players band together to go on raids to kill the most powerful enemies and get the best loot .
zeuzo 's creator , who took the rogue from level zero to high level hero , was contacted for the bbc by other players but he would not confirm or deny reports of the sale .
the method guild of which zeuzo was a member also declined to comment on the the sale .
however , the bbc does have independent confirmation that the account was sold for a figure of about 7,000 euros .
some warcraft players who know zeuzo 's creator did speak out .
on condition of anonymity one said : " the trade was simple .
it was a case of the buyer finding out that zeuzo was currently the best geared rogue in game . "
the next expansion will be the wrath of the lich king " zeuzo received a whisper from a person who said that wanted to buy his account and convinced him by offering more and more money each time for it . "
he said method was disappointed to lose such a good character , but at the same time , understood the final decision .
oliver koppany , a fellow player chosen by zeuzo as a " spokesperson " added : " he had been undergoing financial hardship and that was the only reason why he sold the account . "
the new owner moved the valuable rogue to another server and re-named it shaks .
high risk bill vaughan , editor of incgame 's world of warcraft website , said many people bought accounts to get over the grind of taking a character to the highest levels of the game .
" it generally takes an average person anything up to 600 game play hours to reach the current highest level , " said ms vaughan .
account selling is a growing phenomenon and the average price currently hovers around the £ 200 mark .
" the problem is , " said ms vaughan , " you have no idea how to play the character properly . "
" within a short space of time , you would be subject to the embarrassment of other players noticing your lack of skills , and it would be very apparent that you had either bought your account , or had paid to have your character levelled , " she said .
but , said ms vaughan , worse than other players noticing someone has bought their account is catching the attention of warcraft creator blizzard .
selling accounts and in-game items is against the terms and conditions people sign up to when they start playing .
blizzard has banned up to 100,000 accounts in a month for illegal gold trading or cheating in the game .
in a statement the company said it took the action : " to promote a fun and fair environment for all our players . "
it is easy to find places to buy and sell accounts " blizzard has an interest in enforcing its rules , but it has to spend substantial amounts of money to do so , " said greg lastowka , a law professor from rutgers university who specialises in intellectual property and technology regulation .
" account sales can sometimes be hard to detect , depending on the technology that a game company uses to gather information about users , " he added .
in this case blizzard caught on quick .
it banned the account about five days after it was sold .
big business while account selling is controversial among warcraft players , for some it has become a business prospect .
" account selling is a ludicrous business indeed .
i have friends who make good money without moving one finger , " the bbc was told by one player .
" you can earn 200 euros without doing absolutely anything . "
he said many buy a new account for 12 euros , then pay a gold farmer to power-level the character in 20 days and then when it had reached level 70 sell it back for 400 euros .
dee patel , an ex-warcraft player and a game industry professional , admitted having sold his account for £ 650 on ebay .
" i could have been offered a lot more for my account but i was just wanting to stop playing and wanted to get rid of it , " he said .
last january , ebay banned on-line games account selling on its website .
but thousands of other sites offer similar auction services .
globally the business is huge .

the deal was done in early september and for their money the new owner got a level 70 night elf rogue called zeuzo .
the price was so high because zeuzo possessed magical items , including the twin warglaives of azzinoth , owned by only a handful of warcraft 's nine million active players .
the powerful items were gained by the character 's original owner completing some of the most challenging parts of the game .
cash call world of warcraft is an online fantasy world in which players create characters and take them adventuring .
the characters gain experience and become more powerful by doing all sorts of quests -lrb- kill this , find that , deliver this -rrb- .
at the higher levels many players band together to go on raids to kill the most powerful enemies and get the best loot .
zeuzo 's creator , who took the rogue from level zero to high level hero , was contacted for the bbc by other players but he would not confirm or deny reports of the sale .
the method guild of which zeuzo was a member also declined to comment on the the sale .
however , the bbc does have independent confirmation that the account was sold for a figure of about 7,000 euros .
some warcraft players who know zeuzo 's creator did speak out .
on condition of anonymity one said : " the trade was simple .
it was a case of the buyer finding out that zeuzo was currently the best geared rogue in game . "
the next expansion will be the wrath of the lich king " zeuzo received a whisper from a person who said that wanted to buy his account and convinced him by offering more and more money each time for it . "
he said method was disappointed to lose such a good character , but at the same time , understood the final decision .
oliver koppany , a fellow player chosen by zeuzo as a " spokesperson " added : " he had been undergoing financial hardship and that was the only reason why he sold the account . "
the new owner moved the valuable rogue to another server and re-named it shaks .
high risk bill vaughan , editor of incgame 's world of warcraft website , said many people bought accounts to get over the grind of taking a character to the highest levels of the game .
" it generally takes an average person anything up to 600 game play hours to reach the current highest level , " said ms vaughan .
account selling is a growing phenomenon and the average price currently hovers around the £ 200 mark .
" the problem is , " said ms vaughan , " you have no idea how to play the character properly . "
" within a short space of time , you would be subject to the embarrassment of other players noticing your lack of skills , and it would be very apparent that you had either bought your account , or had paid to have your character levelled , " she said .
but , said ms vaughan , worse than other players noticing someone has bought their account is catching the attention of warcraft creator blizzard .
selling accounts and in-game items is against the terms and conditions people sign up to when they start playing .
blizzard has banned up to 100,000 accounts in a month for illegal gold trading or cheating in the game .
in a statement the company said it took the action : " to promote a fun and fair environment for all our players . "
it is easy to find places to buy and sell accounts " blizzard has an interest in enforcing its rules , but it has to spend substantial amounts of money to do so , " said greg lastowka , a law professor from rutgers university who specialises in intellectual property and technology regulation .
" account sales can sometimes be hard to detect , depending on the technology that a game company uses to gather information about users , " he added .
in this case blizzard caught on quick .
it banned the account about five days after it was sold .
big business while account selling is controversial among warcraft players , for some it has become a business prospect .
" account selling is a ludicrous business indeed .
i have friends who make good money without moving one finger , " the bbc was told by one player .
" you can earn 200 euros without doing absolutely anything . "
he said many buy a new account for 12 euros , then pay a gold farmer to power-level the character in 20 days and then when it had reached level 70 sell it back for 400 euros .
dee patel , an ex-warcraft player and a game industry professional , admitted having sold his account for £ 650 on ebay .
" i could have been offered a lot more for my account but i was just wanting to stop playing and wanted to get rid of it , " he said .
last january , ebay banned on-line games account selling on its website .
but thousands of other sites offer similar auction services .
globally the business is huge .
edward castronova , an academic studying the economics of online gaming at the university of indiana , estimates that the real money trade - people paying real cash for virtual items - is worth around $ 300- $ 400m .
