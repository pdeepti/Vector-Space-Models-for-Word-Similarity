program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 21.06.2007 russian bear aiming to recover former military roar großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia plans to launch 20 satellites that could help steer intercontinental missiles by 2010 ambitious plans for new satellite and rocket programs reflect russia 's attempts to flex its muscle and recover lost prestige on the international stage , say german experts . sergei ivanov , one of russia 's two deputy prime ministers , announced this week that russia would expand its aerospace defense and satellite programs by launching a total of 20 additional satellites into orbit by 2010 for its glonass navigation system . the system , which moscow is developing as a counterweight to both the us gps and european galileo satellite navigation systems , could also be used to steer cruise missiles , according to götz neuneck , an armaments expert at hamburg university 's institute for peace research and security policy . " glonass makes the armed forces more flexible and weapons systems more precise , " he said .
" there has been no attempt from the us side to renew control treaties ; that is another reason why moscow is starting up . " situation changed since soviet-us talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts debate if the us missile shield is really the cause behind russia 's arms program russia has felt pressured to expand its aerospace weapons capabilities by a us decision to exclude defensive systems from the 2002 anti-ballistic missile treaty in order to develop its national missile defense , part of which us military planners want to locate in poland and the czech republic , neuneck added . " the soviet-american treaty -lrb- on intermediate nuclear forces -rrb- is not effective because since -lrb- its signature -rrb- scores of countries have appeared that have such missiles , while russia and the united states are not allowed to have them , " ivanov told a military-industrial commission , reuters reported .
" in these conditions , it is necessary to provide our troops with modern , high-precision weapons . " missile shield only a pretext ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money from energy exports enables russia to modernize its military but hannes adomeit , a russia expert from the german institute for international and security affairs , said the us missile defense system is only the cover the kremlin was looking for to renew its missile arsenal . " without the planned missile defense , moscow would still arm itself in the same way , " he added . among the new weapons are short-range iskander-m missiles as well as rs-24 intercontinental ballistic missiles , which can be armed with up to 10 warheads , both of which were tested in may .
ivanov has said the two missile systems have been designed to overpower all existing and planned missile defense systems . recouping lost prestige matthes buhbe , head of the friedrich ebert stiftung 's moscow office said there has been scant criticism of the missile plans from the russian public .

essen will be the first stop in the popular event 's five-year tour . berlin is off the map for the love parade this year as the event 's organizers and local officials agreed on thursday to relocate the popular techno street party to germany 's ruhr region . after dancing down the streets of essen on aug .
25 this year , ravers can continue the party in dortmund , bochum , duisburg and gelsenkirchen in consecutive years .
the region of 5.3 million inhabitants competed against around 60 cities , including barcelona , st. petersburg and munich , to win the contract .
the love parade is expected to attract over a million visitors to the region and 120 million euros -lrb- $ 161 million -rrb- .
its organizers will foot the bill of roughly three million euros for the street party .
" that this event will take place here is an expression of the region 's liveliness , " said essen mayor wolfgang reininger .
hard to host a party the love parade began in berlin in 1989 , and at its peak , in 1999 , drew 1.5 million partygoers who danced to the techno beats blaring from floats on their route through the city 's central tiergarten park .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's tiergarten park did eventually recover disagreements among the organizers , financial problems and conflicts with the city over park damage and waste disposal led to a two-year break for the parade , which resumed in berlin in 2006 .
but the city senate and the organizers were unable to bridge their differences , so the latter started looking for a new host .
essen 's police have already raised concerns about safety during the party .
" the love parade in berlin was held along a green belt , where there was plenty of space for people to evacuate if there was an emergency , " said ulrich fassbender of the city police .
" but things are different here in essen .
we have some four-lane roads along the route , but if you imagine a crowd of 700,000 , it 's clear that they 'll be very crowded .
if panic breaks out for some reason , there 's not much room for people to escape quickly . " dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the remarks were confirmed by the broadcaster on thursday .
" we 're only demanding that which was taken from us , " kaczynski said afterwards in an interview .
" if poland had not experienced the years between 1939 and 1945 , it would today be a country of 66 million if you look at the demographic data . "
during world war two , which began when nazi germany invaded poland in september 1939 , around 6.5 million poles died , including three million polish jews .
that was about one-fourth of the pre-war population .
today , poland 's population is just under 38 million .

1 , 1939 , setting off world war two the comments are likely to do little to soothe ruffled feathers on both sides of the german-poland border .
the poles have stuck to their threat to veto a watered-down eu treaty at a european union summit opening thursday unless they were given more voting powers .
the polish prime minister said in a german newspaper wednesday that his country would be committing " suicide " if it agreed to the german proposals on the voting system .
" they are trying to isolate and ignore poland .
we can not agree to that .
that would be suicide , " he told the mass-circulation bild .
poland , the biggest of the ex-communist states that joined the eu in 2004 , opposes the planned " double majority " system for making decisions affecting the entire bloc .
the polish demands have been opposed by 25 eu states , with only the czech republic voicing support .
" fair agreement " german chancellor angela merkel on thursday urged her fellow european union leaders to work together for a " fair agreement " on a treaty to reform the eu 's creaking institutions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's comments wo n't do much for german-polish goodwill ahead of a key european summit opening later in the day , where her eu presidency 's plans for a reform treaty will be put to the test , merkel said everyone " can contribute their ideas " but that an agreement was necessary .
" i hope we can all work together in the right spirit to come to a fair agreement because the european union needs to be capable of acting in order to solve the many problems in the world with collective solutions , " she said at a meeting of conservative leaders near brussels .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , at the same gathering , stressed the need for reform so the eu 's institutions can adjust to its growing size .
" we need to reinforce the capacity of the european union to act , " he said .
" with 27 you can not have the same rules as with 12 . " 50-50 chances luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , the eu 's longest-serving leader still in office , put the chances of a summit agreement at " 50-50 " and warned that no further eu enlargement would be possible without a new treaty .

" we need to reach consensus , because if you do not have success now , is there a guarantee that you will get it after six months ? " he asked .
in addition to the polish question mark , british objections to parts of merkel 's plans could yet scupper an accord .

dw-world.de talked to a german aerospace medical expert about the experiment . rupert gerzer directs the institute of aerospace medicine in cologne , which is participating in the simulated mars mission . dw-world.de : the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is looking for two volunteers that - together with four russians - will participate in a mars mission .
including " flight time , " the participants will have to spend 520 days in metal tanks in moscow .
what will be required of them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claustrophobes need not apply rupert gerzer : first of all , candidates have to be healthy .
secondly , they have to have a psychological state of mind that prevents them from getting depressed when they 're locked up in a can for 520 days .
they also have to be compatible with the rest of the group and have no interest in dominating the others .
apart from that , they have to be able to work like a scientist on a mars mission . every crew member gets a personal space of three square meters -lrb- 32 square feet -rrb- .
there 's a common living room , a kitchen and a toilet .
esa calls it a study in isolation and confinement .
that does n't sound particularly enticing .
why should someone participate as a volunteer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupert gerzer it 's surprising how many people want to do it .
i have a full-blown scientist working in my institute who participated in the last study and who 's dying to collaborate in moscow .
a lot of people are fascinated by the idea of taking part in a space mission .
they say : if i can not be a real astronaut , then my confinement can at least help to conduct these missions in the future . there wo n't be a shower during the 520 days , but there will be a sauna .
as a space mission physician , can you explain why a sauna , of all things , is needed ? -lrb- laughs -rrb- that 's a russian specialty . the experiment sounds a bit like the tv show " big brother . "
would n't it be good for space exploration to broadcast live ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rendering of the fake mars mission tank we do n't want to examine tv stars , but find out how an isolated group reacts on the way to mars .
people inside the tank will behave according to how public the whole thing is .
we want to simulate real life or at least approximate it as much as possible .
there could be problems and there will be problems .
we want to know them and find out how to solve them . after the experiment , potential long-term effects will be examined for another year .
is there a chance for people to become a real astronaut if they get through the 520 days ? on the russian side there are people that are aspiring astronauts .
anyone who gets through the 520 days and does well could be accepted to the russian astronaut program .
esa will select new astronauts in 2008 .
anyone who will not be accepted then - because he or she is participating in the study in moscow , for example - does n't stand a chance of becoming an esa astronaut . aarni kuoppamäki interviewed rupert gerzer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german scientists have announced plans to send a lunar probe to orbit the moon .

dw-world.de talked to a german aerospace medical expert about the experiment . rupert gerzer directs the institute of aerospace medicine in cologne , which is participating in the simulated mars mission . dw-world.de : the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is looking for two volunteers that - together with four russians - will participate in a mars mission .
including " flight time , " the participants will have to spend 520 days in metal tanks in moscow .
what will be required of them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claustrophobes need not apply rupert gerzer : first of all , candidates have to be healthy .
secondly , they have to have a psychological state of mind that prevents them from getting depressed when they 're locked up in a can for 520 days .
they also have to be compatible with the rest of the group and have no interest in dominating the others .
apart from that , they have to be able to work like a scientist on a mars mission . every crew member gets a personal space of three square meters -lrb- 32 square feet -rrb- .
there 's a common living room , a kitchen and a toilet .
esa calls it a study in isolation and confinement .
that does n't sound particularly enticing .
why should someone participate as a volunteer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupert gerzer it 's surprising how many people want to do it .
i have a full-blown scientist working in my institute who participated in the last study and who 's dying to collaborate in moscow .
a lot of people are fascinated by the idea of taking part in a space mission .
they say : if i can not be a real astronaut , then my confinement can at least help to conduct these missions in the future . there wo n't be a shower during the 520 days , but there will be a sauna .
as a space mission physician , can you explain why a sauna , of all things , is needed ? -lrb- laughs -rrb- that 's a russian specialty . the experiment sounds a bit like the tv show " big brother . "

we want to know them and find out how to solve them . after the experiment , potential long-term effects will be examined for another year .
is there a chance for people to become a real astronaut if they get through the 520 days ? on the russian side there are people that are aspiring astronauts .

dw-world.de talked to a german aerospace medical expert about the experiment . rupert gerzer directs the institute of aerospace medicine in cologne , which is participating in the simulated mars mission . dw-world.de : the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is looking for two volunteers that - together with four russians - will participate in a mars mission .
including " flight time , " the participants will have to spend 520 days in metal tanks in moscow .
what will be required of them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claustrophobes need not apply rupert gerzer : first of all , candidates have to be healthy .
secondly , they have to have a psychological state of mind that prevents them from getting depressed when they 're locked up in a can for 520 days .
they also have to be compatible with the rest of the group and have no interest in dominating the others .
apart from that , they have to be able to work like a scientist on a mars mission . every crew member gets a personal space of three square meters -lrb- 32 square feet -rrb- .
there 's a common living room , a kitchen and a toilet .
esa calls it a study in isolation and confinement .
that does n't sound particularly enticing .
why should someone participate as a volunteer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupert gerzer it 's surprising how many people want to do it .
i have a full-blown scientist working in my institute who participated in the last study and who 's dying to collaborate in moscow .
a lot of people are fascinated by the idea of taking part in a space mission .
they say : if i can not be a real astronaut , then my confinement can at least help to conduct these missions in the future . there wo n't be a shower during the 520 days , but there will be a sauna .
as a space mission physician , can you explain why a sauna , of all things , is needed ? -lrb- laughs -rrb- that 's a russian specialty . the experiment sounds a bit like the tv show " big brother . "
would n't it be good for space exploration to broadcast live ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rendering of the fake mars mission tank we do n't want to examine tv stars , but find out how an isolated group reacts on the way to mars .
people inside the tank will behave according to how public the whole thing is .
we want to simulate real life or at least approximate it as much as possible .
there could be problems and there will be problems .
we want to know them and find out how to solve them . after the experiment , potential long-term effects will be examined for another year .

fearing the worst , the 22-year-old woman was n't willing to take " john " for an answer when she demanded her client 's name , so she called on the police to help her get the information she wanted .

the remarks were confirmed by the broadcaster on thursday .
" we 're only demanding that which was taken from us , " kaczynski said afterwards in an interview .
" if poland had not experienced the years between 1939 and 1945 , it would today be a country of 66 million if you look at the demographic data . "
during world war two , which began when nazi germany invaded poland in september 1939 , around 6.5 million poles died , including three million polish jews .
that was about one-fourth of the pre-war population .
today , poland 's population is just under 38 million .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers march into poland on sept .
1 , 1939 , setting off world war two the comments are likely to do little to soothe ruffled feathers on both sides of the german-poland border .
the poles have stuck to their threat to veto a watered-down eu treaty at a european union summit opening thursday unless they were given more voting powers .
the polish prime minister said in a german newspaper wednesday that his country would be committing " suicide " if it agreed to the german proposals on the voting system .
" they are trying to isolate and ignore poland .
we can not agree to that .
that would be suicide , " he told the mass-circulation bild .
poland , the biggest of the ex-communist states that joined the eu in 2004 , opposes the planned " double majority " system for making decisions affecting the entire bloc .
the polish demands have been opposed by 25 eu states , with only the czech republic voicing support .
" fair agreement " german chancellor angela merkel on thursday urged her fellow european union leaders to work together for a " fair agreement " on a treaty to reform the eu 's creaking institutions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's comments wo n't do much for german-polish goodwill ahead of a key european summit opening later in the day , where her eu presidency 's plans for a reform treaty will be put to the test , merkel said everyone " can contribute their ideas " but that an agreement was necessary .
" i hope we can all work together in the right spirit to come to a fair agreement because the european union needs to be capable of acting in order to solve the many problems in the world with collective solutions , " she said at a meeting of conservative leaders near brussels .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , at the same gathering , stressed the need for reform so the eu 's institutions can adjust to its growing size .
" we need to reinforce the capacity of the european union to act , " he said .
" with 27 you can not have the same rules as with 12 . " 50-50 chances luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , the eu 's longest-serving leader still in office , put the chances of a summit agreement at " 50-50 " and warned that no further eu enlargement would be possible without a new treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw -lrb- l -rrb- and lech kaczynski have threatened to veto the eu treaty if their concerns are not addressed dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende joined the chorus seeking a deal , despite holding out for more power for national parliaments .
" we need to reach consensus , because if you do not have success now , is there a guarantee that you will get it after six months ? " he asked .
in addition to the polish question mark , british objections to parts of merkel 's plans could yet scupper an accord .
britain has warned that it would prefer no agreement to a bad deal , while polish leaders have said their country is even " willing to die " to defend its corner . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the remarks were confirmed by the broadcaster on thursday .
" we 're only demanding that which was taken from us , " kaczynski said afterwards in an interview .
" if poland had not experienced the years between 1939 and 1945 , it would today be a country of 66 million if you look at the demographic data . "
during world war two , which began when nazi germany invaded poland in september 1939 , around 6.5 million poles died , including three million polish jews .
that was about one-fourth of the pre-war population .
today , poland 's population is just under 38 million .

1 , 1939 , setting off world war two the comments are likely to do little to soothe ruffled feathers on both sides of the german-poland border .
the poles have stuck to their threat to veto a watered-down eu treaty at a european union summit opening thursday unless they were given more voting powers .
the polish prime minister said in a german newspaper wednesday that his country would be committing " suicide " if it agreed to the german proposals on the voting system .
" they are trying to isolate and ignore poland .
we can not agree to that .
that would be suicide , " he told the mass-circulation bild .
poland , the biggest of the ex-communist states that joined the eu in 2004 , opposes the planned " double majority " system for making decisions affecting the entire bloc .
the polish demands have been opposed by 25 eu states , with only the czech republic voicing support .
" fair agreement " german chancellor angela merkel on thursday urged her fellow european union leaders to work together for a " fair agreement " on a treaty to reform the eu 's creaking institutions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's comments wo n't do much for german-polish goodwill ahead of a key european summit opening later in the day , where her eu presidency 's plans for a reform treaty will be put to the test , merkel said everyone " can contribute their ideas " but that an agreement was necessary .
" i hope we can all work together in the right spirit to come to a fair agreement because the european union needs to be capable of acting in order to solve the many problems in the world with collective solutions , " she said at a meeting of conservative leaders near brussels .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , at the same gathering , stressed the need for reform so the eu 's institutions can adjust to its growing size .

essen will be the first stop in the popular event 's five-year tour . berlin is off the map for the love parade this year as the event 's organizers and local officials agreed on thursday to relocate the popular techno street party to germany 's ruhr region . after dancing down the streets of essen on aug .
25 this year , ravers can continue the party in dortmund , bochum , duisburg and gelsenkirchen in consecutive years .
the region of 5.3 million inhabitants competed against around 60 cities , including barcelona , st. petersburg and munich , to win the contract .
the love parade is expected to attract over a million visitors to the region and 120 million euros -lrb- $ 161 million -rrb- .
its organizers will foot the bill of roughly three million euros for the street party .
" that this event will take place here is an expression of the region 's liveliness , " said essen mayor wolfgang reininger .
hard to host a party the love parade began in berlin in 1989 , and at its peak , in 1999 , drew 1.5 million partygoers who danced to the techno beats blaring from floats on their route through the city 's central tiergarten park .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's tiergarten park did eventually recover disagreements among the organizers , financial problems and conflicts with the city over park damage and waste disposal led to a two-year break for the parade , which resumed in berlin in 2006 .
but the city senate and the organizers were unable to bridge their differences , so the latter started looking for a new host .
essen 's police have already raised concerns about safety during the party .
" the love parade in berlin was held along a green belt , where there was plenty of space for people to evacuate if there was an emergency , " said ulrich fassbender of the city police .
" but things are different here in essen .

the environmental group said it had recently observed containers designated for shipping abroad at the port - germany 's biggest - overflowing with unpacked electrical appliances that appeared to be scrap .
this case and further ones " substantiate the suspicion that again on a grand scale dangerous junk is falsely being declared as merchandise from germany to be disposed of in poor countries , " said duh managing director jürgen resch in berlin .
he said hamburg 's environmental authorities had been informed about the cases and were told that the containers were legitimate merchandise for sale abroad .
a spokesman for hamburg 's harbor police confirmed that the loose monitors were not packed in a way that would have protected them from damage before reaching their destination .
world champion of exported junk ?
under eu laws , old appliances must be dismantled and the metals recycled , which is expensive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is germany 's biggest port however , exporters paid 50 cents to one euro -lrb- $ 0.67 to $ 1.34 -rrb- for a discarded computer monitor , although proper disposal would cost around four euros , resch said .
they then hide the old appliances under ones that appear fully functional in containers designated as goods to be exported for sale , he added .
the result was that companies that abided by the law were given a bad name .
volker dumann , spokesman for hamburg 's environmental authority , said that with a turnover of around nine million containers per year , systematic checks of containers passing through the harbor were not possible .
" we 're dependent on tips , on well-founded suspicions from within the scene , from the police or customs officials , " he told news agency afp .
duh 's resch called on the german government to put an end to the illegal export of electrical waste and scrapped cars .
" otherwise the term ' germany is export world champion ' will soon acquire a new , unappetizing resonance , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

never before has a woman been allowed to referee a men 's match at that high a level in germany . bibiana steinhaus is no stranger to whistle-blowing .
in addition to being a soccer referee , the hanover resident works as a policewoman .
but as of august , she 'll be entering uncharted territory - the bundesliga 's second division . female refs have occasionally directed upper-division men 's matches in other countries , but they remain the exception around the world . steinhaus has officiated men 's matches in the third division since 2001 and has served as an assistant in the second division since 2004 .
now in 2007-8 , she 'll be given the chance to run the show at that level . the 28-year-old says her police work is good preparation for refereeing . " i apply the rules and make sure that everything is above board , " steinhaus said in an interview with soccer 's governing body fifa . " i have executive responsibilities , as it were , in both of my jobs , which is a real advantage . " " it 's all about performance , " said the head of the german soccer association 's refereeing committee , volker roth , when the promotion was announced .
" it 's ms. steinhaus ' turn .
i 'm very optimistic that she will continue to perform in the second division . " no special treatment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinhaus wears her love of the game on her hand steinhaus said she had been the target of verbal abuse of in her previous refereeing duties but quickly added that it was nothing she could n't handle . and since she 's well over six feet tall , players may think twice about throwing around any sexist remarks if they feel disadvantaged by a decision . in 1995 , another female referee served as a second-division assistant but only lasted a pair of games .
steinhaus intends to stick around for far longer than that . " i want to prove that conditions are the same for men and women in the working world and as referees , " she said at her introductory press conference .

never before has a woman been allowed to referee a men 's match at that high a level in germany . bibiana steinhaus is no stranger to whistle-blowing .
in addition to being a soccer referee , the hanover resident works as a policewoman .
but as of august , she 'll be entering uncharted territory - the bundesliga 's second division . female refs have occasionally directed upper-division men 's matches in other countries , but they remain the exception around the world . steinhaus has officiated men 's matches in the third division since 2001 and has served as an assistant in the second division since 2004 .
now in 2007-8 , she 'll be given the chance to run the show at that level . the 28-year-old says her police work is good preparation for refereeing . " i apply the rules and make sure that everything is above board , " steinhaus said in an interview with soccer 's governing body fifa . " i have executive responsibilities , as it were , in both of my jobs , which is a real advantage . " " it 's all about performance , " said the head of the german soccer association 's refereeing committee , volker roth , when the promotion was announced .
" it 's ms. steinhaus ' turn .
i 'm very optimistic that she will continue to perform in the second division . " no special treatment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinhaus wears her love of the game on her hand steinhaus said she had been the target of verbal abuse of in her previous refereeing duties but quickly added that it was nothing she could n't handle . and since she 's well over six feet tall , players may think twice about throwing around any sexist remarks if they feel disadvantaged by a decision . in 1995 , another female referee served as a second-division assistant but only lasted a pair of games .
steinhaus intends to stick around for far longer than that . " i want to prove that conditions are the same for men and women in the working world and as referees , " she said at her introductory press conference .

dw-world.de talked to a german aerospace medical expert about the experiment . rupert gerzer directs the institute of aerospace medicine in cologne , which is participating in the simulated mars mission . dw-world.de : the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is looking for two volunteers that - together with four russians - will participate in a mars mission .
including " flight time , " the participants will have to spend 520 days in metal tanks in moscow .
what will be required of them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claustrophobes need not apply rupert gerzer : first of all , candidates have to be healthy .
secondly , they have to have a psychological state of mind that prevents them from getting depressed when they 're locked up in a can for 520 days .
they also have to be compatible with the rest of the group and have no interest in dominating the others .
apart from that , they have to be able to work like a scientist on a mars mission . every crew member gets a personal space of three square meters -lrb- 32 square feet -rrb- .
there 's a common living room , a kitchen and a toilet .
esa calls it a study in isolation and confinement .
that does n't sound particularly enticing .
why should someone participate as a volunteer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupert gerzer it 's surprising how many people want to do it .

they say : if i can not be a real astronaut , then my confinement can at least help to conduct these missions in the future . there wo n't be a shower during the 520 days , but there will be a sauna .
as a space mission physician , can you explain why a sauna , of all things , is needed ? -lrb- laughs -rrb- that 's a russian specialty . the experiment sounds a bit like the tv show " big brother . "

we want to know them and find out how to solve them . after the experiment , potential long-term effects will be examined for another year .

lawyers said there was no charges of forming a terrorist organization because under german law , at least three people are required to constitute such a group .
both suspects were seen on closed-circuit tv at the cologne train station carrying booby-trapped suitcases into trains and were caught within weeks . police said neither of the bombs exploded because of a mistake in their construction .
" a detonation could have led in both cases to a significant blast and additionally a catalyst within the ' bomb trolleys ' could have unleashed a fireball , " the federal prosecutor 's office said in a statement .

the timer and detonator are reported to have gone off without detonating the main explosive .
one of the bags was later handed in as lost property .
the charges will maintain that the two main suspects , who were living in germany , decided in april 2006 to harm their host country to protest publication by newspapers of cartoons they believed were insulting to the prophet mohammed .
police , who said they had gathered substantial dna evidence against both youssef mohamad e.h and jihad h. , have investigated two other men but had not found sufficient evidence to charge them . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the environmental group said it had recently observed containers designated for shipping abroad at the port - germany 's biggest - overflowing with unpacked electrical appliances that appeared to be scrap .
this case and further ones " substantiate the suspicion that again on a grand scale dangerous junk is falsely being declared as merchandise from germany to be disposed of in poor countries , " said duh managing director jürgen resch in berlin .
he said hamburg 's environmental authorities had been informed about the cases and were told that the containers were legitimate merchandise for sale abroad .
a spokesman for hamburg 's harbor police confirmed that the loose monitors were not packed in a way that would have protected them from damage before reaching their destination .
world champion of exported junk ?
under eu laws , old appliances must be dismantled and the metals recycled , which is expensive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is germany 's biggest port however , exporters paid 50 cents to one euro -lrb- $ 0.67 to $ 1.34 -rrb- for a discarded computer monitor , although proper disposal would cost around four euros , resch said .
they then hide the old appliances under ones that appear fully functional in containers designated as goods to be exported for sale , he added .
the result was that companies that abided by the law were given a bad name .
volker dumann , spokesman for hamburg 's environmental authority , said that with a turnover of around nine million containers per year , systematic checks of containers passing through the harbor were not possible .
" we 're dependent on tips , on well-founded suspicions from within the scene , from the police or customs officials , " he told news agency afp .
duh 's resch called on the german government to put an end to the illegal export of electrical waste and scrapped cars .
" otherwise the term ' germany is export world champion ' will soon acquire a new , unappetizing resonance , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" glonass makes the armed forces more flexible and weapons systems more precise , " he said .
" there has been no attempt from the us side to renew control treaties ; that is another reason why moscow is starting up . " situation changed since soviet-us talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts debate if the us missile shield is really the cause behind russia 's arms program russia has felt pressured to expand its aerospace weapons capabilities by a us decision to exclude defensive systems from the 2002 anti-ballistic missile treaty in order to develop its national missile defense , part of which us military planners want to locate in poland and the czech republic , neuneck added . " the soviet-american treaty -lrb- on intermediate nuclear forces -rrb- is not effective because since -lrb- its signature -rrb- scores of countries have appeared that have such missiles , while russia and the united states are not allowed to have them , " ivanov told a military-industrial commission , reuters reported .
" in these conditions , it is necessary to provide our troops with modern , high-precision weapons . " missile shield only a pretext ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money from energy exports enables russia to modernize its military but hannes adomeit , a russia expert from the german institute for international and security affairs , said the us missile defense system is only the cover the kremlin was looking for to renew its missile arsenal . " without the planned missile defense , moscow would still arm itself in the same way , " he added . among the new weapons are short-range iskander-m missiles as well as rs-24 intercontinental ballistic missiles , which can be armed with up to 10 warheads , both of which were tested in may .
ivanov has said the two missile systems have been designed to overpower all existing and planned missile defense systems . recouping lost prestige matthes buhbe , head of the friedrich ebert stiftung 's moscow office said there has been scant criticism of the missile plans from the russian public . " from the left to the right , everyone is excited , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said putin is highly interested in restoring russia 's previous stature a cold war mentality is still present in the kremlin , and russia is interested in reclaiming the international influence it had as the soviet union , adomeit said .

never before has a woman been allowed to referee a men 's match at that high a level in germany . bibiana steinhaus is no stranger to whistle-blowing .
in addition to being a soccer referee , the hanover resident works as a policewoman .
but as of august , she 'll be entering uncharted territory - the bundesliga 's second division . female refs have occasionally directed upper-division men 's matches in other countries , but they remain the exception around the world . steinhaus has officiated men 's matches in the third division since 2001 and has served as an assistant in the second division since 2004 .
now in 2007-8 , she 'll be given the chance to run the show at that level . the 28-year-old says her police work is good preparation for refereeing . " i apply the rules and make sure that everything is above board , " steinhaus said in an interview with soccer 's governing body fifa . " i have executive responsibilities , as it were , in both of my jobs , which is a real advantage . " " it 's all about performance , " said the head of the german soccer association 's refereeing committee , volker roth , when the promotion was announced .
" it 's ms. steinhaus ' turn .
i 'm very optimistic that she will continue to perform in the second division . " no special treatment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinhaus wears her love of the game on her hand steinhaus said she had been the target of verbal abuse of in her previous refereeing duties but quickly added that it was nothing she could n't handle . and since she 's well over six feet tall , players may think twice about throwing around any sexist remarks if they feel disadvantaged by a decision . in 1995 , another female referee served as a second-division assistant but only lasted a pair of games .
steinhaus intends to stick around for far longer than that . " i want to prove that conditions are the same for men and women in the working world and as referees , " she said at her introductory press conference .
" i know i wo n't get any special treatment . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 21.06.2007 russian bear aiming to recover former military roar großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia plans to launch 20 satellites that could help steer intercontinental missiles by 2010 ambitious plans for new satellite and rocket programs reflect russia 's attempts to flex its muscle and recover lost prestige on the international stage , say german experts . sergei ivanov , one of russia 's two deputy prime ministers , announced this week that russia would expand its aerospace defense and satellite programs by launching a total of 20 additional satellites into orbit by 2010 for its glonass navigation system . the system , which moscow is developing as a counterweight to both the us gps and european galileo satellite navigation systems , could also be used to steer cruise missiles , according to götz neuneck , an armaments expert at hamburg university 's institute for peace research and security policy . " glonass makes the armed forces more flexible and weapons systems more precise , " he said .
" there has been no attempt from the us side to renew control treaties ; that is another reason why moscow is starting up . " situation changed since soviet-us talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts debate if the us missile shield is really the cause behind russia 's arms program russia has felt pressured to expand its aerospace weapons capabilities by a us decision to exclude defensive systems from the 2002 anti-ballistic missile treaty in order to develop its national missile defense , part of which us military planners want to locate in poland and the czech republic , neuneck added . " the soviet-american treaty -lrb- on intermediate nuclear forces -rrb- is not effective because since -lrb- its signature -rrb- scores of countries have appeared that have such missiles , while russia and the united states are not allowed to have them , " ivanov told a military-industrial commission , reuters reported .
" in these conditions , it is necessary to provide our troops with modern , high-precision weapons . " missile shield only a pretext ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money from energy exports enables russia to modernize its military but hannes adomeit , a russia expert from the german institute for international and security affairs , said the us missile defense system is only the cover the kremlin was looking for to renew its missile arsenal . " without the planned missile defense , moscow would still arm itself in the same way , " he added . among the new weapons are short-range iskander-m missiles as well as rs-24 intercontinental ballistic missiles , which can be armed with up to 10 warheads , both of which were tested in may .
ivanov has said the two missile systems have been designed to overpower all existing and planned missile defense systems . recouping lost prestige matthes buhbe , head of the friedrich ebert stiftung 's moscow office said there has been scant criticism of the missile plans from the russian public . " from the left to the right , everyone is excited , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said putin is highly interested in restoring russia 's previous stature a cold war mentality is still present in the kremlin , and russia is interested in reclaiming the international influence it had as the soviet union , adomeit said . " russian president vladimir putin wants to position russia as a world power and prove that it is a nuclear equal with the usa , " he said . policy should be taken seriously experts consider nearly 80 percent of the russian arsenal to be out-of-date , making the current potential for escalation small when compared to the political situation of the 80s .
but as some $ 150 billion -lrb- 112 billion euros -rrb- in income from gas and oil exports fills russian coffers , the defense department announced it had quadrupled military spending from 2000 to 2006 . the west , and europe in particular , should take moscow 's change of position seriously and push for new arms control treaties , neuneck said . " the europeans are again caught between the russian and american nuclear mill-stones , " he said , adding that the danger of conflict increases as arms programs replace non-proliferation talks .

the remarks were confirmed by the broadcaster on thursday .

" if poland had not experienced the years between 1939 and 1945 , it would today be a country of 66 million if you look at the demographic data . "

the polish demands have been opposed by 25 eu states , with only the czech republic voicing support .

" i hope we can all work together in the right spirit to come to a fair agreement because the european union needs to be capable of acting in order to solve the many problems in the world with collective solutions , " she said at a meeting of conservative leaders near brussels .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , at the same gathering , stressed the need for reform so the eu 's institutions can adjust to its growing size .
" we need to reinforce the capacity of the european union to act , " he said .
" with 27 you can not have the same rules as with 12 . " 50-50 chances luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , the eu 's longest-serving leader still in office , put the chances of a summit agreement at " 50-50 " and warned that no further eu enlargement would be possible without a new treaty .

" we need to reach consensus , because if you do not have success now , is there a guarantee that you will get it after six months ? " he asked .
in addition to the polish question mark , british objections to parts of merkel 's plans could yet scupper an accord .

dw-world.de talked to a german aerospace medical expert about the experiment . rupert gerzer directs the institute of aerospace medicine in cologne , which is participating in the simulated mars mission . dw-world.de : the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is looking for two volunteers that - together with four russians - will participate in a mars mission .
including " flight time , " the participants will have to spend 520 days in metal tanks in moscow .
what will be required of them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claustrophobes need not apply rupert gerzer : first of all , candidates have to be healthy .
secondly , they have to have a psychological state of mind that prevents them from getting depressed when they 're locked up in a can for 520 days .
they also have to be compatible with the rest of the group and have no interest in dominating the others .
apart from that , they have to be able to work like a scientist on a mars mission . every crew member gets a personal space of three square meters -lrb- 32 square feet -rrb- .
there 's a common living room , a kitchen and a toilet .
esa calls it a study in isolation and confinement .
that does n't sound particularly enticing .
why should someone participate as a volunteer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupert gerzer it 's surprising how many people want to do it .
i have a full-blown scientist working in my institute who participated in the last study and who 's dying to collaborate in moscow .
a lot of people are fascinated by the idea of taking part in a space mission .
they say : if i can not be a real astronaut , then my confinement can at least help to conduct these missions in the future . there wo n't be a shower during the 520 days , but there will be a sauna .
as a space mission physician , can you explain why a sauna , of all things , is needed ? -lrb- laughs -rrb- that 's a russian specialty . the experiment sounds a bit like the tv show " big brother . "
would n't it be good for space exploration to broadcast live ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rendering of the fake mars mission tank we do n't want to examine tv stars , but find out how an isolated group reacts on the way to mars .
people inside the tank will behave according to how public the whole thing is .
we want to simulate real life or at least approximate it as much as possible .
there could be problems and there will be problems .
we want to know them and find out how to solve them . after the experiment , potential long-term effects will be examined for another year .
is there a chance for people to become a real astronaut if they get through the 520 days ? on the russian side there are people that are aspiring astronauts .
anyone who gets through the 520 days and does well could be accepted to the russian astronaut program .
esa will select new astronauts in 2008 .

" people in europe and all over the world expect us to bring this to a fruitful conclusion , " said merkel , who is chairing the summit .
germany ends its six-month stint as eu president at the end of june .
eu leaders will spend the next two days - expected to stretch into three days - trying to agree on the outlines of a new " reform " or amended treaty to replace a draft constitution vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
but signalling hours of hard bargaining ahead , outgoing british prime minister tony blair insisted he would not tone down key demands for changes in the treaty proposals drawn up merkel .
" this is going to be a very tough negotiation , " blair said as he came into the meeting .
however , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , a backer of the original draft constitution , said he would not agree to a treaty that " lacks substance . "
polish president lech kaczynski made no comments as he greeted merkel .
but poland 's demands for an overhaul of eu voting rights has emerged as a major headache for merkel 's efforts to clinch a treaty deal at the summit .

the environmental group said it had recently observed containers designated for shipping abroad at the port - germany 's biggest - overflowing with unpacked electrical appliances that appeared to be scrap .
this case and further ones " substantiate the suspicion that again on a grand scale dangerous junk is falsely being declared as merchandise from germany to be disposed of in poor countries , " said duh managing director jürgen resch in berlin .
he said hamburg 's environmental authorities had been informed about the cases and were told that the containers were legitimate merchandise for sale abroad .
a spokesman for hamburg 's harbor police confirmed that the loose monitors were not packed in a way that would have protected them from damage before reaching their destination .
world champion of exported junk ?
under eu laws , old appliances must be dismantled and the metals recycled , which is expensive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is germany 's biggest port however , exporters paid 50 cents to one euro -lrb- $ 0.67 to $ 1.34 -rrb- for a discarded computer monitor , although proper disposal would cost around four euros , resch said .
they then hide the old appliances under ones that appear fully functional in containers designated as goods to be exported for sale , he added .
the result was that companies that abided by the law were given a bad name .
volker dumann , spokesman for hamburg 's environmental authority , said that with a turnover of around nine million containers per year , systematic checks of containers passing through the harbor were not possible .
" we 're dependent on tips , on well-founded suspicions from within the scene , from the police or customs officials , " he told news agency afp .
duh 's resch called on the german government to put an end to the illegal export of electrical waste and scrapped cars .
" otherwise the term ' germany is export world champion ' will soon acquire a new , unappetizing resonance , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" people in europe and all over the world expect us to bring this to a fruitful conclusion , " said merkel , who is chairing the summit .
germany ends its six-month stint as eu president at the end of june .
eu leaders will spend the next two days - expected to stretch into three days - trying to agree on the outlines of a new " reform " or amended treaty to replace a draft constitution vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 .
but signalling hours of hard bargaining ahead , outgoing british prime minister tony blair insisted he would not tone down key demands for changes in the treaty proposals drawn up merkel .
" this is going to be a very tough negotiation , " blair said as he came into the meeting .
however , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , a backer of the original draft constitution , said he would not agree to a treaty that " lacks substance . "
polish president lech kaczynski made no comments as he greeted merkel .
but poland 's demands for an overhaul of eu voting rights has emerged as a major headache for merkel 's efforts to clinch a treaty deal at the summit .

the environmental group said it had recently observed containers designated for shipping abroad at the port - germany 's biggest - overflowing with unpacked electrical appliances that appeared to be scrap .
this case and further ones " substantiate the suspicion that again on a grand scale dangerous junk is falsely being declared as merchandise from germany to be disposed of in poor countries , " said duh managing director jürgen resch in berlin .
he said hamburg 's environmental authorities had been informed about the cases and were told that the containers were legitimate merchandise for sale abroad .
a spokesman for hamburg 's harbor police confirmed that the loose monitors were not packed in a way that would have protected them from damage before reaching their destination .
world champion of exported junk ?
under eu laws , old appliances must be dismantled and the metals recycled , which is expensive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is germany 's biggest port however , exporters paid 50 cents to one euro -lrb- $ 0.67 to $ 1.34 -rrb- for a discarded computer monitor , although proper disposal would cost around four euros , resch said .
they then hide the old appliances under ones that appear fully functional in containers designated as goods to be exported for sale , he added .
the result was that companies that abided by the law were given a bad name .
volker dumann , spokesman for hamburg 's environmental authority , said that with a turnover of around nine million containers per year , systematic checks of containers passing through the harbor were not possible .
" we 're dependent on tips , on well-founded suspicions from within the scene , from the police or customs officials , " he told news agency afp .
duh 's resch called on the german government to put an end to the illegal export of electrical waste and scrapped cars .
" otherwise the term ' germany is export world champion ' will soon acquire a new , unappetizing resonance , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the environmental group said it had recently observed containers designated for shipping abroad at the port - germany 's biggest - overflowing with unpacked electrical appliances that appeared to be scrap .
this case and further ones " substantiate the suspicion that again on a grand scale dangerous junk is falsely being declared as merchandise from germany to be disposed of in poor countries , " said duh managing director jürgen resch in berlin .
he said hamburg 's environmental authorities had been informed about the cases and were told that the containers were legitimate merchandise for sale abroad .
a spokesman for hamburg 's harbor police confirmed that the loose monitors were not packed in a way that would have protected them from damage before reaching their destination .
world champion of exported junk ?
under eu laws , old appliances must be dismantled and the metals recycled , which is expensive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is germany 's biggest port however , exporters paid 50 cents to one euro -lrb- $ 0.67 to $ 1.34 -rrb- for a discarded computer monitor , although proper disposal would cost around four euros , resch said .
they then hide the old appliances under ones that appear fully functional in containers designated as goods to be exported for sale , he added .
the result was that companies that abided by the law were given a bad name .
volker dumann , spokesman for hamburg 's environmental authority , said that with a turnover of around nine million containers per year , systematic checks of containers passing through the harbor were not possible .
" we 're dependent on tips , on well-founded suspicions from within the scene , from the police or customs officials , " he told news agency afp .
duh 's resch called on the german government to put an end to the illegal export of electrical waste and scrapped cars .

" glonass makes the armed forces more flexible and weapons systems more precise , " he said .

" glonass makes the armed forces more flexible and weapons systems more precise , " he said .
" there has been no attempt from the us side to renew control treaties ; that is another reason why moscow is starting up .

" the soviet-american treaty -lrb- on intermediate nuclear forces -rrb- is not effective because since -lrb- its signature -rrb- scores of countries have appeared that have such missiles , while russia and the united states are not allowed to have them , " ivanov told a military-industrial commission , reuters reported .

" missile shield only a pretext ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money from energy exports enables russia to modernize its military but hannes adomeit , a russia expert from the german institute for international and security affairs , said the us missile defense system is only the cover the kremlin was looking for to renew its missile arsenal . " without the planned missile defense , moscow would still arm itself in the same way , " he added . among the new weapons are short-range iskander-m missiles as well as rs-24 intercontinental ballistic missiles , which can be armed with up to 10 warheads , both of which were tested in may .
ivanov has said the two missile systems have been designed to overpower all existing and planned missile defense systems . recouping lost prestige matthes buhbe , head of the friedrich ebert stiftung 's moscow office said there has been scant criticism of the missile plans from the russian public . " from the left to the right , everyone is excited , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said putin is highly interested in restoring russia 's previous stature a cold war mentality is still present in the kremlin , and russia is interested in reclaiming the international influence it had as the soviet union , adomeit said . " russian president vladimir putin wants to position russia as a world power and prove that it is a nuclear equal with the usa , " he said . policy should be taken seriously experts consider nearly 80 percent of the russian arsenal to be out-of-date , making the current potential for escalation small when compared to the political situation of the 80s .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 21.06.2007 russian bear aiming to recover former military roar großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia plans to launch 20 satellites that could help steer intercontinental missiles by 2010 ambitious plans for new satellite and rocket programs reflect russia 's attempts to flex its muscle and recover lost prestige on the international stage , say german experts . sergei ivanov , one of russia 's two deputy prime ministers , announced this week that russia would expand its aerospace defense and satellite programs by launching a total of 20 additional satellites into orbit by 2010 for its glonass navigation system . the system , which moscow is developing as a counterweight to both the us gps and european galileo satellite navigation systems , could also be used to steer cruise missiles , according to götz neuneck , an armaments expert at hamburg university 's institute for peace research and security policy . " glonass makes the armed forces more flexible and weapons systems more precise , " he said .
" there has been no attempt from the us side to renew control treaties ; that is another reason why moscow is starting up . " situation changed since soviet-us talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts debate if the us missile shield is really the cause behind russia 's arms program russia has felt pressured to expand its aerospace weapons capabilities by a us decision to exclude defensive systems from the 2002 anti-ballistic missile treaty in order to develop its national missile defense , part of which us military planners want to locate in poland and the czech republic , neuneck added . " the soviet-american treaty -lrb- on intermediate nuclear forces -rrb- is not effective because since -lrb- its signature -rrb- scores of countries have appeared that have such missiles , while russia and the united states are not allowed to have them , " ivanov told a military-industrial commission , reuters reported .
" in these conditions , it is necessary to provide our troops with modern , high-precision weapons . " missile shield only a pretext ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money from energy exports enables russia to modernize its military but hannes adomeit , a russia expert from the german institute for international and security affairs , said the us missile defense system is only the cover the kremlin was looking for to renew its missile arsenal . " without the planned missile defense , moscow would still arm itself in the same way , " he added . among the new weapons are short-range iskander-m missiles as well as rs-24 intercontinental ballistic missiles , which can be armed with up to 10 warheads , both of which were tested in may .
ivanov has said the two missile systems have been designed to overpower all existing and planned missile defense systems . recouping lost prestige matthes buhbe , head of the friedrich ebert stiftung 's moscow office said there has been scant criticism of the missile plans from the russian public . " from the left to the right , everyone is excited , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said putin is highly interested in restoring russia 's previous stature a cold war mentality is still present in the kremlin , and russia is interested in reclaiming the international influence it had as the soviet union , adomeit said . " russian president vladimir putin wants to position russia as a world power and prove that it is a nuclear equal with the usa , " he said . policy should be taken seriously experts consider nearly 80 percent of the russian arsenal to be out-of-date , making the current potential for escalation small when compared to the political situation of the 80s .
but as some $ 150 billion -lrb- 112 billion euros -rrb- in income from gas and oil exports fills russian coffers , the defense department announced it had quadrupled military spending from 2000 to 2006 . the west , and europe in particular , should take moscow 's change of position seriously and push for new arms control treaties , neuneck said . " the europeans are again caught between the russian and american nuclear mill-stones , " he said , adding that the danger of conflict increases as arms programs replace non-proliferation talks .

essen will be the first stop in the popular event 's five-year tour . berlin is off the map for the love parade this year as the event 's organizers and local officials agreed on thursday to relocate the popular techno street party to germany 's ruhr region . after dancing down the streets of essen on aug .
25 this year , ravers can continue the party in dortmund , bochum , duisburg and gelsenkirchen in consecutive years .
the region of 5.3 million inhabitants competed against around 60 cities , including barcelona , st. petersburg and munich , to win the contract .
the love parade is expected to attract over a million visitors to the region and 120 million euros -lrb- $ 161 million -rrb- .
its organizers will foot the bill of roughly three million euros for the street party .
" that this event will take place here is an expression of the region 's liveliness , " said essen mayor wolfgang reininger .
hard to host a party the love parade began in berlin in 1989 , and at its peak , in 1999 , drew 1.5 million partygoers who danced to the techno beats blaring from floats on their route through the city 's central tiergarten park .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's tiergarten park did eventually recover disagreements among the organizers , financial problems and conflicts with the city over park damage and waste disposal led to a two-year break for the parade , which resumed in berlin in 2006 .
but the city senate and the organizers were unable to bridge their differences , so the latter started looking for a new host .
essen 's police have already raised concerns about safety during the party .
" the love parade in berlin was held along a green belt , where there was plenty of space for people to evacuate if there was an emergency , " said ulrich fassbender of the city police .
" but things are different here in essen .
we have some four-lane roads along the route , but if you imagine a crowd of 700,000 , it 's clear that they 'll be very crowded .
if panic breaks out for some reason , there 's not much room for people to escape quickly . " dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he could prove a valuable ally to german chancelor merkel . leaders of the european union 's 27 member states hope the two-day summit in brussels will clear the way for a simplified treaty to replace the doomed constitution , blocked by french and dutch referendums in 2005 . it is sarkozy 's first european summit since he was elected president on may 6 , promising a major diplomatic drive to break the eu 's insitutional deadlock . sarkozy told lawmakers from his right-wing ruling party wednesday he was expecting " two very difficult days starting tomorrow , since what is at stake is nothing less than pulling europe out of immobility . " diplomatic push for the past month , sarkozy has been engaged in telephone diplomacy and meetings from warsaw to madrid to boost the chances of an agreement this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy consulted with far-right leader le pen , a political pariah to most he has also held consultations with french political leaders of all stripes - including with far-right leader jean-marie le pen , normally a pariah in french politics - before heading to the negotiating table in brussels . germany , which holds the eu 's presidency until the end of the month , hopes member states will adopt a text outlining the treaty 's contents , and setting a mandate for an intergovernmental conference to hammer out a final version . sarkozy 's spokesman said tuesday the french president was determined " to support the german presidency as much as possible " and to " do everything to contribute to its success . " for jean-dominique giuliani , president of the robert schuman foundation in paris , sarkozy has a key role to play . " france is the main culprit for the current deadlock .
after the french ' no ' , france stopped talking to the rest of europe .
there were no explanations for the ' no ' , nor counter-proposals , " giuliani said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french ' no ' vote in 2005 shook the eu " from the moment he agrees to get things moving again , sarkozy 's voice counts . " " sarkozy is freshly elected , he represents one of the main founding nations , he makes pro-european statements , gets his picture taken with the european flag .
all this is being watched very closely by our partners . " simplified document sarkozy backs the idea of a simplified treaty - creating a permanent eu president and foreign minister and reforming the eu voting system - that could be adopted without another referendum , allowing more time for complex questions such as european enlargement or defense policy . according to giuliani - although the french president has been careful to respect german chancellor angela merkel 's mandate as eu president - the german text being circulated in brussels takes his key proposals into account . poland and britain remain the key obstacles to clinching a deal .
poland , the biggest of 10 countries to join the eu in 2004 , is resisting changes to the voting system that it says will penalize small and medium-sized countries . last week , sarkozy became the latest in a steady flow of european leaders to visit warsaw to try to convince its leaders not to stand in the way of a new , simplified treaty for the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk is not very enthusiastic about a big treaty either on tuesday he agreed in telephone talks with british prime minister tony blair on the principle of an " amending " treaty and warned against attempts to revive the moribund constitution itself . he has reached a similar agreement with dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , equally keen to avoid holding a second referendum . but the french presidency has been cautious over the chances for a deal , a spokesman saying tuesday that there were still " strong reservations " over the proposed treaty and that an agreement was far from assured . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" glonass makes the armed forces more flexible and weapons systems more precise , " he said .
" there has been no attempt from the us side to renew control treaties ; that is another reason why moscow is starting up . " situation changed since soviet-us talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts debate if the us missile shield is really the cause behind russia 's arms program russia has felt pressured to expand its aerospace weapons capabilities by a us decision to exclude defensive systems from the 2002 anti-ballistic missile treaty in order to develop its national missile defense , part of which us military planners want to locate in poland and the czech republic , neuneck added . " the soviet-american treaty -lrb- on intermediate nuclear forces -rrb- is not effective because since -lrb- its signature -rrb- scores of countries have appeared that have such missiles , while russia and the united states are not allowed to have them , " ivanov told a military-industrial commission , reuters reported .
" in these conditions , it is necessary to provide our troops with modern , high-precision weapons . " missile shield only a pretext ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money from energy exports enables russia to modernize its military but hannes adomeit , a russia expert from the german institute for international and security affairs , said the us missile defense system is only the cover the kremlin was looking for to renew its missile arsenal . " without the planned missile defense , moscow would still arm itself in the same way , " he added . among the new weapons are short-range iskander-m missiles as well as rs-24 intercontinental ballistic missiles , which can be armed with up to 10 warheads , both of which were tested in may .
ivanov has said the two missile systems have been designed to overpower all existing and planned missile defense systems . recouping lost prestige matthes buhbe , head of the friedrich ebert stiftung 's moscow office said there has been scant criticism of the missile plans from the russian public . " from the left to the right , everyone is excited , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said putin is highly interested in restoring russia 's previous stature a cold war mentality is still present in the kremlin , and russia is interested in reclaiming the international influence it had as the soviet union , adomeit said . " russian president vladimir putin wants to position russia as a world power and prove that it is a nuclear equal with the usa , " he said . policy should be taken seriously experts consider nearly 80 percent of the russian arsenal to be out-of-date , making the current potential for escalation small when compared to the political situation of the 80s .
but as some $ 150 billion -lrb- 112 billion euros -rrb- in income from gas and oil exports fills russian coffers , the defense department announced it had quadrupled military spending from 2000 to 2006 . the west , and europe in particular , should take moscow 's change of position seriously and push for new arms control treaties , neuneck said .

additional suspects are already on trial in lebanon . the prosecutor 's office in karlsruhe said the charges against youssef mohamad e.h. would be limited to " an unspecified number of counts of attempted murder " and attempting to cause an explosion and would not include membership in a terrorist organization .
lawyers said there was no charges of forming a terrorist organization because under german law , at least three people are required to constitute such a group .
both suspects were seen on closed-circuit tv at the cologne train station carrying booby-trapped suitcases into trains and were caught within weeks . police said neither of the bombs exploded because of a mistake in their construction .
" a detonation could have led in both cases to a significant blast and additionally a catalyst within the ' bomb trolleys ' could have unleashed a fireball , " the federal prosecutor 's office said in a statement .
second trial in lebanon underway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : video surveillance is said to have played a major role in identifying the suspects the next move is for the north-rhine westphalia state court in düsseldorf to formally accept the case for trial .
the 22-year-old lebanese man is the prime suspect in what was an apparent attempt to explode suitcase bombs on two regional trains on july 31 , 2006 . he is currently being held in a berlin jail where investigators said he refuses to answer questions .
he and jihad h. , on trial with three other alleged accomplices in lebanon since april , were filmed at cologne station with suitcases .
in beirut , jihad h. has admitted the plot to german and lebanese police , prosecutors said , bomb turned in to lost and found bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamad e.h. is accused of " an unspecified number of counts of attempted murder " had the bombs exploded , they would have created a 30-meter -lrb- 98-foot -rrb- high fireball that would have badly damaged the trains and likely have caused many deaths , german prosecutors said .
the timer and detonator are reported to have gone off without detonating the main explosive .
one of the bags was later handed in as lost property .
the charges will maintain that the two main suspects , who were living in germany , decided in april 2006 to harm their host country to protest publication by newspapers of cartoons they believed were insulting to the prophet mohammed .
police , who said they had gathered substantial dna evidence against both youssef mohamad e.h and jihad h. , have investigated two other men but had not found sufficient evidence to charge them . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" glonass makes the armed forces more flexible and weapons systems more precise , " he said .
" there has been no attempt from the us side to renew control treaties ; that is another reason why moscow is starting up . " situation changed since soviet-us talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts debate if the us missile shield is really the cause behind russia 's arms program russia has felt pressured to expand its aerospace weapons capabilities by a us decision to exclude defensive systems from the 2002 anti-ballistic missile treaty in order to develop its national missile defense , part of which us military planners want to locate in poland and the czech republic , neuneck added . " the soviet-american treaty -lrb- on intermediate nuclear forces -rrb- is not effective because since -lrb- its signature -rrb- scores of countries have appeared that have such missiles , while russia and the united states are not allowed to have them , " ivanov told a military-industrial commission , reuters reported .
" in these conditions , it is necessary to provide our troops with modern , high-precision weapons . " missile shield only a pretext ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money from energy exports enables russia to modernize its military but hannes adomeit , a russia expert from the german institute for international and security affairs , said the us missile defense system is only the cover the kremlin was looking for to renew its missile arsenal . " without the planned missile defense , moscow would still arm itself in the same way , " he added . among the new weapons are short-range iskander-m missiles as well as rs-24 intercontinental ballistic missiles , which can be armed with up to 10 warheads , both of which were tested in may .
ivanov has said the two missile systems have been designed to overpower all existing and planned missile defense systems . recouping lost prestige matthes buhbe , head of the friedrich ebert stiftung 's moscow office said there has been scant criticism of the missile plans from the russian public . " from the left to the right , everyone is excited , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said putin is highly interested in restoring russia 's previous stature a cold war mentality is still present in the kremlin , and russia is interested in reclaiming the international influence it had as the soviet union , adomeit said . " russian president vladimir putin wants to position russia as a world power and prove that it is a nuclear equal with the usa , " he said . policy should be taken seriously experts consider nearly 80 percent of the russian arsenal to be out-of-date , making the current potential for escalation small when compared to the political situation of the 80s .
but as some $ 150 billion -lrb- 112 billion euros -rrb- in income from gas and oil exports fills russian coffers , the defense department announced it had quadrupled military spending from 2000 to 2006 . the west , and europe in particular , should take moscow 's change of position seriously and push for new arms control treaties , neuneck said . " the europeans are again caught between the russian and american nuclear mill-stones , " he said , adding that the danger of conflict increases as arms programs replace non-proliferation talks .
" instead of negotiations each side is modernizing its own arsenal . " torsten schäfer -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de talked to a german aerospace medical expert about the experiment . rupert gerzer directs the institute of aerospace medicine in cologne , which is participating in the simulated mars mission . dw-world.de : the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is looking for two volunteers that - together with four russians - will participate in a mars mission .
including " flight time , " the participants will have to spend 520 days in metal tanks in moscow .
what will be required of them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claustrophobes need not apply rupert gerzer : first of all , candidates have to be healthy .
secondly , they have to have a psychological state of mind that prevents them from getting depressed when they 're locked up in a can for 520 days .
they also have to be compatible with the rest of the group and have no interest in dominating the others .
apart from that , they have to be able to work like a scientist on a mars mission . every crew member gets a personal space of three square meters -lrb- 32 square feet -rrb- .
there 's a common living room , a kitchen and a toilet .
esa calls it a study in isolation and confinement .
that does n't sound particularly enticing .
why should someone participate as a volunteer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupert gerzer it 's surprising how many people want to do it .
i have a full-blown scientist working in my institute who participated in the last study and who 's dying to collaborate in moscow .
a lot of people are fascinated by the idea of taking part in a space mission .
they say : if i can not be a real astronaut , then my confinement can at least help to conduct these missions in the future . there wo n't be a shower during the 520 days , but there will be a sauna .
as a space mission physician , can you explain why a sauna , of all things , is needed ? -lrb- laughs -rrb- that 's a russian specialty . the experiment sounds a bit like the tv show " big brother . "
would n't it be good for space exploration to broadcast live ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rendering of the fake mars mission tank we do n't want to examine tv stars , but find out how an isolated group reacts on the way to mars .
people inside the tank will behave according to how public the whole thing is .
we want to simulate real life or at least approximate it as much as possible .
there could be problems and there will be problems .
we want to know them and find out how to solve them . after the experiment , potential long-term effects will be examined for another year .
is there a chance for people to become a real astronaut if they get through the 520 days ? on the russian side there are people that are aspiring astronauts .
anyone who gets through the 520 days and does well could be accepted to the russian astronaut program .
esa will select new astronauts in 2008 .
anyone who will not be accepted then - because he or she is participating in the study in moscow , for example - does n't stand a chance of becoming an esa astronaut . aarni kuoppamäki interviewed rupert gerzer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but signalling hours of hard bargaining ahead , outgoing british prime minister tony blair insisted he would not tone down key demands for changes in the treaty proposals drawn up merkel .
" this is going to be a very tough negotiation , " blair said as he came into the meeting .
however , luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , a backer of the original draft constitution , said he would not agree to a treaty that " lacks substance . "
polish president lech kaczynski made no comments as he greeted merkel .
but poland 's demands for an overhaul of eu voting rights has emerged as a major headache for merkel 's efforts to clinch a treaty deal at the summit .

the environmental group said it had recently observed containers designated for shipping abroad at the port - germany 's biggest - overflowing with unpacked electrical appliances that appeared to be scrap .
this case and further ones " substantiate the suspicion that again on a grand scale dangerous junk is falsely being declared as merchandise from germany to be disposed of in poor countries , " said duh managing director jürgen resch in berlin .
he said hamburg 's environmental authorities had been informed about the cases and were told that the containers were legitimate merchandise for sale abroad .
a spokesman for hamburg 's harbor police confirmed that the loose monitors were not packed in a way that would have protected them from damage before reaching their destination .
world champion of exported junk ?
under eu laws , old appliances must be dismantled and the metals recycled , which is expensive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is germany 's biggest port however , exporters paid 50 cents to one euro -lrb- $ 0.67 to $ 1.34 -rrb- for a discarded computer monitor , although proper disposal would cost around four euros , resch said .
they then hide the old appliances under ones that appear fully functional in containers designated as goods to be exported for sale , he added .
the result was that companies that abided by the law were given a bad name .
volker dumann , spokesman for hamburg 's environmental authority , said that with a turnover of around nine million containers per year , systematic checks of containers passing through the harbor were not possible .
" we 're dependent on tips , on well-founded suspicions from within the scene , from the police or customs officials , " he told news agency afp .
duh 's resch called on the german government to put an end to the illegal export of electrical waste and scrapped cars .
" otherwise the term ' germany is export world champion ' will soon acquire a new , unappetizing resonance , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

never before has a woman been allowed to referee a men 's match at that high a level in germany . bibiana steinhaus is no stranger to whistle-blowing .
in addition to being a soccer referee , the hanover resident works as a policewoman .
but as of august , she 'll be entering uncharted territory - the bundesliga 's second division . female refs have occasionally directed upper-division men 's matches in other countries , but they remain the exception around the world . steinhaus has officiated men 's matches in the third division since 2001 and has served as an assistant in the second division since 2004 .
now in 2007-8 , she 'll be given the chance to run the show at that level . the 28-year-old says her police work is good preparation for refereeing . " i apply the rules and make sure that everything is above board , " steinhaus said in an interview with soccer 's governing body fifa . " i have executive responsibilities , as it were , in both of my jobs , which is a real advantage . " " it 's all about performance , " said the head of the german soccer association 's refereeing committee , volker roth , when the promotion was announced .
" it 's ms. steinhaus ' turn .
i 'm very optimistic that she will continue to perform in the second division . " no special treatment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinhaus wears her love of the game on her hand steinhaus said she had been the target of verbal abuse of in her previous refereeing duties but quickly added that it was nothing she could n't handle . and since she 's well over six feet tall , players may think twice about throwing around any sexist remarks if they feel disadvantaged by a decision . in 1995 , another female referee served as a second-division assistant but only lasted a pair of games .
steinhaus intends to stick around for far longer than that . " i want to prove that conditions are the same for men and women in the working world and as referees , " she said at her introductory press conference .

the environmental group said it had recently observed containers designated for shipping abroad at the port - germany 's biggest - overflowing with unpacked electrical appliances that appeared to be scrap .
this case and further ones " substantiate the suspicion that again on a grand scale dangerous junk is falsely being declared as merchandise from germany to be disposed of in poor countries , " said duh managing director jürgen resch in berlin .
he said hamburg 's environmental authorities had been informed about the cases and were told that the containers were legitimate merchandise for sale abroad .

they then hide the old appliances under ones that appear fully functional in containers designated as goods to be exported for sale , he added .
the result was that companies that abided by the law were given a bad name .
volker dumann , spokesman for hamburg 's environmental authority , said that with a turnover of around nine million containers per year , systematic checks of containers passing through the harbor were not possible .
" we 're dependent on tips , on well-founded suspicions from within the scene , from the police or customs officials , " he told news agency afp .
duh 's resch called on the german government to put an end to the illegal export of electrical waste and scrapped cars .

he could prove a valuable ally to german chancelor merkel . leaders of the european union 's 27 member states hope the two-day summit in brussels will clear the way for a simplified treaty to replace the doomed constitution , blocked by french and dutch referendums in 2005 . it is sarkozy 's first european summit since he was elected president on may 6 , promising a major diplomatic drive to break the eu 's insitutional deadlock . sarkozy told lawmakers from his right-wing ruling party wednesday he was expecting " two very difficult days starting tomorrow , since what is at stake is nothing less than pulling europe out of immobility . " diplomatic push for the past month , sarkozy has been engaged in telephone diplomacy and meetings from warsaw to madrid to boost the chances of an agreement this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy consulted with far-right leader le pen , a political pariah to most he has also held consultations with french political leaders of all stripes - including with far-right leader jean-marie le pen , normally a pariah in french politics - before heading to the negotiating table in brussels . germany , which holds the eu 's presidency until the end of the month , hopes member states will adopt a text outlining the treaty 's contents , and setting a mandate for an intergovernmental conference to hammer out a final version . sarkozy 's spokesman said tuesday the french president was determined " to support the german presidency as much as possible " and to " do everything to contribute to its success . " for jean-dominique giuliani , president of the robert schuman foundation in paris , sarkozy has a key role to play . " france is the main culprit for the current deadlock .
after the french ' no ' , france stopped talking to the rest of europe .
there were no explanations for the ' no ' , nor counter-proposals , " giuliani said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french ' no ' vote in 2005 shook the eu " from the moment he agrees to get things moving again , sarkozy 's voice counts . " " sarkozy is freshly elected , he represents one of the main founding nations , he makes pro-european statements , gets his picture taken with the european flag .
all this is being watched very closely by our partners . " simplified document sarkozy backs the idea of a simplified treaty - creating a permanent eu president and foreign minister and reforming the eu voting system - that could be adopted without another referendum , allowing more time for complex questions such as european enlargement or defense policy . according to giuliani - although the french president has been careful to respect german chancellor angela merkel 's mandate as eu president - the german text being circulated in brussels takes his key proposals into account . poland and britain remain the key obstacles to clinching a deal .
poland , the biggest of 10 countries to join the eu in 2004 , is resisting changes to the voting system that it says will penalize small and medium-sized countries . last week , sarkozy became the latest in a steady flow of european leaders to visit warsaw to try to convince its leaders not to stand in the way of a new , simplified treaty for the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk is not very enthusiastic about a big treaty either on tuesday he agreed in telephone talks with british prime minister tony blair on the principle of an " amending " treaty and warned against attempts to revive the moribund constitution itself . he has reached a similar agreement with dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , equally keen to avoid holding a second referendum . but the french presidency has been cautious over the chances for a deal , a spokesman saying tuesday that there were still " strong reservations " over the proposed treaty and that an agreement was far from assured . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de talked to a german aerospace medical expert about the experiment . rupert gerzer directs the institute of aerospace medicine in cologne , which is participating in the simulated mars mission . dw-world.de : the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is looking for two volunteers that - together with four russians - will participate in a mars mission .
including " flight time , " the participants will have to spend 520 days in metal tanks in moscow .
what will be required of them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claustrophobes need not apply rupert gerzer : first of all , candidates have to be healthy .
secondly , they have to have a psychological state of mind that prevents them from getting depressed when they 're locked up in a can for 520 days .
they also have to be compatible with the rest of the group and have no interest in dominating the others .
apart from that , they have to be able to work like a scientist on a mars mission . every crew member gets a personal space of three square meters -lrb- 32 square feet -rrb- .
there 's a common living room , a kitchen and a toilet .
esa calls it a study in isolation and confinement .
that does n't sound particularly enticing .
why should someone participate as a volunteer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupert gerzer it 's surprising how many people want to do it .
i have a full-blown scientist working in my institute who participated in the last study and who 's dying to collaborate in moscow .
a lot of people are fascinated by the idea of taking part in a space mission .
they say : if i can not be a real astronaut , then my confinement can at least help to conduct these missions in the future . there wo n't be a shower during the 520 days , but there will be a sauna .
as a space mission physician , can you explain why a sauna , of all things , is needed ? -lrb- laughs -rrb- that 's a russian specialty . the experiment sounds a bit like the tv show " big brother . "
would n't it be good for space exploration to broadcast live ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rendering of the fake mars mission tank we do n't want to examine tv stars , but find out how an isolated group reacts on the way to mars .
people inside the tank will behave according to how public the whole thing is .
we want to simulate real life or at least approximate it as much as possible .
there could be problems and there will be problems .
we want to know them and find out how to solve them . after the experiment , potential long-term effects will be examined for another year .
is there a chance for people to become a real astronaut if they get through the 520 days ? on the russian side there are people that are aspiring astronauts .
anyone who gets through the 520 days and does well could be accepted to the russian astronaut program .
esa will select new astronauts in 2008 .
anyone who will not be accepted then - because he or she is participating in the study in moscow , for example - does n't stand a chance of becoming an esa astronaut . aarni kuoppamäki interviewed rupert gerzer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de talked to a german aerospace medical expert about the experiment . rupert gerzer directs the institute of aerospace medicine in cologne , which is participating in the simulated mars mission . dw-world.de : the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is looking for two volunteers that - together with four russians - will participate in a mars mission .
including " flight time , " the participants will have to spend 520 days in metal tanks in moscow .
what will be required of them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claustrophobes need not apply rupert gerzer : first of all , candidates have to be healthy .
secondly , they have to have a psychological state of mind that prevents them from getting depressed when they 're locked up in a can for 520 days .
they also have to be compatible with the rest of the group and have no interest in dominating the others .
apart from that , they have to be able to work like a scientist on a mars mission . every crew member gets a personal space of three square meters -lrb- 32 square feet -rrb- .
there 's a common living room , a kitchen and a toilet .
esa calls it a study in isolation and confinement .
that does n't sound particularly enticing .
why should someone participate as a volunteer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupert gerzer it 's surprising how many people want to do it .
i have a full-blown scientist working in my institute who participated in the last study and who 's dying to collaborate in moscow .
a lot of people are fascinated by the idea of taking part in a space mission .
they say : if i can not be a real astronaut , then my confinement can at least help to conduct these missions in the future . there wo n't be a shower during the 520 days , but there will be a sauna .
as a space mission physician , can you explain why a sauna , of all things , is needed ? -lrb- laughs -rrb- that 's a russian specialty . the experiment sounds a bit like the tv show " big brother . "
would n't it be good for space exploration to broadcast live ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rendering of the fake mars mission tank we do n't want to examine tv stars , but find out how an isolated group reacts on the way to mars .
people inside the tank will behave according to how public the whole thing is .
we want to simulate real life or at least approximate it as much as possible .
there could be problems and there will be problems .
we want to know them and find out how to solve them . after the experiment , potential long-term effects will be examined for another year .
is there a chance for people to become a real astronaut if they get through the 520 days ? on the russian side there are people that are aspiring astronauts .
anyone who gets through the 520 days and does well could be accepted to the russian astronaut program .
esa will select new astronauts in 2008 .
anyone who will not be accepted then - because he or she is participating in the study in moscow , for example - does n't stand a chance of becoming an esa astronaut . aarni kuoppamäki interviewed rupert gerzer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if poland had not experienced the years between 1939 and 1945 , it would today be a country of 66 million if you look at the demographic data . "
during world war two , which began when nazi germany invaded poland in september 1939 , around 6.5 million poles died , including three million polish jews .

" i hope we can all work together in the right spirit to come to a fair agreement because the european union needs to be capable of acting in order to solve the many problems in the world with collective solutions , " she said at a meeting of conservative leaders near brussels .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , at the same gathering , stressed the need for reform so the eu 's institutions can adjust to its growing size .

the remarks were confirmed by the broadcaster on thursday .
" we 're only demanding that which was taken from us , " kaczynski said afterwards in an interview .
" if poland had not experienced the years between 1939 and 1945 , it would today be a country of 66 million if you look at the demographic data . "
during world war two , which began when nazi germany invaded poland in september 1939 , around 6.5 million poles died , including three million polish jews .
that was about one-fourth of the pre-war population .
today , poland 's population is just under 38 million .

1 , 1939 , setting off world war two the comments are likely to do little to soothe ruffled feathers on both sides of the german-poland border .
the poles have stuck to their threat to veto a watered-down eu treaty at a european union summit opening thursday unless they were given more voting powers .
the polish prime minister said in a german newspaper wednesday that his country would be committing " suicide " if it agreed to the german proposals on the voting system .
" they are trying to isolate and ignore poland .
we can not agree to that .
that would be suicide , " he told the mass-circulation bild .
poland , the biggest of the ex-communist states that joined the eu in 2004 , opposes the planned " double majority " system for making decisions affecting the entire bloc .
the polish demands have been opposed by 25 eu states , with only the czech republic voicing support .
" fair agreement " german chancellor angela merkel on thursday urged her fellow european union leaders to work together for a " fair agreement " on a treaty to reform the eu 's creaking institutions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's comments wo n't do much for german-polish goodwill ahead of a key european summit opening later in the day , where her eu presidency 's plans for a reform treaty will be put to the test , merkel said everyone " can contribute their ideas " but that an agreement was necessary .
" i hope we can all work together in the right spirit to come to a fair agreement because the european union needs to be capable of acting in order to solve the many problems in the world with collective solutions , " she said at a meeting of conservative leaders near brussels .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , at the same gathering , stressed the need for reform so the eu 's institutions can adjust to its growing size .
" we need to reinforce the capacity of the european union to act , " he said .
" with 27 you can not have the same rules as with 12 .

dw-world.de talked to a german aerospace medical expert about the experiment . rupert gerzer directs the institute of aerospace medicine in cologne , which is participating in the simulated mars mission . dw-world.de : the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- is looking for two volunteers that - together with four russians - will participate in a mars mission .
including " flight time , " the participants will have to spend 520 days in metal tanks in moscow .
what will be required of them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claustrophobes need not apply rupert gerzer : first of all , candidates have to be healthy .
secondly , they have to have a psychological state of mind that prevents them from getting depressed when they 're locked up in a can for 520 days .
they also have to be compatible with the rest of the group and have no interest in dominating the others .
apart from that , they have to be able to work like a scientist on a mars mission . every crew member gets a personal space of three square meters -lrb- 32 square feet -rrb- .
there 's a common living room , a kitchen and a toilet .
esa calls it a study in isolation and confinement .
that does n't sound particularly enticing .
why should someone participate as a volunteer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rupert gerzer it 's surprising how many people want to do it .
i have a full-blown scientist working in my institute who participated in the last study and who 's dying to collaborate in moscow .
a lot of people are fascinated by the idea of taking part in a space mission .

" glonass makes the armed forces more flexible and weapons systems more precise , " he said .
" there has been no attempt from the us side to renew control treaties ; that is another reason why moscow is starting up . " situation changed since soviet-us talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts debate if the us missile shield is really the cause behind russia 's arms program russia has felt pressured to expand its aerospace weapons capabilities by a us decision to exclude defensive systems from the 2002 anti-ballistic missile treaty in order to develop its national missile defense , part of which us military planners want to locate in poland and the czech republic , neuneck added . " the soviet-american treaty -lrb- on intermediate nuclear forces -rrb- is not effective because since -lrb- its signature -rrb- scores of countries have appeared that have such missiles , while russia and the united states are not allowed to have them , " ivanov told a military-industrial commission , reuters reported .
" in these conditions , it is necessary to provide our troops with modern , high-precision weapons . " missile shield only a pretext ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money from energy exports enables russia to modernize its military but hannes adomeit , a russia expert from the german institute for international and security affairs , said the us missile defense system is only the cover the kremlin was looking for to renew its missile arsenal . " without the planned missile defense , moscow would still arm itself in the same way , " he added . among the new weapons are short-range iskander-m missiles as well as rs-24 intercontinental ballistic missiles , which can be armed with up to 10 warheads , both of which were tested in may .
ivanov has said the two missile systems have been designed to overpower all existing and planned missile defense systems . recouping lost prestige matthes buhbe , head of the friedrich ebert stiftung 's moscow office said there has been scant criticism of the missile plans from the russian public . " from the left to the right , everyone is excited , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts said putin is highly interested in restoring russia 's previous stature a cold war mentality is still present in the kremlin , and russia is interested in reclaiming the international influence it had as the soviet union , adomeit said . " russian president vladimir putin wants to position russia as a world power and prove that it is a nuclear equal with the usa , " he said . policy should be taken seriously experts consider nearly 80 percent of the russian arsenal to be out-of-date , making the current potential for escalation small when compared to the political situation of the 80s .
but as some $ 150 billion -lrb- 112 billion euros -rrb- in income from gas and oil exports fills russian coffers , the defense department announced it had quadrupled military spending from 2000 to 2006 . the west , and europe in particular , should take moscow 's change of position seriously and push for new arms control treaties , neuneck said . " the europeans are again caught between the russian and american nuclear mill-stones , " he said , adding that the danger of conflict increases as arms programs replace non-proliferation talks .

essen will be the first stop in the popular event 's five-year tour . berlin is off the map for the love parade this year as the event 's organizers and local officials agreed on thursday to relocate the popular techno street party to germany 's ruhr region . after dancing down the streets of essen on aug .
25 this year , ravers can continue the party in dortmund , bochum , duisburg and gelsenkirchen in consecutive years .
the region of 5.3 million inhabitants competed against around 60 cities , including barcelona , st. petersburg and munich , to win the contract .
the love parade is expected to attract over a million visitors to the region and 120 million euros -lrb- $ 161 million -rrb- .
its organizers will foot the bill of roughly three million euros for the street party .
" that this event will take place here is an expression of the region 's liveliness , " said essen mayor wolfgang reininger .
hard to host a party the love parade began in berlin in 1989 , and at its peak , in 1999 , drew 1.5 million partygoers who danced to the techno beats blaring from floats on their route through the city 's central tiergarten park .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's tiergarten park did eventually recover disagreements among the organizers , financial problems and conflicts with the city over park damage and waste disposal led to a two-year break for the parade , which resumed in berlin in 2006 .
but the city senate and the organizers were unable to bridge their differences , so the latter started looking for a new host .
essen 's police have already raised concerns about safety during the party .
" the love parade in berlin was held along a green belt , where there was plenty of space for people to evacuate if there was an emergency , " said ulrich fassbender of the city police .
" but things are different here in essen .
we have some four-lane roads along the route , but if you imagine a crowd of 700,000 , it 's clear that they 'll be very crowded .

more than 300 people have already been in touch with their suggestions .
the suggestions range from calling for a ban on smacking children to asking for proper funding for apprenticeship schemes .
if i ruled wales will pick one idea , sent in by e-mail , phone or post , and pass it on to ams for consideration .

sixth-form pupils from ysgol gyfun gwynllyw in pontypool , torfaen , put forward their suggestions to if i ruled wales this week .

" i concentrated on good food , fruit , vegetables , the healthy eating , and it worked quite well .

' slightly unlucky ' but he said a combination of factors including problems with blood flow in one of his arteries was to eventually lead to the amputation of his right leg below the knee in april this year .
" in my case , i think i was slightly unlucky , as sometimes happens in life , " he added .
" there was no alternative than to take off the leg to eradicate the problem . "

discussions so far have focused on preserving the paper 's editorial independence , with its main investors - the bancroft family - taking the lead .

analysts suggested the move could lead to a quicker resolution of the deal .
journalistic provisions but , in a statement , dow jones said that it and the bancroft family - which controls voting rights in the firm - would still have to be satisfied that the paper would remain independent under new owners .
" representatives of the bancroft family reiterated that any transaction must include appropriate provisions with respect to journalistic and editorial independence and integrity , " the company said .
since making its surprise bid for dow jones in may , rupert murdoch 's news corporation has sought to reassure sceptics that the paper 's independence would be maintained .
many observers expect a counter-bid for dow jones from another media firm , with pearson - publisher of the financial times - being seen as a likely candidate .

discussions so far have focused on preserving the paper 's editorial independence , with its main investors - the bancroft family - taking the lead .
but dow jones said its board would now head discussions over the bid and " other strategic alternatives " .
analysts suggested the move could lead to a quicker resolution of the deal .
journalistic provisions but , in a statement , dow jones said that it and the bancroft family - which controls voting rights in the firm - would still have to be satisfied that the paper would remain independent under new owners .
" representatives of the bancroft family reiterated that any transaction must include appropriate provisions with respect to journalistic and editorial independence and integrity , " the company said .
since making its surprise bid for dow jones in may , rupert murdoch 's news corporation has sought to reassure sceptics that the paper 's independence would be maintained .
many observers expect a counter-bid for dow jones from another media firm , with pearson - publisher of the financial times - being seen as a likely candidate .
philadelphia media holdings , the owner of the philadelphia inquirer newspaper , has also claimed it is interested in mounting a rival bid .

michael bloomberg is the founder of the bloomberg media empire his decision to leave the republican party and change his political status to unaffiliated provoked a flurry of speculation that this was part of preparations for a run for the white house .
mr bloomberg had denied any plans to stand but the latest developments show how far his profile has risen since he was first elected mayor of new york in 2001 .
then he was an unknown quantity for new yorkers , a political novice who ran as a republican , despite being a long-time democratic party supporter , and who overcame a 25-point deficit in the opinion polls to secure the office .
he was helped in no small part by his huge wealth - during his campaign he spent $ 41m -lrb- £ 20m -rrb- of his own money , more than all the other candidates combined , and was accused of trading dollars for democracy .
but perhaps more important was the endorsement by rudolph giuliani , the outgoing mayor who was transformed into a national hero for his handling of a city in crisis on 11 september .
philanthropist once voted manhattan 's most eligible bachelor , mr bloomberg 's fortune is estimated to be at least $ 5bn -lrb- £ 2.5bn -rrb- .
he has numerous homes all over the world and a helicopter that he pilots himself .
he has also donated millions of dollars , mostly to educational , medical and cultural causes .
mr bloomberg was born in 1942 into a middle-class family - the son of a book-keeper .
he got his first job on wall street after completing his mba in 1966 .
he secured a position at salomon brothers , and by 1972 he had become a partner .
but his relationship with the firm ended abruptly nine years later when salomon brothers was bought out and mr bloomberg was sacked .
he used his stake from the salomon sale to found his own business - now a global media and financial data empire named after him .
today bloomberg lp has offices around the world and is the leading global provider of financial data .
but he wants more than this .
he admits to being a man who craves admiration .
" adulation is great , " he was once quoted as saying .
re-election as mayor , mr bloomberg took time to win over new yorkers .
he raised taxes and cut costs - never vote-winners - and also garnered a reputation as a killjoy .
smoking was banned in bars and clubs , pushing the nicotine-needy out on the streets .
a crusade was also launched by mr bloomberg against street vendors .
in the middle of his first term his approval ratings slipped and tabloid papers began referring to the mayor as " gloomberg " .
but an improving economy , better school results and a falling crime rate helped boost his popularity in the opinion polls , and in 2005 he was re-elected .

doctors looked back at her medical history and they deduced she had had ms - a degenerative disease of the central nervous system affecting around 85,000 people in the uk - for around 10 years .
and she said the little support she received after her diagnosis did little to ease the shock .
" i saw a consultant and they just said ' see a dietician on the way out ' .
there was nothing else , " she said .
i did a lot of crying and wondering if the children would be affected and then i thought ' i will have to get on with it ' " i had to drive home and burst into tears when i told my husband .
" i did a lot of crying and wondering if the children would be affected and then i thought ' i will have to get on with it ' . "
" i am in a wheelchair , which i absolutely hate , but it gets me places - i have independence , " she said , adding that her car had now been converted to hand controls .
" i have had to have a colostomy because my colon is not functioning properly .
my life was curtailed as i could n't plan to do anything . "
she said having that operation had been a big mental blow , but once she had recovered from it , she found she had a great deal more freedom .
' massive strain ' husband dave , 55 , said his wife has relapses which can lead to further disability .
" every time she has a relapse , she loses a percentage of her body movement , " he said .
" it has been a massive burden , it has been a massive strain on the whole family . "
he added that , as a carer , it was easy to become overprotective .
" the other day she was cutting a potato and i came over and said ' i 'll do it ' .
i should n't have - i was taking over her independence .
" i love her to bits and you need to step back and give her some leeway .
it is hard to strike a balance .
" a while ago she knocked herself out in the kitchen .
she fell over like a felled tree and hit her head on the door . "
when i do fall over , i have to ring someone to come and pick me up .
when i 'm down , that 's it .
i have no strength .

counselling course mrs meredith said she did a counselling course when she realised that she would not be able to continue to do her job as a hospital medical secretary .
" it is a terrible situation when you are retired from work , " she said .

looking back , she said her two children had dealt with the condition well .

" i could n't go to watch them play football or go horse-riding , and i felt the children were missing out , but really it was me - i missed out . "

phil curtis of the rspb , who is organising the nest protection scheme , said : " we are delighted that the harriers have five chicks in the nest , this is better than we could ever have hoped for .
' atrocious weather ' " before we started the nest guard we know that one clutch of eggs had vanished from a first nest , and a female hen harrier disappeared from a second nest .
" we are delighted that our watch over this third nest has helped the harriers and that despite some atrocious weather recently the chicks have hatched out .
" it is more important than ever that we maintain the 24-hour guard on the nest over the coming weeks . "
in may last year a female harrier , which nested in the county , is believed to have been shot and a nearby nest failed when the eggs vanished .
incidents of hen harriers disappearing this year from nesting areas in north yorkshire and northumberland are already under investigation by the police , according to the rspb .

mr thaksin 's son and daughter , panthongtae and pintongta shinawatra , are also major players in uk sports investments .
manchester city is the latest english football team to attract interest from foreign investors .

john wardle , chairman of manchester city , added : " following our significant progress over the last few years , this offer provides an exciting opportunity to take manchester city to the next stage of our development and deliver the on-field success we have all been striving for . "

the former thai leader , who now lives mainly in london and was overthrown in a bloodless military coup last september , denies any wrongdoing .
the charges relate to the purchase of a plot of land in bangkok by mr thaksin 's wife pojaman , for 772m baht -lrb- $ 24m ; £ 12m -rrb- .
the land , owned by a government agency , had earlier been valued at 2.1bn baht .

certainly not since the following appeared in the news of the world almost a year ago : " an anguished victim of the elephant man drug trials has broken his silence to tell how doctors discovered the early stages of cancer in his ravaged body . "
that victim was one of six who took part in a drugs trial at a site at northwick park hospital in london .
all suffered multiple organ failure .
yet , according to the drugs companies , the number of volunteers for such trials did not fall as a result of all the publicity .
instead , it went up .
bbc five live 's drive programme decided to have an in-depth look at the business of drug development , to speak to those who worked in the industry and indeed to some of those who still happily volunteer for trials .
not so bad as it sounds philippe is one such person .
i met him in the pfizer research headquarters , located on the erasme hospital campus in brussels .
he is an accountant and apparently a very sane man . "
there are several hundreds , if not thousands , of people who are cured , or at least treated with medication i have helped to develop " philippe yet he had agreed to be shut up in what is effectively a high quality prison for two weeks to try out a new drug designed to treat asthma .
it increased his heart beat , made him tremble and made him go to the loo .
but he seemed unconcerned .
" the impact itself is not so bad as it sounds , it 's minor , " he said .
" and it passes . "
he had been taking part in such trials for ten years , he told me .
they began in university when he needed the money , now he takes part mostly because he thinks it is useful work , and also gives him the chance to watch the 80 dvds he brings in with him .
" in those studies i 've participated in several of the drugs have been further developed and commercialised , " he said .
" i do know that several of those drugs are now on the market .
and today there are several hundreds , if not thousands , of people who are cured , or at least treated with medication i have helped to develop .
of course my input was very small . "
philippe is one of hundreds of people who happily turn up each week at the research headquarters to try out drugs , admittedly in very small amounts , which have never been given to a person before .
weighing up the risks companies like pfizer put together thousands of compounds every year in their laboratories .
they are tried on animals before being tried on people and only a couple of dozen of those thousands make it from the laboratory to the clinical trial on people .
if philippe and the others react badly , it goes no further .
if it does make the grade the next phase will be to test it on people with asthma , and finally to large scale clinical trials .
i asked him whether he had been put off participating by the disastrous british trials and the potential risk of things going horribly wrong .
" of course we have given it a lot of thought , we 've read about it and we 've made some enquiries and we 've also discussed it with a few people in the healthcare industry - but they have assured me that it is impossible for it to happen again . "
all that takes money , lots of it : the cost of a drug which makes it is on average more than £ 500 million .
of all those thousands of compounds produced each year , probably only one will make it to the chemist 's shelf .
that is the company 's case , put very forcibly to me in brussels .
that is why , says the company , profits have to be high on the drugs they do sell .
they have decided to open their doors to us at the headquarters in sandwich so that we can see for ourselves whether their case is a reasonable one .

certainly not since the following appeared in the news of the world almost a year ago : " an anguished victim of the elephant man drug trials has broken his silence to tell how doctors discovered the early stages of cancer in his ravaged body . "
that victim was one of six who took part in a drugs trial at a site at northwick park hospital in london .
all suffered multiple organ failure .
yet , according to the drugs companies , the number of volunteers for such trials did not fall as a result of all the publicity .
instead , it went up .
bbc five live 's drive programme decided to have an in-depth look at the business of drug development , to speak to those who worked in the industry and indeed to some of those who still happily volunteer for trials .
not so bad as it sounds philippe is one such person .
i met him in the pfizer research headquarters , located on the erasme hospital campus in brussels .
he is an accountant and apparently a very sane man .
there are several hundreds , if not thousands , of people who are cured , or at least treated with medication i have helped to develop philippe yet he had agreed to be shut up in what is effectively a high quality prison for two weeks to try out a new drug designed to treat asthma .
it increased his heart beat , made him tremble and made him go to the loo .
but he seemed unconcerned .
" the impact itself is not so bad as it sounds , it 's minor , " he said .
" and it passes . "
he had been taking part in such trials for ten years , he told me .
they began in university when he needed the money , now he takes part mostly because he thinks it is useful work , and also gives him the chance to watch the 80 dvds he brings in with him .
" in those studies i 've participated in several of the drugs have been further developed and commercialised , " he said .
" i do know that several of those drugs are now on the market .
and today there are several hundreds , if not thousands , of people who are cured , or at least treated with medication i have helped to develop .
of course my input was very small . "
philippe is one of hundreds of people who happily turn up each week at the research headquarters to try out drugs , admittedly in very small amounts , which have never been given to a person before .
weighing up the risks companies like pfizer put together thousands of compounds every year in their laboratories .
ryan wilson was most badly affected by the failed drug trial they are tried on animals before being tried on people and only a couple of dozen of those thousands make it from the laboratory to the clinical trial on people .
if philippe and the others react badly , it goes no further .
if it does make the grade the next phase will be to test it on people with asthma , and finally to large scale clinical trials .
i asked him whether he had been put off participating by the disastrous british trials and the potential risk of things going horribly wrong .
" of course we have given it a lot of thought , we 've read about it and we 've made some enquiries and we 've also discussed it with a few people in the healthcare industry - but they have assured me that it is impossible for it to happen again . "
all that takes money , lots of it : the cost of a drug which makes it is on average more than £ 500 million .

the government has started a three-month consultation on possible reforms to the sector , to allow it to compete better with the banks .
it will look at whether the law should be changed to make it easier for unions to attract members and savers .

in addition , reform of how credit unions are funded is being considered .
ed balls , economic secretary to the treasury , said that he wanted to see the credit union sector able to compete more effectively .
