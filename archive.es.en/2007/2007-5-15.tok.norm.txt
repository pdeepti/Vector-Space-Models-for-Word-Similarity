" we are all safer if we operate in a world in which intelligent use of information allows for more focussed efforts in determining who is a threat , " us secretary of homeland security michael chertoff said on monday after a meeting with european union lawmakers and officials .
the us and the 27-member eu are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
" we need to make sure that we have to provide the civilized world with appropriate tools to identify new security threats , " chertoff told a news briefing in brussels .
the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years .
data flow under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 34 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines face fines if they fail to pass on information such as credit card numbers washington has warned that airlines which failed to share passenger data would face fines of up to $ 6,000 -lrb- $ 4,450 -rrb- per passenger and a possible loss of landing rights .
chertoff said that the us wanted to make sure that a new agreement , which has to be clinched by the end of july , would ensure a " sufficient period of time " for the storage of data , arguing that terrorists were planning their plots over several years .
he also said that the us was working on new legislation under which foreign air passengers travelling to the us would be required to feed their data into an online database days ahead of the trip .
this new plan would enable the us " to inform people in advance if there is going to be a problem in allowing them to travel , " chertoff said .
kept for how long ?
eu justice commissioner franco frattini said that the two sides were still disagreeing on how long us authorities should be able to use data about passengers on transatlantic flights , when it should be destroyed and which government agencies should have access to the sensitive information .
the us also wants to pull data directly from airline computers , but european countries insist airlines must transmit the information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the date agreement will affect flights bound for the us eu data protection officials have demanded that personal data sent to us authorities should be made anonymous and the identity of their owner only be revealed if the data matched a profile in a terrorist database .
they have also said that a new deal on passenger data-sharing could be challenged by eu national courts .
the eu and the us are increasingly at odds over how to reconcile civil liberties with the us-led fight against terrorism .
brussels and washington have also locked horns over a secret agreement between the us treasury and the belgium-based money transfer company swift , which has supplied us authorities with personal data for use in counter-terrorism inquiries . dw staff -lrb- kj -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report says attack against americans in germany imminent us and german officials believe a terrorist attack against americans in germany is imminent , us media reported friday .

statisticians attributed the deceleration to less consumer spending following a sharp rise in value-added tax . consumers in europe 's largest economy are moving less money across german shop counters since the government upped the sales or value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent at the beginning of the year . official figures released on tuesday showed that germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- rose by 0.5 percent in the period from january to march compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 .
the increase was down from 1 percent growth in the preceding three months . " consumer spending put the brakes on economic growth , largely in connection with the vat hike at the beginning of the year , " the federal statistics office said in a statement .
the gdp measures the value of a country 's economic performance within the domestic territory . however , economics minister michael glos said the higher vat had been absorbed .
fresh investments at the beginning of the year had brought significant impulses to the country , he said .
according to glos , germany was on track for further growth . " the economic situation in germany is on a robust growth path , " glos said on tuesday . government optimistic growth will continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy is still on an upswing the economic slowdown in germany was not as sharp as feared , though .
forecasts by analysts had put gdp growth at 0.3 percent in the first quarter of 2007 . according to glos , the year 's good start supported the government 's outlook of 2.3 percent growth for the german economy in 2007 .
he said he expected private consumption to return to normal in the course of the year . the 3 percent vat hike marked the biggest-ever single rise in sales tax in a move criticized by many experts as being detrimental to growth . strong investments boosting growth germany 's current economic upturn remained intact , with growth driven both by strong investment and exports , according to official statistics . on a 12-month basis , gdp grew by 3.3 percent in the january-march period compared with the same period in 2006 . " growth in the first quarter was powered by a continuation in strong investment activity , " the statistics office said , adding that growth impulses also came from net foreign trade , while household spending slowed growth down noticeably . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reports biggest tax surplus in modern history germany says it expects its biggest tax surplus for half a century as the economy once derided as the " sick man of europe " reaps the benefits from buoyant growth and moderate reforms .

speaking at the start of the meeting , putin said : " there are differences of opinion on how to solve specific problems , but both sides have a desire to solve them . "
putin met steinmeier straight after talks with us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who is also trying to soothe her country 's tense relations with russia .
a sense of doom with attempts to negotiate a key eu-russia partnership accord in tatters , there were few signs that germany 's intervention as head of the rotating presidency of the european union could salvage the summit .
russia 's foreign ministry accused poland of holding eu-russia relations " hostage " by blocking discussion of the partnership deal , which would govern key areas , including energy supplies , interfax news agency reported .
putin 's representative for eu relations , sergei yastrzhembsky , said there " is no real sense in discussing an accord on which we can not negotiate , " interfax reported .
poland has vetoed negotiations in retaliation for a russian ban on polish meat imports , while lithuania is now also threatening to veto the talks unless russia resumes oil deliveries to a refinery in the north of the baltic state .
warsaw made an additional demand on tuesday that the 27-member eu must pledge to protect the energy security of poland and other eu newcomers that rely on russian oil and gas .

the baltic republic says that a halving of rail freight from russia this month amounts to unofficial economic sanctions .
eu-russia tensions , coupled with increasingly frayed us-russian ties , are contributing to a dramatic deterioration of east-west relations ahead of presidential election seasons in both russia and the united states .
moscow is already in a fierce confrontation with washington over us plans to deploy an anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic .
russia is also at loggerheads with the european union and united states over western-backed plans to give independence to kosovo , a province in russian ally serbia .
a " senseless " summit ahead of his moscow trip , steinmeier sounded pessimistic about the chances of any breakthroughs .
" i can not assure you 100 percent whether progress can be made on individual issues , but even if you do not know you must make an attempt , " he told reporters in brussels .
the german foreign policy chief even addressed rumors that the summit could be cancelled , saying " we have to bring an end to these discussions about whether or not the summit will take place . "
russia 's kommersant daily said steinmeier would be unable " to save the summit from collapse , " while the vedomosti daily called the samara meeting " senseless . "
" the eu-russian summit will either be a relative failure or a scandalous failure .
there will definitely be no negotiations on a partnership agreement .

" we are all safer if we operate in a world in which intelligent use of information allows for more focussed efforts in determining who is a threat , " us secretary of homeland security michael chertoff said on monday after a meeting with european union lawmakers and officials .
the us and the 27-member eu are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
" we need to make sure that we have to provide the civilized world with appropriate tools to identify new security threats , " chertoff told a news briefing in brussels .
the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years .
data flow under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 34 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines face fines if they fail to pass on information such as credit card numbers washington has warned that airlines which failed to share passenger data would face fines of up to $ 6,000 -lrb- $ 4,450 -rrb- per passenger and a possible loss of landing rights .
chertoff said that the us wanted to make sure that a new agreement , which has to be clinched by the end of july , would ensure a " sufficient period of time " for the storage of data , arguing that terrorists were planning their plots over several years .
he also said that the us was working on new legislation under which foreign air passengers travelling to the us would be required to feed their data into an online database days ahead of the trip .
this new plan would enable the us " to inform people in advance if there is going to be a problem in allowing them to travel , " chertoff said .
kept for how long ?
eu justice commissioner franco frattini said that the two sides were still disagreeing on how long us authorities should be able to use data about passengers on transatlantic flights , when it should be destroyed and which government agencies should have access to the sensitive information .
the us also wants to pull data directly from airline computers , but european countries insist airlines must transmit the information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the date agreement will affect flights bound for the us eu data protection officials have demanded that personal data sent to us authorities should be made anonymous and the identity of their owner only be revealed if the data matched a profile in a terrorist database .
they have also said that a new deal on passenger data-sharing could be challenged by eu national courts .
the eu and the us are increasingly at odds over how to reconcile civil liberties with the us-led fight against terrorism .
brussels and washington have also locked horns over a secret agreement between the us treasury and the belgium-based money transfer company swift , which has supplied us authorities with personal data for use in counter-terrorism inquiries . dw staff -lrb- kj -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report says attack against americans in germany imminent us and german officials believe a terrorist attack against americans in germany is imminent , us media reported friday .

" after difficult negotiations , we have come up with a viable compromise on the roaming regulation , " said conservative austrian mp paul rübig , who led the talks at the parliament . the compromise still needs to be formalized , first by members states ' experts on wednesday , then by a vote before the european parliament in a plenary sitting next week , and finally by eu ministers on june 7 . " we now have a solid compromise on the table that can get backing from everyone , " said german economy minister michael glos , adding that " with a little goodwill we can get an agreement . "
under the agreement , rates for calls made while in other eu countries would be capped in the first year of application at 0.49 euros -lrb- $ 0.66 -rrb- a minute .
receiving calls could cost no more than 0.24 euros .
the ceiling for so-called roaming services would come down even lower in the second year , falling to 0.46 and 0.22 euros and then 0.43 and 0.19 euros in the third year . deal has mobile industry up in arms the european commission drew up the plans to regulate roaming rates last year .
it had found evidence of huge variations between operators ' prices , with some roaming calls costing up to six times those of local mobile calls . the package has the industry up in arms .
it has argued that fierce competition has already driven down prices and has been lobbying hard to get the plans watered down . even though the deal brought mobile phone users closer to cheaper roaming rates , the beuc european consumer association was left unimpressed by the compromise . " for us , the roaming rates remain high , " said spokesman dominique forrest .
" it 's a first step , but as it is on the table , it 's not enough . " the french consumer association ufc-que choisir was even more critical of the agreement , charging that it still allowed operators to make huge profits on the back of mobile phone users .
" the compromise gives in to the current excuse for a market which allows operators to have huge margins on calls received or made while abroad even though the cost is close to that for national calls , " it said in a statement .
consumers ca n't benefit from deal on their summer holidays although the new regulations could go into effect as early as mid-july , according to a diplomat , mobile phone users will not be able to benefit from the new rates until after the summer holiday period . the european commission had hoped that the new rates would be in place by the summer holidays . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu panel backs plans to cap mobile roaming rates european union plans to cap the price operators can charge mobile phone users while abroad cleared a key hurdle on thursday when a panel in the european parliament backed the package .

" six lebanese men accused of plotting to bomb the trains in western germany in july 2006 are currently standing trial in beirut . one of the defendants has confessed to lebanese authorities that he planted the homemade bombs to avenge the publication in denmark of cartoons of the prophet mohammed .
investigators believe the devices failed to explode because of faulty detonators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble has come under fire for allowing intelligence agenicies to snoop on pcs via the internet in addition , a little-known islamic extremist group issued a warning in march that germany could come under attack unless it withdrew its troops from afghanistan . last weekend , us media reported of an imminent attack on americans in germany by an al qaeda cell .
german press reports said five islamists living in the frankfurt area and belonging to a little-known group with ties to al qaeda had triggered a security warning by us authorities last month . schäuble said intelligence services were focusing their efforts on monitoring radical islamist websites in an attempt to spot potential attacks at the planning stage . " the internet gives terrorists a gigantic forum , whether as a communications platform , an advertising portal , or as a virtual training camp and think tank , " schäuble said . right-wing attacks on the rise violence by right-wing extremists also shot up in 2006 by 9.3 per cent , the report by the office for the protection of the constitution showed . the far-right national democratic party -lrb- ndp -rrb- gained 1,000 new members to take their membership to 7,000 .
schäuble voiced concern that neo-nazis have a growing influence on the npd leadership and spoke of the " alarming development " that the extreme right was gaining more acceptance in society . the interior minister , however , rejected the idea of attempting to ban the party , saying this would make it more difficult to observe ndp activities . concern over g-8 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been a series of anti-g8 protests in the past weeks the report found that left-wing violence dropped by 3.8 percent , but schäuble used the opportunity to warn that that the government would n't allow " potential violence to hinder the orderly course of the g8 summit , " which germany is hosting at the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm on june 6-8 . german police last week staged a series of raids on the homes and offices of militant left-wingers suspected of planning to disrupt the meeting between the leaders of germany , france , italy , britain , the united states , canada , japan and russia . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reports say raids on g8 protestors uncovered explosives amid growing criticism of a crackdown on leftwing protestors ahead of the g8 summit , news reports say recent raids by german police have yielded a range of incendiary materials .

statisticians attributed the deceleration to less consumer spending following a sharp rise in value-added tax . consumers in europe 's largest economy are moving less money across german shop counters since the government upped the sales or value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent at the beginning of the year . official figures released on tuesday showed that germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- rose by 0.5 percent in the period from january to march compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 .
the increase was down from 1 percent growth in the preceding three months . " consumer spending put the brakes on economic growth , largely in connection with the vat hike at the beginning of the year , " the federal statistics office said in a statement .
the gdp measures the value of a country 's economic performance within the domestic territory . however , economics minister michael glos said the higher vat had been absorbed .
fresh investments at the beginning of the year had brought significant impulses to the country , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.05.2007 opinion : the end of daimler 's " world inc . " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nine-year , trans-atlantic marriage of automakers daimler and chrysler has come to an end and it 's probably best that way for all involved , said deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky . what daimlerchrysler 's former chief jürgen schrempp once called a " marriage from heaven " has now , after nine years , ended in a mundane divorce .
and it 's probably the best thing that could have happened - for both companies .
even though they will remain connected for years to come in joint technical projects and daimler 's minor stake in chrysler , they still have better chances going it alone in the automotive business than being involved in a relationship designed along the lines of jürgen schrempp 's vision of a welt ag or world inc .
that dream quickly revealed itself to be a mere delusion of grandeur .
schadenfreude inappropriate the consequences of that are immense , and feeling a sense of schadenfreude would be inappropriate .
after all , corporate strategies that have gotten out of control have once again caused millions of euros and many jobs to be lost .
daimler managers , with current chief executive dieter zetsche leading them at the time , cut 26,000 jobs at chrysler .
now on its own , chrysler will again have to lay off another 13,000 employees .
and , the way these things work when jobs are cut to increase profitability , what accompanied the announcement of the daimlerchrysler split was a true firework display on the stock market - not unlike the one that followed the news of schrempp 's disreputable departure .
eyes bigger than mouth now it 's official : daimler bit off more than it could chew when it purchased chrysler .
first , there were not enough managers to restructure the already crippled company in the united states ; then , it seemed that money was becoming scarce .
that is when a split becomes mandatory .
the decisive majority-shareholder at chrysler will be the private equity group cerberus capital management .
it will make a capital contribution of 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- - not as a purchase price , it should be noted , but in return for an 80.1-percent equity interest in chrysler .
in order to shed itself of chrysler , daimler must also throw in 1.2 billion euros .
chrysler must now rely on its own strengths .
in addition to having to rid itself of now hard-to-sell pick-up trucks and suv 's , it must also market fuel-efficient small cars since the american conscience has also changed . neither chrysler , nor general motors nor ford , was prepared for that .
cerberus managers may now put a lot of pressure on chrysler to make those changes quickly .
daimler to profit most yet it is daimler which is profiting the most from the divorce since the maker of luxury cars , trucks and buses will no longer have chrysler as an albatross hanging from its neck .
the reputation of daimler 's management , however , has taken another beating .
after all , the bad investment that cost many billions of euros is not restricted to the chrysler issue alone , but is part of a larger complex that has dominated the ranks of daimler 's management for years .
the goal was a european-american-asian automotive company in which the sun never sets .
the result has been a financial disaster .
it 's a good thing that managers neither design nor build cars because mercedes has only survived these managerial adventures because the swabian engineers and workers of the company make such fantastic cars that can be sold high prices on the world market .
in other words : though they fervently tried for many years , the upper echelon of daimler managers just was n't able to drive the corporate group completely into the ground . karl zawadzky is a dw economics expert -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler to sell chrysler to cerberus german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler said on monday it had agreed to sell control of its loss-making us arm chrysler to private equity firm cerberus , for 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- .

" preparing for the summit has been difficult , " steinmeier said after his talks with putin .
" there have been a number of specific problems which we have not been able to solve over the past few weeks .
keeping silent about them does n't help , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , and putin tried to play down their differences " that is why i looked for an opportunity to meet with the russian president and the foreign minister .
that was a good decision .
we are now seeing the situation around the preparation for the ... summit in a much clearer way . "
speaking at the start of the meeting , putin said : " there are differences of opinion on how to solve specific problems , but both sides have a desire to solve them . "
putin met steinmeier straight after talks with us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who is also trying to soothe her country 's tense relations with russia .
a sense of doom with attempts to negotiate a key eu-russia partnership accord in tatters , there were few signs that germany 's intervention as head of the rotating presidency of the european union could salvage the summit .
russia 's foreign ministry accused poland of holding eu-russia relations " hostage " by blocking discussion of the partnership deal , which would govern key areas , including energy supplies , interfax news agency reported .
putin 's representative for eu relations , sergei yastrzhembsky , said there " is no real sense in discussing an accord on which we can not negotiate , " interfax reported .
poland has vetoed negotiations in retaliation for a russian ban on polish meat imports , while lithuania is now also threatening to veto the talks unless russia resumes oil deliveries to a refinery in the north of the baltic state .
warsaw made an additional demand on tuesday that the 27-member eu must pledge to protect the energy security of poland and other eu newcomers that rely on russian oil and gas .
deteriorating ties with west the disputes are fuelling escalating tensions between moscow and new eu member countries of formerly soviet-dominated central europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's ugly dispute over a memorial with estonia have soured moscow 's ties with the eu estonia is also locked in an ugly war of words with russia over the relocation of a soviet-era war memorial in the capital tallinn .
the baltic republic says that a halving of rail freight from russia this month amounts to unofficial economic sanctions .
eu-russia tensions , coupled with increasingly frayed us-russian ties , are contributing to a dramatic deterioration of east-west relations ahead of presidential election seasons in both russia and the united states .
moscow is already in a fierce confrontation with washington over us plans to deploy an anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic .
russia is also at loggerheads with the european union and united states over western-backed plans to give independence to kosovo , a province in russian ally serbia .
a " senseless " summit ahead of his moscow trip , steinmeier sounded pessimistic about the chances of any breakthroughs .
" i can not assure you 100 percent whether progress can be made on individual issues , but even if you do not know you must make an attempt , " he told reporters in brussels .
the german foreign policy chief even addressed rumors that the summit could be cancelled , saying " we have to bring an end to these discussions about whether or not the summit will take place . "
russia 's kommersant daily said steinmeier would be unable " to save the summit from collapse , " while the vedomosti daily called the samara meeting " senseless . "
" the eu-russian summit will either be a relative failure or a scandalous failure .
there will definitely be no negotiations on a partnership agreement .
the participants may not even be able to agree on a joint declaration , " the daily said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " russia wants pragmatic , business-like cooperation " russian and eu delegates meet this week as relations remain taught on issues like independence for kosovo , human rights and the us missile shield .

" six lebanese men accused of plotting to bomb the trains in western germany in july 2006 are currently standing trial in beirut . one of the defendants has confessed to lebanese authorities that he planted the homemade bombs to avenge the publication in denmark of cartoons of the prophet mohammed .
investigators believe the devices failed to explode because of faulty detonators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble has come under fire for allowing intelligence agenicies to snoop on pcs via the internet in addition , a little-known islamic extremist group issued a warning in march that germany could come under attack unless it withdrew its troops from afghanistan . last weekend , us media reported of an imminent attack on americans in germany by an al qaeda cell .
german press reports said five islamists living in the frankfurt area and belonging to a little-known group with ties to al qaeda had triggered a security warning by us authorities last month . schäuble said intelligence services were focusing their efforts on monitoring radical islamist websites in an attempt to spot potential attacks at the planning stage . " the internet gives terrorists a gigantic forum , whether as a communications platform , an advertising portal , or as a virtual training camp and think tank , " schäuble said . right-wing attacks on the rise violence by right-wing extremists also shot up in 2006 by 9.3 per cent , the report by the office for the protection of the constitution showed . the far-right national democratic party -lrb- ndp -rrb- gained 1,000 new members to take their membership to 7,000 .
schäuble voiced concern that neo-nazis have a growing influence on the npd leadership and spoke of the " alarming development " that the extreme right was gaining more acceptance in society . the interior minister , however , rejected the idea of attempting to ban the party , saying this would make it more difficult to observe ndp activities . concern over g-8 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been a series of anti-g8 protests in the past weeks the report found that left-wing violence dropped by 3.8 percent , but schäuble used the opportunity to warn that that the government would n't allow " potential violence to hinder the orderly course of the g8 summit , " which germany is hosting at the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm on june 6-8 . german police last week staged a series of raids on the homes and offices of militant left-wingers suspected of planning to disrupt the meeting between the leaders of germany , france , italy , britain , the united states , canada , japan and russia . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reports say raids on g8 protestors uncovered explosives amid growing criticism of a crackdown on leftwing protestors ahead of the g8 summit , news reports say recent raids by german police have yielded a range of incendiary materials .

schadenfreude inappropriate the consequences of that are immense , and feeling a sense of schadenfreude would be inappropriate .
after all , corporate strategies that have gotten out of control have once again caused millions of euros and many jobs to be lost .
daimler managers , with current chief executive dieter zetsche leading them at the time , cut 26,000 jobs at chrysler .
now on its own , chrysler will again have to lay off another 13,000 employees .
and , the way these things work when jobs are cut to increase profitability , what accompanied the announcement of the daimlerchrysler split was a true firework display on the stock market - not unlike the one that followed the news of schrempp 's disreputable departure .
eyes bigger than mouth now it 's official : daimler bit off more than it could chew when it purchased chrysler .
first , there were not enough managers to restructure the already crippled company in the united states ; then , it seemed that money was becoming scarce .
that is when a split becomes mandatory .
the decisive majority-shareholder at chrysler will be the private equity group cerberus capital management .
it will make a capital contribution of 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- - not as a purchase price , it should be noted , but in return for an 80.1-percent equity interest in chrysler .
in order to shed itself of chrysler , daimler must also throw in 1.2 billion euros .
chrysler must now rely on its own strengths .
in addition to having to rid itself of now hard-to-sell pick-up trucks and suv 's , it must also market fuel-efficient small cars since the american conscience has also changed . neither chrysler , nor general motors nor ford , was prepared for that .
cerberus managers may now put a lot of pressure on chrysler to make those changes quickly .
daimler to profit most yet it is daimler which is profiting the most from the divorce since the maker of luxury cars , trucks and buses will no longer have chrysler as an albatross hanging from its neck .
the reputation of daimler 's management , however , has taken another beating .
after all , the bad investment that cost many billions of euros is not restricted to the chrysler issue alone , but is part of a larger complex that has dominated the ranks of daimler 's management for years .
the goal was a european-american-asian automotive company in which the sun never sets .
the result has been a financial disaster .
it 's a good thing that managers neither design nor build cars because mercedes has only survived these managerial adventures because the swabian engineers and workers of the company make such fantastic cars that can be sold high prices on the world market .
in other words : though they fervently tried for many years , the upper echelon of daimler managers just was n't able to drive the corporate group completely into the ground . karl zawadzky is a dw economics expert -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler to sell chrysler to cerberus german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler said on monday it had agreed to sell control of its loss-making us arm chrysler to private equity firm cerberus , for 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- .

" after difficult negotiations , we have come up with a viable compromise on the roaming regulation , " said conservative austrian mp paul rübig , who led the talks at the parliament . the compromise still needs to be formalized , first by members states ' experts on wednesday , then by a vote before the european parliament in a plenary sitting next week , and finally by eu ministers on june 7 . " we now have a solid compromise on the table that can get backing from everyone , " said german economy minister michael glos , adding that " with a little goodwill we can get an agreement . "
under the agreement , rates for calls made while in other eu countries would be capped in the first year of application at 0.49 euros -lrb- $ 0.66 -rrb- a minute .
receiving calls could cost no more than 0.24 euros .

it had found evidence of huge variations between operators ' prices , with some roaming calls costing up to six times those of local mobile calls . the package has the industry up in arms .
it has argued that fierce competition has already driven down prices and has been lobbying hard to get the plans watered down . even though the deal brought mobile phone users closer to cheaper roaming rates , the beuc european consumer association was left unimpressed by the compromise . " for us , the roaming rates remain high , " said spokesman dominique forrest .
" it 's a first step , but as it is on the table , it 's not enough . " the french consumer association ufc-que choisir was even more critical of the agreement , charging that it still allowed operators to make huge profits on the back of mobile phone users .
" the compromise gives in to the current excuse for a market which allows operators to have huge margins on calls received or made while abroad even though the cost is close to that for national calls , " it said in a statement .
consumers ca n't benefit from deal on their summer holidays although the new regulations could go into effect as early as mid-july , according to a diplomat , mobile phone users will not be able to benefit from the new rates until after the summer holiday period . the european commission had hoped that the new rates would be in place by the summer holidays . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu panel backs plans to cap mobile roaming rates european union plans to cap the price operators can charge mobile phone users while abroad cleared a key hurdle on thursday when a panel in the european parliament backed the package .

" we are all safer if we operate in a world in which intelligent use of information allows for more focussed efforts in determining who is a threat , " us secretary of homeland security michael chertoff said on monday after a meeting with european union lawmakers and officials .
the us and the 27-member eu are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
" we need to make sure that we have to provide the civilized world with appropriate tools to identify new security threats , " chertoff told a news briefing in brussels .
the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years .
data flow under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 34 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines face fines if they fail to pass on information such as credit card numbers washington has warned that airlines which failed to share passenger data would face fines of up to $ 6,000 -lrb- $ 4,450 -rrb- per passenger and a possible loss of landing rights .
chertoff said that the us wanted to make sure that a new agreement , which has to be clinched by the end of july , would ensure a " sufficient period of time " for the storage of data , arguing that terrorists were planning their plots over several years .
he also said that the us was working on new legislation under which foreign air passengers travelling to the us would be required to feed their data into an online database days ahead of the trip .
this new plan would enable the us " to inform people in advance if there is going to be a problem in allowing them to travel , " chertoff said .
kept for how long ?
eu justice commissioner franco frattini said that the two sides were still disagreeing on how long us authorities should be able to use data about passengers on transatlantic flights , when it should be destroyed and which government agencies should have access to the sensitive information .
the us also wants to pull data directly from airline computers , but european countries insist airlines must transmit the information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the date agreement will affect flights bound for the us eu data protection officials have demanded that personal data sent to us authorities should be made anonymous and the identity of their owner only be revealed if the data matched a profile in a terrorist database .
they have also said that a new deal on passenger data-sharing could be challenged by eu national courts .
the eu and the us are increasingly at odds over how to reconcile civil liberties with the us-led fight against terrorism .
brussels and washington have also locked horns over a secret agreement between the us treasury and the belgium-based money transfer company swift , which has supplied us authorities with personal data for use in counter-terrorism inquiries . dw staff -lrb- kj -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report says attack against americans in germany imminent us and german officials believe a terrorist attack against americans in germany is imminent , us media reported friday .

they have also said that a new deal on passenger data-sharing could be challenged by eu national courts .
the eu and the us are increasingly at odds over how to reconcile civil liberties with the us-led fight against terrorism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.05.2007 opinion : the end of daimler 's " world inc . " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nine-year , trans-atlantic marriage of automakers daimler and chrysler has come to an end and it 's probably best that way for all involved , said deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky . what daimlerchrysler 's former chief jürgen schrempp once called a " marriage from heaven " has now , after nine years , ended in a mundane divorce .
and it 's probably the best thing that could have happened - for both companies .
even though they will remain connected for years to come in joint technical projects and daimler 's minor stake in chrysler , they still have better chances going it alone in the automotive business than being involved in a relationship designed along the lines of jürgen schrempp 's vision of a welt ag or world inc .
that dream quickly revealed itself to be a mere delusion of grandeur .
schadenfreude inappropriate the consequences of that are immense , and feeling a sense of schadenfreude would be inappropriate .
after all , corporate strategies that have gotten out of control have once again caused millions of euros and many jobs to be lost .
daimler managers , with current chief executive dieter zetsche leading them at the time , cut 26,000 jobs at chrysler .
now on its own , chrysler will again have to lay off another 13,000 employees .
and , the way these things work when jobs are cut to increase profitability , what accompanied the announcement of the daimlerchrysler split was a true firework display on the stock market - not unlike the one that followed the news of schrempp 's disreputable departure .
eyes bigger than mouth now it 's official : daimler bit off more than it could chew when it purchased chrysler .
first , there were not enough managers to restructure the already crippled company in the united states ; then , it seemed that money was becoming scarce .
that is when a split becomes mandatory .
the decisive majority-shareholder at chrysler will be the private equity group cerberus capital management .
it will make a capital contribution of 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- - not as a purchase price , it should be noted , but in return for an 80.1-percent equity interest in chrysler .
in order to shed itself of chrysler , daimler must also throw in 1.2 billion euros .
chrysler must now rely on its own strengths .
in addition to having to rid itself of now hard-to-sell pick-up trucks and suv 's , it must also market fuel-efficient small cars since the american conscience has also changed . neither chrysler , nor general motors nor ford , was prepared for that .
cerberus managers may now put a lot of pressure on chrysler to make those changes quickly .
daimler to profit most yet it is daimler which is profiting the most from the divorce since the maker of luxury cars , trucks and buses will no longer have chrysler as an albatross hanging from its neck .
the reputation of daimler 's management , however , has taken another beating .
after all , the bad investment that cost many billions of euros is not restricted to the chrysler issue alone , but is part of a larger complex that has dominated the ranks of daimler 's management for years .
the goal was a european-american-asian automotive company in which the sun never sets .
the result has been a financial disaster .
it 's a good thing that managers neither design nor build cars because mercedes has only survived these managerial adventures because the swabian engineers and workers of the company make such fantastic cars that can be sold high prices on the world market .
in other words : though they fervently tried for many years , the upper echelon of daimler managers just was n't able to drive the corporate group completely into the ground . karl zawadzky is a dw economics expert -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler to sell chrysler to cerberus german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler said on monday it had agreed to sell control of its loss-making us arm chrysler to private equity firm cerberus , for 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : blair bows out blair endorses gordon brown as candidate for british pm european press review : " it 's blair 's fault britain is relieved " gordon brown , the next man in number 10 praise floods in for blair from europe , us european union -pipe- 15.05.2007 brown 's britain : striking an eu-us balance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together with european partners , a more equal partnership with us under brown passionately pro-european and atlanticist , tony blair sought good relations with both the eu and the us , although his pragmatic successor gordon brown is more likely to achieve both . from winston churchill to tony blair , every post-war prime minister has been consumed by a foreign policy that has boiled down to the choice between europe and the united states while trying to establish an independent british role in the world .
although britain emerged as an allied victor from the ashes of world war ii , some say she won the war , but lost the peace .
her vast imperial empire had disintegrated , and the " special relationship " with the united states , a partnership forged by a common heritage and the war , went through rough patches after the suez crisis in 1956 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartime leader winston churchill -lrb- right -rrb- chose the us over europe the anglo-french conspiracy to topple egypt ’ s gamal abdel nasser met with us hostility , shattering both british pretensions in the middle east and illusions about the loyalty of its closest ally .
america emerged as a superpower , while britain , like france , was reduced to a mid-sized nuclear power with a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
as an increasingly junior partner in the anglo-american relationship , she had to look for alliances elsewhere , and this meant reluctantly throwing in her lot with neighbors across the english channel .
that the uk was a latecomer in joining the european club in 1973 had to do with what french statesman charles de gaulle perceived as the conflict of her ties to the commonwealth and america .
de gaulle had used france ’ s veto to keep britain out of the european economic community -lrb- eec -rrb- , so when the uk finally did join 15 years after the founding of the treaty of rome , she joined a club where the rules had already been set by others .
hence britain 's relationship to europe has often been an adversarial one .
iron lady margaret thatcher had made britain a pariah state by demanding a rebate for the amount the uk was paying into eec coffers in farm subsidies and opting out of the community ’ s social charter .
in a decade of the current labour government , britain is the only major european union country which has not signed on to the border-free schengen accords , and not adopted the common currency , the euro . iraq war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair 's support of iraq war reinforced european view that britain favors the us but above all , it was outgoing prime minister tony blair ’ s staunch support for the american-led iraq war against overwhelming public sentiment that greatly diminished his premiership and reinforced the view among the french and germans that britain still favors the us over europe although gordon brown , blair 's almost certain successor on june 27 , was closely identified with the cabinet ’ s iraq policy , experts say that he is more likely to distance himself from the bush administration , yet seek closer trans-atlantic ties in conjunction with britain 's european partners .
" brown 's under public pressure not to have an exclusive relationship with the white house that was so damaging for britain under blair , " said hugo brady of the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank .
brady also sees a greater convergence of the eu 's big three - the uk , france and germany - in spite of brown 's reputation as a euro skeptic who as chancellor of the exchequer , britain 's finance minister , kept his country out of the euro zone . the fact that newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy has expressed admiration rather than contempt for " anglo-saxon " free markets also helps , and even germany ’ s angela merkel is a natural ally when it comes to her atlanticist leanings and advocacy of structural reforms that could bring further boost continental europe 's economy .
above all , all three leaders , who belong to europe 's post-war generation , are more pragmatic than their more ideologically motivated predecessors . eu relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain was off the hook after french and dutch voters rejected the eu constitution " brown is not passionate about europe , but because of it , he will be able to get further in brussels than someone so outwardly messianic about it like blair , " said brady , who explained that blair went too far with the british public in pushing for an eu constitution , which merkel wants to salvage before the end of germany 's six-month rotating eu presidency .
after french and dutch voters rejected it in 2005 , the british referendum was called off , saving blair from the embarrassing risk of a likely " no " at the ballot box .
" even the founding member states are more cautious about guarding what they perceive as their national interests and uncomfortable about the idea a superstate imposed on them from brussels , so the british are less on the outs than they used to be , " said julie smith , deputy director of the centre of international studies at cambridge university .
as blair 's finance minister , brown has said that he did not support the euro , because it was not in britain 's economic interest , although others say that the decision was purely political . " people are attached to the sterling .
it 's a symbol of british greatness , " said brady .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain and its eu partners are divided about turkey the one controversial issue that keeps britain aligned with the united states in opposition to its european partners is the country 's support for turkey 's membership in the eu , which has been opposed by sarkozy and merkel , although she has softened her stance since becoming chancellor .
britain , like the us , favors keeping the door open to turkey for geopolitical reasons , whereas france and germany see an influx of cheap labor and the problems of integrating a poor , predominantly muslim country .
the turkish issue also reflects the difference in the british vision of a broader confederation of nation states with the conflicting french desire for a deeper political integration and a tighter club .
relations with the united states are expected to be less divisive among the eu-3 , making it even possible for the uk to have good relations with both europe and the us at the same time , according to smith . " britain has never achieved the right balance .
tony blair tried , but gravitated too far towards america .
gordon brown may have a better chance of getting it right , " she said .
furthermore , according to brady , a humbled george w. bush in the twilight years of the american presidency is more likely to treat europe as an equal partner . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel calls for eu constitution push at mini summit chancellor angela merkel on saturday said germany needs the support of eu members , in particular the next two eu presidencies portugal and slovenia , if europe 's stalled constitution is to move forward .
-lrb- 12.05.2007 -rrb- blair endorses gordon brown as candidate for british pm outgoing british prime minister tony blair formally endorsed his finance minister gordon brown to become his successor friday , saying he would make a " great prime minister .

" merkel , the daughter of a protestant pastor and the leader of germany 's strongly catholic cdu party , has been pushing strongly for a reference to christianity in the new charter . however , any attempt to mention christianity or god in the treaty has been strictly opposed by secular france , liberal countries such as sweden and denmark and by britain . during the 2004 negotiations on the bloc 's original constitution , there were concerns that any religious reference could anger europe 's muslims and jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and dutch rejection of the treaty plunged the eu into a crisis merkel , who currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency , wants member states to agree to a mandate for a new treaty at the next european summit in june .
the original draft was ratified by 18 of the 27 eu member states , but was vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 . portugal behind merkel foreign minister luis amado of portugal , which assumes the eu presidency in july , urged fellow member states on tuesday to swiftly agree on a new treaty of sorely-needed reforms for the bloc . presenting the priorities for portugal 's six-month turn at the eu helm , amado stressed that the 27 eu nations " need a new treaty and we need it fast " . he said he hoped that the current german eu presidency , which ends on june 30 , " succeeds in working out a new agreement and a clear mandate " . if that is done then the portuguese presidency will make it their priority to deliver a new constitution , he told reporters , stressing the original charter should form the basis of its successor . " the basis for this treaty is not to be invented .
we got a strong consensus on the constitutional treaty and that should be the basis of a new agreement , " amado said .

minimum wage issues remain unresolved . during a cabinet meeting late monday night , leaders of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ended months of disagreement and agreed to create new child care provisions , part of a bid to catch up with other european countries on family politics and encourage mothers to work and reverse a declining birthrate . " there was a really large coalition formed for children and families , " family affairs minister ursula von der leyen told german public broadcaster ard on tuesday . coalition leaders punctuated the talks with the " breakthrough " on child care , according to spd head kurt beck .
christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , leader edmund stoiber emphasized that the panel also agreed on payments of 150 euros a month to families for raising children at home . " it is a sustainable compromise , " stoiber added .
states already accepted plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany lags behind european neighbors in day care last month , german states endorsed the plan that was adopted monday night , which calls for tripling the number of day care places for children under age three to 750,000 by 2013 .
the move was championed by von der leyen , a mother of seven who has stirred the ire of conservatives who see the provisions for child care as a break with traditional family values .
von der leyen 's proposal foresees the federal government covering one-third of the total 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.2 billion -rrb- in costs for expanding day care spaces for kids , but it is still unclear how federal , state and municipal governments plan to fund the expenses .
at present , germany lags behind its european neighbors in providing day care .
figures released by the government show 13.5 percent of children under three attend nursery schools , compared with the european average of 35 percent . easing burden on low-wage earners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctor , mother and politician von der leyen has ruffled her party 's feathers the coalition was unable to settle the divisive issue of implementing a minimum wage , with both beck and stoiber confirming that subject is still unresolved . labor unions want a minimum hourly wage of 7.50 euros to protect german workers from being undercut by cheap foreign labor , but merkel 's cdu says a new minimum wage would lead to job losses .
the cdu and spd , however , did agree on easing the burden on low-income earners .
those who earn between 800 euros and 1300 euros and also draw on social welfare benefits will no longer have to make social insurance contributions .
according to the federal labor agency , around half a million people in germany earn so little , that they must supplement their income with social welfare . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germans and their politicians badly need a course correction " as germans discuss increasing childcare opportunities and women in the workforce , german performer désirée nick taks to dw-world.de about motherhood and climbing the career ladder in high heels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.05.2007 opinion : the end of daimler 's " world inc . " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nine-year , trans-atlantic marriage of automakers daimler and chrysler has come to an end and it 's probably best that way for all involved , said deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky . what daimlerchrysler 's former chief jürgen schrempp once called a " marriage from heaven " has now , after nine years , ended in a mundane divorce .
and it 's probably the best thing that could have happened - for both companies .
even though they will remain connected for years to come in joint technical projects and daimler 's minor stake in chrysler , they still have better chances going it alone in the automotive business than being involved in a relationship designed along the lines of jürgen schrempp 's vision of a welt ag or world inc .
that dream quickly revealed itself to be a mere delusion of grandeur .
schadenfreude inappropriate the consequences of that are immense , and feeling a sense of schadenfreude would be inappropriate .
after all , corporate strategies that have gotten out of control have once again caused millions of euros and many jobs to be lost .
daimler managers , with current chief executive dieter zetsche leading them at the time , cut 26,000 jobs at chrysler .
now on its own , chrysler will again have to lay off another 13,000 employees .
and , the way these things work when jobs are cut to increase profitability , what accompanied the announcement of the daimlerchrysler split was a true firework display on the stock market - not unlike the one that followed the news of schrempp 's disreputable departure .
eyes bigger than mouth now it 's official : daimler bit off more than it could chew when it purchased chrysler .
first , there were not enough managers to restructure the already crippled company in the united states ; then , it seemed that money was becoming scarce .
that is when a split becomes mandatory .
the decisive majority-shareholder at chrysler will be the private equity group cerberus capital management .
it will make a capital contribution of 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- - not as a purchase price , it should be noted , but in return for an 80.1-percent equity interest in chrysler .
in order to shed itself of chrysler , daimler must also throw in 1.2 billion euros .
chrysler must now rely on its own strengths .
in addition to having to rid itself of now hard-to-sell pick-up trucks and suv 's , it must also market fuel-efficient small cars since the american conscience has also changed . neither chrysler , nor general motors nor ford , was prepared for that .
cerberus managers may now put a lot of pressure on chrysler to make those changes quickly .
daimler to profit most yet it is daimler which is profiting the most from the divorce since the maker of luxury cars , trucks and buses will no longer have chrysler as an albatross hanging from its neck .
the reputation of daimler 's management , however , has taken another beating .
after all , the bad investment that cost many billions of euros is not restricted to the chrysler issue alone , but is part of a larger complex that has dominated the ranks of daimler 's management for years .
the goal was a european-american-asian automotive company in which the sun never sets .
the result has been a financial disaster .
it 's a good thing that managers neither design nor build cars because mercedes has only survived these managerial adventures because the swabian engineers and workers of the company make such fantastic cars that can be sold high prices on the world market .
in other words : though they fervently tried for many years , the upper echelon of daimler managers just was n't able to drive the corporate group completely into the ground . karl zawadzky is a dw economics expert -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler to sell chrysler to cerberus german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler said on monday it had agreed to sell control of its loss-making us arm chrysler to private equity firm cerberus , for 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- .

although britain emerged as an allied victor from the ashes of world war ii , some say she won the war , but lost the peace .
her vast imperial empire had disintegrated , and the " special relationship " with the united states , a partnership forged by a common heritage and the war , went through rough patches after the suez crisis in 1956 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartime leader winston churchill -lrb- right -rrb- chose the us over europe the anglo-french conspiracy to topple egypt ’ s gamal abdel nasser met with us hostility , shattering both british pretensions in the middle east and illusions about the loyalty of its closest ally .
america emerged as a superpower , while britain , like france , was reduced to a mid-sized nuclear power with a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
as an increasingly junior partner in the anglo-american relationship , she had to look for alliances elsewhere , and this meant reluctantly throwing in her lot with neighbors across the english channel .
that the uk was a latecomer in joining the european club in 1973 had to do with what french statesman charles de gaulle perceived as the conflict of her ties to the commonwealth and america .
de gaulle had used france ’ s veto to keep britain out of the european economic community -lrb- eec -rrb- , so when the uk finally did join 15 years after the founding of the treaty of rome , she joined a club where the rules had already been set by others .
hence britain 's relationship to europe has often been an adversarial one .
iron lady margaret thatcher had made britain a pariah state by demanding a rebate for the amount the uk was paying into eec coffers in farm subsidies and opting out of the community ’ s social charter .
in a decade of the current labour government , britain is the only major european union country which has not signed on to the border-free schengen accords , and not adopted the common currency , the euro . iraq war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair 's support of iraq war reinforced european view that britain favors the us but above all , it was outgoing prime minister tony blair ’ s staunch support for the american-led iraq war against overwhelming public sentiment that greatly diminished his premiership and reinforced the view among the french and germans that britain still favors the us over europe although gordon brown , blair 's almost certain successor on june 27 , was closely identified with the cabinet ’ s iraq policy , experts say that he is more likely to distance himself from the bush administration , yet seek closer trans-atlantic ties in conjunction with britain 's european partners .
" brown 's under public pressure not to have an exclusive relationship with the white house that was so damaging for britain under blair , " said hugo brady of the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank .
brady also sees a greater convergence of the eu 's big three - the uk , france and germany - in spite of brown 's reputation as a euro skeptic who as chancellor of the exchequer , britain 's finance minister , kept his country out of the euro zone . the fact that newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy has expressed admiration rather than contempt for " anglo-saxon " free markets also helps , and even germany ’ s angela merkel is a natural ally when it comes to her atlanticist leanings and advocacy of structural reforms that could bring further boost continental europe 's economy .
above all , all three leaders , who belong to europe 's post-war generation , are more pragmatic than their more ideologically motivated predecessors . eu relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain was off the hook after french and dutch voters rejected the eu constitution " brown is not passionate about europe , but because of it , he will be able to get further in brussels than someone so outwardly messianic about it like blair , " said brady , who explained that blair went too far with the british public in pushing for an eu constitution , which merkel wants to salvage before the end of germany 's six-month rotating eu presidency .
after french and dutch voters rejected it in 2005 , the british referendum was called off , saving blair from the embarrassing risk of a likely " no " at the ballot box .
" even the founding member states are more cautious about guarding what they perceive as their national interests and uncomfortable about the idea a superstate imposed on them from brussels , so the british are less on the outs than they used to be , " said julie smith , deputy director of the centre of international studies at cambridge university .
as blair 's finance minister , brown has said that he did not support the euro , because it was not in britain 's economic interest , although others say that the decision was purely political . " people are attached to the sterling .
it 's a symbol of british greatness , " said brady .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain and its eu partners are divided about turkey the one controversial issue that keeps britain aligned with the united states in opposition to its european partners is the country 's support for turkey 's membership in the eu , which has been opposed by sarkozy and merkel , although she has softened her stance since becoming chancellor .
britain , like the us , favors keeping the door open to turkey for geopolitical reasons , whereas france and germany see an influx of cheap labor and the problems of integrating a poor , predominantly muslim country .
the turkish issue also reflects the difference in the british vision of a broader confederation of nation states with the conflicting french desire for a deeper political integration and a tighter club .
relations with the united states are expected to be less divisive among the eu-3 , making it even possible for the uk to have good relations with both europe and the us at the same time , according to smith . " britain has never achieved the right balance .
tony blair tried , but gravitated too far towards america .
gordon brown may have a better chance of getting it right , " she said .
furthermore , according to brady , a humbled george w. bush in the twilight years of the american presidency is more likely to treat europe as an equal partner . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel calls for eu constitution push at mini summit chancellor angela merkel on saturday said germany needs the support of eu members , in particular the next two eu presidencies portugal and slovenia , if europe 's stalled constitution is to move forward .

" we are all safer if we operate in a world in which intelligent use of information allows for more focussed efforts in determining who is a threat , " us secretary of homeland security michael chertoff said on monday after a meeting with european union lawmakers and officials .
the us and the 27-member eu are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
" we need to make sure that we have to provide the civilized world with appropriate tools to identify new security threats , " chertoff told a news briefing in brussels .
the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years .
data flow under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 34 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines face fines if they fail to pass on information such as credit card numbers washington has warned that airlines which failed to share passenger data would face fines of up to $ 6,000 -lrb- $ 4,450 -rrb- per passenger and a possible loss of landing rights .
chertoff said that the us wanted to make sure that a new agreement , which has to be clinched by the end of july , would ensure a " sufficient period of time " for the storage of data , arguing that terrorists were planning their plots over several years .
he also said that the us was working on new legislation under which foreign air passengers travelling to the us would be required to feed their data into an online database days ahead of the trip .
this new plan would enable the us " to inform people in advance if there is going to be a problem in allowing them to travel , " chertoff said .
kept for how long ?
eu justice commissioner franco frattini said that the two sides were still disagreeing on how long us authorities should be able to use data about passengers on transatlantic flights , when it should be destroyed and which government agencies should have access to the sensitive information .
the us also wants to pull data directly from airline computers , but european countries insist airlines must transmit the information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the date agreement will affect flights bound for the us eu data protection officials have demanded that personal data sent to us authorities should be made anonymous and the identity of their owner only be revealed if the data matched a profile in a terrorist database .
they have also said that a new deal on passenger data-sharing could be challenged by eu national courts .
the eu and the us are increasingly at odds over how to reconcile civil liberties with the us-led fight against terrorism .
brussels and washington have also locked horns over a secret agreement between the us treasury and the belgium-based money transfer company swift , which has supplied us authorities with personal data for use in counter-terrorism inquiries . dw staff -lrb- kj -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report says attack against americans in germany imminent us and german officials believe a terrorist attack against americans in germany is imminent , us media reported friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 15.05.2007 germany 's coalition agrees on radical expansion of nurseries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents will have a legal right to a day care spot for their kids in 2013 chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition has approved a tripling of nursery school facilities that would guarantee every family a place in the state day care system by 2013 .
minimum wage issues remain unresolved . during a cabinet meeting late monday night , leaders of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ended months of disagreement and agreed to create new child care provisions , part of a bid to catch up with other european countries on family politics and encourage mothers to work and reverse a declining birthrate . " there was a really large coalition formed for children and families , " family affairs minister ursula von der leyen told german public broadcaster ard on tuesday . coalition leaders punctuated the talks with the " breakthrough " on child care , according to spd head kurt beck .
christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , leader edmund stoiber emphasized that the panel also agreed on payments of 150 euros a month to families for raising children at home . " it is a sustainable compromise , " stoiber added .
states already accepted plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany lags behind european neighbors in day care last month , german states endorsed the plan that was adopted monday night , which calls for tripling the number of day care places for children under age three to 750,000 by 2013 .
the move was championed by von der leyen , a mother of seven who has stirred the ire of conservatives who see the provisions for child care as a break with traditional family values .
von der leyen 's proposal foresees the federal government covering one-third of the total 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.2 billion -rrb- in costs for expanding day care spaces for kids , but it is still unclear how federal , state and municipal governments plan to fund the expenses .
at present , germany lags behind its european neighbors in providing day care .
figures released by the government show 13.5 percent of children under three attend nursery schools , compared with the european average of 35 percent . easing burden on low-wage earners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctor , mother and politician von der leyen has ruffled her party 's feathers the coalition was unable to settle the divisive issue of implementing a minimum wage , with both beck and stoiber confirming that subject is still unresolved . labor unions want a minimum hourly wage of 7.50 euros to protect german workers from being undercut by cheap foreign labor , but merkel 's cdu says a new minimum wage would lead to job losses .
the cdu and spd , however , did agree on easing the burden on low-income earners .
those who earn between 800 euros and 1300 euros and also draw on social welfare benefits will no longer have to make social insurance contributions .
according to the federal labor agency , around half a million people in germany earn so little , that they must supplement their income with social welfare . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germans and their politicians badly need a course correction " as germans discuss increasing childcare opportunities and women in the workforce , german performer désirée nick taks to dw-world.de about motherhood and climbing the career ladder in high heels .

after the sensible idea of promoting exercise comes the slightly mad idea of pricing fatty foods out of the average budget . being fingered as the fattest nation in europe has really got the germans ' oversized panties in a bunch .

scared that the germans ' reputation as sport-mad , health-conscious types is being consigned to the rubbish bin of history - along with all the pizza boxes and burger wrappers - german leaders are wracking their brains to come up with policies that help the populace shed their pounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all bought and paid for - but at what price ?
following on from the launch of the five-point action plan " fit instead of fat , " which the government hopes will promote more active lifestyles and encourage germans to pay more attention to healthy nutrition , the powers-that-be are now grabbing at more desperate straws .
the latest weapon in the battle of the bulge could be a " fat tax . "
in response to the damning report from the international association for the study of obesity , which found that 58.9 percent of german women are overweight and 75.4 percent of men tip the scales , the german government is proposing to increase the tax on foods that are high in calories .
the thinking behind this is that the more expensive the food , the less likely people will want to eat it .
therefore , by abstaining from eating high-calorie , high-cost food , germans will get thinner .
while there is more than a little bit of twisted logic in this thinking , the german government seems to be ignoring a couple of key factors which should potentially scupper the idea before the prices of chips and soft drinks even get the chance to go up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generation x-box needs to get out and exercise firstly , the idea that hiking the tax on a product will mean less people will buy it is historically flawed .
the sales of cigarettes and alcohol have not suffered unduly through massive price increases over the years .
if someone wants to smoke or have a drink , they will , regardless of price .
the same can almost certainly be said for certain favorite fatty foods .
secondly , the problem isn ’ t the amount of calories but what is done to burn them off .
this is why the " fit instead of fat " plan is a far better way of tackling the obesity problem .
germans are n't the fattest in europe because they eat more calories but because they move less .
this is particularly true of children .
so , rather than trying to price calorie-laden foods out of the common person 's budget , the german government should think again .
and if they really want to introduce bird-brained ideas to encourage people to lose weight , why not try a " sitting on your backside tax . "
people will be less willing to sit around gaining weight if it 's taking precious cigarette and beer money away from them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government wants germans to get fit , not fat in response to a recent study which showed that germans are fatter than all other europeans , the german government called wednesday for concrete steps to wage a nationwide battle of the bulge .

in response to the damning report from the international association for the study of obesity , which found that 58.9 percent of german women are overweight and 75.4 percent of men tip the scales , the german government is proposing to increase the tax on foods that are high in calories .
the thinking behind this is that the more expensive the food , the less likely people will want to eat it .
therefore , by abstaining from eating high-calorie , high-cost food , germans will get thinner .
while there is more than a little bit of twisted logic in this thinking , the german government seems to be ignoring a couple of key factors which should potentially scupper the idea before the prices of chips and soft drinks even get the chance to go up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generation x-box needs to get out and exercise firstly , the idea that hiking the tax on a product will mean less people will buy it is historically flawed .
the sales of cigarettes and alcohol have not suffered unduly through massive price increases over the years .
if someone wants to smoke or have a drink , they will , regardless of price .
the same can almost certainly be said for certain favorite fatty foods .
secondly , the problem isn ’ t the amount of calories but what is done to burn them off .
this is why the " fit instead of fat " plan is a far better way of tackling the obesity problem .
germans are n't the fattest in europe because they eat more calories but because they move less .
this is particularly true of children .
so , rather than trying to price calorie-laden foods out of the common person 's budget , the german government should think again .
and if they really want to introduce bird-brained ideas to encourage people to lose weight , why not try a " sitting on your backside tax . "

" after difficult negotiations , we have come up with a viable compromise on the roaming regulation , " said conservative austrian mp paul rübig , who led the talks at the parliament . the compromise still needs to be formalized , first by members states ' experts on wednesday , then by a vote before the european parliament in a plenary sitting next week , and finally by eu ministers on june 7 . " we now have a solid compromise on the table that can get backing from everyone , " said german economy minister michael glos , adding that " with a little goodwill we can get an agreement . "
under the agreement , rates for calls made while in other eu countries would be capped in the first year of application at 0.49 euros -lrb- $ 0.66 -rrb- a minute .
receiving calls could cost no more than 0.24 euros .
the ceiling for so-called roaming services would come down even lower in the second year , falling to 0.46 and 0.22 euros and then 0.43 and 0.19 euros in the third year . deal has mobile industry up in arms the european commission drew up the plans to regulate roaming rates last year .
it had found evidence of huge variations between operators ' prices , with some roaming calls costing up to six times those of local mobile calls . the package has the industry up in arms .
it has argued that fierce competition has already driven down prices and has been lobbying hard to get the plans watered down . even though the deal brought mobile phone users closer to cheaper roaming rates , the beuc european consumer association was left unimpressed by the compromise . " for us , the roaming rates remain high , " said spokesman dominique forrest .
" it 's a first step , but as it is on the table , it 's not enough . " the french consumer association ufc-que choisir was even more critical of the agreement , charging that it still allowed operators to make huge profits on the back of mobile phone users .
" the compromise gives in to the current excuse for a market which allows operators to have huge margins on calls received or made while abroad even though the cost is close to that for national calls , " it said in a statement .
consumers ca n't benefit from deal on their summer holidays although the new regulations could go into effect as early as mid-july , according to a diplomat , mobile phone users will not be able to benefit from the new rates until after the summer holiday period . the european commission had hoped that the new rates would be in place by the summer holidays . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu panel backs plans to cap mobile roaming rates european union plans to cap the price operators can charge mobile phone users while abroad cleared a key hurdle on thursday when a panel in the european parliament backed the package .

" after difficult negotiations , we have come up with a viable compromise on the roaming regulation , " said conservative austrian mp paul rübig , who led the talks at the parliament . the compromise still needs to be formalized , first by members states ' experts on wednesday , then by a vote before the european parliament in a plenary sitting next week , and finally by eu ministers on june 7 . " we now have a solid compromise on the table that can get backing from everyone , " said german economy minister michael glos , adding that " with a little goodwill we can get an agreement . "
under the agreement , rates for calls made while in other eu countries would be capped in the first year of application at 0.49 euros -lrb- $ 0.66 -rrb- a minute .
receiving calls could cost no more than 0.24 euros .
the ceiling for so-called roaming services would come down even lower in the second year , falling to 0.46 and 0.22 euros and then 0.43 and 0.19 euros in the third year . deal has mobile industry up in arms the european commission drew up the plans to regulate roaming rates last year .
it had found evidence of huge variations between operators ' prices , with some roaming calls costing up to six times those of local mobile calls . the package has the industry up in arms .
it has argued that fierce competition has already driven down prices and has been lobbying hard to get the plans watered down . even though the deal brought mobile phone users closer to cheaper roaming rates , the beuc european consumer association was left unimpressed by the compromise . " for us , the roaming rates remain high , " said spokesman dominique forrest .
" it 's a first step , but as it is on the table , it 's not enough . " the french consumer association ufc-que choisir was even more critical of the agreement , charging that it still allowed operators to make huge profits on the back of mobile phone users .
" the compromise gives in to the current excuse for a market which allows operators to have huge margins on calls received or made while abroad even though the cost is close to that for national calls , " it said in a statement .
consumers ca n't benefit from deal on their summer holidays although the new regulations could go into effect as early as mid-july , according to a diplomat , mobile phone users will not be able to benefit from the new rates until after the summer holiday period . the european commission had hoped that the new rates would be in place by the summer holidays . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu panel backs plans to cap mobile roaming rates european union plans to cap the price operators can charge mobile phone users while abroad cleared a key hurdle on thursday when a panel in the european parliament backed the package .

" six lebanese men accused of plotting to bomb the trains in western germany in july 2006 are currently standing trial in beirut . one of the defendants has confessed to lebanese authorities that he planted the homemade bombs to avenge the publication in denmark of cartoons of the prophet mohammed .
investigators believe the devices failed to explode because of faulty detonators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble has come under fire for allowing intelligence agenicies to snoop on pcs via the internet in addition , a little-known islamic extremist group issued a warning in march that germany could come under attack unless it withdrew its troops from afghanistan . last weekend , us media reported of an imminent attack on americans in germany by an al qaeda cell .
german press reports said five islamists living in the frankfurt area and belonging to a little-known group with ties to al qaeda had triggered a security warning by us authorities last month . schäuble said intelligence services were focusing their efforts on monitoring radical islamist websites in an attempt to spot potential attacks at the planning stage . " the internet gives terrorists a gigantic forum , whether as a communications platform , an advertising portal , or as a virtual training camp and think tank , " schäuble said . right-wing attacks on the rise violence by right-wing extremists also shot up in 2006 by 9.3 per cent , the report by the office for the protection of the constitution showed . the far-right national democratic party -lrb- ndp -rrb- gained 1,000 new members to take their membership to 7,000 .
schäuble voiced concern that neo-nazis have a growing influence on the npd leadership and spoke of the " alarming development " that the extreme right was gaining more acceptance in society . the interior minister , however , rejected the idea of attempting to ban the party , saying this would make it more difficult to observe ndp activities . concern over g-8 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been a series of anti-g8 protests in the past weeks the report found that left-wing violence dropped by 3.8 percent , but schäuble used the opportunity to warn that that the government would n't allow " potential violence to hinder the orderly course of the g8 summit , " which germany is hosting at the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm on june 6-8 . german police last week staged a series of raids on the homes and offices of militant left-wingers suspected of planning to disrupt the meeting between the leaders of germany , france , italy , britain , the united states , canada , japan and russia . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reports say raids on g8 protestors uncovered explosives amid growing criticism of a crackdown on leftwing protestors ahead of the g8 summit , news reports say recent raids by german police have yielded a range of incendiary materials .

" six lebanese men accused of plotting to bomb the trains in western germany in july 2006 are currently standing trial in beirut . one of the defendants has confessed to lebanese authorities that he planted the homemade bombs to avenge the publication in denmark of cartoons of the prophet mohammed .
investigators believe the devices failed to explode because of faulty detonators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble has come under fire for allowing intelligence agenicies to snoop on pcs via the internet in addition , a little-known islamic extremist group issued a warning in march that germany could come under attack unless it withdrew its troops from afghanistan . last weekend , us media reported of an imminent attack on americans in germany by an al qaeda cell .
german press reports said five islamists living in the frankfurt area and belonging to a little-known group with ties to al qaeda had triggered a security warning by us authorities last month . schäuble said intelligence services were focusing their efforts on monitoring radical islamist websites in an attempt to spot potential attacks at the planning stage .

schäuble voiced concern that neo-nazis have a growing influence on the npd leadership and spoke of the " alarming development " that the extreme right was gaining more acceptance in society . the interior minister , however , rejected the idea of attempting to ban the party , saying this would make it more difficult to observe ndp activities . concern over g-8 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been a series of anti-g8 protests in the past weeks the report found that left-wing violence dropped by 3.8 percent , but schäuble used the opportunity to warn that that the government would n't allow " potential violence to hinder the orderly course of the g8 summit , " which germany is hosting at the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm on june 6-8 . german police last week staged a series of raids on the homes and offices of militant left-wingers suspected of planning to disrupt the meeting between the leaders of germany , france , italy , britain , the united states , canada , japan and russia . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reports say raids on g8 protestors uncovered explosives amid growing criticism of a crackdown on leftwing protestors ahead of the g8 summit , news reports say recent raids by german police have yielded a range of incendiary materials .

although britain emerged as an allied victor from the ashes of world war ii , some say she won the war , but lost the peace .
her vast imperial empire had disintegrated , and the " special relationship " with the united states , a partnership forged by a common heritage and the war , went through rough patches after the suez crisis in 1956 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartime leader winston churchill -lrb- right -rrb- chose the us over europe the anglo-french conspiracy to topple egypt ’ s gamal abdel nasser met with us hostility , shattering both british pretensions in the middle east and illusions about the loyalty of its closest ally .
america emerged as a superpower , while britain , like france , was reduced to a mid-sized nuclear power with a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
as an increasingly junior partner in the anglo-american relationship , she had to look for alliances elsewhere , and this meant reluctantly throwing in her lot with neighbors across the english channel .
that the uk was a latecomer in joining the european club in 1973 had to do with what french statesman charles de gaulle perceived as the conflict of her ties to the commonwealth and america .
de gaulle had used france ’ s veto to keep britain out of the european economic community -lrb- eec -rrb- , so when the uk finally did join 15 years after the founding of the treaty of rome , she joined a club where the rules had already been set by others .
hence britain 's relationship to europe has often been an adversarial one .
iron lady margaret thatcher had made britain a pariah state by demanding a rebate for the amount the uk was paying into eec coffers in farm subsidies and opting out of the community ’ s social charter .
in a decade of the current labour government , britain is the only major european union country which has not signed on to the border-free schengen accords , and not adopted the common currency , the euro . iraq war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair 's support of iraq war reinforced european view that britain favors the us but above all , it was outgoing prime minister tony blair ’ s staunch support for the american-led iraq war against overwhelming public sentiment that greatly diminished his premiership and reinforced the view among the french and germans that britain still favors the us over europe although gordon brown , blair 's almost certain successor on june 27 , was closely identified with the cabinet ’ s iraq policy , experts say that he is more likely to distance himself from the bush administration , yet seek closer trans-atlantic ties in conjunction with britain 's european partners .
" brown 's under public pressure not to have an exclusive relationship with the white house that was so damaging for britain under blair , " said hugo brady of the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank .
brady also sees a greater convergence of the eu 's big three - the uk , france and germany - in spite of brown 's reputation as a euro skeptic who as chancellor of the exchequer , britain 's finance minister , kept his country out of the euro zone . the fact that newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy has expressed admiration rather than contempt for " anglo-saxon " free markets also helps , and even germany ’ s angela merkel is a natural ally when it comes to her atlanticist leanings and advocacy of structural reforms that could bring further boost continental europe 's economy .
above all , all three leaders , who belong to europe 's post-war generation , are more pragmatic than their more ideologically motivated predecessors . eu relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain was off the hook after french and dutch voters rejected the eu constitution " brown is not passionate about europe , but because of it , he will be able to get further in brussels than someone so outwardly messianic about it like blair , " said brady , who explained that blair went too far with the british public in pushing for an eu constitution , which merkel wants to salvage before the end of germany 's six-month rotating eu presidency .
after french and dutch voters rejected it in 2005 , the british referendum was called off , saving blair from the embarrassing risk of a likely " no " at the ballot box .
" even the founding member states are more cautious about guarding what they perceive as their national interests and uncomfortable about the idea a superstate imposed on them from brussels , so the british are less on the outs than they used to be , " said julie smith , deputy director of the centre of international studies at cambridge university .
as blair 's finance minister , brown has said that he did not support the euro , because it was not in britain 's economic interest , although others say that the decision was purely political . " people are attached to the sterling .
it 's a symbol of british greatness , " said brady .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain and its eu partners are divided about turkey the one controversial issue that keeps britain aligned with the united states in opposition to its european partners is the country 's support for turkey 's membership in the eu , which has been opposed by sarkozy and merkel , although she has softened her stance since becoming chancellor .
britain , like the us , favors keeping the door open to turkey for geopolitical reasons , whereas france and germany see an influx of cheap labor and the problems of integrating a poor , predominantly muslim country .
the turkish issue also reflects the difference in the british vision of a broader confederation of nation states with the conflicting french desire for a deeper political integration and a tighter club .
relations with the united states are expected to be less divisive among the eu-3 , making it even possible for the uk to have good relations with both europe and the us at the same time , according to smith . " britain has never achieved the right balance .
tony blair tried , but gravitated too far towards america .
gordon brown may have a better chance of getting it right , " she said .
furthermore , according to brady , a humbled george w. bush in the twilight years of the american presidency is more likely to treat europe as an equal partner . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel calls for eu constitution push at mini summit chancellor angela merkel on saturday said germany needs the support of eu members , in particular the next two eu presidencies portugal and slovenia , if europe 's stalled constitution is to move forward .

although britain emerged as an allied victor from the ashes of world war ii , some say she won the war , but lost the peace .
her vast imperial empire had disintegrated , and the " special relationship " with the united states , a partnership forged by a common heritage and the war , went through rough patches after the suez crisis in 1956 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartime leader winston churchill -lrb- right -rrb- chose the us over europe the anglo-french conspiracy to topple egypt ’ s gamal abdel nasser met with us hostility , shattering both british pretensions in the middle east and illusions about the loyalty of its closest ally .
america emerged as a superpower , while britain , like france , was reduced to a mid-sized nuclear power with a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
as an increasingly junior partner in the anglo-american relationship , she had to look for alliances elsewhere , and this meant reluctantly throwing in her lot with neighbors across the english channel .
that the uk was a latecomer in joining the european club in 1973 had to do with what french statesman charles de gaulle perceived as the conflict of her ties to the commonwealth and america .
de gaulle had used france ’ s veto to keep britain out of the european economic community -lrb- eec -rrb- , so when the uk finally did join 15 years after the founding of the treaty of rome , she joined a club where the rules had already been set by others .
hence britain 's relationship to europe has often been an adversarial one .
iron lady margaret thatcher had made britain a pariah state by demanding a rebate for the amount the uk was paying into eec coffers in farm subsidies and opting out of the community ’ s social charter .
in a decade of the current labour government , britain is the only major european union country which has not signed on to the border-free schengen accords , and not adopted the common currency , the euro . iraq war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair 's support of iraq war reinforced european view that britain favors the us but above all , it was outgoing prime minister tony blair ’ s staunch support for the american-led iraq war against overwhelming public sentiment that greatly diminished his premiership and reinforced the view among the french and germans that britain still favors the us over europe although gordon brown , blair 's almost certain successor on june 27 , was closely identified with the cabinet ’ s iraq policy , experts say that he is more likely to distance himself from the bush administration , yet seek closer trans-atlantic ties in conjunction with britain 's european partners .
" brown 's under public pressure not to have an exclusive relationship with the white house that was so damaging for britain under blair , " said hugo brady of the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank .
brady also sees a greater convergence of the eu 's big three - the uk , france and germany - in spite of brown 's reputation as a euro skeptic who as chancellor of the exchequer , britain 's finance minister , kept his country out of the euro zone . the fact that newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy has expressed admiration rather than contempt for " anglo-saxon " free markets also helps , and even germany ’ s angela merkel is a natural ally when it comes to her atlanticist leanings and advocacy of structural reforms that could bring further boost continental europe 's economy .
above all , all three leaders , who belong to europe 's post-war generation , are more pragmatic than their more ideologically motivated predecessors . eu relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain was off the hook after french and dutch voters rejected the eu constitution " brown is not passionate about europe , but because of it , he will be able to get further in brussels than someone so outwardly messianic about it like blair , " said brady , who explained that blair went too far with the british public in pushing for an eu constitution , which merkel wants to salvage before the end of germany 's six-month rotating eu presidency .
after french and dutch voters rejected it in 2005 , the british referendum was called off , saving blair from the embarrassing risk of a likely " no " at the ballot box .
" even the founding member states are more cautious about guarding what they perceive as their national interests and uncomfortable about the idea a superstate imposed on them from brussels , so the british are less on the outs than they used to be , " said julie smith , deputy director of the centre of international studies at cambridge university .
as blair 's finance minister , brown has said that he did not support the euro , because it was not in britain 's economic interest , although others say that the decision was purely political . " people are attached to the sterling .
it 's a symbol of british greatness , " said brady .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain and its eu partners are divided about turkey the one controversial issue that keeps britain aligned with the united states in opposition to its european partners is the country 's support for turkey 's membership in the eu , which has been opposed by sarkozy and merkel , although she has softened her stance since becoming chancellor .

" six lebanese men accused of plotting to bomb the trains in western germany in july 2006 are currently standing trial in beirut . one of the defendants has confessed to lebanese authorities that he planted the homemade bombs to avenge the publication in denmark of cartoons of the prophet mohammed .

german press reports said five islamists living in the frankfurt area and belonging to a little-known group with ties to al qaeda had triggered a security warning by us authorities last month . schäuble said intelligence services were focusing their efforts on monitoring radical islamist websites in an attempt to spot potential attacks at the planning stage .

schäuble voiced concern that neo-nazis have a growing influence on the npd leadership and spoke of the " alarming development " that the extreme right was gaining more acceptance in society . the interior minister , however , rejected the idea of attempting to ban the party , saying this would make it more difficult to observe ndp activities . concern over g-8 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been a series of anti-g8 protests in the past weeks the report found that left-wing violence dropped by 3.8 percent , but schäuble used the opportunity to warn that that the government would n't allow " potential violence to hinder the orderly course of the g8 summit , " which germany is hosting at the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm on june 6-8 . german police last week staged a series of raids on the homes and offices of militant left-wingers suspected of planning to disrupt the meeting between the leaders of germany , france , italy , britain , the united states , canada , japan and russia . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reports say raids on g8 protestors uncovered explosives amid growing criticism of a crackdown on leftwing protestors ahead of the g8 summit , news reports say recent raids by german police have yielded a range of incendiary materials .

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nine-year , trans-atlantic marriage of automakers daimler and chrysler has come to an end and it 's probably best that way for all involved , said deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky . what daimlerchrysler 's former chief jürgen schrempp once called a " marriage from heaven " has now , after nine years , ended in a mundane divorce .
and it 's probably the best thing that could have happened - for both companies .
even though they will remain connected for years to come in joint technical projects and daimler 's minor stake in chrysler , they still have better chances going it alone in the automotive business than being involved in a relationship designed along the lines of jürgen schrempp 's vision of a welt ag or world inc .
that dream quickly revealed itself to be a mere delusion of grandeur .
schadenfreude inappropriate the consequences of that are immense , and feeling a sense of schadenfreude would be inappropriate .
after all , corporate strategies that have gotten out of control have once again caused millions of euros and many jobs to be lost .
daimler managers , with current chief executive dieter zetsche leading them at the time , cut 26,000 jobs at chrysler .
now on its own , chrysler will again have to lay off another 13,000 employees .
and , the way these things work when jobs are cut to increase profitability , what accompanied the announcement of the daimlerchrysler split was a true firework display on the stock market - not unlike the one that followed the news of schrempp 's disreputable departure .
eyes bigger than mouth now it 's official : daimler bit off more than it could chew when it purchased chrysler .
first , there were not enough managers to restructure the already crippled company in the united states ; then , it seemed that money was becoming scarce .
that is when a split becomes mandatory .
the decisive majority-shareholder at chrysler will be the private equity group cerberus capital management .
it will make a capital contribution of 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- - not as a purchase price , it should be noted , but in return for an 80.1-percent equity interest in chrysler .
in order to shed itself of chrysler , daimler must also throw in 1.2 billion euros .
chrysler must now rely on its own strengths .
in addition to having to rid itself of now hard-to-sell pick-up trucks and suv 's , it must also market fuel-efficient small cars since the american conscience has also changed . neither chrysler , nor general motors nor ford , was prepared for that .
cerberus managers may now put a lot of pressure on chrysler to make those changes quickly .
daimler to profit most yet it is daimler which is profiting the most from the divorce since the maker of luxury cars , trucks and buses will no longer have chrysler as an albatross hanging from its neck .
the reputation of daimler 's management , however , has taken another beating .
after all , the bad investment that cost many billions of euros is not restricted to the chrysler issue alone , but is part of a larger complex that has dominated the ranks of daimler 's management for years .
the goal was a european-american-asian automotive company in which the sun never sets .
the result has been a financial disaster .
it 's a good thing that managers neither design nor build cars because mercedes has only survived these managerial adventures because the swabian engineers and workers of the company make such fantastic cars that can be sold high prices on the world market .

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nine-year , trans-atlantic marriage of automakers daimler and chrysler has come to an end and it 's probably best that way for all involved , said deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky . what daimlerchrysler 's former chief jürgen schrempp once called a " marriage from heaven " has now , after nine years , ended in a mundane divorce .
and it 's probably the best thing that could have happened - for both companies .
even though they will remain connected for years to come in joint technical projects and daimler 's minor stake in chrysler , they still have better chances going it alone in the automotive business than being involved in a relationship designed along the lines of jürgen schrempp 's vision of a welt ag or world inc .
that dream quickly revealed itself to be a mere delusion of grandeur .
schadenfreude inappropriate the consequences of that are immense , and feeling a sense of schadenfreude would be inappropriate .
after all , corporate strategies that have gotten out of control have once again caused millions of euros and many jobs to be lost .
daimler managers , with current chief executive dieter zetsche leading them at the time , cut 26,000 jobs at chrysler .
now on its own , chrysler will again have to lay off another 13,000 employees .
and , the way these things work when jobs are cut to increase profitability , what accompanied the announcement of the daimlerchrysler split was a true firework display on the stock market - not unlike the one that followed the news of schrempp 's disreputable departure .
eyes bigger than mouth now it 's official : daimler bit off more than it could chew when it purchased chrysler .
first , there were not enough managers to restructure the already crippled company in the united states ; then , it seemed that money was becoming scarce .
that is when a split becomes mandatory .
the decisive majority-shareholder at chrysler will be the private equity group cerberus capital management .
it will make a capital contribution of 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- - not as a purchase price , it should be noted , but in return for an 80.1-percent equity interest in chrysler .
in order to shed itself of chrysler , daimler must also throw in 1.2 billion euros .
chrysler must now rely on its own strengths .
in addition to having to rid itself of now hard-to-sell pick-up trucks and suv 's , it must also market fuel-efficient small cars since the american conscience has also changed . neither chrysler , nor general motors nor ford , was prepared for that .
cerberus managers may now put a lot of pressure on chrysler to make those changes quickly .
daimler to profit most yet it is daimler which is profiting the most from the divorce since the maker of luxury cars , trucks and buses will no longer have chrysler as an albatross hanging from its neck .
the reputation of daimler 's management , however , has taken another beating .
after all , the bad investment that cost many billions of euros is not restricted to the chrysler issue alone , but is part of a larger complex that has dominated the ranks of daimler 's management for years .

the result has been a financial disaster .
it 's a good thing that managers neither design nor build cars because mercedes has only survived these managerial adventures because the swabian engineers and workers of the company make such fantastic cars that can be sold high prices on the world market .

statisticians attributed the deceleration to less consumer spending following a sharp rise in value-added tax . consumers in europe 's largest economy are moving less money across german shop counters since the government upped the sales or value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent at the beginning of the year . official figures released on tuesday showed that germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- rose by 0.5 percent in the period from january to march compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 .
the increase was down from 1 percent growth in the preceding three months . " consumer spending put the brakes on economic growth , largely in connection with the vat hike at the beginning of the year , " the federal statistics office said in a statement .
the gdp measures the value of a country 's economic performance within the domestic territory . however , economics minister michael glos said the higher vat had been absorbed .
fresh investments at the beginning of the year had brought significant impulses to the country , he said .
according to glos , germany was on track for further growth . " the economic situation in germany is on a robust growth path , " glos said on tuesday . government optimistic growth will continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy is still on an upswing the economic slowdown in germany was not as sharp as feared , though .
forecasts by analysts had put gdp growth at 0.3 percent in the first quarter of 2007 . according to glos , the year 's good start supported the government 's outlook of 2.3 percent growth for the german economy in 2007 .
he said he expected private consumption to return to normal in the course of the year . the 3 percent vat hike marked the biggest-ever single rise in sales tax in a move criticized by many experts as being detrimental to growth . strong investments boosting growth germany 's current economic upturn remained intact , with growth driven both by strong investment and exports , according to official statistics . on a 12-month basis , gdp grew by 3.3 percent in the january-march period compared with the same period in 2006 . " growth in the first quarter was powered by a continuation in strong investment activity , " the statistics office said , adding that growth impulses also came from net foreign trade , while household spending slowed growth down noticeably . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reports biggest tax surplus in modern history germany says it expects its biggest tax surplus for half a century as the economy once derided as the " sick man of europe " reaps the benefits from buoyant growth and moderate reforms .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all bought and paid for - but at what price ?
following on from the launch of the five-point action plan " fit instead of fat , " which the government hopes will promote more active lifestyles and encourage germans to pay more attention to healthy nutrition , the powers-that-be are now grabbing at more desperate straws .
the latest weapon in the battle of the bulge could be a " fat tax . "
in response to the damning report from the international association for the study of obesity , which found that 58.9 percent of german women are overweight and 75.4 percent of men tip the scales , the german government is proposing to increase the tax on foods that are high in calories .
the thinking behind this is that the more expensive the food , the less likely people will want to eat it .
therefore , by abstaining from eating high-calorie , high-cost food , germans will get thinner .

secondly , the problem isn ’ t the amount of calories but what is done to burn them off .
this is why the " fit instead of fat " plan is a far better way of tackling the obesity problem .
germans are n't the fattest in europe because they eat more calories but because they move less .
this is particularly true of children .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 15.05.2007 eu must increase data sharing in terror fight , us says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sharing of passenger data remains controversial in the eu information gathered about passengers traveling to the united states is crucial in combating international terrorism , a us top security official said , pressing europe to increase its data exchange with the us . " we are all safer if we operate in a world in which intelligent use of information allows for more focussed efforts in determining who is a threat , " us secretary of homeland security michael chertoff said on monday after a meeting with european union lawmakers and officials .
the us and the 27-member eu are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
" we need to make sure that we have to provide the civilized world with appropriate tools to identify new security threats , " chertoff told a news briefing in brussels .
the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years .
data flow under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 34 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines face fines if they fail to pass on information such as credit card numbers washington has warned that airlines which failed to share passenger data would face fines of up to $ 6,000 -lrb- $ 4,450 -rrb- per passenger and a possible loss of landing rights .
chertoff said that the us wanted to make sure that a new agreement , which has to be clinched by the end of july , would ensure a " sufficient period of time " for the storage of data , arguing that terrorists were planning their plots over several years .
he also said that the us was working on new legislation under which foreign air passengers travelling to the us would be required to feed their data into an online database days ahead of the trip .
this new plan would enable the us " to inform people in advance if there is going to be a problem in allowing them to travel , " chertoff said .
kept for how long ?
eu justice commissioner franco frattini said that the two sides were still disagreeing on how long us authorities should be able to use data about passengers on transatlantic flights , when it should be destroyed and which government agencies should have access to the sensitive information .
the us also wants to pull data directly from airline computers , but european countries insist airlines must transmit the information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the date agreement will affect flights bound for the us eu data protection officials have demanded that personal data sent to us authorities should be made anonymous and the identity of their owner only be revealed if the data matched a profile in a terrorist database .
they have also said that a new deal on passenger data-sharing could be challenged by eu national courts .
the eu and the us are increasingly at odds over how to reconcile civil liberties with the us-led fight against terrorism .
brussels and washington have also locked horns over a secret agreement between the us treasury and the belgium-based money transfer company swift , which has supplied us authorities with personal data for use in counter-terrorism inquiries . dw staff -lrb- kj -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report says attack against americans in germany imminent us and german officials believe a terrorist attack against americans in germany is imminent , us media reported friday .

" preparing for the summit has been difficult , " steinmeier said after his talks with putin .

eu-russia tensions , coupled with increasingly frayed us-russian ties , are contributing to a dramatic deterioration of east-west relations ahead of presidential election seasons in both russia and the united states .
moscow is already in a fierce confrontation with washington over us plans to deploy an anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic .
russia is also at loggerheads with the european union and united states over western-backed plans to give independence to kosovo , a province in russian ally serbia .

minimum wage issues remain unresolved . during a cabinet meeting late monday night , leaders of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ended months of disagreement and agreed to create new child care provisions , part of a bid to catch up with other european countries on family politics and encourage mothers to work and reverse a declining birthrate . " there was a really large coalition formed for children and families , " family affairs minister ursula von der leyen told german public broadcaster ard on tuesday . coalition leaders punctuated the talks with the " breakthrough " on child care , according to spd head kurt beck .
christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , leader edmund stoiber emphasized that the panel also agreed on payments of 150 euros a month to families for raising children at home . " it is a sustainable compromise , " stoiber added .
states already accepted plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany lags behind european neighbors in day care last month , german states endorsed the plan that was adopted monday night , which calls for tripling the number of day care places for children under age three to 750,000 by 2013 .
the move was championed by von der leyen , a mother of seven who has stirred the ire of conservatives who see the provisions for child care as a break with traditional family values .
von der leyen 's proposal foresees the federal government covering one-third of the total 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.2 billion -rrb- in costs for expanding day care spaces for kids , but it is still unclear how federal , state and municipal governments plan to fund the expenses .

the cdu and spd , however , did agree on easing the burden on low-income earners .

" we are only asking what the politicians promised , not one euro more , " the founder of live aid said at a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" schröder signed in the name of the german people , if merkel betrays the pride of germany , then she kills people 12 miles south of europe in africa , " he said .
german music star herbert grönemeyer , who will sing at a major concert in rostock on june 7 along with bono and other musicians , said " politicians should just do their job and keep their promises . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geldof in younger years at a london live aid concert for africa the calls come just weeks before merkel hosts fellow leaders from the group of eight most industrialized nations at a summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm on june 6-8 .
germany currently holds the eu presidency .
bono said : " it is important that the g8 is taking place in germany because people expect germans to keep their promises . "
" if you break your promise , then everybody else will abandon ship , " he said .
report on progress geldof and the u2 frontman unveiled a report by data - a watchdog monitoring first-world help to africa which the two founded in 2002 - on the progress g8 nations have made in fulfilling their pledges made at gleneagles to collectively increase aid to africa by 25 billion dollars by 2010 .
the data report found that only britain and japan were doing their share to meet that target .
together the g8 nations stepped up development aid by $ 2.3 billion between 2004 and 2006 , but this is less than half of what they needed to give to be on track to meeting their 2010 deadline .
" it is less than half of what should have been done , " said jamie drummond of data .
" to get back on track in 2007 , they would have to increase aid by $ 6.4 billion , but so far there is at best a third of this in the pipeline . "
fears of violence german authorities fear that up to 100,000 anti-globalization protestors could target the g8 summit , and bono warned that failing to honor the group 's promises to africa could enrage activists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's grönemeyer has lent his voice to helping africa he said that although he was " opposed " to protestors resorting to violence , his own visits to poor countries had made him angry at the way the world neglected africa .
" i want to say that i relate to their rage , i feel it myself when i walk into a hospital and see people queuing up to die . "
merkel has promised to use the summit to build on efforts to help africa undertaken at gleneagles in 2005 .
on the weekend , merkel devoted her weekly podcast entirely to africa .
she said she wants the leaders of the group of eight industrialized nations to keep their earlier promises for increased development funding .
she said the richest nations in the world can really make a difference .
failure to help africa , she said , would come home to roost in the industrialized world .
" if we do n't care about the fate of our neighbors in this globalized world , we will one day see the problems arriving at our doorsteps , " she said .
" the migration of refugees can only be prevented if we help resolve the problems in their countries .
and we must do it now , " she stressed . dw staff with agency reports -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are the right countries sitting at the g8 table ?

" we are only asking what the politicians promised , not one euro more , " the founder of live aid said at a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" schröder signed in the name of the german people , if merkel betrays the pride of germany , then she kills people 12 miles south of europe in africa , " he said .
german music star herbert grönemeyer , who will sing at a major concert in rostock on june 7 along with bono and other musicians , said " politicians should just do their job and keep their promises . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geldof in younger years at a london live aid concert for africa the calls come just weeks before merkel hosts fellow leaders from the group of eight most industrialized nations at a summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm on june 6-8 .
germany currently holds the eu presidency .
bono said : " it is important that the g8 is taking place in germany because people expect germans to keep their promises . "
" if you break your promise , then everybody else will abandon ship , " he said .
report on progress geldof and the u2 frontman unveiled a report by data - a watchdog monitoring first-world help to africa which the two founded in 2002 - on the progress g8 nations have made in fulfilling their pledges made at gleneagles to collectively increase aid to africa by 25 billion dollars by 2010 .
the data report found that only britain and japan were doing their share to meet that target .
together the g8 nations stepped up development aid by $ 2.3 billion between 2004 and 2006 , but this is less than half of what they needed to give to be on track to meeting their 2010 deadline .
" it is less than half of what should have been done , " said jamie drummond of data .
" to get back on track in 2007 , they would have to increase aid by $ 6.4 billion , but so far there is at best a third of this in the pipeline . "
fears of violence german authorities fear that up to 100,000 anti-globalization protestors could target the g8 summit , and bono warned that failing to honor the group 's promises to africa could enrage activists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's grönemeyer has lent his voice to helping africa he said that although he was " opposed " to protestors resorting to violence , his own visits to poor countries had made him angry at the way the world neglected africa .
" i want to say that i relate to their rage , i feel it myself when i walk into a hospital and see people queuing up to die . "
merkel has promised to use the summit to build on efforts to help africa undertaken at gleneagles in 2005 .
on the weekend , merkel devoted her weekly podcast entirely to africa .
she said she wants the leaders of the group of eight industrialized nations to keep their earlier promises for increased development funding .
she said the richest nations in the world can really make a difference .
failure to help africa , she said , would come home to roost in the industrialized world .
" if we do n't care about the fate of our neighbors in this globalized world , we will one day see the problems arriving at our doorsteps , " she said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all bought and paid for - but at what price ?
following on from the launch of the five-point action plan " fit instead of fat , " which the government hopes will promote more active lifestyles and encourage germans to pay more attention to healthy nutrition , the powers-that-be are now grabbing at more desperate straws .
the latest weapon in the battle of the bulge could be a " fat tax . "
in response to the damning report from the international association for the study of obesity , which found that 58.9 percent of german women are overweight and 75.4 percent of men tip the scales , the german government is proposing to increase the tax on foods that are high in calories .
the thinking behind this is that the more expensive the food , the less likely people will want to eat it .
therefore , by abstaining from eating high-calorie , high-cost food , germans will get thinner .
while there is more than a little bit of twisted logic in this thinking , the german government seems to be ignoring a couple of key factors which should potentially scupper the idea before the prices of chips and soft drinks even get the chance to go up .

the same can almost certainly be said for certain favorite fatty foods .
secondly , the problem isn ’ t the amount of calories but what is done to burn them off .
this is why the " fit instead of fat " plan is a far better way of tackling the obesity problem .
germans are n't the fattest in europe because they eat more calories but because they move less .
this is particularly true of children .
so , rather than trying to price calorie-laden foods out of the common person 's budget , the german government should think again .
and if they really want to introduce bird-brained ideas to encourage people to lose weight , why not try a " sitting on your backside tax . "

after the sensible idea of promoting exercise comes the slightly mad idea of pricing fatty foods out of the average budget . being fingered as the fattest nation in europe has really got the germans ' oversized panties in a bunch .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all bought and paid for - but at what price ?
following on from the launch of the five-point action plan " fit instead of fat , " which the government hopes will promote more active lifestyles and encourage germans to pay more attention to healthy nutrition , the powers-that-be are now grabbing at more desperate straws .
the latest weapon in the battle of the bulge could be a " fat tax . "
in response to the damning report from the international association for the study of obesity , which found that 58.9 percent of german women are overweight and 75.4 percent of men tip the scales , the german government is proposing to increase the tax on foods that are high in calories .
the thinking behind this is that the more expensive the food , the less likely people will want to eat it .
therefore , by abstaining from eating high-calorie , high-cost food , germans will get thinner .
while there is more than a little bit of twisted logic in this thinking , the german government seems to be ignoring a couple of key factors which should potentially scupper the idea before the prices of chips and soft drinks even get the chance to go up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generation x-box needs to get out and exercise firstly , the idea that hiking the tax on a product will mean less people will buy it is historically flawed .

the same can almost certainly be said for certain favorite fatty foods .
secondly , the problem isn ’ t the amount of calories but what is done to burn them off .
this is why the " fit instead of fat " plan is a far better way of tackling the obesity problem .
germans are n't the fattest in europe because they eat more calories but because they move less .
this is particularly true of children .

" preparing for the summit has been difficult , " steinmeier said after his talks with putin .
" there have been a number of specific problems which we have not been able to solve over the past few weeks .
keeping silent about them does n't help , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , and putin tried to play down their differences " that is why i looked for an opportunity to meet with the russian president and the foreign minister .
that was a good decision .
we are now seeing the situation around the preparation for the ... summit in a much clearer way . "
speaking at the start of the meeting , putin said : " there are differences of opinion on how to solve specific problems , but both sides have a desire to solve them . "
putin met steinmeier straight after talks with us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who is also trying to soothe her country 's tense relations with russia .
a sense of doom with attempts to negotiate a key eu-russia partnership accord in tatters , there were few signs that germany 's intervention as head of the rotating presidency of the european union could salvage the summit .
russia 's foreign ministry accused poland of holding eu-russia relations " hostage " by blocking discussion of the partnership deal , which would govern key areas , including energy supplies , interfax news agency reported .
putin 's representative for eu relations , sergei yastrzhembsky , said there " is no real sense in discussing an accord on which we can not negotiate , " interfax reported .
poland has vetoed negotiations in retaliation for a russian ban on polish meat imports , while lithuania is now also threatening to veto the talks unless russia resumes oil deliveries to a refinery in the north of the baltic state .
warsaw made an additional demand on tuesday that the 27-member eu must pledge to protect the energy security of poland and other eu newcomers that rely on russian oil and gas .
deteriorating ties with west the disputes are fuelling escalating tensions between moscow and new eu member countries of formerly soviet-dominated central europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's ugly dispute over a memorial with estonia have soured moscow 's ties with the eu estonia is also locked in an ugly war of words with russia over the relocation of a soviet-era war memorial in the capital tallinn .
the baltic republic says that a halving of rail freight from russia this month amounts to unofficial economic sanctions .
eu-russia tensions , coupled with increasingly frayed us-russian ties , are contributing to a dramatic deterioration of east-west relations ahead of presidential election seasons in both russia and the united states .
moscow is already in a fierce confrontation with washington over us plans to deploy an anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic .
russia is also at loggerheads with the european union and united states over western-backed plans to give independence to kosovo , a province in russian ally serbia .
a " senseless " summit ahead of his moscow trip , steinmeier sounded pessimistic about the chances of any breakthroughs .
" i can not assure you 100 percent whether progress can be made on individual issues , but even if you do not know you must make an attempt , " he told reporters in brussels .
the german foreign policy chief even addressed rumors that the summit could be cancelled , saying " we have to bring an end to these discussions about whether or not the summit will take place . "
russia 's kommersant daily said steinmeier would be unable " to save the summit from collapse , " while the vedomosti daily called the samara meeting " senseless . "
" the eu-russian summit will either be a relative failure or a scandalous failure .
there will definitely be no negotiations on a partnership agreement .
the participants may not even be able to agree on a joint declaration , " the daily said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " russia wants pragmatic , business-like cooperation " russian and eu delegates meet this week as relations remain taught on issues like independence for kosovo , human rights and the us missile shield .

" we are all safer if we operate in a world in which intelligent use of information allows for more focussed efforts in determining who is a threat , " us secretary of homeland security michael chertoff said on monday after a meeting with european union lawmakers and officials .
the us and the 27-member eu are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
" we need to make sure that we have to provide the civilized world with appropriate tools to identify new security threats , " chertoff told a news briefing in brussels .
the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years .
data flow under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 34 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines face fines if they fail to pass on information such as credit card numbers washington has warned that airlines which failed to share passenger data would face fines of up to $ 6,000 -lrb- $ 4,450 -rrb- per passenger and a possible loss of landing rights .
chertoff said that the us wanted to make sure that a new agreement , which has to be clinched by the end of july , would ensure a " sufficient period of time " for the storage of data , arguing that terrorists were planning their plots over several years .
he also said that the us was working on new legislation under which foreign air passengers travelling to the us would be required to feed their data into an online database days ahead of the trip .
this new plan would enable the us " to inform people in advance if there is going to be a problem in allowing them to travel , " chertoff said .
kept for how long ?
eu justice commissioner franco frattini said that the two sides were still disagreeing on how long us authorities should be able to use data about passengers on transatlantic flights , when it should be destroyed and which government agencies should have access to the sensitive information .
the us also wants to pull data directly from airline computers , but european countries insist airlines must transmit the information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the date agreement will affect flights bound for the us eu data protection officials have demanded that personal data sent to us authorities should be made anonymous and the identity of their owner only be revealed if the data matched a profile in a terrorist database .
they have also said that a new deal on passenger data-sharing could be challenged by eu national courts .
the eu and the us are increasingly at odds over how to reconcile civil liberties with the us-led fight against terrorism .
brussels and washington have also locked horns over a secret agreement between the us treasury and the belgium-based money transfer company swift , which has supplied us authorities with personal data for use in counter-terrorism inquiries . dw staff -lrb- kj -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report says attack against americans in germany imminent us and german officials believe a terrorist attack against americans in germany is imminent , us media reported friday .

statisticians attributed the deceleration to less consumer spending following a sharp rise in value-added tax . consumers in europe 's largest economy are moving less money across german shop counters since the government upped the sales or value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent at the beginning of the year . official figures released on tuesday showed that germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- rose by 0.5 percent in the period from january to march compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 .
the increase was down from 1 percent growth in the preceding three months . " consumer spending put the brakes on economic growth , largely in connection with the vat hike at the beginning of the year , " the federal statistics office said in a statement .
the gdp measures the value of a country 's economic performance within the domestic territory . however , economics minister michael glos said the higher vat had been absorbed .
fresh investments at the beginning of the year had brought significant impulses to the country , he said .
according to glos , germany was on track for further growth . " the economic situation in germany is on a robust growth path , " glos said on tuesday . government optimistic growth will continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy is still on an upswing the economic slowdown in germany was not as sharp as feared , though .
forecasts by analysts had put gdp growth at 0.3 percent in the first quarter of 2007 . according to glos , the year 's good start supported the government 's outlook of 2.3 percent growth for the german economy in 2007 .
he said he expected private consumption to return to normal in the course of the year . the 3 percent vat hike marked the biggest-ever single rise in sales tax in a move criticized by many experts as being detrimental to growth . strong investments boosting growth germany 's current economic upturn remained intact , with growth driven both by strong investment and exports , according to official statistics . on a 12-month basis , gdp grew by 3.3 percent in the january-march period compared with the same period in 2006 . " growth in the first quarter was powered by a continuation in strong investment activity , " the statistics office said , adding that growth impulses also came from net foreign trade , while household spending slowed growth down noticeably . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reports biggest tax surplus in modern history germany says it expects its biggest tax surplus for half a century as the economy once derided as the " sick man of europe " reaps the benefits from buoyant growth and moderate reforms .

although britain emerged as an allied victor from the ashes of world war ii , some say she won the war , but lost the peace .
her vast imperial empire had disintegrated , and the " special relationship " with the united states , a partnership forged by a common heritage and the war , went through rough patches after the suez crisis in 1956 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartime leader winston churchill -lrb- right -rrb- chose the us over europe the anglo-french conspiracy to topple egypt ’ s gamal abdel nasser met with us hostility , shattering both british pretensions in the middle east and illusions about the loyalty of its closest ally .
america emerged as a superpower , while britain , like france , was reduced to a mid-sized nuclear power with a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
as an increasingly junior partner in the anglo-american relationship , she had to look for alliances elsewhere , and this meant reluctantly throwing in her lot with neighbors across the english channel .
that the uk was a latecomer in joining the european club in 1973 had to do with what french statesman charles de gaulle perceived as the conflict of her ties to the commonwealth and america .
de gaulle had used france ’ s veto to keep britain out of the european economic community -lrb- eec -rrb- , so when the uk finally did join 15 years after the founding of the treaty of rome , she joined a club where the rules had already been set by others .
hence britain 's relationship to europe has often been an adversarial one .
iron lady margaret thatcher had made britain a pariah state by demanding a rebate for the amount the uk was paying into eec coffers in farm subsidies and opting out of the community ’ s social charter .
in a decade of the current labour government , britain is the only major european union country which has not signed on to the border-free schengen accords , and not adopted the common currency , the euro . iraq war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair 's support of iraq war reinforced european view that britain favors the us but above all , it was outgoing prime minister tony blair ’ s staunch support for the american-led iraq war against overwhelming public sentiment that greatly diminished his premiership and reinforced the view among the french and germans that britain still favors the us over europe although gordon brown , blair 's almost certain successor on june 27 , was closely identified with the cabinet ’ s iraq policy , experts say that he is more likely to distance himself from the bush administration , yet seek closer trans-atlantic ties in conjunction with britain 's european partners .
" brown 's under public pressure not to have an exclusive relationship with the white house that was so damaging for britain under blair , " said hugo brady of the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank .
brady also sees a greater convergence of the eu 's big three - the uk , france and germany - in spite of brown 's reputation as a euro skeptic who as chancellor of the exchequer , britain 's finance minister , kept his country out of the euro zone . the fact that newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy has expressed admiration rather than contempt for " anglo-saxon " free markets also helps , and even germany ’ s angela merkel is a natural ally when it comes to her atlanticist leanings and advocacy of structural reforms that could bring further boost continental europe 's economy .
above all , all three leaders , who belong to europe 's post-war generation , are more pragmatic than their more ideologically motivated predecessors . eu relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain was off the hook after french and dutch voters rejected the eu constitution " brown is not passionate about europe , but because of it , he will be able to get further in brussels than someone so outwardly messianic about it like blair , " said brady , who explained that blair went too far with the british public in pushing for an eu constitution , which merkel wants to salvage before the end of germany 's six-month rotating eu presidency .
after french and dutch voters rejected it in 2005 , the british referendum was called off , saving blair from the embarrassing risk of a likely " no " at the ballot box .
" even the founding member states are more cautious about guarding what they perceive as their national interests and uncomfortable about the idea a superstate imposed on them from brussels , so the british are less on the outs than they used to be , " said julie smith , deputy director of the centre of international studies at cambridge university .
as blair 's finance minister , brown has said that he did not support the euro , because it was not in britain 's economic interest , although others say that the decision was purely political . " people are attached to the sterling .
it 's a symbol of british greatness , " said brady .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain and its eu partners are divided about turkey the one controversial issue that keeps britain aligned with the united states in opposition to its european partners is the country 's support for turkey 's membership in the eu , which has been opposed by sarkozy and merkel , although she has softened her stance since becoming chancellor .
britain , like the us , favors keeping the door open to turkey for geopolitical reasons , whereas france and germany see an influx of cheap labor and the problems of integrating a poor , predominantly muslim country .
the turkish issue also reflects the difference in the british vision of a broader confederation of nation states with the conflicting french desire for a deeper political integration and a tighter club .
relations with the united states are expected to be less divisive among the eu-3 , making it even possible for the uk to have good relations with both europe and the us at the same time , according to smith . " britain has never achieved the right balance .
tony blair tried , but gravitated too far towards america .
gordon brown may have a better chance of getting it right , " she said .

britain , like the us , favors keeping the door open to turkey for geopolitical reasons , whereas france and germany see an influx of cheap labor and the problems of integrating a poor , predominantly muslim country .
the turkish issue also reflects the difference in the british vision of a broader confederation of nation states with the conflicting french desire for a deeper political integration and a tighter club .
relations with the united states are expected to be less divisive among the eu-3 , making it even possible for the uk to have good relations with both europe and the us at the same time , according to smith . " britain has never achieved the right balance .
tony blair tried , but gravitated too far towards america .
gordon brown may have a better chance of getting it right , " she said .
furthermore , according to brady , a humbled george w. bush in the twilight years of the american presidency is more likely to treat europe as an equal partner . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel calls for eu constitution push at mini summit chancellor angela merkel on saturday said germany needs the support of eu members , in particular the next two eu presidencies portugal and slovenia , if europe 's stalled constitution is to move forward .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 15.05.2007 eu must increase data sharing in terror fight , us says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sharing of passenger data remains controversial in the eu information gathered about passengers traveling to the united states is crucial in combating international terrorism , a us top security official said , pressing europe to increase its data exchange with the us . " we are all safer if we operate in a world in which intelligent use of information allows for more focussed efforts in determining who is a threat , " us secretary of homeland security michael chertoff said on monday after a meeting with european union lawmakers and officials .
the us and the 27-member eu are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
" we need to make sure that we have to provide the civilized world with appropriate tools to identify new security threats , " chertoff told a news briefing in brussels .
the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years .
data flow under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 34 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines face fines if they fail to pass on information such as credit card numbers washington has warned that airlines which failed to share passenger data would face fines of up to $ 6,000 -lrb- $ 4,450 -rrb- per passenger and a possible loss of landing rights .
chertoff said that the us wanted to make sure that a new agreement , which has to be clinched by the end of july , would ensure a " sufficient period of time " for the storage of data , arguing that terrorists were planning their plots over several years .
he also said that the us was working on new legislation under which foreign air passengers travelling to the us would be required to feed their data into an online database days ahead of the trip .
this new plan would enable the us " to inform people in advance if there is going to be a problem in allowing them to travel , " chertoff said .
kept for how long ?
eu justice commissioner franco frattini said that the two sides were still disagreeing on how long us authorities should be able to use data about passengers on transatlantic flights , when it should be destroyed and which government agencies should have access to the sensitive information .
the us also wants to pull data directly from airline computers , but european countries insist airlines must transmit the information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the date agreement will affect flights bound for the us eu data protection officials have demanded that personal data sent to us authorities should be made anonymous and the identity of their owner only be revealed if the data matched a profile in a terrorist database .
they have also said that a new deal on passenger data-sharing could be challenged by eu national courts .
the eu and the us are increasingly at odds over how to reconcile civil liberties with the us-led fight against terrorism .
brussels and washington have also locked horns over a secret agreement between the us treasury and the belgium-based money transfer company swift , which has supplied us authorities with personal data for use in counter-terrorism inquiries . dw staff -lrb- kj -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report says attack against americans in germany imminent us and german officials believe a terrorist attack against americans in germany is imminent , us media reported friday .

" we are all safer if we operate in a world in which intelligent use of information allows for more focussed efforts in determining who is a threat , " us secretary of homeland security michael chertoff said on monday after a meeting with european union lawmakers and officials .
the us and the 27-member eu are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
" we need to make sure that we have to provide the civilized world with appropriate tools to identify new security threats , " chertoff told a news briefing in brussels .
the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years .
data flow under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 34 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines face fines if they fail to pass on information such as credit card numbers washington has warned that airlines which failed to share passenger data would face fines of up to $ 6,000 -lrb- $ 4,450 -rrb- per passenger and a possible loss of landing rights .
chertoff said that the us wanted to make sure that a new agreement , which has to be clinched by the end of july , would ensure a " sufficient period of time " for the storage of data , arguing that terrorists were planning their plots over several years .
he also said that the us was working on new legislation under which foreign air passengers travelling to the us would be required to feed their data into an online database days ahead of the trip .
this new plan would enable the us " to inform people in advance if there is going to be a problem in allowing them to travel , " chertoff said .
kept for how long ?
eu justice commissioner franco frattini said that the two sides were still disagreeing on how long us authorities should be able to use data about passengers on transatlantic flights , when it should be destroyed and which government agencies should have access to the sensitive information .
the us also wants to pull data directly from airline computers , but european countries insist airlines must transmit the information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the date agreement will affect flights bound for the us eu data protection officials have demanded that personal data sent to us authorities should be made anonymous and the identity of their owner only be revealed if the data matched a profile in a terrorist database .
they have also said that a new deal on passenger data-sharing could be challenged by eu national courts .
the eu and the us are increasingly at odds over how to reconcile civil liberties with the us-led fight against terrorism .
brussels and washington have also locked horns over a secret agreement between the us treasury and the belgium-based money transfer company swift , which has supplied us authorities with personal data for use in counter-terrorism inquiries . dw staff -lrb- kj -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report says attack against americans in germany imminent us and german officials believe a terrorist attack against americans in germany is imminent , us media reported friday .

" preparing for the summit has been difficult , " steinmeier said after his talks with putin .
" there have been a number of specific problems which we have not been able to solve over the past few weeks .
keeping silent about them does n't help , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , and putin tried to play down their differences " that is why i looked for an opportunity to meet with the russian president and the foreign minister .
that was a good decision .
we are now seeing the situation around the preparation for the ... summit in a much clearer way . "
speaking at the start of the meeting , putin said : " there are differences of opinion on how to solve specific problems , but both sides have a desire to solve them . "
putin met steinmeier straight after talks with us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who is also trying to soothe her country 's tense relations with russia .
a sense of doom with attempts to negotiate a key eu-russia partnership accord in tatters , there were few signs that germany 's intervention as head of the rotating presidency of the european union could salvage the summit .
russia 's foreign ministry accused poland of holding eu-russia relations " hostage " by blocking discussion of the partnership deal , which would govern key areas , including energy supplies , interfax news agency reported .
putin 's representative for eu relations , sergei yastrzhembsky , said there " is no real sense in discussing an accord on which we can not negotiate , " interfax reported .
poland has vetoed negotiations in retaliation for a russian ban on polish meat imports , while lithuania is now also threatening to veto the talks unless russia resumes oil deliveries to a refinery in the north of the baltic state .
warsaw made an additional demand on tuesday that the 27-member eu must pledge to protect the energy security of poland and other eu newcomers that rely on russian oil and gas .
deteriorating ties with west the disputes are fuelling escalating tensions between moscow and new eu member countries of formerly soviet-dominated central europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's ugly dispute over a memorial with estonia have soured moscow 's ties with the eu estonia is also locked in an ugly war of words with russia over the relocation of a soviet-era war memorial in the capital tallinn .
the baltic republic says that a halving of rail freight from russia this month amounts to unofficial economic sanctions .
eu-russia tensions , coupled with increasingly frayed us-russian ties , are contributing to a dramatic deterioration of east-west relations ahead of presidential election seasons in both russia and the united states .
moscow is already in a fierce confrontation with washington over us plans to deploy an anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic .
russia is also at loggerheads with the european union and united states over western-backed plans to give independence to kosovo , a province in russian ally serbia .
a " senseless " summit ahead of his moscow trip , steinmeier sounded pessimistic about the chances of any breakthroughs .
" i can not assure you 100 percent whether progress can be made on individual issues , but even if you do not know you must make an attempt , " he told reporters in brussels .
the german foreign policy chief even addressed rumors that the summit could be cancelled , saying " we have to bring an end to these discussions about whether or not the summit will take place . "
russia 's kommersant daily said steinmeier would be unable " to save the summit from collapse , " while the vedomosti daily called the samara meeting " senseless . "
" the eu-russian summit will either be a relative failure or a scandalous failure .
there will definitely be no negotiations on a partnership agreement .
the participants may not even be able to agree on a joint declaration , " the daily said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " russia wants pragmatic , business-like cooperation " russian and eu delegates meet this week as relations remain taught on issues like independence for kosovo , human rights and the us missile shield .

-lrb- 14.05.2007 -rrb- russia set for stormy eu , us talks amid heightened tensions eu foreign ministers will meet to prepare for an eu-russia summit they hope will ease tensions heightened in recent months by issues as diverse as independence for kosovo , us missile defense plans and human rights .

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nine-year , trans-atlantic marriage of automakers daimler and chrysler has come to an end and it 's probably best that way for all involved , said deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky . what daimlerchrysler 's former chief jürgen schrempp once called a " marriage from heaven " has now , after nine years , ended in a mundane divorce .
and it 's probably the best thing that could have happened - for both companies .
even though they will remain connected for years to come in joint technical projects and daimler 's minor stake in chrysler , they still have better chances going it alone in the automotive business than being involved in a relationship designed along the lines of jürgen schrempp 's vision of a welt ag or world inc .
that dream quickly revealed itself to be a mere delusion of grandeur .
schadenfreude inappropriate the consequences of that are immense , and feeling a sense of schadenfreude would be inappropriate .
after all , corporate strategies that have gotten out of control have once again caused millions of euros and many jobs to be lost .
daimler managers , with current chief executive dieter zetsche leading them at the time , cut 26,000 jobs at chrysler .
now on its own , chrysler will again have to lay off another 13,000 employees .
and , the way these things work when jobs are cut to increase profitability , what accompanied the announcement of the daimlerchrysler split was a true firework display on the stock market - not unlike the one that followed the news of schrempp 's disreputable departure .
eyes bigger than mouth now it 's official : daimler bit off more than it could chew when it purchased chrysler .
first , there were not enough managers to restructure the already crippled company in the united states ; then , it seemed that money was becoming scarce .
that is when a split becomes mandatory .
the decisive majority-shareholder at chrysler will be the private equity group cerberus capital management .
it will make a capital contribution of 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- - not as a purchase price , it should be noted , but in return for an 80.1-percent equity interest in chrysler .
in order to shed itself of chrysler , daimler must also throw in 1.2 billion euros .
chrysler must now rely on its own strengths .
in addition to having to rid itself of now hard-to-sell pick-up trucks and suv 's , it must also market fuel-efficient small cars since the american conscience has also changed . neither chrysler , nor general motors nor ford , was prepared for that .
cerberus managers may now put a lot of pressure on chrysler to make those changes quickly .
daimler to profit most yet it is daimler which is profiting the most from the divorce since the maker of luxury cars , trucks and buses will no longer have chrysler as an albatross hanging from its neck .
the reputation of daimler 's management , however , has taken another beating .
after all , the bad investment that cost many billions of euros is not restricted to the chrysler issue alone , but is part of a larger complex that has dominated the ranks of daimler 's management for years .
the goal was a european-american-asian automotive company in which the sun never sets .
the result has been a financial disaster .
it 's a good thing that managers neither design nor build cars because mercedes has only survived these managerial adventures because the swabian engineers and workers of the company make such fantastic cars that can be sold high prices on the world market .

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nine-year , trans-atlantic marriage of automakers daimler and chrysler has come to an end and it 's probably best that way for all involved , said deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky . what daimlerchrysler 's former chief jürgen schrempp once called a " marriage from heaven " has now , after nine years , ended in a mundane divorce .
and it 's probably the best thing that could have happened - for both companies .
even though they will remain connected for years to come in joint technical projects and daimler 's minor stake in chrysler , they still have better chances going it alone in the automotive business than being involved in a relationship designed along the lines of jürgen schrempp 's vision of a welt ag or world inc .
that dream quickly revealed itself to be a mere delusion of grandeur .
schadenfreude inappropriate the consequences of that are immense , and feeling a sense of schadenfreude would be inappropriate .
after all , corporate strategies that have gotten out of control have once again caused millions of euros and many jobs to be lost .
daimler managers , with current chief executive dieter zetsche leading them at the time , cut 26,000 jobs at chrysler .
now on its own , chrysler will again have to lay off another 13,000 employees .
and , the way these things work when jobs are cut to increase profitability , what accompanied the announcement of the daimlerchrysler split was a true firework display on the stock market - not unlike the one that followed the news of schrempp 's disreputable departure .
eyes bigger than mouth now it 's official : daimler bit off more than it could chew when it purchased chrysler .
first , there were not enough managers to restructure the already crippled company in the united states ; then , it seemed that money was becoming scarce .
that is when a split becomes mandatory .
the decisive majority-shareholder at chrysler will be the private equity group cerberus capital management .
it will make a capital contribution of 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- - not as a purchase price , it should be noted , but in return for an 80.1-percent equity interest in chrysler .
in order to shed itself of chrysler , daimler must also throw in 1.2 billion euros .
chrysler must now rely on its own strengths .
in addition to having to rid itself of now hard-to-sell pick-up trucks and suv 's , it must also market fuel-efficient small cars since the american conscience has also changed . neither chrysler , nor general motors nor ford , was prepared for that .
cerberus managers may now put a lot of pressure on chrysler to make those changes quickly .
daimler to profit most yet it is daimler which is profiting the most from the divorce since the maker of luxury cars , trucks and buses will no longer have chrysler as an albatross hanging from its neck .
the reputation of daimler 's management , however , has taken another beating .
after all , the bad investment that cost many billions of euros is not restricted to the chrysler issue alone , but is part of a larger complex that has dominated the ranks of daimler 's management for years .
the goal was a european-american-asian automotive company in which the sun never sets .
the result has been a financial disaster .
it 's a good thing that managers neither design nor build cars because mercedes has only survived these managerial adventures because the swabian engineers and workers of the company make such fantastic cars that can be sold high prices on the world market .

" six lebanese men accused of plotting to bomb the trains in western germany in july 2006 are currently standing trial in beirut . one of the defendants has confessed to lebanese authorities that he planted the homemade bombs to avenge the publication in denmark of cartoons of the prophet mohammed .
investigators believe the devices failed to explode because of faulty detonators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble has come under fire for allowing intelligence agenicies to snoop on pcs via the internet in addition , a little-known islamic extremist group issued a warning in march that germany could come under attack unless it withdrew its troops from afghanistan . last weekend , us media reported of an imminent attack on americans in germany by an al qaeda cell .

" we are only asking what the politicians promised , not one euro more , " the founder of live aid said at a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" schröder signed in the name of the german people , if merkel betrays the pride of germany , then she kills people 12 miles south of europe in africa , " he said .
german music star herbert grönemeyer , who will sing at a major concert in rostock on june 7 along with bono and other musicians , said " politicians should just do their job and keep their promises . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geldof in younger years at a london live aid concert for africa the calls come just weeks before merkel hosts fellow leaders from the group of eight most industrialized nations at a summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm on june 6-8 .
germany currently holds the eu presidency .
bono said : " it is important that the g8 is taking place in germany because people expect germans to keep their promises . "
" if you break your promise , then everybody else will abandon ship , " he said .
report on progress geldof and the u2 frontman unveiled a report by data - a watchdog monitoring first-world help to africa which the two founded in 2002 - on the progress g8 nations have made in fulfilling their pledges made at gleneagles to collectively increase aid to africa by 25 billion dollars by 2010 .
the data report found that only britain and japan were doing their share to meet that target .
together the g8 nations stepped up development aid by $ 2.3 billion between 2004 and 2006 , but this is less than half of what they needed to give to be on track to meeting their 2010 deadline .
" it is less than half of what should have been done , " said jamie drummond of data .
" to get back on track in 2007 , they would have to increase aid by $ 6.4 billion , but so far there is at best a third of this in the pipeline . "
fears of violence german authorities fear that up to 100,000 anti-globalization protestors could target the g8 summit , and bono warned that failing to honor the group 's promises to africa could enrage activists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's grönemeyer has lent his voice to helping africa he said that although he was " opposed " to protestors resorting to violence , his own visits to poor countries had made him angry at the way the world neglected africa .
" i want to say that i relate to their rage , i feel it myself when i walk into a hospital and see people queuing up to die . "
merkel has promised to use the summit to build on efforts to help africa undertaken at gleneagles in 2005 .
on the weekend , merkel devoted her weekly podcast entirely to africa .
she said she wants the leaders of the group of eight industrialized nations to keep their earlier promises for increased development funding .
she said the richest nations in the world can really make a difference .
failure to help africa , she said , would come home to roost in the industrialized world .
" if we do n't care about the fate of our neighbors in this globalized world , we will one day see the problems arriving at our doorsteps , " she said .

schäuble voiced concern that neo-nazis have a growing influence on the npd leadership and spoke of the " alarming development " that the extreme right was gaining more acceptance in society . the interior minister , however , rejected the idea of attempting to ban the party , saying this would make it more difficult to observe ndp activities . concern over g-8 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been a series of anti-g8 protests in the past weeks the report found that left-wing violence dropped by 3.8 percent , but schäuble used the opportunity to warn that that the government would n't allow " potential violence to hinder the orderly course of the g8 summit , " which germany is hosting at the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm on june 6-8 . german police last week staged a series of raids on the homes and offices of militant left-wingers suspected of planning to disrupt the meeting between the leaders of germany , france , italy , britain , the united states , canada , japan and russia . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reports say raids on g8 protestors uncovered explosives amid growing criticism of a crackdown on leftwing protestors ahead of the g8 summit , news reports say recent raids by german police have yielded a range of incendiary materials .

" we are only asking what the politicians promised , not one euro more , " the founder of live aid said at a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" schröder signed in the name of the german people , if merkel betrays the pride of germany , then she kills people 12 miles south of europe in africa , " he said .
german music star herbert grönemeyer , who will sing at a major concert in rostock on june 7 along with bono and other musicians , said " politicians should just do their job and keep their promises . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geldof in younger years at a london live aid concert for africa the calls come just weeks before merkel hosts fellow leaders from the group of eight most industrialized nations at a summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm on june 6-8 .
germany currently holds the eu presidency .
bono said : " it is important that the g8 is taking place in germany because people expect germans to keep their promises . "
" if you break your promise , then everybody else will abandon ship , " he said .
report on progress geldof and the u2 frontman unveiled a report by data - a watchdog monitoring first-world help to africa which the two founded in 2002 - on the progress g8 nations have made in fulfilling their pledges made at gleneagles to collectively increase aid to africa by 25 billion dollars by 2010 .
the data report found that only britain and japan were doing their share to meet that target .
together the g8 nations stepped up development aid by $ 2.3 billion between 2004 and 2006 , but this is less than half of what they needed to give to be on track to meeting their 2010 deadline .
" it is less than half of what should have been done , " said jamie drummond of data .
" to get back on track in 2007 , they would have to increase aid by $ 6.4 billion , but so far there is at best a third of this in the pipeline . "
fears of violence german authorities fear that up to 100,000 anti-globalization protestors could target the g8 summit , and bono warned that failing to honor the group 's promises to africa could enrage activists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's grönemeyer has lent his voice to helping africa he said that although he was " opposed " to protestors resorting to violence , his own visits to poor countries had made him angry at the way the world neglected africa .
" i want to say that i relate to their rage , i feel it myself when i walk into a hospital and see people queuing up to die . "
merkel has promised to use the summit to build on efforts to help africa undertaken at gleneagles in 2005 .
on the weekend , merkel devoted her weekly podcast entirely to africa .
she said she wants the leaders of the group of eight industrialized nations to keep their earlier promises for increased development funding .
she said the richest nations in the world can really make a difference .
failure to help africa , she said , would come home to roost in the industrialized world .
" if we do n't care about the fate of our neighbors in this globalized world , we will one day see the problems arriving at our doorsteps , " she said .
" the migration of refugees can only be prevented if we help resolve the problems in their countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : blair bows out blair endorses gordon brown as candidate for british pm european press review : " it 's blair 's fault britain is relieved " gordon brown , the next man in number 10 praise floods in for blair from europe , us european union -pipe- 15.05.2007 brown 's britain : striking an eu-us balance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together with european partners , a more equal partnership with us under brown passionately pro-european and atlanticist , tony blair sought good relations with both the eu and the us , although his pragmatic successor gordon brown is more likely to achieve both . from winston churchill to tony blair , every post-war prime minister has been consumed by a foreign policy that has boiled down to the choice between europe and the united states while trying to establish an independent british role in the world .
although britain emerged as an allied victor from the ashes of world war ii , some say she won the war , but lost the peace .
her vast imperial empire had disintegrated , and the " special relationship " with the united states , a partnership forged by a common heritage and the war , went through rough patches after the suez crisis in 1956 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartime leader winston churchill -lrb- right -rrb- chose the us over europe the anglo-french conspiracy to topple egypt ’ s gamal abdel nasser met with us hostility , shattering both british pretensions in the middle east and illusions about the loyalty of its closest ally .
america emerged as a superpower , while britain , like france , was reduced to a mid-sized nuclear power with a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
as an increasingly junior partner in the anglo-american relationship , she had to look for alliances elsewhere , and this meant reluctantly throwing in her lot with neighbors across the english channel .
that the uk was a latecomer in joining the european club in 1973 had to do with what french statesman charles de gaulle perceived as the conflict of her ties to the commonwealth and america .
de gaulle had used france ’ s veto to keep britain out of the european economic community -lrb- eec -rrb- , so when the uk finally did join 15 years after the founding of the treaty of rome , she joined a club where the rules had already been set by others .
hence britain 's relationship to europe has often been an adversarial one .
iron lady margaret thatcher had made britain a pariah state by demanding a rebate for the amount the uk was paying into eec coffers in farm subsidies and opting out of the community ’ s social charter .
in a decade of the current labour government , britain is the only major european union country which has not signed on to the border-free schengen accords , and not adopted the common currency , the euro . iraq war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair 's support of iraq war reinforced european view that britain favors the us but above all , it was outgoing prime minister tony blair ’ s staunch support for the american-led iraq war against overwhelming public sentiment that greatly diminished his premiership and reinforced the view among the french and germans that britain still favors the us over europe although gordon brown , blair 's almost certain successor on june 27 , was closely identified with the cabinet ’ s iraq policy , experts say that he is more likely to distance himself from the bush administration , yet seek closer trans-atlantic ties in conjunction with britain 's european partners .
" brown 's under public pressure not to have an exclusive relationship with the white house that was so damaging for britain under blair , " said hugo brady of the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank .
brady also sees a greater convergence of the eu 's big three - the uk , france and germany - in spite of brown 's reputation as a euro skeptic who as chancellor of the exchequer , britain 's finance minister , kept his country out of the euro zone . the fact that newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy has expressed admiration rather than contempt for " anglo-saxon " free markets also helps , and even germany ’ s angela merkel is a natural ally when it comes to her atlanticist leanings and advocacy of structural reforms that could bring further boost continental europe 's economy .
above all , all three leaders , who belong to europe 's post-war generation , are more pragmatic than their more ideologically motivated predecessors . eu relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain was off the hook after french and dutch voters rejected the eu constitution " brown is not passionate about europe , but because of it , he will be able to get further in brussels than someone so outwardly messianic about it like blair , " said brady , who explained that blair went too far with the british public in pushing for an eu constitution , which merkel wants to salvage before the end of germany 's six-month rotating eu presidency .
after french and dutch voters rejected it in 2005 , the british referendum was called off , saving blair from the embarrassing risk of a likely " no " at the ballot box .
" even the founding member states are more cautious about guarding what they perceive as their national interests and uncomfortable about the idea a superstate imposed on them from brussels , so the british are less on the outs than they used to be , " said julie smith , deputy director of the centre of international studies at cambridge university .
as blair 's finance minister , brown has said that he did not support the euro , because it was not in britain 's economic interest , although others say that the decision was purely political . " people are attached to the sterling .
it 's a symbol of british greatness , " said brady .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain and its eu partners are divided about turkey the one controversial issue that keeps britain aligned with the united states in opposition to its european partners is the country 's support for turkey 's membership in the eu , which has been opposed by sarkozy and merkel , although she has softened her stance since becoming chancellor .
britain , like the us , favors keeping the door open to turkey for geopolitical reasons , whereas france and germany see an influx of cheap labor and the problems of integrating a poor , predominantly muslim country .
the turkish issue also reflects the difference in the british vision of a broader confederation of nation states with the conflicting french desire for a deeper political integration and a tighter club .
relations with the united states are expected to be less divisive among the eu-3 , making it even possible for the uk to have good relations with both europe and the us at the same time , according to smith . " britain has never achieved the right balance .

although britain emerged as an allied victor from the ashes of world war ii , some say she won the war , but lost the peace .
her vast imperial empire had disintegrated , and the " special relationship " with the united states , a partnership forged by a common heritage and the war , went through rough patches after the suez crisis in 1956 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartime leader winston churchill -lrb- right -rrb- chose the us over europe the anglo-french conspiracy to topple egypt ’ s gamal abdel nasser met with us hostility , shattering both british pretensions in the middle east and illusions about the loyalty of its closest ally .
america emerged as a superpower , while britain , like france , was reduced to a mid-sized nuclear power with a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
as an increasingly junior partner in the anglo-american relationship , she had to look for alliances elsewhere , and this meant reluctantly throwing in her lot with neighbors across the english channel .
that the uk was a latecomer in joining the european club in 1973 had to do with what french statesman charles de gaulle perceived as the conflict of her ties to the commonwealth and america .
de gaulle had used france ’ s veto to keep britain out of the european economic community -lrb- eec -rrb- , so when the uk finally did join 15 years after the founding of the treaty of rome , she joined a club where the rules had already been set by others .
hence britain 's relationship to europe has often been an adversarial one .
iron lady margaret thatcher had made britain a pariah state by demanding a rebate for the amount the uk was paying into eec coffers in farm subsidies and opting out of the community ’ s social charter .
in a decade of the current labour government , britain is the only major european union country which has not signed on to the border-free schengen accords , and not adopted the common currency , the euro . iraq war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair 's support of iraq war reinforced european view that britain favors the us but above all , it was outgoing prime minister tony blair ’ s staunch support for the american-led iraq war against overwhelming public sentiment that greatly diminished his premiership and reinforced the view among the french and germans that britain still favors the us over europe although gordon brown , blair 's almost certain successor on june 27 , was closely identified with the cabinet ’ s iraq policy , experts say that he is more likely to distance himself from the bush administration , yet seek closer trans-atlantic ties in conjunction with britain 's european partners .
" brown 's under public pressure not to have an exclusive relationship with the white house that was so damaging for britain under blair , " said hugo brady of the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank .
brady also sees a greater convergence of the eu 's big three - the uk , france and germany - in spite of brown 's reputation as a euro skeptic who as chancellor of the exchequer , britain 's finance minister , kept his country out of the euro zone . the fact that newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy has expressed admiration rather than contempt for " anglo-saxon " free markets also helps , and even germany ’ s angela merkel is a natural ally when it comes to her atlanticist leanings and advocacy of structural reforms that could bring further boost continental europe 's economy .
above all , all three leaders , who belong to europe 's post-war generation , are more pragmatic than their more ideologically motivated predecessors . eu relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain was off the hook after french and dutch voters rejected the eu constitution " brown is not passionate about europe , but because of it , he will be able to get further in brussels than someone so outwardly messianic about it like blair , " said brady , who explained that blair went too far with the british public in pushing for an eu constitution , which merkel wants to salvage before the end of germany 's six-month rotating eu presidency .
after french and dutch voters rejected it in 2005 , the british referendum was called off , saving blair from the embarrassing risk of a likely " no " at the ballot box .
" even the founding member states are more cautious about guarding what they perceive as their national interests and uncomfortable about the idea a superstate imposed on them from brussels , so the british are less on the outs than they used to be , " said julie smith , deputy director of the centre of international studies at cambridge university .
as blair 's finance minister , brown has said that he did not support the euro , because it was not in britain 's economic interest , although others say that the decision was purely political . " people are attached to the sterling .
it 's a symbol of british greatness , " said brady .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain and its eu partners are divided about turkey the one controversial issue that keeps britain aligned with the united states in opposition to its european partners is the country 's support for turkey 's membership in the eu , which has been opposed by sarkozy and merkel , although she has softened her stance since becoming chancellor .
britain , like the us , favors keeping the door open to turkey for geopolitical reasons , whereas france and germany see an influx of cheap labor and the problems of integrating a poor , predominantly muslim country .
the turkish issue also reflects the difference in the british vision of a broader confederation of nation states with the conflicting french desire for a deeper political integration and a tighter club .
relations with the united states are expected to be less divisive among the eu-3 , making it even possible for the uk to have good relations with both europe and the us at the same time , according to smith . " britain has never achieved the right balance .
tony blair tried , but gravitated too far towards america .
gordon brown may have a better chance of getting it right , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.05.2007 opinion : the end of daimler 's " world inc . " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nine-year , trans-atlantic marriage of automakers daimler and chrysler has come to an end and it 's probably best that way for all involved , said deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky . what daimlerchrysler 's former chief jürgen schrempp once called a " marriage from heaven " has now , after nine years , ended in a mundane divorce .
and it 's probably the best thing that could have happened - for both companies .
even though they will remain connected for years to come in joint technical projects and daimler 's minor stake in chrysler , they still have better chances going it alone in the automotive business than being involved in a relationship designed along the lines of jürgen schrempp 's vision of a welt ag or world inc .
that dream quickly revealed itself to be a mere delusion of grandeur .
schadenfreude inappropriate the consequences of that are immense , and feeling a sense of schadenfreude would be inappropriate .
after all , corporate strategies that have gotten out of control have once again caused millions of euros and many jobs to be lost .
daimler managers , with current chief executive dieter zetsche leading them at the time , cut 26,000 jobs at chrysler .
now on its own , chrysler will again have to lay off another 13,000 employees .
and , the way these things work when jobs are cut to increase profitability , what accompanied the announcement of the daimlerchrysler split was a true firework display on the stock market - not unlike the one that followed the news of schrempp 's disreputable departure .
eyes bigger than mouth now it 's official : daimler bit off more than it could chew when it purchased chrysler .
first , there were not enough managers to restructure the already crippled company in the united states ; then , it seemed that money was becoming scarce .
that is when a split becomes mandatory .
the decisive majority-shareholder at chrysler will be the private equity group cerberus capital management .
it will make a capital contribution of 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- - not as a purchase price , it should be noted , but in return for an 80.1-percent equity interest in chrysler .
in order to shed itself of chrysler , daimler must also throw in 1.2 billion euros .
chrysler must now rely on its own strengths .
in addition to having to rid itself of now hard-to-sell pick-up trucks and suv 's , it must also market fuel-efficient small cars since the american conscience has also changed . neither chrysler , nor general motors nor ford , was prepared for that .
cerberus managers may now put a lot of pressure on chrysler to make those changes quickly .
daimler to profit most yet it is daimler which is profiting the most from the divorce since the maker of luxury cars , trucks and buses will no longer have chrysler as an albatross hanging from its neck .
the reputation of daimler 's management , however , has taken another beating .
after all , the bad investment that cost many billions of euros is not restricted to the chrysler issue alone , but is part of a larger complex that has dominated the ranks of daimler 's management for years .
the goal was a european-american-asian automotive company in which the sun never sets .
the result has been a financial disaster .
it 's a good thing that managers neither design nor build cars because mercedes has only survived these managerial adventures because the swabian engineers and workers of the company make such fantastic cars that can be sold high prices on the world market .
in other words : though they fervently tried for many years , the upper echelon of daimler managers just was n't able to drive the corporate group completely into the ground . karl zawadzky is a dw economics expert -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler to sell chrysler to cerberus german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler said on monday it had agreed to sell control of its loss-making us arm chrysler to private equity firm cerberus , for 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- .

" we are all safer if we operate in a world in which intelligent use of information allows for more focussed efforts in determining who is a threat , " us secretary of homeland security michael chertoff said on monday after a meeting with european union lawmakers and officials .
the us and the 27-member eu are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
" we need to make sure that we have to provide the civilized world with appropriate tools to identify new security threats , " chertoff told a news briefing in brussels .
the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years .
data flow under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 34 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers .

chertoff said that the us wanted to make sure that a new agreement , which has to be clinched by the end of july , would ensure a " sufficient period of time " for the storage of data , arguing that terrorists were planning their plots over several years .
he also said that the us was working on new legislation under which foreign air passengers travelling to the us would be required to feed their data into an online database days ahead of the trip .
this new plan would enable the us " to inform people in advance if there is going to be a problem in allowing them to travel , " chertoff said .
kept for how long ?
eu justice commissioner franco frattini said that the two sides were still disagreeing on how long us authorities should be able to use data about passengers on transatlantic flights , when it should be destroyed and which government agencies should have access to the sensitive information .
the us also wants to pull data directly from airline computers , but european countries insist airlines must transmit the information .

minimum wage issues remain unresolved . during a cabinet meeting late monday night , leaders of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ended months of disagreement and agreed to create new child care provisions , part of a bid to catch up with other european countries on family politics and encourage mothers to work and reverse a declining birthrate . " there was a really large coalition formed for children and families , " family affairs minister ursula von der leyen told german public broadcaster ard on tuesday . coalition leaders punctuated the talks with the " breakthrough " on child care , according to spd head kurt beck .

the move was championed by von der leyen , a mother of seven who has stirred the ire of conservatives who see the provisions for child care as a break with traditional family values .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 15.05.2007 eu must increase data sharing in terror fight , us says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sharing of passenger data remains controversial in the eu information gathered about passengers traveling to the united states is crucial in combating international terrorism , a us top security official said , pressing europe to increase its data exchange with the us . " we are all safer if we operate in a world in which intelligent use of information allows for more focussed efforts in determining who is a threat , " us secretary of homeland security michael chertoff said on monday after a meeting with european union lawmakers and officials .
the us and the 27-member eu are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
" we need to make sure that we have to provide the civilized world with appropriate tools to identify new security threats , " chertoff told a news briefing in brussels .
the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years .
data flow under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 34 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines face fines if they fail to pass on information such as credit card numbers washington has warned that airlines which failed to share passenger data would face fines of up to $ 6,000 -lrb- $ 4,450 -rrb- per passenger and a possible loss of landing rights .
chertoff said that the us wanted to make sure that a new agreement , which has to be clinched by the end of july , would ensure a " sufficient period of time " for the storage of data , arguing that terrorists were planning their plots over several years .
he also said that the us was working on new legislation under which foreign air passengers travelling to the us would be required to feed their data into an online database days ahead of the trip .
this new plan would enable the us " to inform people in advance if there is going to be a problem in allowing them to travel , " chertoff said .
kept for how long ?
eu justice commissioner franco frattini said that the two sides were still disagreeing on how long us authorities should be able to use data about passengers on transatlantic flights , when it should be destroyed and which government agencies should have access to the sensitive information .
the us also wants to pull data directly from airline computers , but european countries insist airlines must transmit the information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the date agreement will affect flights bound for the us eu data protection officials have demanded that personal data sent to us authorities should be made anonymous and the identity of their owner only be revealed if the data matched a profile in a terrorist database .
they have also said that a new deal on passenger data-sharing could be challenged by eu national courts .
the eu and the us are increasingly at odds over how to reconcile civil liberties with the us-led fight against terrorism .
brussels and washington have also locked horns over a secret agreement between the us treasury and the belgium-based money transfer company swift , which has supplied us authorities with personal data for use in counter-terrorism inquiries . dw staff -lrb- kj -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report says attack against americans in germany imminent us and german officials believe a terrorist attack against americans in germany is imminent , us media reported friday .

" preparing for the summit has been difficult , " steinmeier said after his talks with putin .
" there have been a number of specific problems which we have not been able to solve over the past few weeks .
keeping silent about them does n't help , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , and putin tried to play down their differences " that is why i looked for an opportunity to meet with the russian president and the foreign minister .
that was a good decision .
we are now seeing the situation around the preparation for the ... summit in a much clearer way . "
speaking at the start of the meeting , putin said : " there are differences of opinion on how to solve specific problems , but both sides have a desire to solve them . "
putin met steinmeier straight after talks with us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who is also trying to soothe her country 's tense relations with russia .

" merkel , the daughter of a protestant pastor and the leader of germany 's strongly catholic cdu party , has been pushing strongly for a reference to christianity in the new charter . however , any attempt to mention christianity or god in the treaty has been strictly opposed by secular france , liberal countries such as sweden and denmark and by britain . during the 2004 negotiations on the bloc 's original constitution , there were concerns that any religious reference could anger europe 's muslims and jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and dutch rejection of the treaty plunged the eu into a crisis merkel , who currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency , wants member states to agree to a mandate for a new treaty at the next european summit in june .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 15.05.2007 germany 's coalition agrees on radical expansion of nurseries großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents will have a legal right to a day care spot for their kids in 2013 chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition has approved a tripling of nursery school facilities that would guarantee every family a place in the state day care system by 2013 .
minimum wage issues remain unresolved . during a cabinet meeting late monday night , leaders of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ended months of disagreement and agreed to create new child care provisions , part of a bid to catch up with other european countries on family politics and encourage mothers to work and reverse a declining birthrate . " there was a really large coalition formed for children and families , " family affairs minister ursula von der leyen told german public broadcaster ard on tuesday . coalition leaders punctuated the talks with the " breakthrough " on child care , according to spd head kurt beck .
christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , leader edmund stoiber emphasized that the panel also agreed on payments of 150 euros a month to families for raising children at home . " it is a sustainable compromise , " stoiber added .
states already accepted plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany lags behind european neighbors in day care last month , german states endorsed the plan that was adopted monday night , which calls for tripling the number of day care places for children under age three to 750,000 by 2013 .
the move was championed by von der leyen , a mother of seven who has stirred the ire of conservatives who see the provisions for child care as a break with traditional family values .
von der leyen 's proposal foresees the federal government covering one-third of the total 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.2 billion -rrb- in costs for expanding day care spaces for kids , but it is still unclear how federal , state and municipal governments plan to fund the expenses .
at present , germany lags behind its european neighbors in providing day care .
figures released by the government show 13.5 percent of children under three attend nursery schools , compared with the european average of 35 percent . easing burden on low-wage earners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctor , mother and politician von der leyen has ruffled her party 's feathers the coalition was unable to settle the divisive issue of implementing a minimum wage , with both beck and stoiber confirming that subject is still unresolved . labor unions want a minimum hourly wage of 7.50 euros to protect german workers from being undercut by cheap foreign labor , but merkel 's cdu says a new minimum wage would lead to job losses .
the cdu and spd , however , did agree on easing the burden on low-income earners .
those who earn between 800 euros and 1300 euros and also draw on social welfare benefits will no longer have to make social insurance contributions .
according to the federal labor agency , around half a million people in germany earn so little , that they must supplement their income with social welfare . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germans and their politicians badly need a course correction " as germans discuss increasing childcare opportunities and women in the workforce , german performer désirée nick taks to dw-world.de about motherhood and climbing the career ladder in high heels .

" preparing for the summit has been difficult , " steinmeier said after his talks with putin .
" there have been a number of specific problems which we have not been able to solve over the past few weeks .
keeping silent about them does n't help , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , and putin tried to play down their differences " that is why i looked for an opportunity to meet with the russian president and the foreign minister .
that was a good decision .
we are now seeing the situation around the preparation for the ... summit in a much clearer way . "
speaking at the start of the meeting , putin said : " there are differences of opinion on how to solve specific problems , but both sides have a desire to solve them . "
putin met steinmeier straight after talks with us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who is also trying to soothe her country 's tense relations with russia .
a sense of doom with attempts to negotiate a key eu-russia partnership accord in tatters , there were few signs that germany 's intervention as head of the rotating presidency of the european union could salvage the summit .
russia 's foreign ministry accused poland of holding eu-russia relations " hostage " by blocking discussion of the partnership deal , which would govern key areas , including energy supplies , interfax news agency reported .
putin 's representative for eu relations , sergei yastrzhembsky , said there " is no real sense in discussing an accord on which we can not negotiate , " interfax reported .
poland has vetoed negotiations in retaliation for a russian ban on polish meat imports , while lithuania is now also threatening to veto the talks unless russia resumes oil deliveries to a refinery in the north of the baltic state .
warsaw made an additional demand on tuesday that the 27-member eu must pledge to protect the energy security of poland and other eu newcomers that rely on russian oil and gas .
deteriorating ties with west the disputes are fuelling escalating tensions between moscow and new eu member countries of formerly soviet-dominated central europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's ugly dispute over a memorial with estonia have soured moscow 's ties with the eu estonia is also locked in an ugly war of words with russia over the relocation of a soviet-era war memorial in the capital tallinn .
the baltic republic says that a halving of rail freight from russia this month amounts to unofficial economic sanctions .
eu-russia tensions , coupled with increasingly frayed us-russian ties , are contributing to a dramatic deterioration of east-west relations ahead of presidential election seasons in both russia and the united states .
moscow is already in a fierce confrontation with washington over us plans to deploy an anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic .
russia is also at loggerheads with the european union and united states over western-backed plans to give independence to kosovo , a province in russian ally serbia .
a " senseless " summit ahead of his moscow trip , steinmeier sounded pessimistic about the chances of any breakthroughs .
" i can not assure you 100 percent whether progress can be made on individual issues , but even if you do not know you must make an attempt , " he told reporters in brussels .
the german foreign policy chief even addressed rumors that the summit could be cancelled , saying " we have to bring an end to these discussions about whether or not the summit will take place . "
russia 's kommersant daily said steinmeier would be unable " to save the summit from collapse , " while the vedomosti daily called the samara meeting " senseless . "
" the eu-russian summit will either be a relative failure or a scandalous failure .
there will definitely be no negotiations on a partnership agreement .
the participants may not even be able to agree on a joint declaration , " the daily said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " russia wants pragmatic , business-like cooperation " russian and eu delegates meet this week as relations remain taught on issues like independence for kosovo , human rights and the us missile shield .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.05.2007 opinion : the end of daimler 's " world inc . " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nine-year , trans-atlantic marriage of automakers daimler and chrysler has come to an end and it 's probably best that way for all involved , said deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky . what daimlerchrysler 's former chief jürgen schrempp once called a " marriage from heaven " has now , after nine years , ended in a mundane divorce .
and it 's probably the best thing that could have happened - for both companies .
even though they will remain connected for years to come in joint technical projects and daimler 's minor stake in chrysler , they still have better chances going it alone in the automotive business than being involved in a relationship designed along the lines of jürgen schrempp 's vision of a welt ag or world inc .
that dream quickly revealed itself to be a mere delusion of grandeur .
schadenfreude inappropriate the consequences of that are immense , and feeling a sense of schadenfreude would be inappropriate .
after all , corporate strategies that have gotten out of control have once again caused millions of euros and many jobs to be lost .
daimler managers , with current chief executive dieter zetsche leading them at the time , cut 26,000 jobs at chrysler .
now on its own , chrysler will again have to lay off another 13,000 employees .
and , the way these things work when jobs are cut to increase profitability , what accompanied the announcement of the daimlerchrysler split was a true firework display on the stock market - not unlike the one that followed the news of schrempp 's disreputable departure .
eyes bigger than mouth now it 's official : daimler bit off more than it could chew when it purchased chrysler .
first , there were not enough managers to restructure the already crippled company in the united states ; then , it seemed that money was becoming scarce .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : blair bows out blair endorses gordon brown as candidate for british pm european press review : " it 's blair 's fault britain is relieved " gordon brown , the next man in number 10 praise floods in for blair from europe , us european union -pipe- 15.05.2007 brown 's britain : striking an eu-us balance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together with european partners , a more equal partnership with us under brown passionately pro-european and atlanticist , tony blair sought good relations with both the eu and the us , although his pragmatic successor gordon brown is more likely to achieve both . from winston churchill to tony blair , every post-war prime minister has been consumed by a foreign policy that has boiled down to the choice between europe and the united states while trying to establish an independent british role in the world .
although britain emerged as an allied victor from the ashes of world war ii , some say she won the war , but lost the peace .
her vast imperial empire had disintegrated , and the " special relationship " with the united states , a partnership forged by a common heritage and the war , went through rough patches after the suez crisis in 1956 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartime leader winston churchill -lrb- right -rrb- chose the us over europe the anglo-french conspiracy to topple egypt ’ s gamal abdel nasser met with us hostility , shattering both british pretensions in the middle east and illusions about the loyalty of its closest ally .
america emerged as a superpower , while britain , like france , was reduced to a mid-sized nuclear power with a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
as an increasingly junior partner in the anglo-american relationship , she had to look for alliances elsewhere , and this meant reluctantly throwing in her lot with neighbors across the english channel .
that the uk was a latecomer in joining the european club in 1973 had to do with what french statesman charles de gaulle perceived as the conflict of her ties to the commonwealth and america .
de gaulle had used france ’ s veto to keep britain out of the european economic community -lrb- eec -rrb- , so when the uk finally did join 15 years after the founding of the treaty of rome , she joined a club where the rules had already been set by others .
hence britain 's relationship to europe has often been an adversarial one .
iron lady margaret thatcher had made britain a pariah state by demanding a rebate for the amount the uk was paying into eec coffers in farm subsidies and opting out of the community ’ s social charter .
in a decade of the current labour government , britain is the only major european union country which has not signed on to the border-free schengen accords , and not adopted the common currency , the euro . iraq war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair 's support of iraq war reinforced european view that britain favors the us but above all , it was outgoing prime minister tony blair ’ s staunch support for the american-led iraq war against overwhelming public sentiment that greatly diminished his premiership and reinforced the view among the french and germans that britain still favors the us over europe although gordon brown , blair 's almost certain successor on june 27 , was closely identified with the cabinet ’ s iraq policy , experts say that he is more likely to distance himself from the bush administration , yet seek closer trans-atlantic ties in conjunction with britain 's european partners .
" brown 's under public pressure not to have an exclusive relationship with the white house that was so damaging for britain under blair , " said hugo brady of the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank .
brady also sees a greater convergence of the eu 's big three - the uk , france and germany - in spite of brown 's reputation as a euro skeptic who as chancellor of the exchequer , britain 's finance minister , kept his country out of the euro zone . the fact that newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy has expressed admiration rather than contempt for " anglo-saxon " free markets also helps , and even germany ’ s angela merkel is a natural ally when it comes to her atlanticist leanings and advocacy of structural reforms that could bring further boost continental europe 's economy .
above all , all three leaders , who belong to europe 's post-war generation , are more pragmatic than their more ideologically motivated predecessors . eu relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain was off the hook after french and dutch voters rejected the eu constitution " brown is not passionate about europe , but because of it , he will be able to get further in brussels than someone so outwardly messianic about it like blair , " said brady , who explained that blair went too far with the british public in pushing for an eu constitution , which merkel wants to salvage before the end of germany 's six-month rotating eu presidency .
after french and dutch voters rejected it in 2005 , the british referendum was called off , saving blair from the embarrassing risk of a likely " no " at the ballot box .
" even the founding member states are more cautious about guarding what they perceive as their national interests and uncomfortable about the idea a superstate imposed on them from brussels , so the british are less on the outs than they used to be , " said julie smith , deputy director of the centre of international studies at cambridge university .
as blair 's finance minister , brown has said that he did not support the euro , because it was not in britain 's economic interest , although others say that the decision was purely political . " people are attached to the sterling .
it 's a symbol of british greatness , " said brady .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain and its eu partners are divided about turkey the one controversial issue that keeps britain aligned with the united states in opposition to its european partners is the country 's support for turkey 's membership in the eu , which has been opposed by sarkozy and merkel , although she has softened her stance since becoming chancellor .
britain , like the us , favors keeping the door open to turkey for geopolitical reasons , whereas france and germany see an influx of cheap labor and the problems of integrating a poor , predominantly muslim country .
the turkish issue also reflects the difference in the british vision of a broader confederation of nation states with the conflicting french desire for a deeper political integration and a tighter club .
relations with the united states are expected to be less divisive among the eu-3 , making it even possible for the uk to have good relations with both europe and the us at the same time , according to smith . " britain has never achieved the right balance .
tony blair tried , but gravitated too far towards america .
gordon brown may have a better chance of getting it right , " she said .
furthermore , according to brady , a humbled george w. bush in the twilight years of the american presidency is more likely to treat europe as an equal partner . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel calls for eu constitution push at mini summit chancellor angela merkel on saturday said germany needs the support of eu members , in particular the next two eu presidencies portugal and slovenia , if europe 's stalled constitution is to move forward .

" six lebanese men accused of plotting to bomb the trains in western germany in july 2006 are currently standing trial in beirut . one of the defendants has confessed to lebanese authorities that he planted the homemade bombs to avenge the publication in denmark of cartoons of the prophet mohammed .
investigators believe the devices failed to explode because of faulty detonators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble has come under fire for allowing intelligence agenicies to snoop on pcs via the internet in addition , a little-known islamic extremist group issued a warning in march that germany could come under attack unless it withdrew its troops from afghanistan . last weekend , us media reported of an imminent attack on americans in germany by an al qaeda cell .
german press reports said five islamists living in the frankfurt area and belonging to a little-known group with ties to al qaeda had triggered a security warning by us authorities last month . schäuble said intelligence services were focusing their efforts on monitoring radical islamist websites in an attempt to spot potential attacks at the planning stage . " the internet gives terrorists a gigantic forum , whether as a communications platform , an advertising portal , or as a virtual training camp and think tank , " schäuble said . right-wing attacks on the rise violence by right-wing extremists also shot up in 2006 by 9.3 per cent , the report by the office for the protection of the constitution showed . the far-right national democratic party -lrb- ndp -rrb- gained 1,000 new members to take their membership to 7,000 .
schäuble voiced concern that neo-nazis have a growing influence on the npd leadership and spoke of the " alarming development " that the extreme right was gaining more acceptance in society . the interior minister , however , rejected the idea of attempting to ban the party , saying this would make it more difficult to observe ndp activities . concern over g-8 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been a series of anti-g8 protests in the past weeks the report found that left-wing violence dropped by 3.8 percent , but schäuble used the opportunity to warn that that the government would n't allow " potential violence to hinder the orderly course of the g8 summit , " which germany is hosting at the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm on june 6-8 . german police last week staged a series of raids on the homes and offices of militant left-wingers suspected of planning to disrupt the meeting between the leaders of germany , france , italy , britain , the united states , canada , japan and russia . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reports say raids on g8 protestors uncovered explosives amid growing criticism of a crackdown on leftwing protestors ahead of the g8 summit , news reports say recent raids by german police have yielded a range of incendiary materials .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all bought and paid for - but at what price ?
following on from the launch of the five-point action plan " fit instead of fat , " which the government hopes will promote more active lifestyles and encourage germans to pay more attention to healthy nutrition , the powers-that-be are now grabbing at more desperate straws .
the latest weapon in the battle of the bulge could be a " fat tax . "
in response to the damning report from the international association for the study of obesity , which found that 58.9 percent of german women are overweight and 75.4 percent of men tip the scales , the german government is proposing to increase the tax on foods that are high in calories .
the thinking behind this is that the more expensive the food , the less likely people will want to eat it .
therefore , by abstaining from eating high-calorie , high-cost food , germans will get thinner .
while there is more than a little bit of twisted logic in this thinking , the german government seems to be ignoring a couple of key factors which should potentially scupper the idea before the prices of chips and soft drinks even get the chance to go up .

this is why the " fit instead of fat " plan is a far better way of tackling the obesity problem .
germans are n't the fattest in europe because they eat more calories but because they move less .
this is particularly true of children .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 15.05.2007 eu must increase data sharing in terror fight , us says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sharing of passenger data remains controversial in the eu information gathered about passengers traveling to the united states is crucial in combating international terrorism , a us top security official said , pressing europe to increase its data exchange with the us . " we are all safer if we operate in a world in which intelligent use of information allows for more focussed efforts in determining who is a threat , " us secretary of homeland security michael chertoff said on monday after a meeting with european union lawmakers and officials .
the us and the 27-member eu are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
" we need to make sure that we have to provide the civilized world with appropriate tools to identify new security threats , " chertoff told a news briefing in brussels .
the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years .
data flow under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 34 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines face fines if they fail to pass on information such as credit card numbers washington has warned that airlines which failed to share passenger data would face fines of up to $ 6,000 -lrb- $ 4,450 -rrb- per passenger and a possible loss of landing rights .
chertoff said that the us wanted to make sure that a new agreement , which has to be clinched by the end of july , would ensure a " sufficient period of time " for the storage of data , arguing that terrorists were planning their plots over several years .
he also said that the us was working on new legislation under which foreign air passengers travelling to the us would be required to feed their data into an online database days ahead of the trip .
this new plan would enable the us " to inform people in advance if there is going to be a problem in allowing them to travel , " chertoff said .
kept for how long ?
eu justice commissioner franco frattini said that the two sides were still disagreeing on how long us authorities should be able to use data about passengers on transatlantic flights , when it should be destroyed and which government agencies should have access to the sensitive information .
the us also wants to pull data directly from airline computers , but european countries insist airlines must transmit the information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the date agreement will affect flights bound for the us eu data protection officials have demanded that personal data sent to us authorities should be made anonymous and the identity of their owner only be revealed if the data matched a profile in a terrorist database .
they have also said that a new deal on passenger data-sharing could be challenged by eu national courts .
the eu and the us are increasingly at odds over how to reconcile civil liberties with the us-led fight against terrorism .
brussels and washington have also locked horns over a secret agreement between the us treasury and the belgium-based money transfer company swift , which has supplied us authorities with personal data for use in counter-terrorism inquiries . dw staff -lrb- kj -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report says attack against americans in germany imminent us and german officials believe a terrorist attack against americans in germany is imminent , us media reported friday .

" six lebanese men accused of plotting to bomb the trains in western germany in july 2006 are currently standing trial in beirut . one of the defendants has confessed to lebanese authorities that he planted the homemade bombs to avenge the publication in denmark of cartoons of the prophet mohammed .
investigators believe the devices failed to explode because of faulty detonators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble has come under fire for allowing intelligence agenicies to snoop on pcs via the internet in addition , a little-known islamic extremist group issued a warning in march that germany could come under attack unless it withdrew its troops from afghanistan . last weekend , us media reported of an imminent attack on americans in germany by an al qaeda cell .
german press reports said five islamists living in the frankfurt area and belonging to a little-known group with ties to al qaeda had triggered a security warning by us authorities last month . schäuble said intelligence services were focusing their efforts on monitoring radical islamist websites in an attempt to spot potential attacks at the planning stage . " the internet gives terrorists a gigantic forum , whether as a communications platform , an advertising portal , or as a virtual training camp and think tank , " schäuble said . right-wing attacks on the rise violence by right-wing extremists also shot up in 2006 by 9.3 per cent , the report by the office for the protection of the constitution showed . the far-right national democratic party -lrb- ndp -rrb- gained 1,000 new members to take their membership to 7,000 .
schäuble voiced concern that neo-nazis have a growing influence on the npd leadership and spoke of the " alarming development " that the extreme right was gaining more acceptance in society . the interior minister , however , rejected the idea of attempting to ban the party , saying this would make it more difficult to observe ndp activities . concern over g-8 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been a series of anti-g8 protests in the past weeks the report found that left-wing violence dropped by 3.8 percent , but schäuble used the opportunity to warn that that the government would n't allow " potential violence to hinder the orderly course of the g8 summit , " which germany is hosting at the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm on june 6-8 . german police last week staged a series of raids on the homes and offices of militant left-wingers suspected of planning to disrupt the meeting between the leaders of germany , france , italy , britain , the united states , canada , japan and russia . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reports say raids on g8 protestors uncovered explosives amid growing criticism of a crackdown on leftwing protestors ahead of the g8 summit , news reports say recent raids by german police have yielded a range of incendiary materials .
-lrb- 13.05.2007 -rrb- beirut puts off german train bomb trial until may a beirut court on wednesday adjourned until next month a hearing for six lebanese accused of plotting to bomb trains in germany last july after defense lawyers requested more time .

after the sensible idea of promoting exercise comes the slightly mad idea of pricing fatty foods out of the average budget . being fingered as the fattest nation in europe has really got the germans ' oversized panties in a bunch .
the shock of outweighing the bulging brits as the continent ’ s portliest people has sent germany ’ s politicians into a crazed frenzy of legislative lunacy .
scared that the germans ' reputation as sport-mad , health-conscious types is being consigned to the rubbish bin of history - along with all the pizza boxes and burger wrappers - german leaders are wracking their brains to come up with policies that help the populace shed their pounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all bought and paid for - but at what price ?
following on from the launch of the five-point action plan " fit instead of fat , " which the government hopes will promote more active lifestyles and encourage germans to pay more attention to healthy nutrition , the powers-that-be are now grabbing at more desperate straws .
the latest weapon in the battle of the bulge could be a " fat tax . "
in response to the damning report from the international association for the study of obesity , which found that 58.9 percent of german women are overweight and 75.4 percent of men tip the scales , the german government is proposing to increase the tax on foods that are high in calories .
the thinking behind this is that the more expensive the food , the less likely people will want to eat it .
therefore , by abstaining from eating high-calorie , high-cost food , germans will get thinner .
while there is more than a little bit of twisted logic in this thinking , the german government seems to be ignoring a couple of key factors which should potentially scupper the idea before the prices of chips and soft drinks even get the chance to go up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generation x-box needs to get out and exercise firstly , the idea that hiking the tax on a product will mean less people will buy it is historically flawed .
the sales of cigarettes and alcohol have not suffered unduly through massive price increases over the years .
if someone wants to smoke or have a drink , they will , regardless of price .
the same can almost certainly be said for certain favorite fatty foods .
secondly , the problem isn ’ t the amount of calories but what is done to burn them off .
this is why the " fit instead of fat " plan is a far better way of tackling the obesity problem .
germans are n't the fattest in europe because they eat more calories but because they move less .
this is particularly true of children .
so , rather than trying to price calorie-laden foods out of the common person 's budget , the german government should think again .
and if they really want to introduce bird-brained ideas to encourage people to lose weight , why not try a " sitting on your backside tax . "

statisticians attributed the deceleration to less consumer spending following a sharp rise in value-added tax . consumers in europe 's largest economy are moving less money across german shop counters since the government upped the sales or value-added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 percent to 19 percent at the beginning of the year . official figures released on tuesday showed that germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- rose by 0.5 percent in the period from january to march compared to the fourth quarter of 2006 .
the increase was down from 1 percent growth in the preceding three months . " consumer spending put the brakes on economic growth , largely in connection with the vat hike at the beginning of the year , " the federal statistics office said in a statement .
the gdp measures the value of a country 's economic performance within the domestic territory . however , economics minister michael glos said the higher vat had been absorbed .
fresh investments at the beginning of the year had brought significant impulses to the country , he said .
according to glos , germany was on track for further growth .

" after difficult negotiations , we have come up with a viable compromise on the roaming regulation , " said conservative austrian mp paul rübig , who led the talks at the parliament . the compromise still needs to be formalized , first by members states ' experts on wednesday , then by a vote before the european parliament in a plenary sitting next week , and finally by eu ministers on june 7 . " we now have a solid compromise on the table that can get backing from everyone , " said german economy minister michael glos , adding that " with a little goodwill we can get an agreement . "
under the agreement , rates for calls made while in other eu countries would be capped in the first year of application at 0.49 euros -lrb- $ 0.66 -rrb- a minute .
receiving calls could cost no more than 0.24 euros .
the ceiling for so-called roaming services would come down even lower in the second year , falling to 0.46 and 0.22 euros and then 0.43 and 0.19 euros in the third year . deal has mobile industry up in arms the european commission drew up the plans to regulate roaming rates last year .
it had found evidence of huge variations between operators ' prices , with some roaming calls costing up to six times those of local mobile calls . the package has the industry up in arms .
it has argued that fierce competition has already driven down prices and has been lobbying hard to get the plans watered down . even though the deal brought mobile phone users closer to cheaper roaming rates , the beuc european consumer association was left unimpressed by the compromise . " for us , the roaming rates remain high , " said spokesman dominique forrest .
" it 's a first step , but as it is on the table , it 's not enough . " the french consumer association ufc-que choisir was even more critical of the agreement , charging that it still allowed operators to make huge profits on the back of mobile phone users .
" the compromise gives in to the current excuse for a market which allows operators to have huge margins on calls received or made while abroad even though the cost is close to that for national calls , " it said in a statement .
consumers ca n't benefit from deal on their summer holidays although the new regulations could go into effect as early as mid-july , according to a diplomat , mobile phone users will not be able to benefit from the new rates until after the summer holiday period . the european commission had hoped that the new rates would be in place by the summer holidays . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu panel backs plans to cap mobile roaming rates european union plans to cap the price operators can charge mobile phone users while abroad cleared a key hurdle on thursday when a panel in the european parliament backed the package .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 15.05.2007 eu must increase data sharing in terror fight , us says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sharing of passenger data remains controversial in the eu information gathered about passengers traveling to the united states is crucial in combating international terrorism , a us top security official said , pressing europe to increase its data exchange with the us . " we are all safer if we operate in a world in which intelligent use of information allows for more focussed efforts in determining who is a threat , " us secretary of homeland security michael chertoff said on monday after a meeting with european union lawmakers and officials .
the us and the 27-member eu are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
" we need to make sure that we have to provide the civilized world with appropriate tools to identify new security threats , " chertoff told a news briefing in brussels .
the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years .
data flow under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 34 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines face fines if they fail to pass on information such as credit card numbers washington has warned that airlines which failed to share passenger data would face fines of up to $ 6,000 -lrb- $ 4,450 -rrb- per passenger and a possible loss of landing rights .
chertoff said that the us wanted to make sure that a new agreement , which has to be clinched by the end of july , would ensure a " sufficient period of time " for the storage of data , arguing that terrorists were planning their plots over several years .
he also said that the us was working on new legislation under which foreign air passengers travelling to the us would be required to feed their data into an online database days ahead of the trip .
this new plan would enable the us " to inform people in advance if there is going to be a problem in allowing them to travel , " chertoff said .
kept for how long ?
eu justice commissioner franco frattini said that the two sides were still disagreeing on how long us authorities should be able to use data about passengers on transatlantic flights , when it should be destroyed and which government agencies should have access to the sensitive information .
the us also wants to pull data directly from airline computers , but european countries insist airlines must transmit the information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the date agreement will affect flights bound for the us eu data protection officials have demanded that personal data sent to us authorities should be made anonymous and the identity of their owner only be revealed if the data matched a profile in a terrorist database .
they have also said that a new deal on passenger data-sharing could be challenged by eu national courts .
the eu and the us are increasingly at odds over how to reconcile civil liberties with the us-led fight against terrorism .
brussels and washington have also locked horns over a secret agreement between the us treasury and the belgium-based money transfer company swift , which has supplied us authorities with personal data for use in counter-terrorism inquiries . dw staff -lrb- kj -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report says attack against americans in germany imminent us and german officials believe a terrorist attack against americans in germany is imminent , us media reported friday .

" after difficult negotiations , we have come up with a viable compromise on the roaming regulation , " said conservative austrian mp paul rübig , who led the talks at the parliament . the compromise still needs to be formalized , first by members states ' experts on wednesday , then by a vote before the european parliament in a plenary sitting next week , and finally by eu ministers on june 7 . " we now have a solid compromise on the table that can get backing from everyone , " said german economy minister michael glos , adding that " with a little goodwill we can get an agreement . "
under the agreement , rates for calls made while in other eu countries would be capped in the first year of application at 0.49 euros -lrb- $ 0.66 -rrb- a minute .
receiving calls could cost no more than 0.24 euros .
the ceiling for so-called roaming services would come down even lower in the second year , falling to 0.46 and 0.22 euros and then 0.43 and 0.19 euros in the third year . deal has mobile industry up in arms the european commission drew up the plans to regulate roaming rates last year .
it had found evidence of huge variations between operators ' prices , with some roaming calls costing up to six times those of local mobile calls . the package has the industry up in arms .
it has argued that fierce competition has already driven down prices and has been lobbying hard to get the plans watered down . even though the deal brought mobile phone users closer to cheaper roaming rates , the beuc european consumer association was left unimpressed by the compromise . " for us , the roaming rates remain high , " said spokesman dominique forrest .
" it 's a first step , but as it is on the table , it 's not enough . " the french consumer association ufc-que choisir was even more critical of the agreement , charging that it still allowed operators to make huge profits on the back of mobile phone users .
" the compromise gives in to the current excuse for a market which allows operators to have huge margins on calls received or made while abroad even though the cost is close to that for national calls , " it said in a statement .
consumers ca n't benefit from deal on their summer holidays although the new regulations could go into effect as early as mid-july , according to a diplomat , mobile phone users will not be able to benefit from the new rates until after the summer holiday period . the european commission had hoped that the new rates would be in place by the summer holidays . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu panel backs plans to cap mobile roaming rates european union plans to cap the price operators can charge mobile phone users while abroad cleared a key hurdle on thursday when a panel in the european parliament backed the package .

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nine-year , trans-atlantic marriage of automakers daimler and chrysler has come to an end and it 's probably best that way for all involved , said deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky . what daimlerchrysler 's former chief jürgen schrempp once called a " marriage from heaven " has now , after nine years , ended in a mundane divorce .
and it 's probably the best thing that could have happened - for both companies .
even though they will remain connected for years to come in joint technical projects and daimler 's minor stake in chrysler , they still have better chances going it alone in the automotive business than being involved in a relationship designed along the lines of jürgen schrempp 's vision of a welt ag or world inc .
that dream quickly revealed itself to be a mere delusion of grandeur .
schadenfreude inappropriate the consequences of that are immense , and feeling a sense of schadenfreude would be inappropriate .
after all , corporate strategies that have gotten out of control have once again caused millions of euros and many jobs to be lost .
daimler managers , with current chief executive dieter zetsche leading them at the time , cut 26,000 jobs at chrysler .
now on its own , chrysler will again have to lay off another 13,000 employees .
and , the way these things work when jobs are cut to increase profitability , what accompanied the announcement of the daimlerchrysler split was a true firework display on the stock market - not unlike the one that followed the news of schrempp 's disreputable departure .
eyes bigger than mouth now it 's official : daimler bit off more than it could chew when it purchased chrysler .
first , there were not enough managers to restructure the already crippled company in the united states ; then , it seemed that money was becoming scarce .
that is when a split becomes mandatory .
the decisive majority-shareholder at chrysler will be the private equity group cerberus capital management .
it will make a capital contribution of 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- - not as a purchase price , it should be noted , but in return for an 80.1-percent equity interest in chrysler .
in order to shed itself of chrysler , daimler must also throw in 1.2 billion euros .
chrysler must now rely on its own strengths .
in addition to having to rid itself of now hard-to-sell pick-up trucks and suv 's , it must also market fuel-efficient small cars since the american conscience has also changed . neither chrysler , nor general motors nor ford , was prepared for that .
cerberus managers may now put a lot of pressure on chrysler to make those changes quickly .
daimler to profit most yet it is daimler which is profiting the most from the divorce since the maker of luxury cars , trucks and buses will no longer have chrysler as an albatross hanging from its neck .
the reputation of daimler 's management , however , has taken another beating .
after all , the bad investment that cost many billions of euros is not restricted to the chrysler issue alone , but is part of a larger complex that has dominated the ranks of daimler 's management for years .
the goal was a european-american-asian automotive company in which the sun never sets .
the result has been a financial disaster .
it 's a good thing that managers neither design nor build cars because mercedes has only survived these managerial adventures because the swabian engineers and workers of the company make such fantastic cars that can be sold high prices on the world market .

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nine-year , trans-atlantic marriage of automakers daimler and chrysler has come to an end and it 's probably best that way for all involved , said deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky . what daimlerchrysler 's former chief jürgen schrempp once called a " marriage from heaven " has now , after nine years , ended in a mundane divorce .
and it 's probably the best thing that could have happened - for both companies .
even though they will remain connected for years to come in joint technical projects and daimler 's minor stake in chrysler , they still have better chances going it alone in the automotive business than being involved in a relationship designed along the lines of jürgen schrempp 's vision of a welt ag or world inc .
that dream quickly revealed itself to be a mere delusion of grandeur .
schadenfreude inappropriate the consequences of that are immense , and feeling a sense of schadenfreude would be inappropriate .
after all , corporate strategies that have gotten out of control have once again caused millions of euros and many jobs to be lost .
daimler managers , with current chief executive dieter zetsche leading them at the time , cut 26,000 jobs at chrysler .
now on its own , chrysler will again have to lay off another 13,000 employees .
and , the way these things work when jobs are cut to increase profitability , what accompanied the announcement of the daimlerchrysler split was a true firework display on the stock market - not unlike the one that followed the news of schrempp 's disreputable departure .
eyes bigger than mouth now it 's official : daimler bit off more than it could chew when it purchased chrysler .
first , there were not enough managers to restructure the already crippled company in the united states ; then , it seemed that money was becoming scarce .
that is when a split becomes mandatory .
the decisive majority-shareholder at chrysler will be the private equity group cerberus capital management .
it will make a capital contribution of 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- - not as a purchase price , it should be noted , but in return for an 80.1-percent equity interest in chrysler .
in order to shed itself of chrysler , daimler must also throw in 1.2 billion euros .
chrysler must now rely on its own strengths .
in addition to having to rid itself of now hard-to-sell pick-up trucks and suv 's , it must also market fuel-efficient small cars since the american conscience has also changed . neither chrysler , nor general motors nor ford , was prepared for that .
cerberus managers may now put a lot of pressure on chrysler to make those changes quickly .
daimler to profit most yet it is daimler which is profiting the most from the divorce since the maker of luxury cars , trucks and buses will no longer have chrysler as an albatross hanging from its neck .
the reputation of daimler 's management , however , has taken another beating .
after all , the bad investment that cost many billions of euros is not restricted to the chrysler issue alone , but is part of a larger complex that has dominated the ranks of daimler 's management for years .
the goal was a european-american-asian automotive company in which the sun never sets .
the result has been a financial disaster .
it 's a good thing that managers neither design nor build cars because mercedes has only survived these managerial adventures because the swabian engineers and workers of the company make such fantastic cars that can be sold high prices on the world market .

" after difficult negotiations , we have come up with a viable compromise on the roaming regulation , " said conservative austrian mp paul rübig , who led the talks at the parliament . the compromise still needs to be formalized , first by members states ' experts on wednesday , then by a vote before the european parliament in a plenary sitting next week , and finally by eu ministers on june 7 . " we now have a solid compromise on the table that can get backing from everyone , " said german economy minister michael glos , adding that " with a little goodwill we can get an agreement . "
under the agreement , rates for calls made while in other eu countries would be capped in the first year of application at 0.49 euros -lrb- $ 0.66 -rrb- a minute .
receiving calls could cost no more than 0.24 euros .
the ceiling for so-called roaming services would come down even lower in the second year , falling to 0.46 and 0.22 euros and then 0.43 and 0.19 euros in the third year . deal has mobile industry up in arms the european commission drew up the plans to regulate roaming rates last year .
it had found evidence of huge variations between operators ' prices , with some roaming calls costing up to six times those of local mobile calls . the package has the industry up in arms .
it has argued that fierce competition has already driven down prices and has been lobbying hard to get the plans watered down . even though the deal brought mobile phone users closer to cheaper roaming rates , the beuc european consumer association was left unimpressed by the compromise . " for us , the roaming rates remain high , " said spokesman dominique forrest .
" it 's a first step , but as it is on the table , it 's not enough . " the french consumer association ufc-que choisir was even more critical of the agreement , charging that it still allowed operators to make huge profits on the back of mobile phone users .
" the compromise gives in to the current excuse for a market which allows operators to have huge margins on calls received or made while abroad even though the cost is close to that for national calls , " it said in a statement .
consumers ca n't benefit from deal on their summer holidays although the new regulations could go into effect as early as mid-july , according to a diplomat , mobile phone users will not be able to benefit from the new rates until after the summer holiday period . the european commission had hoped that the new rates would be in place by the summer holidays . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu panel backs plans to cap mobile roaming rates european union plans to cap the price operators can charge mobile phone users while abroad cleared a key hurdle on thursday when a panel in the european parliament backed the package .

" we are only asking what the politicians promised , not one euro more , " the founder of live aid said at a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" schröder signed in the name of the german people , if merkel betrays the pride of germany , then she kills people 12 miles south of europe in africa , " he said .
german music star herbert grönemeyer , who will sing at a major concert in rostock on june 7 along with bono and other musicians , said " politicians should just do their job and keep their promises . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geldof in younger years at a london live aid concert for africa the calls come just weeks before merkel hosts fellow leaders from the group of eight most industrialized nations at a summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm on june 6-8 .
germany currently holds the eu presidency .
bono said : " it is important that the g8 is taking place in germany because people expect germans to keep their promises . "
" if you break your promise , then everybody else will abandon ship , " he said .
report on progress geldof and the u2 frontman unveiled a report by data - a watchdog monitoring first-world help to africa which the two founded in 2002 - on the progress g8 nations have made in fulfilling their pledges made at gleneagles to collectively increase aid to africa by 25 billion dollars by 2010 .
the data report found that only britain and japan were doing their share to meet that target .
together the g8 nations stepped up development aid by $ 2.3 billion between 2004 and 2006 , but this is less than half of what they needed to give to be on track to meeting their 2010 deadline .
" it is less than half of what should have been done , " said jamie drummond of data .
" to get back on track in 2007 , they would have to increase aid by $ 6.4 billion , but so far there is at best a third of this in the pipeline . "
fears of violence german authorities fear that up to 100,000 anti-globalization protestors could target the g8 summit , and bono warned that failing to honor the group 's promises to africa could enrage activists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's grönemeyer has lent his voice to helping africa he said that although he was " opposed " to protestors resorting to violence , his own visits to poor countries had made him angry at the way the world neglected africa .
" i want to say that i relate to their rage , i feel it myself when i walk into a hospital and see people queuing up to die . "
merkel has promised to use the summit to build on efforts to help africa undertaken at gleneagles in 2005 .
on the weekend , merkel devoted her weekly podcast entirely to africa .
she said she wants the leaders of the group of eight industrialized nations to keep their earlier promises for increased development funding .
she said the richest nations in the world can really make a difference .
failure to help africa , she said , would come home to roost in the industrialized world .
" if we do n't care about the fate of our neighbors in this globalized world , we will one day see the problems arriving at our doorsteps , " she said .
" the migration of refugees can only be prevented if we help resolve the problems in their countries .
and we must do it now , " she stressed . dw staff with agency reports -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are the right countries sitting at the g8 table ?

" merkel , the daughter of a protestant pastor and the leader of germany 's strongly catholic cdu party , has been pushing strongly for a reference to christianity in the new charter . however , any attempt to mention christianity or god in the treaty has been strictly opposed by secular france , liberal countries such as sweden and denmark and by britain . during the 2004 negotiations on the bloc 's original constitution , there were concerns that any religious reference could anger europe 's muslims and jews . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and dutch rejection of the treaty plunged the eu into a crisis merkel , who currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency , wants member states to agree to a mandate for a new treaty at the next european summit in june .

minimum wage issues remain unresolved . during a cabinet meeting late monday night , leaders of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ended months of disagreement and agreed to create new child care provisions , part of a bid to catch up with other european countries on family politics and encourage mothers to work and reverse a declining birthrate . " there was a really large coalition formed for children and families , " family affairs minister ursula von der leyen told german public broadcaster ard on tuesday . coalition leaders punctuated the talks with the " breakthrough " on child care , according to spd head kurt beck .
christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , leader edmund stoiber emphasized that the panel also agreed on payments of 150 euros a month to families for raising children at home . " it is a sustainable compromise , " stoiber added .
states already accepted plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany lags behind european neighbors in day care last month , german states endorsed the plan that was adopted monday night , which calls for tripling the number of day care places for children under age three to 750,000 by 2013 .
the move was championed by von der leyen , a mother of seven who has stirred the ire of conservatives who see the provisions for child care as a break with traditional family values .
von der leyen 's proposal foresees the federal government covering one-third of the total 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.2 billion -rrb- in costs for expanding day care spaces for kids , but it is still unclear how federal , state and municipal governments plan to fund the expenses .
at present , germany lags behind its european neighbors in providing day care .
figures released by the government show 13.5 percent of children under three attend nursery schools , compared with the european average of 35 percent . easing burden on low-wage earners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctor , mother and politician von der leyen has ruffled her party 's feathers the coalition was unable to settle the divisive issue of implementing a minimum wage , with both beck and stoiber confirming that subject is still unresolved . labor unions want a minimum hourly wage of 7.50 euros to protect german workers from being undercut by cheap foreign labor , but merkel 's cdu says a new minimum wage would lead to job losses .
the cdu and spd , however , did agree on easing the burden on low-income earners .
those who earn between 800 euros and 1300 euros and also draw on social welfare benefits will no longer have to make social insurance contributions .
according to the federal labor agency , around half a million people in germany earn so little , that they must supplement their income with social welfare . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germans and their politicians badly need a course correction " as germans discuss increasing childcare opportunities and women in the workforce , german performer désirée nick taks to dw-world.de about motherhood and climbing the career ladder in high heels .

although britain emerged as an allied victor from the ashes of world war ii , some say she won the war , but lost the peace .
her vast imperial empire had disintegrated , and the " special relationship " with the united states , a partnership forged by a common heritage and the war , went through rough patches after the suez crisis in 1956 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartime leader winston churchill -lrb- right -rrb- chose the us over europe the anglo-french conspiracy to topple egypt ’ s gamal abdel nasser met with us hostility , shattering both british pretensions in the middle east and illusions about the loyalty of its closest ally .
america emerged as a superpower , while britain , like france , was reduced to a mid-sized nuclear power with a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
as an increasingly junior partner in the anglo-american relationship , she had to look for alliances elsewhere , and this meant reluctantly throwing in her lot with neighbors across the english channel .
that the uk was a latecomer in joining the european club in 1973 had to do with what french statesman charles de gaulle perceived as the conflict of her ties to the commonwealth and america .
de gaulle had used france ’ s veto to keep britain out of the european economic community -lrb- eec -rrb- , so when the uk finally did join 15 years after the founding of the treaty of rome , she joined a club where the rules had already been set by others .
hence britain 's relationship to europe has often been an adversarial one .
iron lady margaret thatcher had made britain a pariah state by demanding a rebate for the amount the uk was paying into eec coffers in farm subsidies and opting out of the community ’ s social charter .
in a decade of the current labour government , britain is the only major european union country which has not signed on to the border-free schengen accords , and not adopted the common currency , the euro . iraq war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair 's support of iraq war reinforced european view that britain favors the us but above all , it was outgoing prime minister tony blair ’ s staunch support for the american-led iraq war against overwhelming public sentiment that greatly diminished his premiership and reinforced the view among the french and germans that britain still favors the us over europe although gordon brown , blair 's almost certain successor on june 27 , was closely identified with the cabinet ’ s iraq policy , experts say that he is more likely to distance himself from the bush administration , yet seek closer trans-atlantic ties in conjunction with britain 's european partners .
" brown 's under public pressure not to have an exclusive relationship with the white house that was so damaging for britain under blair , " said hugo brady of the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank .
brady also sees a greater convergence of the eu 's big three - the uk , france and germany - in spite of brown 's reputation as a euro skeptic who as chancellor of the exchequer , britain 's finance minister , kept his country out of the euro zone . the fact that newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy has expressed admiration rather than contempt for " anglo-saxon " free markets also helps , and even germany ’ s angela merkel is a natural ally when it comes to her atlanticist leanings and advocacy of structural reforms that could bring further boost continental europe 's economy .
above all , all three leaders , who belong to europe 's post-war generation , are more pragmatic than their more ideologically motivated predecessors . eu relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain was off the hook after french and dutch voters rejected the eu constitution " brown is not passionate about europe , but because of it , he will be able to get further in brussels than someone so outwardly messianic about it like blair , " said brady , who explained that blair went too far with the british public in pushing for an eu constitution , which merkel wants to salvage before the end of germany 's six-month rotating eu presidency .
after french and dutch voters rejected it in 2005 , the british referendum was called off , saving blair from the embarrassing risk of a likely " no " at the ballot box .
" even the founding member states are more cautious about guarding what they perceive as their national interests and uncomfortable about the idea a superstate imposed on them from brussels , so the british are less on the outs than they used to be , " said julie smith , deputy director of the centre of international studies at cambridge university .
as blair 's finance minister , brown has said that he did not support the euro , because it was not in britain 's economic interest , although others say that the decision was purely political . " people are attached to the sterling .
it 's a symbol of british greatness , " said brady .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain and its eu partners are divided about turkey the one controversial issue that keeps britain aligned with the united states in opposition to its european partners is the country 's support for turkey 's membership in the eu , which has been opposed by sarkozy and merkel , although she has softened her stance since becoming chancellor .
britain , like the us , favors keeping the door open to turkey for geopolitical reasons , whereas france and germany see an influx of cheap labor and the problems of integrating a poor , predominantly muslim country .
the turkish issue also reflects the difference in the british vision of a broader confederation of nation states with the conflicting french desire for a deeper political integration and a tighter club .
relations with the united states are expected to be less divisive among the eu-3 , making it even possible for the uk to have good relations with both europe and the us at the same time , according to smith . " britain has never achieved the right balance .
tony blair tried , but gravitated too far towards america .
gordon brown may have a better chance of getting it right , " she said .

although britain emerged as an allied victor from the ashes of world war ii , some say she won the war , but lost the peace .
her vast imperial empire had disintegrated , and the " special relationship " with the united states , a partnership forged by a common heritage and the war , went through rough patches after the suez crisis in 1956 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartime leader winston churchill -lrb- right -rrb- chose the us over europe the anglo-french conspiracy to topple egypt ’ s gamal abdel nasser met with us hostility , shattering both british pretensions in the middle east and illusions about the loyalty of its closest ally .
america emerged as a superpower , while britain , like france , was reduced to a mid-sized nuclear power with a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
as an increasingly junior partner in the anglo-american relationship , she had to look for alliances elsewhere , and this meant reluctantly throwing in her lot with neighbors across the english channel .
that the uk was a latecomer in joining the european club in 1973 had to do with what french statesman charles de gaulle perceived as the conflict of her ties to the commonwealth and america .
de gaulle had used france ’ s veto to keep britain out of the european economic community -lrb- eec -rrb- , so when the uk finally did join 15 years after the founding of the treaty of rome , she joined a club where the rules had already been set by others .
hence britain 's relationship to europe has often been an adversarial one .
iron lady margaret thatcher had made britain a pariah state by demanding a rebate for the amount the uk was paying into eec coffers in farm subsidies and opting out of the community ’ s social charter .
in a decade of the current labour government , britain is the only major european union country which has not signed on to the border-free schengen accords , and not adopted the common currency , the euro . iraq war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair 's support of iraq war reinforced european view that britain favors the us but above all , it was outgoing prime minister tony blair ’ s staunch support for the american-led iraq war against overwhelming public sentiment that greatly diminished his premiership and reinforced the view among the french and germans that britain still favors the us over europe although gordon brown , blair 's almost certain successor on june 27 , was closely identified with the cabinet ’ s iraq policy , experts say that he is more likely to distance himself from the bush administration , yet seek closer trans-atlantic ties in conjunction with britain 's european partners .
" brown 's under public pressure not to have an exclusive relationship with the white house that was so damaging for britain under blair , " said hugo brady of the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank .
brady also sees a greater convergence of the eu 's big three - the uk , france and germany - in spite of brown 's reputation as a euro skeptic who as chancellor of the exchequer , britain 's finance minister , kept his country out of the euro zone . the fact that newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy has expressed admiration rather than contempt for " anglo-saxon " free markets also helps , and even germany ’ s angela merkel is a natural ally when it comes to her atlanticist leanings and advocacy of structural reforms that could bring further boost continental europe 's economy .
above all , all three leaders , who belong to europe 's post-war generation , are more pragmatic than their more ideologically motivated predecessors . eu relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain was off the hook after french and dutch voters rejected the eu constitution " brown is not passionate about europe , but because of it , he will be able to get further in brussels than someone so outwardly messianic about it like blair , " said brady , who explained that blair went too far with the british public in pushing for an eu constitution , which merkel wants to salvage before the end of germany 's six-month rotating eu presidency .
after french and dutch voters rejected it in 2005 , the british referendum was called off , saving blair from the embarrassing risk of a likely " no " at the ballot box .
" even the founding member states are more cautious about guarding what they perceive as their national interests and uncomfortable about the idea a superstate imposed on them from brussels , so the british are less on the outs than they used to be , " said julie smith , deputy director of the centre of international studies at cambridge university .
as blair 's finance minister , brown has said that he did not support the euro , because it was not in britain 's economic interest , although others say that the decision was purely political . " people are attached to the sterling .
it 's a symbol of british greatness , " said brady .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain and its eu partners are divided about turkey the one controversial issue that keeps britain aligned with the united states in opposition to its european partners is the country 's support for turkey 's membership in the eu , which has been opposed by sarkozy and merkel , although she has softened her stance since becoming chancellor .
britain , like the us , favors keeping the door open to turkey for geopolitical reasons , whereas france and germany see an influx of cheap labor and the problems of integrating a poor , predominantly muslim country .
the turkish issue also reflects the difference in the british vision of a broader confederation of nation states with the conflicting french desire for a deeper political integration and a tighter club .
relations with the united states are expected to be less divisive among the eu-3 , making it even possible for the uk to have good relations with both europe and the us at the same time , according to smith . " britain has never achieved the right balance .
tony blair tried , but gravitated too far towards america .
gordon brown may have a better chance of getting it right , " she said .

her vast imperial empire had disintegrated , and the " special relationship " with the united states , a partnership forged by a common heritage and the war , went through rough patches after the suez crisis in 1956 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartime leader winston churchill -lrb- right -rrb- chose the us over europe the anglo-french conspiracy to topple egypt ’ s gamal abdel nasser met with us hostility , shattering both british pretensions in the middle east and illusions about the loyalty of its closest ally .
america emerged as a superpower , while britain , like france , was reduced to a mid-sized nuclear power with a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
as an increasingly junior partner in the anglo-american relationship , she had to look for alliances elsewhere , and this meant reluctantly throwing in her lot with neighbors across the english channel .
that the uk was a latecomer in joining the european club in 1973 had to do with what french statesman charles de gaulle perceived as the conflict of her ties to the commonwealth and america .
de gaulle had used france ’ s veto to keep britain out of the european economic community -lrb- eec -rrb- , so when the uk finally did join 15 years after the founding of the treaty of rome , she joined a club where the rules had already been set by others .
hence britain 's relationship to europe has often been an adversarial one .
iron lady margaret thatcher had made britain a pariah state by demanding a rebate for the amount the uk was paying into eec coffers in farm subsidies and opting out of the community ’ s social charter .
in a decade of the current labour government , britain is the only major european union country which has not signed on to the border-free schengen accords , and not adopted the common currency , the euro . iraq war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair 's support of iraq war reinforced european view that britain favors the us but above all , it was outgoing prime minister tony blair ’ s staunch support for the american-led iraq war against overwhelming public sentiment that greatly diminished his premiership and reinforced the view among the french and germans that britain still favors the us over europe although gordon brown , blair 's almost certain successor on june 27 , was closely identified with the cabinet ’ s iraq policy , experts say that he is more likely to distance himself from the bush administration , yet seek closer trans-atlantic ties in conjunction with britain 's european partners .
" brown 's under public pressure not to have an exclusive relationship with the white house that was so damaging for britain under blair , " said hugo brady of the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank .
brady also sees a greater convergence of the eu 's big three - the uk , france and germany - in spite of brown 's reputation as a euro skeptic who as chancellor of the exchequer , britain 's finance minister , kept his country out of the euro zone . the fact that newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy has expressed admiration rather than contempt for " anglo-saxon " free markets also helps , and even germany ’ s angela merkel is a natural ally when it comes to her atlanticist leanings and advocacy of structural reforms that could bring further boost continental europe 's economy .
above all , all three leaders , who belong to europe 's post-war generation , are more pragmatic than their more ideologically motivated predecessors . eu relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain was off the hook after french and dutch voters rejected the eu constitution " brown is not passionate about europe , but because of it , he will be able to get further in brussels than someone so outwardly messianic about it like blair , " said brady , who explained that blair went too far with the british public in pushing for an eu constitution , which merkel wants to salvage before the end of germany 's six-month rotating eu presidency .
after french and dutch voters rejected it in 2005 , the british referendum was called off , saving blair from the embarrassing risk of a likely " no " at the ballot box .
" even the founding member states are more cautious about guarding what they perceive as their national interests and uncomfortable about the idea a superstate imposed on them from brussels , so the british are less on the outs than they used to be , " said julie smith , deputy director of the centre of international studies at cambridge university .
as blair 's finance minister , brown has said that he did not support the euro , because it was not in britain 's economic interest , although others say that the decision was purely political . " people are attached to the sterling .
it 's a symbol of british greatness , " said brady .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain and its eu partners are divided about turkey the one controversial issue that keeps britain aligned with the united states in opposition to its european partners is the country 's support for turkey 's membership in the eu , which has been opposed by sarkozy and merkel , although she has softened her stance since becoming chancellor .
britain , like the us , favors keeping the door open to turkey for geopolitical reasons , whereas france and germany see an influx of cheap labor and the problems of integrating a poor , predominantly muslim country .
the turkish issue also reflects the difference in the british vision of a broader confederation of nation states with the conflicting french desire for a deeper political integration and a tighter club .
relations with the united states are expected to be less divisive among the eu-3 , making it even possible for the uk to have good relations with both europe and the us at the same time , according to smith . " britain has never achieved the right balance .
tony blair tried , but gravitated too far towards america .
gordon brown may have a better chance of getting it right , " she said .
furthermore , according to brady , a humbled george w. bush in the twilight years of the american presidency is more likely to treat europe as an equal partner . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel calls for eu constitution push at mini summit chancellor angela merkel on saturday said germany needs the support of eu members , in particular the next two eu presidencies portugal and slovenia , if europe 's stalled constitution is to move forward .

after the sensible idea of promoting exercise comes the slightly mad idea of pricing fatty foods out of the average budget . being fingered as the fattest nation in europe has really got the germans ' oversized panties in a bunch .

scared that the germans ' reputation as sport-mad , health-conscious types is being consigned to the rubbish bin of history - along with all the pizza boxes and burger wrappers - german leaders are wracking their brains to come up with policies that help the populace shed their pounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all bought and paid for - but at what price ?
following on from the launch of the five-point action plan " fit instead of fat , " which the government hopes will promote more active lifestyles and encourage germans to pay more attention to healthy nutrition , the powers-that-be are now grabbing at more desperate straws .
the latest weapon in the battle of the bulge could be a " fat tax . "
in response to the damning report from the international association for the study of obesity , which found that 58.9 percent of german women are overweight and 75.4 percent of men tip the scales , the german government is proposing to increase the tax on foods that are high in calories .
the thinking behind this is that the more expensive the food , the less likely people will want to eat it .
therefore , by abstaining from eating high-calorie , high-cost food , germans will get thinner .
while there is more than a little bit of twisted logic in this thinking , the german government seems to be ignoring a couple of key factors which should potentially scupper the idea before the prices of chips and soft drinks even get the chance to go up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generation x-box needs to get out and exercise firstly , the idea that hiking the tax on a product will mean less people will buy it is historically flawed .

the same can almost certainly be said for certain favorite fatty foods .
secondly , the problem isn ’ t the amount of calories but what is done to burn them off .
this is why the " fit instead of fat " plan is a far better way of tackling the obesity problem .
germans are n't the fattest in europe because they eat more calories but because they move less .
this is particularly true of children .
so , rather than trying to price calorie-laden foods out of the common person 's budget , the german government should think again .
and if they really want to introduce bird-brained ideas to encourage people to lose weight , why not try a " sitting on your backside tax . "

after the sensible idea of promoting exercise comes the slightly mad idea of pricing fatty foods out of the average budget . being fingered as the fattest nation in europe has really got the germans ' oversized panties in a bunch .
the shock of outweighing the bulging brits as the continent ’ s portliest people has sent germany ’ s politicians into a crazed frenzy of legislative lunacy .
scared that the germans ' reputation as sport-mad , health-conscious types is being consigned to the rubbish bin of history - along with all the pizza boxes and burger wrappers - german leaders are wracking their brains to come up with policies that help the populace shed their pounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all bought and paid for - but at what price ?
following on from the launch of the five-point action plan " fit instead of fat , " which the government hopes will promote more active lifestyles and encourage germans to pay more attention to healthy nutrition , the powers-that-be are now grabbing at more desperate straws .
the latest weapon in the battle of the bulge could be a " fat tax . "
in response to the damning report from the international association for the study of obesity , which found that 58.9 percent of german women are overweight and 75.4 percent of men tip the scales , the german government is proposing to increase the tax on foods that are high in calories .
the thinking behind this is that the more expensive the food , the less likely people will want to eat it .
therefore , by abstaining from eating high-calorie , high-cost food , germans will get thinner .
while there is more than a little bit of twisted logic in this thinking , the german government seems to be ignoring a couple of key factors which should potentially scupper the idea before the prices of chips and soft drinks even get the chance to go up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generation x-box needs to get out and exercise firstly , the idea that hiking the tax on a product will mean less people will buy it is historically flawed .
the sales of cigarettes and alcohol have not suffered unduly through massive price increases over the years .
if someone wants to smoke or have a drink , they will , regardless of price .
the same can almost certainly be said for certain favorite fatty foods .
secondly , the problem isn ’ t the amount of calories but what is done to burn them off .
this is why the " fit instead of fat " plan is a far better way of tackling the obesity problem .
germans are n't the fattest in europe because they eat more calories but because they move less .
this is particularly true of children .
so , rather than trying to price calorie-laden foods out of the common person 's budget , the german government should think again .
and if they really want to introduce bird-brained ideas to encourage people to lose weight , why not try a " sitting on your backside tax . "

" we are all safer if we operate in a world in which intelligent use of information allows for more focussed efforts in determining who is a threat , " us secretary of homeland security michael chertoff said on monday after a meeting with european union lawmakers and officials .
the us and the 27-member eu are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
" we need to make sure that we have to provide the civilized world with appropriate tools to identify new security threats , " chertoff told a news briefing in brussels .
the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years .
data flow under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 34 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers .

chertoff said that the us wanted to make sure that a new agreement , which has to be clinched by the end of july , would ensure a " sufficient period of time " for the storage of data , arguing that terrorists were planning their plots over several years .
he also said that the us was working on new legislation under which foreign air passengers travelling to the us would be required to feed their data into an online database days ahead of the trip .
this new plan would enable the us " to inform people in advance if there is going to be a problem in allowing them to travel , " chertoff said .
kept for how long ?
eu justice commissioner franco frattini said that the two sides were still disagreeing on how long us authorities should be able to use data about passengers on transatlantic flights , when it should be destroyed and which government agencies should have access to the sensitive information .
the us also wants to pull data directly from airline computers , but european countries insist airlines must transmit the information .

" we are all safer if we operate in a world in which intelligent use of information allows for more focussed efforts in determining who is a threat , " us secretary of homeland security michael chertoff said on monday after a meeting with european union lawmakers and officials .
the us and the 27-member eu are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
" we need to make sure that we have to provide the civilized world with appropriate tools to identify new security threats , " chertoff told a news briefing in brussels .
the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years .
data flow under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 34 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines face fines if they fail to pass on information such as credit card numbers washington has warned that airlines which failed to share passenger data would face fines of up to $ 6,000 -lrb- $ 4,450 -rrb- per passenger and a possible loss of landing rights .
chertoff said that the us wanted to make sure that a new agreement , which has to be clinched by the end of july , would ensure a " sufficient period of time " for the storage of data , arguing that terrorists were planning their plots over several years .
he also said that the us was working on new legislation under which foreign air passengers travelling to the us would be required to feed their data into an online database days ahead of the trip .
this new plan would enable the us " to inform people in advance if there is going to be a problem in allowing them to travel , " chertoff said .
kept for how long ?
eu justice commissioner franco frattini said that the two sides were still disagreeing on how long us authorities should be able to use data about passengers on transatlantic flights , when it should be destroyed and which government agencies should have access to the sensitive information .
the us also wants to pull data directly from airline computers , but european countries insist airlines must transmit the information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the date agreement will affect flights bound for the us eu data protection officials have demanded that personal data sent to us authorities should be made anonymous and the identity of their owner only be revealed if the data matched a profile in a terrorist database .

minimum wage issues remain unresolved . during a cabinet meeting late monday night , leaders of the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- ended months of disagreement and agreed to create new child care provisions , part of a bid to catch up with other european countries on family politics and encourage mothers to work and reverse a declining birthrate . " there was a really large coalition formed for children and families , " family affairs minister ursula von der leyen told german public broadcaster ard on tuesday . coalition leaders punctuated the talks with the " breakthrough " on child care , according to spd head kurt beck .
christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , leader edmund stoiber emphasized that the panel also agreed on payments of 150 euros a month to families for raising children at home . " it is a sustainable compromise , " stoiber added .
states already accepted plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany lags behind european neighbors in day care last month , german states endorsed the plan that was adopted monday night , which calls for tripling the number of day care places for children under age three to 750,000 by 2013 .
the move was championed by von der leyen , a mother of seven who has stirred the ire of conservatives who see the provisions for child care as a break with traditional family values .
von der leyen 's proposal foresees the federal government covering one-third of the total 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.2 billion -rrb- in costs for expanding day care spaces for kids , but it is still unclear how federal , state and municipal governments plan to fund the expenses .
at present , germany lags behind its european neighbors in providing day care .
figures released by the government show 13.5 percent of children under three attend nursery schools , compared with the european average of 35 percent . easing burden on low-wage earners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctor , mother and politician von der leyen has ruffled her party 's feathers the coalition was unable to settle the divisive issue of implementing a minimum wage , with both beck and stoiber confirming that subject is still unresolved . labor unions want a minimum hourly wage of 7.50 euros to protect german workers from being undercut by cheap foreign labor , but merkel 's cdu says a new minimum wage would lead to job losses .
the cdu and spd , however , did agree on easing the burden on low-income earners .
those who earn between 800 euros and 1300 euros and also draw on social welfare benefits will no longer have to make social insurance contributions .
according to the federal labor agency , around half a million people in germany earn so little , that they must supplement their income with social welfare . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " germans and their politicians badly need a course correction " as germans discuss increasing childcare opportunities and women in the workforce , german performer désirée nick taks to dw-world.de about motherhood and climbing the career ladder in high heels .

" preparing for the summit has been difficult , " steinmeier said after his talks with putin .
" there have been a number of specific problems which we have not been able to solve over the past few weeks .
keeping silent about them does n't help , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , and putin tried to play down their differences " that is why i looked for an opportunity to meet with the russian president and the foreign minister .
that was a good decision .
we are now seeing the situation around the preparation for the ... summit in a much clearer way . "
speaking at the start of the meeting , putin said : " there are differences of opinion on how to solve specific problems , but both sides have a desire to solve them . "
putin met steinmeier straight after talks with us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who is also trying to soothe her country 's tense relations with russia .
a sense of doom with attempts to negotiate a key eu-russia partnership accord in tatters , there were few signs that germany 's intervention as head of the rotating presidency of the european union could salvage the summit .
russia 's foreign ministry accused poland of holding eu-russia relations " hostage " by blocking discussion of the partnership deal , which would govern key areas , including energy supplies , interfax news agency reported .
putin 's representative for eu relations , sergei yastrzhembsky , said there " is no real sense in discussing an accord on which we can not negotiate , " interfax reported .
poland has vetoed negotiations in retaliation for a russian ban on polish meat imports , while lithuania is now also threatening to veto the talks unless russia resumes oil deliveries to a refinery in the north of the baltic state .
warsaw made an additional demand on tuesday that the 27-member eu must pledge to protect the energy security of poland and other eu newcomers that rely on russian oil and gas .
deteriorating ties with west the disputes are fuelling escalating tensions between moscow and new eu member countries of formerly soviet-dominated central europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's ugly dispute over a memorial with estonia have soured moscow 's ties with the eu estonia is also locked in an ugly war of words with russia over the relocation of a soviet-era war memorial in the capital tallinn .
the baltic republic says that a halving of rail freight from russia this month amounts to unofficial economic sanctions .
eu-russia tensions , coupled with increasingly frayed us-russian ties , are contributing to a dramatic deterioration of east-west relations ahead of presidential election seasons in both russia and the united states .
moscow is already in a fierce confrontation with washington over us plans to deploy an anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic .
russia is also at loggerheads with the european union and united states over western-backed plans to give independence to kosovo , a province in russian ally serbia .
a " senseless " summit ahead of his moscow trip , steinmeier sounded pessimistic about the chances of any breakthroughs .
" i can not assure you 100 percent whether progress can be made on individual issues , but even if you do not know you must make an attempt , " he told reporters in brussels .
the german foreign policy chief even addressed rumors that the summit could be cancelled , saying " we have to bring an end to these discussions about whether or not the summit will take place . "
russia 's kommersant daily said steinmeier would be unable " to save the summit from collapse , " while the vedomosti daily called the samara meeting " senseless . "
" the eu-russian summit will either be a relative failure or a scandalous failure .
there will definitely be no negotiations on a partnership agreement .
the participants may not even be able to agree on a joint declaration , " the daily said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " russia wants pragmatic , business-like cooperation " russian and eu delegates meet this week as relations remain taught on issues like independence for kosovo , human rights and the us missile shield .

" after difficult negotiations , we have come up with a viable compromise on the roaming regulation , " said conservative austrian mp paul rübig , who led the talks at the parliament . the compromise still needs to be formalized , first by members states ' experts on wednesday , then by a vote before the european parliament in a plenary sitting next week , and finally by eu ministers on june 7 . " we now have a solid compromise on the table that can get backing from everyone , " said german economy minister michael glos , adding that " with a little goodwill we can get an agreement . "
under the agreement , rates for calls made while in other eu countries would be capped in the first year of application at 0.49 euros -lrb- $ 0.66 -rrb- a minute .
receiving calls could cost no more than 0.24 euros .
the ceiling for so-called roaming services would come down even lower in the second year , falling to 0.46 and 0.22 euros and then 0.43 and 0.19 euros in the third year . deal has mobile industry up in arms the european commission drew up the plans to regulate roaming rates last year .
it had found evidence of huge variations between operators ' prices , with some roaming calls costing up to six times those of local mobile calls . the package has the industry up in arms .
it has argued that fierce competition has already driven down prices and has been lobbying hard to get the plans watered down . even though the deal brought mobile phone users closer to cheaper roaming rates , the beuc european consumer association was left unimpressed by the compromise . " for us , the roaming rates remain high , " said spokesman dominique forrest .
" it 's a first step , but as it is on the table , it 's not enough . " the french consumer association ufc-que choisir was even more critical of the agreement , charging that it still allowed operators to make huge profits on the back of mobile phone users .
" the compromise gives in to the current excuse for a market which allows operators to have huge margins on calls received or made while abroad even though the cost is close to that for national calls , " it said in a statement .
consumers ca n't benefit from deal on their summer holidays although the new regulations could go into effect as early as mid-july , according to a diplomat , mobile phone users will not be able to benefit from the new rates until after the summer holiday period . the european commission had hoped that the new rates would be in place by the summer holidays . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu panel backs plans to cap mobile roaming rates european union plans to cap the price operators can charge mobile phone users while abroad cleared a key hurdle on thursday when a panel in the european parliament backed the package .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : development aid to africa tops g8 agenda " the lack of a global response to aids is a catastrophe " europe rushes to stem flood of cocaine coming through africa experts question g8 's emphasis on africa g8 development ministers seek ways to meet african aid goals development aid -pipe- 15.05.2007 rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " people expect germans to keep their promises , " bono said tuesday in berlin irish rock stars bono and bob geldof on tuesday accused g8 nations of falling far behind on pledges of aid to africa and put pressure on germany as current head of the club to donate nearly one billion dollars . bob geldof said german chancellor angela merkel needed to channel a minimum of 700 million euros -lrb- $ 947 million -rrb- in aid to africa this year in order to meet a commitment signed by her predecessor gerhard schröder at the g8 summit in gleneagles , scotland in 2005 .
" we are only asking what the politicians promised , not one euro more , " the founder of live aid said at a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" schröder signed in the name of the german people , if merkel betrays the pride of germany , then she kills people 12 miles south of europe in africa , " he said .
german music star herbert grönemeyer , who will sing at a major concert in rostock on june 7 along with bono and other musicians , said " politicians should just do their job and keep their promises . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geldof in younger years at a london live aid concert for africa the calls come just weeks before merkel hosts fellow leaders from the group of eight most industrialized nations at a summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm on june 6-8 .
germany currently holds the eu presidency .
bono said : " it is important that the g8 is taking place in germany because people expect germans to keep their promises . "
" if you break your promise , then everybody else will abandon ship , " he said .
report on progress geldof and the u2 frontman unveiled a report by data - a watchdog monitoring first-world help to africa which the two founded in 2002 - on the progress g8 nations have made in fulfilling their pledges made at gleneagles to collectively increase aid to africa by 25 billion dollars by 2010 .
the data report found that only britain and japan were doing their share to meet that target .
together the g8 nations stepped up development aid by $ 2.3 billion between 2004 and 2006 , but this is less than half of what they needed to give to be on track to meeting their 2010 deadline .
" it is less than half of what should have been done , " said jamie drummond of data .
" to get back on track in 2007 , they would have to increase aid by $ 6.4 billion , but so far there is at best a third of this in the pipeline . "
fears of violence german authorities fear that up to 100,000 anti-globalization protestors could target the g8 summit , and bono warned that failing to honor the group 's promises to africa could enrage activists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's grönemeyer has lent his voice to helping africa he said that although he was " opposed " to protestors resorting to violence , his own visits to poor countries had made him angry at the way the world neglected africa .
" i want to say that i relate to their rage , i feel it myself when i walk into a hospital and see people queuing up to die . "
merkel has promised to use the summit to build on efforts to help africa undertaken at gleneagles in 2005 .
on the weekend , merkel devoted her weekly podcast entirely to africa .
she said she wants the leaders of the group of eight industrialized nations to keep their earlier promises for increased development funding .
she said the richest nations in the world can really make a difference .
failure to help africa , she said , would come home to roost in the industrialized world .
" if we do n't care about the fate of our neighbors in this globalized world , we will one day see the problems arriving at our doorsteps , " she said .
" the migration of refugees can only be prevented if we help resolve the problems in their countries .
and we must do it now , " she stressed . dw staff with agency reports -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are the right countries sitting at the g8 table ?
g8 stands for the world 's leading eight industrial nations .

" we are all safer if we operate in a world in which intelligent use of information allows for more focussed efforts in determining who is a threat , " us secretary of homeland security michael chertoff said on monday after a meeting with european union lawmakers and officials .
the us and the 27-member eu are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
" we need to make sure that we have to provide the civilized world with appropriate tools to identify new security threats , " chertoff told a news briefing in brussels .
the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years .
data flow under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 34 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers .

chertoff said that the us wanted to make sure that a new agreement , which has to be clinched by the end of july , would ensure a " sufficient period of time " for the storage of data , arguing that terrorists were planning their plots over several years .
he also said that the us was working on new legislation under which foreign air passengers travelling to the us would be required to feed their data into an online database days ahead of the trip .
this new plan would enable the us " to inform people in advance if there is going to be a problem in allowing them to travel , " chertoff said .
kept for how long ?
eu justice commissioner franco frattini said that the two sides were still disagreeing on how long us authorities should be able to use data about passengers on transatlantic flights , when it should be destroyed and which government agencies should have access to the sensitive information .
the us also wants to pull data directly from airline computers , but european countries insist airlines must transmit the information .

they have also said that a new deal on passenger data-sharing could be challenged by eu national courts .
the eu and the us are increasingly at odds over how to reconcile civil liberties with the us-led fight against terrorism .

" we are all safer if we operate in a world in which intelligent use of information allows for more focussed efforts in determining who is a threat , " us secretary of homeland security michael chertoff said on monday after a meeting with european union lawmakers and officials .
the us and the 27-member eu are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
" we need to make sure that we have to provide the civilized world with appropriate tools to identify new security threats , " chertoff told a news briefing in brussels .
the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years .
data flow under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 34 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers .

chertoff said that the us wanted to make sure that a new agreement , which has to be clinched by the end of july , would ensure a " sufficient period of time " for the storage of data , arguing that terrorists were planning their plots over several years .
he also said that the us was working on new legislation under which foreign air passengers travelling to the us would be required to feed their data into an online database days ahead of the trip .
this new plan would enable the us " to inform people in advance if there is going to be a problem in allowing them to travel , " chertoff said .
kept for how long ?
eu justice commissioner franco frattini said that the two sides were still disagreeing on how long us authorities should be able to use data about passengers on transatlantic flights , when it should be destroyed and which government agencies should have access to the sensitive information .
the us also wants to pull data directly from airline computers , but european countries insist airlines must transmit the information .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 15.05.2007 germany considers fat tax in battle of the bulge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adding a tax to high calorie foods may lead to binge buying before the prices go up the german government will consider all options in the fight against obesity , however bizarre .
after the sensible idea of promoting exercise comes the slightly mad idea of pricing fatty foods out of the average budget . being fingered as the fattest nation in europe has really got the germans ' oversized panties in a bunch .
the shock of outweighing the bulging brits as the continent ’ s portliest people has sent germany ’ s politicians into a crazed frenzy of legislative lunacy .
scared that the germans ' reputation as sport-mad , health-conscious types is being consigned to the rubbish bin of history - along with all the pizza boxes and burger wrappers - german leaders are wracking their brains to come up with policies that help the populace shed their pounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all bought and paid for - but at what price ?
following on from the launch of the five-point action plan " fit instead of fat , " which the government hopes will promote more active lifestyles and encourage germans to pay more attention to healthy nutrition , the powers-that-be are now grabbing at more desperate straws .
the latest weapon in the battle of the bulge could be a " fat tax . "
in response to the damning report from the international association for the study of obesity , which found that 58.9 percent of german women are overweight and 75.4 percent of men tip the scales , the german government is proposing to increase the tax on foods that are high in calories .
the thinking behind this is that the more expensive the food , the less likely people will want to eat it .
therefore , by abstaining from eating high-calorie , high-cost food , germans will get thinner .
while there is more than a little bit of twisted logic in this thinking , the german government seems to be ignoring a couple of key factors which should potentially scupper the idea before the prices of chips and soft drinks even get the chance to go up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generation x-box needs to get out and exercise firstly , the idea that hiking the tax on a product will mean less people will buy it is historically flawed .
the sales of cigarettes and alcohol have not suffered unduly through massive price increases over the years .
if someone wants to smoke or have a drink , they will , regardless of price .
the same can almost certainly be said for certain favorite fatty foods .
secondly , the problem isn ’ t the amount of calories but what is done to burn them off .
this is why the " fit instead of fat " plan is a far better way of tackling the obesity problem .
germans are n't the fattest in europe because they eat more calories but because they move less .
this is particularly true of children .
so , rather than trying to price calorie-laden foods out of the common person 's budget , the german government should think again .
and if they really want to introduce bird-brained ideas to encourage people to lose weight , why not try a " sitting on your backside tax . "
people will be less willing to sit around gaining weight if it 's taking precious cigarette and beer money away from them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government wants germans to get fit , not fat in response to a recent study which showed that germans are fatter than all other europeans , the german government called wednesday for concrete steps to wage a nationwide battle of the bulge .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : blair bows out blair endorses gordon brown as candidate for british pm european press review : " it 's blair 's fault britain is relieved " gordon brown , the next man in number 10 praise floods in for blair from europe , us european union -pipe- 15.05.2007 brown 's britain : striking an eu-us balance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : together with european partners , a more equal partnership with us under brown passionately pro-european and atlanticist , tony blair sought good relations with both the eu and the us , although his pragmatic successor gordon brown is more likely to achieve both . from winston churchill to tony blair , every post-war prime minister has been consumed by a foreign policy that has boiled down to the choice between europe and the united states while trying to establish an independent british role in the world .
although britain emerged as an allied victor from the ashes of world war ii , some say she won the war , but lost the peace .
her vast imperial empire had disintegrated , and the " special relationship " with the united states , a partnership forged by a common heritage and the war , went through rough patches after the suez crisis in 1956 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartime leader winston churchill -lrb- right -rrb- chose the us over europe the anglo-french conspiracy to topple egypt ’ s gamal abdel nasser met with us hostility , shattering both british pretensions in the middle east and illusions about the loyalty of its closest ally .
america emerged as a superpower , while britain , like france , was reduced to a mid-sized nuclear power with a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
as an increasingly junior partner in the anglo-american relationship , she had to look for alliances elsewhere , and this meant reluctantly throwing in her lot with neighbors across the english channel .
that the uk was a latecomer in joining the european club in 1973 had to do with what french statesman charles de gaulle perceived as the conflict of her ties to the commonwealth and america .
de gaulle had used france ’ s veto to keep britain out of the european economic community -lrb- eec -rrb- , so when the uk finally did join 15 years after the founding of the treaty of rome , she joined a club where the rules had already been set by others .
hence britain 's relationship to europe has often been an adversarial one .
iron lady margaret thatcher had made britain a pariah state by demanding a rebate for the amount the uk was paying into eec coffers in farm subsidies and opting out of the community ’ s social charter .
in a decade of the current labour government , britain is the only major european union country which has not signed on to the border-free schengen accords , and not adopted the common currency , the euro . iraq war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair 's support of iraq war reinforced european view that britain favors the us but above all , it was outgoing prime minister tony blair ’ s staunch support for the american-led iraq war against overwhelming public sentiment that greatly diminished his premiership and reinforced the view among the french and germans that britain still favors the us over europe although gordon brown , blair 's almost certain successor on june 27 , was closely identified with the cabinet ’ s iraq policy , experts say that he is more likely to distance himself from the bush administration , yet seek closer trans-atlantic ties in conjunction with britain 's european partners .
" brown 's under public pressure not to have an exclusive relationship with the white house that was so damaging for britain under blair , " said hugo brady of the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank .
brady also sees a greater convergence of the eu 's big three - the uk , france and germany - in spite of brown 's reputation as a euro skeptic who as chancellor of the exchequer , britain 's finance minister , kept his country out of the euro zone . the fact that newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy has expressed admiration rather than contempt for " anglo-saxon " free markets also helps , and even germany ’ s angela merkel is a natural ally when it comes to her atlanticist leanings and advocacy of structural reforms that could bring further boost continental europe 's economy .
above all , all three leaders , who belong to europe 's post-war generation , are more pragmatic than their more ideologically motivated predecessors . eu relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain was off the hook after french and dutch voters rejected the eu constitution " brown is not passionate about europe , but because of it , he will be able to get further in brussels than someone so outwardly messianic about it like blair , " said brady , who explained that blair went too far with the british public in pushing for an eu constitution , which merkel wants to salvage before the end of germany 's six-month rotating eu presidency .
after french and dutch voters rejected it in 2005 , the british referendum was called off , saving blair from the embarrassing risk of a likely " no " at the ballot box .
" even the founding member states are more cautious about guarding what they perceive as their national interests and uncomfortable about the idea a superstate imposed on them from brussels , so the british are less on the outs than they used to be , " said julie smith , deputy director of the centre of international studies at cambridge university .
as blair 's finance minister , brown has said that he did not support the euro , because it was not in britain 's economic interest , although others say that the decision was purely political . " people are attached to the sterling .
it 's a symbol of british greatness , " said brady .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain and its eu partners are divided about turkey the one controversial issue that keeps britain aligned with the united states in opposition to its european partners is the country 's support for turkey 's membership in the eu , which has been opposed by sarkozy and merkel , although she has softened her stance since becoming chancellor .
britain , like the us , favors keeping the door open to turkey for geopolitical reasons , whereas france and germany see an influx of cheap labor and the problems of integrating a poor , predominantly muslim country .
the turkish issue also reflects the difference in the british vision of a broader confederation of nation states with the conflicting french desire for a deeper political integration and a tighter club .
relations with the united states are expected to be less divisive among the eu-3 , making it even possible for the uk to have good relations with both europe and the us at the same time , according to smith . " britain has never achieved the right balance .
tony blair tried , but gravitated too far towards america .
gordon brown may have a better chance of getting it right , " she said .
furthermore , according to brady , a humbled george w. bush in the twilight years of the american presidency is more likely to treat europe as an equal partner . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel calls for eu constitution push at mini summit chancellor angela merkel on saturday said germany needs the support of eu members , in particular the next two eu presidencies portugal and slovenia , if europe 's stalled constitution is to move forward .

although britain emerged as an allied victor from the ashes of world war ii , some say she won the war , but lost the peace .
her vast imperial empire had disintegrated , and the " special relationship " with the united states , a partnership forged by a common heritage and the war , went through rough patches after the suez crisis in 1956 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wartime leader winston churchill -lrb- right -rrb- chose the us over europe the anglo-french conspiracy to topple egypt ’ s gamal abdel nasser met with us hostility , shattering both british pretensions in the middle east and illusions about the loyalty of its closest ally .
america emerged as a superpower , while britain , like france , was reduced to a mid-sized nuclear power with a permanent seat on the united nations security council .
as an increasingly junior partner in the anglo-american relationship , she had to look for alliances elsewhere , and this meant reluctantly throwing in her lot with neighbors across the english channel .
that the uk was a latecomer in joining the european club in 1973 had to do with what french statesman charles de gaulle perceived as the conflict of her ties to the commonwealth and america .
de gaulle had used france ’ s veto to keep britain out of the european economic community -lrb- eec -rrb- , so when the uk finally did join 15 years after the founding of the treaty of rome , she joined a club where the rules had already been set by others .
hence britain 's relationship to europe has often been an adversarial one .
iron lady margaret thatcher had made britain a pariah state by demanding a rebate for the amount the uk was paying into eec coffers in farm subsidies and opting out of the community ’ s social charter .
in a decade of the current labour government , britain is the only major european union country which has not signed on to the border-free schengen accords , and not adopted the common currency , the euro . iraq war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair 's support of iraq war reinforced european view that britain favors the us but above all , it was outgoing prime minister tony blair ’ s staunch support for the american-led iraq war against overwhelming public sentiment that greatly diminished his premiership and reinforced the view among the french and germans that britain still favors the us over europe although gordon brown , blair 's almost certain successor on june 27 , was closely identified with the cabinet ’ s iraq policy , experts say that he is more likely to distance himself from the bush administration , yet seek closer trans-atlantic ties in conjunction with britain 's european partners .
" brown 's under public pressure not to have an exclusive relationship with the white house that was so damaging for britain under blair , " said hugo brady of the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank .
brady also sees a greater convergence of the eu 's big three - the uk , france and germany - in spite of brown 's reputation as a euro skeptic who as chancellor of the exchequer , britain 's finance minister , kept his country out of the euro zone . the fact that newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy has expressed admiration rather than contempt for " anglo-saxon " free markets also helps , and even germany ’ s angela merkel is a natural ally when it comes to her atlanticist leanings and advocacy of structural reforms that could bring further boost continental europe 's economy .
above all , all three leaders , who belong to europe 's post-war generation , are more pragmatic than their more ideologically motivated predecessors . eu relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain was off the hook after french and dutch voters rejected the eu constitution " brown is not passionate about europe , but because of it , he will be able to get further in brussels than someone so outwardly messianic about it like blair , " said brady , who explained that blair went too far with the british public in pushing for an eu constitution , which merkel wants to salvage before the end of germany 's six-month rotating eu presidency .
after french and dutch voters rejected it in 2005 , the british referendum was called off , saving blair from the embarrassing risk of a likely " no " at the ballot box .
" even the founding member states are more cautious about guarding what they perceive as their national interests and uncomfortable about the idea a superstate imposed on them from brussels , so the british are less on the outs than they used to be , " said julie smith , deputy director of the centre of international studies at cambridge university .
as blair 's finance minister , brown has said that he did not support the euro , because it was not in britain 's economic interest , although others say that the decision was purely political . " people are attached to the sterling .
it 's a symbol of british greatness , " said brady .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain and its eu partners are divided about turkey the one controversial issue that keeps britain aligned with the united states in opposition to its european partners is the country 's support for turkey 's membership in the eu , which has been opposed by sarkozy and merkel , although she has softened her stance since becoming chancellor .
britain , like the us , favors keeping the door open to turkey for geopolitical reasons , whereas france and germany see an influx of cheap labor and the problems of integrating a poor , predominantly muslim country .
the turkish issue also reflects the difference in the british vision of a broader confederation of nation states with the conflicting french desire for a deeper political integration and a tighter club .
relations with the united states are expected to be less divisive among the eu-3 , making it even possible for the uk to have good relations with both europe and the us at the same time , according to smith . " britain has never achieved the right balance .
tony blair tried , but gravitated too far towards america .
gordon brown may have a better chance of getting it right , " she said .
furthermore , according to brady , a humbled george w. bush in the twilight years of the american presidency is more likely to treat europe as an equal partner . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel calls for eu constitution push at mini summit chancellor angela merkel on saturday said germany needs the support of eu members , in particular the next two eu presidencies portugal and slovenia , if europe 's stalled constitution is to move forward .

iron lady margaret thatcher had made britain a pariah state by demanding a rebate for the amount the uk was paying into eec coffers in farm subsidies and opting out of the community ’ s social charter .
in a decade of the current labour government , britain is the only major european union country which has not signed on to the border-free schengen accords , and not adopted the common currency , the euro . iraq war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair 's support of iraq war reinforced european view that britain favors the us but above all , it was outgoing prime minister tony blair ’ s staunch support for the american-led iraq war against overwhelming public sentiment that greatly diminished his premiership and reinforced the view among the french and germans that britain still favors the us over europe although gordon brown , blair 's almost certain successor on june 27 , was closely identified with the cabinet ’ s iraq policy , experts say that he is more likely to distance himself from the bush administration , yet seek closer trans-atlantic ties in conjunction with britain 's european partners .
" brown 's under public pressure not to have an exclusive relationship with the white house that was so damaging for britain under blair , " said hugo brady of the centre for european reform , a london-based think tank .
brady also sees a greater convergence of the eu 's big three - the uk , france and germany - in spite of brown 's reputation as a euro skeptic who as chancellor of the exchequer , britain 's finance minister , kept his country out of the euro zone . the fact that newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy has expressed admiration rather than contempt for " anglo-saxon " free markets also helps , and even germany ’ s angela merkel is a natural ally when it comes to her atlanticist leanings and advocacy of structural reforms that could bring further boost continental europe 's economy .
above all , all three leaders , who belong to europe 's post-war generation , are more pragmatic than their more ideologically motivated predecessors . eu relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain was off the hook after french and dutch voters rejected the eu constitution " brown is not passionate about europe , but because of it , he will be able to get further in brussels than someone so outwardly messianic about it like blair , " said brady , who explained that blair went too far with the british public in pushing for an eu constitution , which merkel wants to salvage before the end of germany 's six-month rotating eu presidency .
after french and dutch voters rejected it in 2005 , the british referendum was called off , saving blair from the embarrassing risk of a likely " no " at the ballot box .
" even the founding member states are more cautious about guarding what they perceive as their national interests and uncomfortable about the idea a superstate imposed on them from brussels , so the british are less on the outs than they used to be , " said julie smith , deputy director of the centre of international studies at cambridge university .
as blair 's finance minister , brown has said that he did not support the euro , because it was not in britain 's economic interest , although others say that the decision was purely political . " people are attached to the sterling .
it 's a symbol of british greatness , " said brady .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain and its eu partners are divided about turkey the one controversial issue that keeps britain aligned with the united states in opposition to its european partners is the country 's support for turkey 's membership in the eu , which has been opposed by sarkozy and merkel , although she has softened her stance since becoming chancellor .
britain , like the us , favors keeping the door open to turkey for geopolitical reasons , whereas france and germany see an influx of cheap labor and the problems of integrating a poor , predominantly muslim country .
the turkish issue also reflects the difference in the british vision of a broader confederation of nation states with the conflicting french desire for a deeper political integration and a tighter club .
relations with the united states are expected to be less divisive among the eu-3 , making it even possible for the uk to have good relations with both europe and the us at the same time , according to smith . " britain has never achieved the right balance .
tony blair tried , but gravitated too far towards america .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 15.05.2007 germany considers fat tax in battle of the bulge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adding a tax to high calorie foods may lead to binge buying before the prices go up the german government will consider all options in the fight against obesity , however bizarre .
after the sensible idea of promoting exercise comes the slightly mad idea of pricing fatty foods out of the average budget . being fingered as the fattest nation in europe has really got the germans ' oversized panties in a bunch .
the shock of outweighing the bulging brits as the continent ’ s portliest people has sent germany ’ s politicians into a crazed frenzy of legislative lunacy .
scared that the germans ' reputation as sport-mad , health-conscious types is being consigned to the rubbish bin of history - along with all the pizza boxes and burger wrappers - german leaders are wracking their brains to come up with policies that help the populace shed their pounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all bought and paid for - but at what price ?
following on from the launch of the five-point action plan " fit instead of fat , " which the government hopes will promote more active lifestyles and encourage germans to pay more attention to healthy nutrition , the powers-that-be are now grabbing at more desperate straws .
the latest weapon in the battle of the bulge could be a " fat tax . "
in response to the damning report from the international association for the study of obesity , which found that 58.9 percent of german women are overweight and 75.4 percent of men tip the scales , the german government is proposing to increase the tax on foods that are high in calories .
the thinking behind this is that the more expensive the food , the less likely people will want to eat it .
therefore , by abstaining from eating high-calorie , high-cost food , germans will get thinner .
while there is more than a little bit of twisted logic in this thinking , the german government seems to be ignoring a couple of key factors which should potentially scupper the idea before the prices of chips and soft drinks even get the chance to go up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generation x-box needs to get out and exercise firstly , the idea that hiking the tax on a product will mean less people will buy it is historically flawed .
the sales of cigarettes and alcohol have not suffered unduly through massive price increases over the years .
if someone wants to smoke or have a drink , they will , regardless of price .
the same can almost certainly be said for certain favorite fatty foods .
secondly , the problem isn ’ t the amount of calories but what is done to burn them off .
this is why the " fit instead of fat " plan is a far better way of tackling the obesity problem .
germans are n't the fattest in europe because they eat more calories but because they move less .
this is particularly true of children .
so , rather than trying to price calorie-laden foods out of the common person 's budget , the german government should think again .
and if they really want to introduce bird-brained ideas to encourage people to lose weight , why not try a " sitting on your backside tax . "
people will be less willing to sit around gaining weight if it 's taking precious cigarette and beer money away from them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government wants germans to get fit , not fat in response to a recent study which showed that germans are fatter than all other europeans , the german government called wednesday for concrete steps to wage a nationwide battle of the bulge .

putin met steinmeier straight after talks with us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who is also trying to soothe her country 's tense relations with russia .
a sense of doom with attempts to negotiate a key eu-russia partnership accord in tatters , there were few signs that germany 's intervention as head of the rotating presidency of the european union could salvage the summit .
russia 's foreign ministry accused poland of holding eu-russia relations " hostage " by blocking discussion of the partnership deal , which would govern key areas , including energy supplies , interfax news agency reported .
putin 's representative for eu relations , sergei yastrzhembsky , said there " is no real sense in discussing an accord on which we can not negotiate , " interfax reported .
poland has vetoed negotiations in retaliation for a russian ban on polish meat imports , while lithuania is now also threatening to veto the talks unless russia resumes oil deliveries to a refinery in the north of the baltic state .
warsaw made an additional demand on tuesday that the 27-member eu must pledge to protect the energy security of poland and other eu newcomers that rely on russian oil and gas .
deteriorating ties with west the disputes are fuelling escalating tensions between moscow and new eu member countries of formerly soviet-dominated central europe .

the baltic republic says that a halving of rail freight from russia this month amounts to unofficial economic sanctions .
eu-russia tensions , coupled with increasingly frayed us-russian ties , are contributing to a dramatic deterioration of east-west relations ahead of presidential election seasons in both russia and the united states .
moscow is already in a fierce confrontation with washington over us plans to deploy an anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic .
russia is also at loggerheads with the european union and united states over western-backed plans to give independence to kosovo , a province in russian ally serbia .
a " senseless " summit ahead of his moscow trip , steinmeier sounded pessimistic about the chances of any breakthroughs .
" i can not assure you 100 percent whether progress can be made on individual issues , but even if you do not know you must make an attempt , " he told reporters in brussels .
the german foreign policy chief even addressed rumors that the summit could be cancelled , saying " we have to bring an end to these discussions about whether or not the summit will take place . "
russia 's kommersant daily said steinmeier would be unable " to save the summit from collapse , " while the vedomosti daily called the samara meeting " senseless . "
" the eu-russian summit will either be a relative failure or a scandalous failure .
there will definitely be no negotiations on a partnership agreement .
the participants may not even be able to agree on a joint declaration , " the daily said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " russia wants pragmatic , business-like cooperation " russian and eu delegates meet this week as relations remain taught on issues like independence for kosovo , human rights and the us missile shield .

after the sensible idea of promoting exercise comes the slightly mad idea of pricing fatty foods out of the average budget . being fingered as the fattest nation in europe has really got the germans ' oversized panties in a bunch .
the shock of outweighing the bulging brits as the continent ’ s portliest people has sent germany ’ s politicians into a crazed frenzy of legislative lunacy .
scared that the germans ' reputation as sport-mad , health-conscious types is being consigned to the rubbish bin of history - along with all the pizza boxes and burger wrappers - german leaders are wracking their brains to come up with policies that help the populace shed their pounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all bought and paid for - but at what price ?
following on from the launch of the five-point action plan " fit instead of fat , " which the government hopes will promote more active lifestyles and encourage germans to pay more attention to healthy nutrition , the powers-that-be are now grabbing at more desperate straws .
the latest weapon in the battle of the bulge could be a " fat tax . "
in response to the damning report from the international association for the study of obesity , which found that 58.9 percent of german women are overweight and 75.4 percent of men tip the scales , the german government is proposing to increase the tax on foods that are high in calories .
the thinking behind this is that the more expensive the food , the less likely people will want to eat it .
therefore , by abstaining from eating high-calorie , high-cost food , germans will get thinner .
while there is more than a little bit of twisted logic in this thinking , the german government seems to be ignoring a couple of key factors which should potentially scupper the idea before the prices of chips and soft drinks even get the chance to go up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generation x-box needs to get out and exercise firstly , the idea that hiking the tax on a product will mean less people will buy it is historically flawed .
the sales of cigarettes and alcohol have not suffered unduly through massive price increases over the years .
if someone wants to smoke or have a drink , they will , regardless of price .
the same can almost certainly be said for certain favorite fatty foods .
secondly , the problem isn ’ t the amount of calories but what is done to burn them off .
this is why the " fit instead of fat " plan is a far better way of tackling the obesity problem .
germans are n't the fattest in europe because they eat more calories but because they move less .
this is particularly true of children .
so , rather than trying to price calorie-laden foods out of the common person 's budget , the german government should think again .
and if they really want to introduce bird-brained ideas to encourage people to lose weight , why not try a " sitting on your backside tax . "
people will be less willing to sit around gaining weight if it 's taking precious cigarette and beer money away from them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government wants germans to get fit , not fat in response to a recent study which showed that germans are fatter than all other europeans , the german government called wednesday for concrete steps to wage a nationwide battle of the bulge .

after the sensible idea of promoting exercise comes the slightly mad idea of pricing fatty foods out of the average budget . being fingered as the fattest nation in europe has really got the germans ' oversized panties in a bunch .
the shock of outweighing the bulging brits as the continent ’ s portliest people has sent germany ’ s politicians into a crazed frenzy of legislative lunacy .
scared that the germans ' reputation as sport-mad , health-conscious types is being consigned to the rubbish bin of history - along with all the pizza boxes and burger wrappers - german leaders are wracking their brains to come up with policies that help the populace shed their pounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all bought and paid for - but at what price ?
following on from the launch of the five-point action plan " fit instead of fat , " which the government hopes will promote more active lifestyles and encourage germans to pay more attention to healthy nutrition , the powers-that-be are now grabbing at more desperate straws .
the latest weapon in the battle of the bulge could be a " fat tax . "
in response to the damning report from the international association for the study of obesity , which found that 58.9 percent of german women are overweight and 75.4 percent of men tip the scales , the german government is proposing to increase the tax on foods that are high in calories .
the thinking behind this is that the more expensive the food , the less likely people will want to eat it .
therefore , by abstaining from eating high-calorie , high-cost food , germans will get thinner .
while there is more than a little bit of twisted logic in this thinking , the german government seems to be ignoring a couple of key factors which should potentially scupper the idea before the prices of chips and soft drinks even get the chance to go up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generation x-box needs to get out and exercise firstly , the idea that hiking the tax on a product will mean less people will buy it is historically flawed .
the sales of cigarettes and alcohol have not suffered unduly through massive price increases over the years .
if someone wants to smoke or have a drink , they will , regardless of price .
the same can almost certainly be said for certain favorite fatty foods .
secondly , the problem isn ’ t the amount of calories but what is done to burn them off .
this is why the " fit instead of fat " plan is a far better way of tackling the obesity problem .
germans are n't the fattest in europe because they eat more calories but because they move less .
this is particularly true of children .
so , rather than trying to price calorie-laden foods out of the common person 's budget , the german government should think again .
and if they really want to introduce bird-brained ideas to encourage people to lose weight , why not try a " sitting on your backside tax . "
people will be less willing to sit around gaining weight if it 's taking precious cigarette and beer money away from them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government wants germans to get fit , not fat in response to a recent study which showed that germans are fatter than all other europeans , the german government called wednesday for concrete steps to wage a nationwide battle of the bulge .
-lrb- 09.05.2007 -rrb- topping the eu fat stats , germany plans anti-obesity drive after a new study showed that germans are fatter than other europeans , germany 's minister for food and agriculture is campaigning for better nutrition and restrictions on the advertising of sugar-laden foods .
-lrb- 20.04.2007 -rrb- the fat years are not over the annual report from eu statistics department eurostat has thrown up a few surprises .
the most eye-opening statistic is the new shared interest german guys and british girls have in common : being fat .
-lrb- 21.02.2007 -rrb- cooking course takes a bite out of obesity in germany western populations are getting fatter , due to too little exercise and too much fast food .
socially disadvantaged families are particularly prone to such diets .
but a cooking course in hamburg hopes to change that .

" there was a really large coalition formed for children and families , " family affairs minister ursula von der leyen told german public broadcaster ard on tuesday . coalition leaders punctuated the talks with the " breakthrough " on child care , according to spd head kurt beck .
christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , leader edmund stoiber emphasized that the panel also agreed on payments of 150 euros a month to families for raising children at home . " it is a sustainable compromise , " stoiber added .
states already accepted plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany lags behind european neighbors in day care last month , german states endorsed the plan that was adopted monday night , which calls for tripling the number of day care places for children under age three to 750,000 by 2013 .
the move was championed by von der leyen , a mother of seven who has stirred the ire of conservatives who see the provisions for child care as a break with traditional family values .
von der leyen 's proposal foresees the federal government covering one-third of the total 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.2 billion -rrb- in costs for expanding day care spaces for kids , but it is still unclear how federal , state and municipal governments plan to fund the expenses .

the cdu and spd , however , did agree on easing the burden on low-income earners .
those who earn between 800 euros and 1300 euros and also draw on social welfare benefits will no longer have to make social insurance contributions .

the move was championed by von der leyen , a mother of seven who has stirred the ire of conservatives who see the provisions for child care as a break with traditional family values .
von der leyen 's proposal foresees the federal government covering one-third of the total 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.2 billion -rrb- in costs for expanding day care spaces for kids , but it is still unclear how federal , state and municipal governments plan to fund the expenses .

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nine-year , trans-atlantic marriage of automakers daimler and chrysler has come to an end and it 's probably best that way for all involved , said deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky . what daimlerchrysler 's former chief jürgen schrempp once called a " marriage from heaven " has now , after nine years , ended in a mundane divorce .
and it 's probably the best thing that could have happened - for both companies .
even though they will remain connected for years to come in joint technical projects and daimler 's minor stake in chrysler , they still have better chances going it alone in the automotive business than being involved in a relationship designed along the lines of jürgen schrempp 's vision of a welt ag or world inc .
that dream quickly revealed itself to be a mere delusion of grandeur .
schadenfreude inappropriate the consequences of that are immense , and feeling a sense of schadenfreude would be inappropriate .
after all , corporate strategies that have gotten out of control have once again caused millions of euros and many jobs to be lost .
daimler managers , with current chief executive dieter zetsche leading them at the time , cut 26,000 jobs at chrysler .
now on its own , chrysler will again have to lay off another 13,000 employees .
and , the way these things work when jobs are cut to increase profitability , what accompanied the announcement of the daimlerchrysler split was a true firework display on the stock market - not unlike the one that followed the news of schrempp 's disreputable departure .
eyes bigger than mouth now it 's official : daimler bit off more than it could chew when it purchased chrysler .
first , there were not enough managers to restructure the already crippled company in the united states ; then , it seemed that money was becoming scarce .
that is when a split becomes mandatory .
the decisive majority-shareholder at chrysler will be the private equity group cerberus capital management .
it will make a capital contribution of 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- - not as a purchase price , it should be noted , but in return for an 80.1-percent equity interest in chrysler .
in order to shed itself of chrysler , daimler must also throw in 1.2 billion euros .
chrysler must now rely on its own strengths .
in addition to having to rid itself of now hard-to-sell pick-up trucks and suv 's , it must also market fuel-efficient small cars since the american conscience has also changed . neither chrysler , nor general motors nor ford , was prepared for that .
cerberus managers may now put a lot of pressure on chrysler to make those changes quickly .
daimler to profit most yet it is daimler which is profiting the most from the divorce since the maker of luxury cars , trucks and buses will no longer have chrysler as an albatross hanging from its neck .
the reputation of daimler 's management , however , has taken another beating .
after all , the bad investment that cost many billions of euros is not restricted to the chrysler issue alone , but is part of a larger complex that has dominated the ranks of daimler 's management for years .
the goal was a european-american-asian automotive company in which the sun never sets .
the result has been a financial disaster .
it 's a good thing that managers neither design nor build cars because mercedes has only survived these managerial adventures because the swabian engineers and workers of the company make such fantastic cars that can be sold high prices on the world market .

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nine-year , trans-atlantic marriage of automakers daimler and chrysler has come to an end and it 's probably best that way for all involved , said deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky . what daimlerchrysler 's former chief jürgen schrempp once called a " marriage from heaven " has now , after nine years , ended in a mundane divorce .
and it 's probably the best thing that could have happened - for both companies .
even though they will remain connected for years to come in joint technical projects and daimler 's minor stake in chrysler , they still have better chances going it alone in the automotive business than being involved in a relationship designed along the lines of jürgen schrempp 's vision of a welt ag or world inc .
that dream quickly revealed itself to be a mere delusion of grandeur .
schadenfreude inappropriate the consequences of that are immense , and feeling a sense of schadenfreude would be inappropriate .
after all , corporate strategies that have gotten out of control have once again caused millions of euros and many jobs to be lost .
daimler managers , with current chief executive dieter zetsche leading them at the time , cut 26,000 jobs at chrysler .
now on its own , chrysler will again have to lay off another 13,000 employees .
and , the way these things work when jobs are cut to increase profitability , what accompanied the announcement of the daimlerchrysler split was a true firework display on the stock market - not unlike the one that followed the news of schrempp 's disreputable departure .
eyes bigger than mouth now it 's official : daimler bit off more than it could chew when it purchased chrysler .
first , there were not enough managers to restructure the already crippled company in the united states ; then , it seemed that money was becoming scarce .
that is when a split becomes mandatory .
the decisive majority-shareholder at chrysler will be the private equity group cerberus capital management .
it will make a capital contribution of 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.4 billion -rrb- - not as a purchase price , it should be noted , but in return for an 80.1-percent equity interest in chrysler .
in order to shed itself of chrysler , daimler must also throw in 1.2 billion euros .
chrysler must now rely on its own strengths .
in addition to having to rid itself of now hard-to-sell pick-up trucks and suv 's , it must also market fuel-efficient small cars since the american conscience has also changed . neither chrysler , nor general motors nor ford , was prepared for that .
cerberus managers may now put a lot of pressure on chrysler to make those changes quickly .
daimler to profit most yet it is daimler which is profiting the most from the divorce since the maker of luxury cars , trucks and buses will no longer have chrysler as an albatross hanging from its neck .
the reputation of daimler 's management , however , has taken another beating .
after all , the bad investment that cost many billions of euros is not restricted to the chrysler issue alone , but is part of a larger complex that has dominated the ranks of daimler 's management for years .
the goal was a european-american-asian automotive company in which the sun never sets .
the result has been a financial disaster .
it 's a good thing that managers neither design nor build cars because mercedes has only survived these managerial adventures because the swabian engineers and workers of the company make such fantastic cars that can be sold high prices on the world market .

" six lebanese men accused of plotting to bomb the trains in western germany in july 2006 are currently standing trial in beirut . one of the defendants has confessed to lebanese authorities that he planted the homemade bombs to avenge the publication in denmark of cartoons of the prophet mohammed .
investigators believe the devices failed to explode because of faulty detonators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble has come under fire for allowing intelligence agenicies to snoop on pcs via the internet in addition , a little-known islamic extremist group issued a warning in march that germany could come under attack unless it withdrew its troops from afghanistan . last weekend , us media reported of an imminent attack on americans in germany by an al qaeda cell .
german press reports said five islamists living in the frankfurt area and belonging to a little-known group with ties to al qaeda had triggered a security warning by us authorities last month . schäuble said intelligence services were focusing their efforts on monitoring radical islamist websites in an attempt to spot potential attacks at the planning stage . " the internet gives terrorists a gigantic forum , whether as a communications platform , an advertising portal , or as a virtual training camp and think tank , " schäuble said . right-wing attacks on the rise violence by right-wing extremists also shot up in 2006 by 9.3 per cent , the report by the office for the protection of the constitution showed . the far-right national democratic party -lrb- ndp -rrb- gained 1,000 new members to take their membership to 7,000 .
schäuble voiced concern that neo-nazis have a growing influence on the npd leadership and spoke of the " alarming development " that the extreme right was gaining more acceptance in society . the interior minister , however , rejected the idea of attempting to ban the party , saying this would make it more difficult to observe ndp activities . concern over g-8 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been a series of anti-g8 protests in the past weeks the report found that left-wing violence dropped by 3.8 percent , but schäuble used the opportunity to warn that that the government would n't allow " potential violence to hinder the orderly course of the g8 summit , " which germany is hosting at the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm on june 6-8 . german police last week staged a series of raids on the homes and offices of militant left-wingers suspected of planning to disrupt the meeting between the leaders of germany , france , italy , britain , the united states , canada , japan and russia . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reports say raids on g8 protestors uncovered explosives amid growing criticism of a crackdown on leftwing protestors ahead of the g8 summit , news reports say recent raids by german police have yielded a range of incendiary materials .
-lrb- 13.05.2007 -rrb- beirut puts off german train bomb trial until may a beirut court on wednesday adjourned until next month a hearing for six lebanese accused of plotting to bomb trains in germany last july after defense lawyers requested more time .

the move was championed by von der leyen , a mother of seven who has stirred the ire of conservatives who see the provisions for child care as a break with traditional family values .
von der leyen 's proposal foresees the federal government covering one-third of the total 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.2 billion -rrb- in costs for expanding day care spaces for kids , but it is still unclear how federal , state and municipal governments plan to fund the expenses .

" preparing for the summit has been difficult , " steinmeier said after his talks with putin .
" there have been a number of specific problems which we have not been able to solve over the past few weeks .
keeping silent about them does n't help , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , and putin tried to play down their differences " that is why i looked for an opportunity to meet with the russian president and the foreign minister .
that was a good decision .
we are now seeing the situation around the preparation for the ... summit in a much clearer way . "
speaking at the start of the meeting , putin said : " there are differences of opinion on how to solve specific problems , but both sides have a desire to solve them . "
putin met steinmeier straight after talks with us secretary of state condoleezza rice , who is also trying to soothe her country 's tense relations with russia .
a sense of doom with attempts to negotiate a key eu-russia partnership accord in tatters , there were few signs that germany 's intervention as head of the rotating presidency of the european union could salvage the summit .
russia 's foreign ministry accused poland of holding eu-russia relations " hostage " by blocking discussion of the partnership deal , which would govern key areas , including energy supplies , interfax news agency reported .
putin 's representative for eu relations , sergei yastrzhembsky , said there " is no real sense in discussing an accord on which we can not negotiate , " interfax reported .
poland has vetoed negotiations in retaliation for a russian ban on polish meat imports , while lithuania is now also threatening to veto the talks unless russia resumes oil deliveries to a refinery in the north of the baltic state .
warsaw made an additional demand on tuesday that the 27-member eu must pledge to protect the energy security of poland and other eu newcomers that rely on russian oil and gas .
deteriorating ties with west the disputes are fuelling escalating tensions between moscow and new eu member countries of formerly soviet-dominated central europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's ugly dispute over a memorial with estonia have soured moscow 's ties with the eu estonia is also locked in an ugly war of words with russia over the relocation of a soviet-era war memorial in the capital tallinn .
the baltic republic says that a halving of rail freight from russia this month amounts to unofficial economic sanctions .
eu-russia tensions , coupled with increasingly frayed us-russian ties , are contributing to a dramatic deterioration of east-west relations ahead of presidential election seasons in both russia and the united states .
moscow is already in a fierce confrontation with washington over us plans to deploy an anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic .
russia is also at loggerheads with the european union and united states over western-backed plans to give independence to kosovo , a province in russian ally serbia .
a " senseless " summit ahead of his moscow trip , steinmeier sounded pessimistic about the chances of any breakthroughs .
" i can not assure you 100 percent whether progress can be made on individual issues , but even if you do not know you must make an attempt , " he told reporters in brussels .
the german foreign policy chief even addressed rumors that the summit could be cancelled , saying " we have to bring an end to these discussions about whether or not the summit will take place . "
russia 's kommersant daily said steinmeier would be unable " to save the summit from collapse , " while the vedomosti daily called the samara meeting " senseless . "
" the eu-russian summit will either be a relative failure or a scandalous failure .
there will definitely be no negotiations on a partnership agreement .

" we are only asking what the politicians promised , not one euro more , " the founder of live aid said at a press conference in berlin on tuesday .
" schröder signed in the name of the german people , if merkel betrays the pride of germany , then she kills people 12 miles south of europe in africa , " he said .
german music star herbert grönemeyer , who will sing at a major concert in rostock on june 7 along with bono and other musicians , said " politicians should just do their job and keep their promises . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geldof in younger years at a london live aid concert for africa the calls come just weeks before merkel hosts fellow leaders from the group of eight most industrialized nations at a summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm on june 6-8 .
germany currently holds the eu presidency .
bono said : " it is important that the g8 is taking place in germany because people expect germans to keep their promises . "
" if you break your promise , then everybody else will abandon ship , " he said .
report on progress geldof and the u2 frontman unveiled a report by data - a watchdog monitoring first-world help to africa which the two founded in 2002 - on the progress g8 nations have made in fulfilling their pledges made at gleneagles to collectively increase aid to africa by 25 billion dollars by 2010 .
the data report found that only britain and japan were doing their share to meet that target .
together the g8 nations stepped up development aid by $ 2.3 billion between 2004 and 2006 , but this is less than half of what they needed to give to be on track to meeting their 2010 deadline .
" it is less than half of what should have been done , " said jamie drummond of data .
" to get back on track in 2007 , they would have to increase aid by $ 6.4 billion , but so far there is at best a third of this in the pipeline . "
fears of violence german authorities fear that up to 100,000 anti-globalization protestors could target the g8 summit , and bono warned that failing to honor the group 's promises to africa could enrage activists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's grönemeyer has lent his voice to helping africa he said that although he was " opposed " to protestors resorting to violence , his own visits to poor countries had made him angry at the way the world neglected africa .
" i want to say that i relate to their rage , i feel it myself when i walk into a hospital and see people queuing up to die . "
merkel has promised to use the summit to build on efforts to help africa undertaken at gleneagles in 2005 .
on the weekend , merkel devoted her weekly podcast entirely to africa .
she said she wants the leaders of the group of eight industrialized nations to keep their earlier promises for increased development funding .
she said the richest nations in the world can really make a difference .
failure to help africa , she said , would come home to roost in the industrialized world .
" if we do n't care about the fate of our neighbors in this globalized world , we will one day see the problems arriving at our doorsteps , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 15.05.2007 eu must increase data sharing in terror fight , us says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sharing of passenger data remains controversial in the eu information gathered about passengers traveling to the united states is crucial in combating international terrorism , a us top security official said , pressing europe to increase its data exchange with the us . " we are all safer if we operate in a world in which intelligent use of information allows for more focussed efforts in determining who is a threat , " us secretary of homeland security michael chertoff said on monday after a meeting with european union lawmakers and officials .
the us and the 27-member eu are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
" we need to make sure that we have to provide the civilized world with appropriate tools to identify new security threats , " chertoff told a news briefing in brussels .
the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years .
data flow under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 34 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines face fines if they fail to pass on information such as credit card numbers washington has warned that airlines which failed to share passenger data would face fines of up to $ 6,000 -lrb- $ 4,450 -rrb- per passenger and a possible loss of landing rights .
chertoff said that the us wanted to make sure that a new agreement , which has to be clinched by the end of july , would ensure a " sufficient period of time " for the storage of data , arguing that terrorists were planning their plots over several years .
he also said that the us was working on new legislation under which foreign air passengers travelling to the us would be required to feed their data into an online database days ahead of the trip .
this new plan would enable the us " to inform people in advance if there is going to be a problem in allowing them to travel , " chertoff said .
kept for how long ?
eu justice commissioner franco frattini said that the two sides were still disagreeing on how long us authorities should be able to use data about passengers on transatlantic flights , when it should be destroyed and which government agencies should have access to the sensitive information .
the us also wants to pull data directly from airline computers , but european countries insist airlines must transmit the information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the date agreement will affect flights bound for the us eu data protection officials have demanded that personal data sent to us authorities should be made anonymous and the identity of their owner only be revealed if the data matched a profile in a terrorist database .
they have also said that a new deal on passenger data-sharing could be challenged by eu national courts .

" we are all safer if we operate in a world in which intelligent use of information allows for more focussed efforts in determining who is a threat , " us secretary of homeland security michael chertoff said on monday after a meeting with european union lawmakers and officials .
the us and the 27-member eu are currently negotiating a permanent pact on the controversial sharing of key air passenger data which washington requires from airlines as part of heightened security measures after the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
" we need to make sure that we have to provide the civilized world with appropriate tools to identify new security threats , " chertoff told a news briefing in brussels .
the us has called for more data-sharing , claiming that european privacy concerns had unreasonably hampered its counter-terrorism activities in the past few years .
data flow under the current interim pact , european air carriers are obliged to give us authorities up to 34 pieces of information on each passenger aboard america-bound flights .
the data includes credit card numbers , travel itineraries , addresses and telephone numbers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airlines face fines if they fail to pass on information such as credit card numbers washington has warned that airlines which failed to share passenger data would face fines of up to $ 6,000 -lrb- $ 4,450 -rrb- per passenger and a possible loss of landing rights .
chertoff said that the us wanted to make sure that a new agreement , which has to be clinched by the end of july , would ensure a " sufficient period of time " for the storage of data , arguing that terrorists were planning their plots over several years .
he also said that the us was working on new legislation under which foreign air passengers travelling to the us would be required to feed their data into an online database days ahead of the trip .
this new plan would enable the us " to inform people in advance if there is going to be a problem in allowing them to travel , " chertoff said .
kept for how long ?
eu justice commissioner franco frattini said that the two sides were still disagreeing on how long us authorities should be able to use data about passengers on transatlantic flights , when it should be destroyed and which government agencies should have access to the sensitive information .
the us also wants to pull data directly from airline computers , but european countries insist airlines must transmit the information .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the date agreement will affect flights bound for the us eu data protection officials have demanded that personal data sent to us authorities should be made anonymous and the identity of their owner only be revealed if the data matched a profile in a terrorist database .
they have also said that a new deal on passenger data-sharing could be challenged by eu national courts .
the eu and the us are increasingly at odds over how to reconcile civil liberties with the us-led fight against terrorism .

the joint nature conservation committee said 90 % of key habitats and 50 % of species at risk were affected .
the group is carrying out an audit of habitats and species identified by the eu as vulnerable , rare or endangered .
conservation groups said the research was " alarming " .
the government said it would comment when the audit was over .
under the eu 's habitats directive , 500 sites in the uk have been identified as important for rare , endangered or vulnerable plants or wildlife .
priority sites the idea behind earmarking the sites , known as the natura 2000 network , had been to ensure they were protected from the start of the millennium .
but there are now 170 in the uk considered so vulnerable they have been given priority status .
they include the coastal lagoons of the fleet in dorset , the north norfolk coast and the caledonian forests of the cairngorms .
conservation groups say the initial findings are " terrible " show the government is failing to protect vulnerable sites .
the government said it would comment on the findings once the consultation process is over later this year .

they say the system for recruitment is deeply flawed .
and they are particularly worried about continuity of care when teams of newly appointed doctors take up their posts in august .
concessions by the government over interviews for training places have failed to allay their concerns . "
we want to make sure that patient care does not fall between the cracks of this problem " professor humphrey hodgson the training reforms for doctors have already run into serious trouble with many complaining about a lack of posts , poorly designed recruitment forms and technical failures with the online application system .
the doctors are angry about the way everyone has been made to apply for training places at the same time , rather than the old rolling recruitment process which allowed them to keep on trying for jobs as they came up .
they say those who miss out this time wo n't be able to get back on the career ladder towards becoming a consultant .
a trainee surgeon based in north west london , dr matt jameson evans , says the whole process has gone from bad to worse .
he said : " i 've experienced what everyone had , which is a completely inappropriate selection procedure , wrongly weighted questions whereby a creative essay of a 150 words counts for more than a three-year phd .
" i have experienced the crashes of the system , i 've experienced the worries about my data protection , i 've experienced the absolute chaos and consternation around me , and now the interview process which causes further concerns . "
court challenge dr jameson evans is a member of a group of junior doctors called remedy uk which is challenging the new training arrangements in court this week .
they have support across the profession - amid concerns that patient care will suffer .
have your say " doctors should be subject to market forces " brendan webster , weymouth send us your comments a group of leading consultants has warned the nhs faces a huge and potentially dangerous upheaval on 1 august , as completely new teams of doctors take up their posts .
professor humphrey hodgson , a liver specialist at the royal free hospital in north west london , said the continuity of care provided under the old recruitment system will disappear .
he said : " think of the complexities of any one individual sitting in a hospital with a combination of physical problems , psychological problems , social problems .
" the thought that all of that , and all the knowledge that is within the team that is looking after them , could be transferred seamlessly to an incoming completely different team with no overlap - well it wo n't happen , and something will fall through the net . "
online survey eighteen leading specialists , including professor hodgson , have organised an online survey of doctors which drew 3,500 responses . "
the big problem throughout all of this has been the intransigence of the government " dr jo hillborne british medical association it was a self-selecting sample , but an interesting gauge of where opinion in the profession is moving .
eighty-five per cent of consultants who took part backed a boycott of recruitment interviews .
ninety per cent expressed no confidence in the health secretary and chief medical officer .
the bbc has also learned - ahead of publication in the lancet - that nearly four out of five backed a delay in the whole recruitment process until it can be properly sorted out .
professor hodgson said urgent action was needed .
" we are in damage limitation in which we want to make sure that patient care does not fall between the cracks of this problem and i think that some overlap between staff is important . "
bma criticised in a further sign of the mood of militancy , 72 % of those who took part in the survey disapproved of the way the doctors union - the british medical association - had handled the situation .
it has not backed this week 's legal challenge by remedy uk .
but its junior doctors spokesman , dr jo hillborne , said it warned ministers of problems ahead well before the crisis erupted .
she said it is now too late to start again from scratch .
" unfortunately it takes two people to make a result happen .
" it takes the people who are raising the problems and it takes the will of the people with whom the problems are being raised .
" and the big problem throughout all of this has been the intransigence of the government and its unwillingness to listen to the views of the profession , to take on board our clearly and regularly and loudly expressed reservations and to act . "
the government said it will issue a ministerial statement on the training reforms and the doctors job-application process shortly .
andrew lansley , the shadow health secretary , urged the government to listen to consultants , and warned of " serious pressures " in august .

the doctors are angry about the way everyone has been made to apply for training places at the same time , rather than the old rolling recruitment process which allowed them to keep on trying for jobs as they came up .
they say those who miss out this time wo n't be able to get back on the career ladder towards becoming a consultant .
a trainee surgeon based in north west london , dr matt jameson evans , says the whole process has gone from bad to worse .
he said : " i 've experienced what everyone had , which is a completely inappropriate selection procedure , wrongly weighted questions whereby a creative essay of a 150 words counts for more than a three-year phd .
" i have experienced the crashes of the system , i 've experienced the worries about my data protection , i 've experienced the absolute chaos and consternation around me , and now the interview process which causes further concerns . "

have your say doctors should be subject to market forces brendan webster , weymouth send us your comments a group of leading consultants has warned the nhs faces a huge and potentially dangerous upheaval on 1 august , as completely new teams of doctors take up their posts .
professor humphrey hodgson , a liver specialist at the royal free hospital in north west london , said the continuity of care provided under the old recruitment system will disappear .
he said : " think of the complexities of any one individual sitting in a hospital with a combination of physical problems , psychological problems , social problems .
" the thought that all of that , and all the knowledge that is within the team that is looking after them , could be transferred seamlessly to an incoming completely different team with no overlap - well it wo n't happen , and something will fall through the net . "
online survey eighteen leading specialists , including professor hodgson , have organised an online survey of doctors which drew 3,500 responses .
the big problem throughout all of this has been the intransigence of the government dr jo hillborne british medical association it was a self-selecting sample , but an interesting gauge of where opinion in the profession is moving .
eighty-five per cent of consultants who took part backed a boycott of recruitment interviews .
ninety per cent expressed no confidence in the health secretary and chief medical officer .
the bbc has also learned - ahead of publication in the lancet - that nearly four out of five backed a delay in the whole recruitment process until it can be properly sorted out .
professor hodgson said urgent action was needed .
" we are in damage limitation in which we want to make sure that patient care does not fall between the cracks of this problem and i think that some overlap between staff is important . "

it has not backed this week 's legal challenge by remedy uk .

she said it is now too late to start again from scratch .
" unfortunately it takes two people to make a result happen .
" it takes the people who are raising the problems and it takes the will of the people with whom the problems are being raised .
" and the big problem throughout all of this has been the intransigence of the government and its unwillingness to listen to the views of the profession , to take on board our clearly and regularly and loudly expressed reservations and to act . "

according to figures released by the business software alliance 35 % of the programs used by firms are illegal- a figure unchanged since 2003 .
despite this , the piracy watchdog said some nations , such as china , had made big inroads into the amount of illegal software companies were using .
the bsa said governments had to do more to get firms using licenced software .
tax break the static rates of piracy in the us -lrb- 22 % -rrb- and western europe -lrb- 36 % -rrb- stood in stark contrast to the declining rates in other countries , said julie strawson , vice-chair of the bsa in the uk .
in only three years , she said , piracy rates in china had declined from 92 % to 82 % .
" that 's got a lot to do with government intervention , " she said .
a commitment from the chinese government to only use licenced software itself and tougher regulations to make companies buy licences had helped to bring about the reduction , said ms strawson .
" governments can help a lot because as soon as they put it on their agenda , businesses do too . "
piracy rates asia - 55 % central europe - 68 % latin america - 66 % middle east / africa - 60 % north america - 22 % western europe - 36 % tougher action by governments in richer nations could help break the deadlock that saw a minority of firms continue to use illegal software , she said .
ms strawson singled out the uk as one of the places where a hard core of companies , 27 % , were still using unlicenced software .
many pirates , she said , were unaware of the risks of using unlicenced software .
for instance , said ms strawson , getting software from illegal sources could leave firms at risk of being infected by a virus .
" i 'm sure most companies out there do not mean to operate illegally , " she said .
as well as tougher laws , governments could reward firms that had licences for all the software they used , she said .
corporate tax breaks could help drive piracy rates below current rates .
ms strawson said hi-tech firms were also working to make software harder to pirate .
but , she said , the industry could only go so far to lock down its products before interoperability suffered .
" the last thing users want is software that is less stable , " she said .

according to figures released by the business software alliance 35 % of the programs used by firms are illegal- a figure unchanged since 2003 .
despite this , the piracy watchdog said some nations , such as china , had made big inroads into the amount of illegal software companies were using .
the bsa said governments had to do more to get firms using licenced software .
tax break the static rates of piracy in the us -lrb- 22 % -rrb- and western europe -lrb- 36 % -rrb- stood in stark contrast to the declining rates in other countries , said julie strawson , vice-chair of the bsa in the uk .
in only three years , she said , piracy rates in china had declined from 92 % to 82 % .
" that 's got a lot to do with government intervention , " she said .
a commitment from the chinese government to only use licenced software itself and tougher regulations to make companies buy licences had helped to bring about the reduction , said ms strawson .

ms strawson singled out the uk as one of the places where a hard core of companies , 27 % , were still using unlicenced software .
many pirates , she said , were unaware of the risks of using unlicenced software .
for instance , said ms strawson , getting software from illegal sources could leave firms at risk of being infected by a virus .
" i 'm sure most companies out there do not mean to operate illegally , " she said .
as well as tougher laws , governments could reward firms that had licences for all the software they used , she said .
corporate tax breaks could help drive piracy rates below current rates .

in addition , the franchisor charges an on-going monthly fee based on a percentage of the franchisee 's sales or profit .
if a franchisee wants to leave the business or fails to make a success of it , they can sell the franchise on to someone else -lrb- subject to the approval of the franchisor -rrb- .
training and support before selling the first franchise , you must make sure that your business model is one that can be set up and run relatively easily by people who do not necessarily have industry-specific knowledge .
franchisees will require a package of support to help them set up their franchises , including training in how to provide the service and run a business .
preparing the support processes and documentation takes significant time and effort .
franchisees will also expect on-going support .
in particular , they will expect the franchisor to invest in marketing the franchise name .

the designers , the mayo clinic in minnesota , said it could help obese people to lose up to 30kg a year .
fifteen obese volunteers burned an average of 191 calories an hour using the treadmill , compared to 72 calories just sitting at their desk .
the study features in the british journal of sports medicine . "
this is clearly something that is slightly gimmicky , but if it is a way of getting people with sedentary lifestyles off of their backsides then that has got to be a good thing " john brewer lucozade sports science academy exercise and work - we put theory into action the workstation , which is designed to be used for two to three hours a day , comprises a computer , keyboard and treadmill .
the steel frame of the device is shaped in the form of the letter " h " and is supported by four locking rubber wheels , so that it can be moved about easily .
the frame holds a plexiglass panel on to which two adjustable arms are bolted - one to hold the computer screen and the other for the keyboard and mouse .
slats provide storage for personal items such as flower vase , cup holder , pen holder or paper tray .
the adjustable design enables users to walk and work , stand and work , or , if the treadmill is replaced by a high chair , sit and work .
the speed of the treadmill can also be adjusted by the user .
sedentary jobs the 14 men and one women who took part in the trials all had sedentary office jobs , and none took part in any regular exercise .
while using the workstation , they walked at the equivalent of one mile an hour .
their energy expenditure while using the workstation for 35 minutes every hour was compared to that while working at their desk .
the researchers said : " if sitting computer time were replaced by walking-and-working , energy expenditure could increase by 100 kcal -lrb- calories -rrb- per hour .
" thus , if obese individuals were to replace time spent sitting at the computer with walking computer time by two to three hours a day , and if other components of energy balance were constant , a weight loss of 20-30 kilograms per year could occur . "
obesity rates are soaring across much of the developed world , and many people blame a hectic lifestyle for failing to make time to exercise .
an increase in sedentary leisure activities , such as using a computer , has also been blamed .
more than 12m adults and one million children in england alone will be obese by 2010 if no action is taken , a report by the department of health predicted last year .
john brewer , director of the lucozade sports science academy , said : " the growing obesity epidemic is something that requires drastic action .
" this is clearly this is something that is slightly gimmicky and unusual , but if it is a way of getting people with sedentary lifestyles off of their backsides then that has got to be a good thing . "
mr brewer said the workstation could potentially appeal to people who found pounding out miles on a treadmill tedious by allowing them to combine it with a more interesting activity .
the desks cost £ 1,000 each .

the designers , the mayo clinic in minnesota , said it could help obese people to lose up to 30kg a year .
fifteen obese volunteers burned an average of 191 calories an hour using the treadmill , compared to 72 calories just sitting at their desk .
the study features in the british journal of sports medicine .

the steel frame of the device is shaped in the form of the letter " h " and is supported by four locking rubber wheels , so that it can be moved about easily .
the frame holds a plexiglass panel on to which two adjustable arms are bolted - one to hold the computer screen and the other for the keyboard and mouse .
slats provide storage for personal items such as flower vase , cup holder , pen holder or paper tray .
the adjustable design enables users to walk and work , stand and work , or , if the treadmill is replaced by a high chair , sit and work .
the speed of the treadmill can also be adjusted by the user .
sedentary jobs the 14 men and one women who took part in the trials all had sedentary office jobs , and none took part in any regular exercise .
while using the workstation , they walked at the equivalent of one mile an hour .
their energy expenditure while using the workstation for 35 minutes every hour was compared to that while working at their desk .
the researchers said : " if sitting computer time were replaced by walking-and-working , energy expenditure could increase by 100 kcal -lrb- calories -rrb- per hour .
" thus , if obese individuals were to replace time spent sitting at the computer with walking computer time by two to three hours a day , and if other components of energy balance were constant , a weight loss of 20-30 kilograms per year could occur . "
obesity rates are soaring across much of the developed world , and many people blame a hectic lifestyle for failing to make time to exercise .

the st andrews university psychologists found examples of female chimps killing the offspring of incoming mothers , previously regarded as a male trait .
the fife team has been studying chimps in the budongo forest , uganda .
the researchers said only three previous instances of lethal aggression in wild female chimps had been documented in the past 50 years .
the belief was that male and females differed greatly in nature but the psychologists found that if the chimps ' resources come under threat , the females could become just as aggressive as males .
our research shows that , under the right socio-ecological circumstances , chimp gender stereotypes collapse completely simon townsend st andrews university while observing chimps in the sonso community , the researchers came across three examples of female apes killing the offspring of incoming mothers .
one attack was so violent that a baby chimp 's head was bitten off .
simon townsend , who led the study , said : " it 's true that males are much more often seen to engage in extreme physical violence than females , and this has led to the notion of violent and demonic males in contrast to quite peaceful females .
" however , our research shows that , under the right socio-ecological circumstances , these chimp gender stereotypes collapse completely .
" if their resources are under threat , females can become just as violently aggressive as males . "
similar behaviour similar behaviour was described by a leading primatologist in the 1970s , but her findings were later disregarded as inconsistent .
mr townsend said female aggression only occurred under specific circumstances .
he added that an increase of immigrant females entering the sonso community had put pressure on food and mate resources , which had caused the violence .
" it is impossible to predict when another instance may occur , " mr townsend said .
" however , we are very interested in keeping a close eye on levels of female aggression in the sonso community , especially in the instances when new females attempt to immigrate . "

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- how to pick the right website address home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business market data economy companies health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : tuesday , 15 may 2007 , 08:33 gmt 09:33 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version how to pick the right website address will you be tempted by a .co.uk or a .aero address ?
if you are making the leap online - whether you 're a multinational corporation , small business or one-man band - it is all too easy to forget about the domain name .
the right web address is crucial to getting your online presence right but is too often left until the last minute .
the most popular domains end in .com -lrb- short for ' company ' -rrb- .
the address was intended to be used by companies with a global presence but has become highly sought-after and is fast running out of recognisable and usable combinations .
there are other options available including .net -lrb- internet -rrb- , .org -lrb- organisation -rrb- .gov -lrb- government -rrb- and .co.uk -lrb- a uk company -rrb- .
the group that looks after global domains launched seven more in 2001 , in the hope that this would prevent a shortage .
however , the specific nature of some of those new names -lrb- .aero for aviation , .coop for cooperatives and the self-explanatory .museum -rrb- may mean they are of limited use .
stay simple which name you pick is up to you -lrb- as long as someone else has n't got there first -rrb- , but as a general rule try to avoid hyphens and complicated combinations .
stick to something that is easily memorable .
owning a domain costs between about £ 15 and £ 75 a year depending on which one you pick .
you 'll have to pay a domain name company - or registrar - to look after the name for you and remember to re-register it every two years .
domain names approved in 2000 .aero .coop .biz .info .name .pro .museum if someone already owns a domain that you think your company is entitled to , then you can appeal .

the police federation of england and wales says government targets lead to " ludicrous " decisions such as arresting a child for throwing a cucumber slice .
detectives are being diverted away from serious cases , it also warns .
the home office said it was discussing future targets to give more prominence to serious crime .
the federation is due to discuss the issue at its annual conference in blackpool .
delegates will debate whether judging officers purely on numbers of arrests , cautions or on-the-spot fines is the best way to assess success .
dossier published the federation , which represents 130,000 rank-and-file officers , has published a dossier of " ludicrous " cases it claims are the result of home office targets .
the cases include : a man from cheshire who was cautioned for being " found in possession of an egg with intent to throw " a child in kent who was arrested after removing a slice of cucumber from a sandwich and throwing it at another youngster a west midlands woman arrested on her wedding day for criminal damage after her foot slipped on her accelerator pedal and her vehicle damaged a car park barrier " understandably , when the public hears about this they ask ' what the hell is going on ? " '
police federation spokesman ' threat to general coppering ' a child from kent who was arrested for throwing cream buns at a bus a 70-year-old cheshire pensioner who was arrested for criminal damage after cutting back a neighbour 's conifer trees an officer in the west midlands who was told to caution a man for throwing a glass of water over his girlfriend two children from manchester who were arrested for being in possession of a plastic toy pistol a spokesman for the federation said such cases were a result of officers being " so busy chasing targets and securing ticks in boxes " .
as a result , he said , officers were distancing themselves from " middle england " .
have your say " officers do not know what there are going to face as they go on shift " roger traynor , frome send us your comments the list of compiled cases showed incidents where officers had been " under such pressure to deliver it has resulted in an arrest or caution when even the officer themselves thinks it is ludicrous " , he said .
" understandably , when the public hears about this they ask ' what the hell is going on ? ' . "
' talking to ' federation chairman jan berry said some officers were considering leaving the service over the issue because it was " not the job they signed up to do " .
she added : " just talking to people and giving them a few words of advice can not be counted as easily as a ticket can be .
" but sometimes it is just as effective as taking someone to court . "
mrs berry added that the issue would be raised with home secretary john reid later in the week when he attends the conference .
the chair of the commons home affairs committee , john denham , told the bbc questions need to be directed at senior figures in the police service .
" over the last few years we 've seen a massive investment in police resources and yet we have n't seen the scale of increases in cases brought to court for things like burglary and car thieves , and robbers and child pornographers that we would want , " he said .
" clearly the government is right to say on behalf of taxpayers - we want to see value for money for that investment . "
officers should not pursue detection numbers for numbers ' sake if that means chasing minor misdemeanours at the expense of serious offenders " home office spokeswoman " now , if between that message and jan berry 's members it is being distorted into crude number chasing by senior police officers , that 's where we 've got to tackle the problem . "
a spokeswoman for the home office said : " bringing criminals to justice is a core job for the police , but officers should not pursue detection numbers for numbers ' sake if that means chasing minor misdemeanours at the expense of serious offenders .
" this amounts to hitting the target , but missing the point .
" we are currently discussing future targets in this area so that both our crime reduction and detections targets give much more prominence to more serious crime , particularly the most serious violent crime . "
paul cavadino , chief executive of nacro , the crime reduction charity , said : " law enforcement agencies should not be judged by how many offenders they arrest but on how much they reduce crime . "
shadow home secretary david davis said whitehall targets were " stopping the police from doing what the public want them to do " .
he added : " conservatives would free the police from labour 's red tape so they can be deployed onto our streets - where the public want them . "

bbc scotland has established that voters in two of the biggest cities did not receive the ballot papers they had been led to expect .
the papers had been redesigned after the nominations closed to cope with the high number of parties and individuals .
the rate of rejected holyrood ballots was high across scotland but highest in the glasgow and edinburgh areas .
the bbc 's newsnight scotland programme has established a significant link between this high number of rejected papers and a decision taken soon after nominations closed to change the ballot paper .
in lothian and glasgow , no fewer than 23 parties and individuals were vying for the list vote .
it was feared there would be too many on the ballot paper to permit electronic counting .
this regional variation can be attributed to the number of parties on the regional lists dr christopher carman strathclyde university so in both regions arrows designed to help voters put one cross in each column were scrapped .
it meant thousands of voters went to the polling booths expecting to see one design of ballot paper and were faced with another .
in the 2003 election , the list vote for holyrood said there were just over 1,200 rejected ballots across glasgow .
in this month 's vote , there were 9,000 and the differential in the constituency vote was even bigger .
the city had eight of the 10 constituencies with the highest number of rejected first-past-the-post votes , and seven of the top 10 for regional votes .
regional lists dr christopher carman , of the department of government at strathclyde university , said there were " distinct differences " across the different regions .
" as this has developed and as we have been able to gather information our models now clearly show that this regional variation can be attributed to the number of parties on the regional lists , " he said .
professor james mitchell , of strathclyde university , said a system with two ballots on one paper worked elsewhere .
" it did n't work in scotland , and we have to explore why that is , " he said .
the design of the ballot paper will form a significant part of that wide-ranging inquiry with which the scotland office will co-operate fully scotland office spokesman " it seems to be that the instructions on the ballot paper were not adequate for the job , but in some places they were even less adequate than others , so we have got regional variations .
" in principle there is nothing wrong with it , it is an implementation failure . "
the scotland office , which was responsible for the election , said it was waiting for a review by the electoral commission .
a scotland office spokesman said : " the electoral commission today announced the appointment of the electoral expert ron gould to lead an independent review of the scottish elections .
" the design of the ballot paper will form a significant part of that wide-ranging inquiry with which the scotland office will co-operate fully . "
' crossed wires ' mr gould , a canadian expert who has overseen elections in more than 70 countries , said : " i hope my review will help ensure that the people of scotland can be confident that any lessons are learned for the future . "
professor david mccrone , of the institute of governance at edinburgh university , said : " someone should carry the can and indeed a number of people are going to have to carry the can .

" understandably , when the public hears about this they ask ' what the hell is going on ? ' . "
' talking to ' federation chairman jan berry said some officers were considering leaving the service over the issue because it was " not the job they signed up to do " .
she added : " just talking to people and giving them a few words of advice can not be counted as easily as a ticket can be .

a spokeswoman for the home office said : " bringing criminals to justice is a core job for the police , but officers should not pursue detection numbers for numbers ' sake if that means chasing minor misdemeanours at the expense of serious offenders .

" we are currently discussing future targets in this area so that both our crime reduction and detections targets give much more prominence to more serious crime , particularly the most serious violent crime . "
paul cavadino , chief executive of nacro , the crime reduction charity , said : " law enforcement agencies should not be judged by how many offenders they arrest but on how much they reduce crime . "
shadow home secretary david davis said whitehall targets were " stopping the police from doing what the public want them to do " .
he added : " conservatives would free the police from labour 's red tape so they can be deployed onto our streets - where the public want them . "

the goal is one of ten ambitious targets set out by the charity for the future of cancer care .
it comes as figures show a patient with cancer now has a 46.2 % chance of being alive ten years after diagnosis compared with 23.6 % 30 years ago .
the department of health backed the targets and said work was needed to further improve cancer prognosis .
increased survival over the past three decades can be attributed to earlier detection of cancer , greater use of specialist surgery , cancer screening programmes and advances in treatments .
2020 cancer goals three-quarters of people will know how to reduce their risk of cancer four million fewer adults will be smokers risk of cancer in under 75s will fall from one in four to one in five two-thirds of cancer will be diagnosed early when it can be treated half of all patients will have better targeted treatments with fewer side effects two-thirds of cancer patients will be alive after five years difference in risk of dying from cancer between rich and poor will be reduced by half nine out of ten patients will get better information we will have a detailed understanding of the causes and changes in the body in two-thirds of all cases of cancer rapid progress will continue after 2020 cancer survival : in graphics a team from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine found that for all cancers combined the ten year survival rose by 11 % in the past decade and five-year survival rates increased from 39.7 % to 49.6 % over the same period .
but survival ranges from just 2.5 % for pancreatic cancer to 95 % for testicular cancer .
two-thirds of patients with breast cancer are alive 20 years after diagnosis but there has been no improvement in survival for lung cancer .
professor michel coleman who led the study said within the figures there were success stories and disappointments .
" we do n't generally use an overall survival figure for cancer , partly because it is not a helpful number to individual cancer patients anxious to know their own chances .
" but since the new goals relate to cancer as a whole , we feel it is important to define a simple baseline for watching progress . " 2020 goals cancer research uk want three-quarters of people in the uk to know how to reduce their risk of cancer by 2020 .
they also want two-thirds of cancers to be diagnosed at an early stage when the cancer can be successfully treated .
and if survival rates in the poorest communities was brought into line with that in the richest communities , more than 17,000 deaths could be avoided every year .
harpal kumar , cancer research uk 's chief executive , said : " our goals are as broad as they are ambitious .
" they recognise the importance of furthering our fundamental biological understanding of cancer while at the same time taking that knowledge out of the lab and turning it into new treatments . "
he said the uk came out top in europe for direct cancer research funding .
" we read a lot of negative stories about the uk 's place in europe so it 's encouraging these figures show such dramatic improvements in cancer survival . "
national cancer director professor mike richards said : " while research charities , universities , industry and the nhs have always worked together , those collaborations have never been stronger than they are today .
have your say " of course the nhs should pay for cancer drugs .
you ca n't put a price on somebody 's life " martin , london send us your comments " this means we are getting more potential treatments out of the lab and into the clinic , and we are enrolling more patients than ever into clinical trials . "
" the department of health welcomes these goals because they will spur everyone in the field to work to further improve the prospects of cancer patients , especially those with types of cancer for which outcomes sadly remain poor . "

paris is abuzz with the question , as voters wonder whether cecilia sarkozy will be a full-time first lady or not , as her husband nicolas assumes power at the elysee palace on wednesday .
other nations have soap operas to keep them entertained .
france has its own real-life political drama , which has so far kept millions tuned in - from the gripping episodes during the long-term feud between nicolas sarkozy , 52 , and his former mentor , the outgoing president jacques chirac , to the recent cliff-hanger of the sporadic absences of cecilia from her ambitious husband 's side .
the 49-year-old former model and mother of his youngest son , louis , 10 , was with mr sarkozy as he claimed victory in his speech to cheering supporters on place de la concorde on the evening of 6 may .
but she was not with him earlier on sunday afternoon when he went to vote , even though both of her stunning blonde daughters were at his side .
cecilia was also noticeably absent for most of the final weeks of his winning campaign , even as president chirac 's wife bernadette turned up to give her support at mr sarkozy 's final rally in montpellier .
marital ' furniture ' cecilia 's recent absences have puzzled and intrigued the french , not least because for a long time she was one of her husband 's closest political advisers .
when he was minister of the interior from 2003 , her office was next to his and she was known as a decisive and calming influence on mr sarkozy behind the scenes . "
i do n't see myself as first lady - the whole idea bores me " cecilia sarkozy interviewed in march 2005 however , the couple had a well-publicised split when cecilia left mr sarkozy in may 2005 for several months for the international communications consultant , richard attias , confiding to friends that she had had enough of being treated like " part of the furniture " .
the rumours flew on the internet , and among paris-based journalists .
but when paris match published a series of photos of cecilia with her lover in new york , it was a step too far .
the editor of the magazine , alain genestar , lost his job - the result , most believe , of severe pressure from above .
france 's new president has been known to ring editors personally in fury when upset by coverage , and is said to have a long memory for journalistic slights .
happily for relations between the french media and their new president , cecilia returned to mr sarkozy 's side a few months after the split , in january 2006 .
only a few newspapers had reported his affair - during her absence - with a french political journalist .
over the past month , there has been little coverage in the french media of cecilia 's on-off presence .
mr sarkozy is a close friend of many of france 's media barons .
in fact , this week paris match boasts a picture of the couple kissing on its front cover .
" cecilia shares in his victory , " reads a sub-heading , followed by several pages of photographs of the presidential pair together on the night of his victory , along with cecilia 's two daughters from her previous marriage and nicolas sarkozy 's two sons from his first marriage .
cecilia was also back at his side , along with their youngest son , as the new president sunned himself on a billionaire 's yacht off malta for a few days after the election .
' struck by lightning ' france has long been fascinated by one of its most glamorous power couples and their fiery personalities and continuing marital dramas - including the story of how they first met .
cecilia maria sara isabel ciganer-albeniz was born in paris to a pianist father of russian origins and a spanish mother .
a law student and parliamentary aide as well as a model , she was first married at the age of 27 to the 51-year old children 's tv presenter jacques martin at the town hall of the chic paris suburb of neuilly in 1984 .
the man who performed their marriage ceremony was a certain nicolas sarkozy , then the 29-year old mayor of the suburb .
three years later , mr sarkozy and cecilia met again and he was apparently " struck by lightning " as he fell in love with her and she with him .
the two left their respective spouses for each other , finally marrying in 1996 and playing out much of their subsequent relationship in the media spotlight .
since then , cecilia and the children have often appeared in magazine photo-shoots with nicolas sarkozy portraying their happy family life , with paris match showing the couple holding hands and enjoying a walk in the park on a recent weekend trip to london .
so what will happen next ?
will cecilia be a first lady in the bernadette chirac mould , keeping her counsel and rarely speaking to the media except to promote her charitable interests ?
cecilia sarkozy herself has gone on the record as saying she has always been keen to preserve her independence .
" i do n't see myself as first lady - the whole idea bores me , " she said in an interview in march 2005 .
" i am not politically correct . "
' many but discreetly ' but does it matter whether there is a full-time first lady in the elysee palace ?
the french are , after all , famously tolerant of what their presidents get up to in their private lives .
the late francois mitterrand managed to keep a mistress and an illegitimate child secret for most of his presidency .
even though the chattering classes in paris knew , nobody thought it necessary to inform the french public .
the outgoing president jacques chirac has also admitted to having loved many women " as discreetly as possible " though it is not clear if his wife bernadette agrees with his assessment .
" the french are very tolerant .
they will brush off affairs , they will disregard financial scandals by french presidents , " says one man who should know , jean-francois probst , a long-time adviser and former chef-de-cabinet of mr chirac .
" but in some ways the french are also very conservative , and i think if there is no traditional first lady to represent them , many would be upset . "
in his book testimony , mr sarkozy himself wrote last year : " today , cecilia and i are reunited for good , for real , doubtless for ever ...
we are not able and do not know how to separate from each other . "
he recently explained cecilia 's absence on the campaign trail as a deliberate strategy to take his family out of the relentless glare of the media , when the far-right leader jean-marie le pen tried - but failed - to make political capital out of cecilia 's temporary absence .
all the signs point towards cecilia sarkozy remaining at nicolas sarkozy 's side and becoming france 's first lady as he takes office this week .
however , in this age of les pipol -lrb- people -rrb- , as celebrities are dubbed here , the french will doubtless be tuning in enthusiastically for the next episode of the gripping real-life drama that is elysee palace .

france has its own real-life political drama , which has so far kept millions tuned in - from the gripping episodes during the long-term feud between nicolas sarkozy , 52 , and his former mentor , the outgoing president jacques chirac , to the recent cliff-hanger of the sporadic absences of cecilia from her ambitious husband 's side .
the 49-year-old former model and mother of his youngest son , louis , 10 , was with mr sarkozy as he claimed victory in his speech to cheering supporters on place de la concorde on the evening of 6 may .
but she was not with him earlier on sunday afternoon when he went to vote , even though both of her stunning blonde daughters were at his side .
cecilia was also noticeably absent for most of the final weeks of his winning campaign , even as president chirac 's wife bernadette turned up to give her support at mr sarkozy 's final rally in montpellier .
marital ' furniture ' cecilia 's recent absences have puzzled and intrigued the french , not least because for a long time she was one of her husband 's closest political advisers .
when he was minister of the interior from 2003 , her office was next to his and she was known as a decisive and calming influence on mr sarkozy behind the scenes .
i do n't see myself as first lady - the whole idea bores me cecilia sarkozy interviewed in march 2005 however , the couple had a well-publicised split when cecilia left mr sarkozy in may 2005 for several months for the international communications consultant , richard attias , confiding to friends that she had had enough of being treated like " part of the furniture " .
the rumours flew on the internet , and among paris-based journalists .
but when paris match published a series of photos of cecilia with her lover in new york , it was a step too far .
the editor of the magazine , alain genestar , lost his job - the result , most believe , of severe pressure from above .
france 's new president has been known to ring editors personally in fury when upset by coverage , and is said to have a long memory for journalistic slights .
happily for relations between the french media and their new president , cecilia returned to mr sarkozy 's side a few months after the split , in january 2006 .
only a few newspapers had reported his affair - during her absence - with a french political journalist .
over the past month , there has been little coverage in the french media of cecilia 's on-off presence .
mr sarkozy is a close friend of many of france 's media barons .
in fact , this week paris match boasts a picture of the couple kissing on its front cover .
" cecilia shares in his victory , " reads a sub-heading , followed by several pages of photographs of the presidential pair together on the night of his victory , along with cecilia 's two daughters from her previous marriage and nicolas sarkozy 's two sons from his first marriage .
cecilia was also back at his side , along with their youngest son , as the new president sunned himself on a billionaire 's yacht off malta for a few days after the election .
' struck by lightning ' france has long been fascinated by one of its most glamorous power couples and their fiery personalities and continuing marital dramas - including the story of how they first met .
outgoing president jacques chirac has said he " loved many women " cecilia maria sara isabel ciganer-albeniz was born in paris to a pianist father of russian origins and a spanish mother .
a law student and parliamentary aide as well as a model , she was first married at the age of 27 to the 51-year old children 's tv presenter jacques martin at the town hall of the chic paris suburb of neuilly in 1984 .
the man who performed their marriage ceremony was a certain nicolas sarkozy , then the 29-year old mayor of the suburb .
three years later , mr sarkozy and cecilia met again and he was apparently " struck by lightning " as he fell in love with her and she with him .
the two left their respective spouses for each other , finally marrying in 1996 and playing out much of their subsequent relationship in the media spotlight .
since then , cecilia and the children have often appeared in magazine photo-shoots with nicolas sarkozy portraying their happy family life , with paris match showing the couple holding hands and enjoying a walk in the park on a recent weekend trip to london .
so what will happen next ?
will cecilia be a first lady in the bernadette chirac mould , keeping her counsel and rarely speaking to the media except to promote her charitable interests ?
cecilia sarkozy herself has gone on the record as saying she has always been keen to preserve her independence .
" i do n't see myself as first lady - the whole idea bores me , " she said in an interview in march 2005 .
" i am not politically correct . "
' many but discreetly ' but does it matter whether there is a full-time first lady in the elysee palace ?
mitterrand 's daughter and mistress were long kept a secret the french are , after all , famously tolerant of what their presidents get up to in their private lives .
the late francois mitterrand managed to keep a mistress and an illegitimate child secret for most of his presidency .
even though the chattering classes in paris knew , nobody thought it necessary to inform the french public .
the outgoing president jacques chirac has also admitted to having loved many women " as discreetly as possible " though it is not clear if his wife bernadette agrees with his assessment .
" the french are very tolerant .
they will brush off affairs , they will disregard financial scandals by french presidents , " says one man who should know , jean-francois probst , a long-time adviser and former chef-de-cabinet of mr chirac .
" but in some ways the french are also very conservative , and i think if there is no traditional first lady to represent them , many would be upset . "
in his book testimony , mr sarkozy himself wrote last year : " today , cecilia and i are reunited for good , for real , doubtless for ever ...
we are not able and do not know how to separate from each other . "
he recently explained cecilia 's absence on the campaign trail as a deliberate strategy to take his family out of the relentless glare of the media , when the far-right leader jean-marie le pen tried - but failed - to make political capital out of cecilia 's temporary absence .
all the signs point towards cecilia sarkozy remaining at nicolas sarkozy 's side and becoming france 's first lady as he takes office this week .
however , in this age of les pipol -lrb- people -rrb- , as celebrities are dubbed here , the french will doubtless be tuning in enthusiastically for the next episode of the gripping real-life drama that is elysee palace .

they will brush off affairs , they will disregard financial scandals by french presidents , " says one man who should know , jean-francois probst , a long-time adviser and former chef-de-cabinet of mr chirac .
" but in some ways the french are also very conservative , and i think if there is no traditional first lady to represent them , many would be upset . "
in his book testimony , mr sarkozy himself wrote last year : " today , cecilia and i are reunited for good , for real , doubtless for ever ...
we are not able and do not know how to separate from each other . "
he recently explained cecilia 's absence on the campaign trail as a deliberate strategy to take his family out of the relentless glare of the media , when the far-right leader jean-marie le pen tried - but failed - to make political capital out of cecilia 's temporary absence .
all the signs point towards cecilia sarkozy remaining at nicolas sarkozy 's side and becoming france 's first lady as he takes office this week .
however , in this age of les pipol -lrb- people -rrb- , as celebrities are dubbed here , the french will doubtless be tuning in enthusiastically for the next episode of the gripping real-life drama that is elysee palace .

two teachers died counting votes as their school was set alight on monday night , bringing to 126 the number of election-related deaths , police said .
meanwhile , observers spoke of voter intimidation and described seeing blatant attempts to buy votes .
the millions of votes from monday 's congressional and local elections are being counted by hand .
initial results for local areas are expected as early as thursday , but it could be weeks before the final outcome for the senate and house of representatives is known .
we also saw people who already voted several times and had more than one ink mark on their fingers election observer jessica tulloch an exit poll by abs-cbn television in manila suggested that the opposition could win at least nine of the 12 senate seats up for grabs .
but it is thought the 275-seat house of representatives will remain in the hands of president gloria arroyo 's supporters .
this would thwart any attempt by the opposition to launch a third bid to impeach her over allegations she fixed the 2004 presidential election .
' generally peaceful ' national police chief , oscar calderon , described monday 's vote as " relatively peaceful " , compared with the 189 deaths in the 2004 poll , but admitted there continued to be reports of " isolated incidents of violence " .
ballot boxes were set alight as teachers counted votes in a school south of manila .
the flames quickly engulfed the building , killing two and hospitalising three others , police said .
the election campaign was colourful , but often violent tv reports also said a policeman guarding ballot boxes in northern ilocos norte province was shot dead after polls had closed on monday .
at least three people were killed on polling day itself .
mr calderon vowed to go " hammer and tongs " against the perpetrators of violence over the last three months of campaigning , and " give justice to the 126 killed " .
meanwhile , election observers described seeing scenes of violence , intimidation and threats towards voters .
one volunteer observer in the south of the country told the associated press that she had seen vote-buying take place at the polling station - with ballot papers handed to voters with money attached .
" we ... also talked to minors who were able to vote several times .
we also saw people who already voted several times and had more than one ink mark on their fingers , " jessica tulloch , a chicago volunteer with the united methodist church , said .
the asian network for free elections warned of a " culture of impunity for election and political crime " that could " fuel calls for alternative government that can provide justice for the people " .
but officials said that , while there were sporadic reports of irregularities , this poll had generally been more fair and peaceful than past elections .
" it is a credit to the filipino people that -lsb- monday 's -rsb- elections , compared to previous ones , were generally peaceful and that we had a good turnout , " presidential spokesman ignacio bunye said .
more than 70 % of the country 's registered 45 million voters are believed to have turned out for monday 's vote .
in total , about 87,000 candidates were contesting nearly 18,000 positions .
