politicians called for the death penalty .
captains of industry , judges and politicians were considered prime terrorist targets .
these weeks marked a watershed for post-war germany .
terrorism is a useful tool for political activists who lack influence - be they the left-wing rebels of germany 's red army faction , al qaeda fanatics or the taliban .
an act of terrorism is , literally , the last resort of the self-righteous revolutionary who has lost all sense of moderation and humanity .
then , potential targets are not just the captains of industry , judges and politicians , but anyone who simply happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time - from the businesspeople and tourists milling around the world trade center on sept.11 , 2001 to the passengers on a madrid commuter train and the crowds packed on to a double-decker bus in london in 2005 . unfailingly , terrorism unleashes panic , whether its target is us imperialism or the " pig state " invoked by the raf . when their back is against the wall , societies tend to turn to overreact , employing such standard defense mechanisms as revenge .
anyone who remembers the mood in germany in the fateful autumn of 1977 will recall the loud clamors for a reintroduction of the death penalty - and how these calls seemed as excessive a reaction as the us-led attack on iraq as retaliation for sept .
11 seemed four years ago , notwithstanding the substantial differences between raf and islamist terrorism . raf terrorism was a targeted attack against those it saw as " arch capitalists . "
this was the group 's derogatory terms for all those who bore any degree of responsibility in democratic , free-market west germany .
to the raf , they were " guilty , " and victims such as the driver who died in a hail of bullets during schleyer 's abduction , were merely collateral damages .
in contrast , the terrorism of al qaeda might be highly precise in terms of its execution , but it claims lives randomly .
its victims are citizens of the free world .
to the raf , the enemy was the german state .
to the jihadists , the enemy is the western world , with all its freedom of belief and rampant consumerism . then and now , a society need to show terrorists that it will not be blackmailed .
germany paid a high price for refusing to release the raf terrorists held in stammheim - the life of hanns martin schleyer .
those in charge of negotiations that fateful autumn - including former chancellor helmut schmidt - are personally indebted to the schleyer family .
but they believed that the decision they made to sacrifice his life was justified , because they maintained the state 's integrity and stability . in 2007 , a similarly steadfast line needs to be taken when innocent hostages are taken by the taliban in afghanistan or gangs of rebels in iraq .
whether it comes in the form of kidnappings or suicide bombings , terrorism can only be dealt with by remaining strong .
negotiations and concessions are grist to the mill of international terrorism . but remaining strong is far from easy .
thirty years ago , the accusations that germany 's left was made up of " intellectual desk criminals " was an inappropriate as today 's attempt to blame islam for the actions of fanatical islamist terrorists .
only when religious freedom endures , even in times of terrorist threats , will freedom serve as proof of western strength .
and only when the state 's protective measures stop short of restricting individual freedoms will citizens start to show a long-term willingness to defend society 's values , liberal laws and democracies - an important principle to remember when the specter of terrorism is looming large . as the west continues to fight its war on terror , the lessons learnt 30 years ago seem more relevant than ever . daniel scheschkewitz was dw-radio 's us correspondent and now works as a special correspondent -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the days between the raf 's kidnapping on sept .
5 of hanns martin schleyer , president of the federation of german industries , and the discovery of his body on oct .
19 , plunged the country into a state of emergency .
the militant , left-wing group staged the abduction in a bid to blackmail the state into releasing 11 members of its group who were in prison in stuttgart-stammheim for numerous bomb attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz tens of thousands of police officers spent weeks searching for the kidnappers and their hostage .
politicians called for the death penalty .
captains of industry , judges and politicians were considered prime terrorist targets .
these weeks marked a watershed for post-war germany .
terrorism is a useful tool for political activists who lack influence - be they the left-wing rebels of germany 's red army faction , al qaeda fanatics or the taliban .
an act of terrorism is , literally , the last resort of the self-righteous revolutionary who has lost all sense of moderation and humanity .
then , potential targets are not just the captains of industry , judges and politicians , but anyone who simply happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time - from the businesspeople and tourists milling around the world trade center on sept.11 , 2001 to the passengers on a madrid commuter train and the crowds packed on to a double-decker bus in london in 2005 . unfailingly , terrorism unleashes panic , whether its target is us imperialism or the " pig state " invoked by the raf . when their back is against the wall , societies tend to turn to overreact , employing such standard defense mechanisms as revenge .
anyone who remembers the mood in germany in the fateful autumn of 1977 will recall the loud clamors for a reintroduction of the death penalty - and how these calls seemed as excessive a reaction as the us-led attack on iraq as retaliation for sept .
11 seemed four years ago , notwithstanding the substantial differences between raf and islamist terrorism . raf terrorism was a targeted attack against those it saw as " arch capitalists . "
this was the group 's derogatory terms for all those who bore any degree of responsibility in democratic , free-market west germany .
to the raf , they were " guilty , " and victims such as the driver who died in a hail of bullets during schleyer 's abduction , were merely collateral damages .
in contrast , the terrorism of al qaeda might be highly precise in terms of its execution , but it claims lives randomly .
its victims are citizens of the free world .
to the raf , the enemy was the german state .
to the jihadists , the enemy is the western world , with all its freedom of belief and rampant consumerism . then and now , a society need to show terrorists that it will not be blackmailed .

shifting the focus from military action to civil reconstruction , berlin aims to help reform and improve the afghan justice ministry and judicial system . german chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly stressed the need for both military and civil involvement in the region . defense minister franz josef jung again ruled out deploying german troops to troubled southern afghanistan from their bases in the relatively secure north of the country .
he also stressed the need to continue political and civil rebuilding efforts . " we aim to push on with the training of afghan security forces in the north , " jung told national public television wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 05.09.2007 german engineer guilty of nuclear-technology smuggling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard wisser -lrb- r -rrb- and daniel geiges -lrb- l -rrb- : players in a global black market a south african court has found a german engineer guilty of seven charges of contravening the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction act and the nuclear energy act , and two counts of forgery . gerhard wisser was sentenced to three years under house arrest and given a suspended jail sentence of 18 years .
the 68-year-old engineer struck a plea bargain with prosecutors after he admitted in the pretoria high court to being involved in attempts to supply parts for libya 's aborted nuclear weapons program .
wisser , former managing director of johannesburg engineering company krisch , admitted he had played a role in a global black market in atomic weapons technology headed by disgraced pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan , who has admitted to helping nations under international embargo develop their weapons programs .
the case is part of an international effort to crack down on a network that has helped libya , north korea and iran skirt sanctions in their pursuit of nuclear technology .
the sentence also sets a precedent for the possible prosecution of other members in europe or asia , and wisser has agreed to cooperate with south african and overseas authorities in their investigations .
wisser denied he had suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a capsule of enriched uranium from iran his guilty plea marked a surprise turnaround in wisser 's case .
despite having worked on south africa 's secret apartheid-era nuclear program in the 1980s , wisser insisted he had suspected nothing when he was approached in 2000 by a nuclear industry contact about manufacturing a " compact pipework system " for an anonymous client , german news service dpa reported .
the client had paid him one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- to find a company in south africa to carry out the work .
wisser and his employee , swiss-born engineer daniel geiges , soon realized that the drawings were for a uranium enrichment plant .
wisser has always claimed that it never occurred to him that it could be for use in a nuclear weapons program .
ha awarded the contract to an old friend and fellow engineer with experience in the nuclear industry , johan meyer of tradefin engineering near johannesburg .
wisser repeatedly claimed he did not suspect he was abetting libya 's nuclear program until mid-2003 and that he believed he was working for pakistan 's nuclear energy program - even when two libyan engineers arrived in south africa to inspect the plant in 2002 .
" the realization dawned " after meyer received a payment from libya in 2003 , but wisser only pulled the plug on the plant when italian and us authorities intercepted a ship carrying parts for libya 's nuclear program off the coast of italy in october 2003 , exposing moammar gadhafi 's then atomic ambitions .

the 68-year-old engineer struck a plea bargain with prosecutors after he admitted in the pretoria high court to being involved in attempts to supply parts for libya 's aborted nuclear weapons program .
wisser , former managing director of johannesburg engineering company krisch , admitted he had played a role in a global black market in atomic weapons technology headed by disgraced pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan , who has admitted to helping nations under international embargo develop their weapons programs .
the case is part of an international effort to crack down on a network that has helped libya , north korea and iran skirt sanctions in their pursuit of nuclear technology .
the sentence also sets a precedent for the possible prosecution of other members in europe or asia , and wisser has agreed to cooperate with south african and overseas authorities in their investigations .
wisser denied he had suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a capsule of enriched uranium from iran his guilty plea marked a surprise turnaround in wisser 's case .
despite having worked on south africa 's secret apartheid-era nuclear program in the 1980s , wisser insisted he had suspected nothing when he was approached in 2000 by a nuclear industry contact about manufacturing a " compact pipework system " for an anonymous client , german news service dpa reported .
the client had paid him one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- to find a company in south africa to carry out the work .
wisser and his employee , swiss-born engineer daniel geiges , soon realized that the drawings were for a uranium enrichment plant .
wisser has always claimed that it never occurred to him that it could be for use in a nuclear weapons program .
ha awarded the contract to an old friend and fellow engineer with experience in the nuclear industry , johan meyer of tradefin engineering near johannesburg .
wisser repeatedly claimed he did not suspect he was abetting libya 's nuclear program until mid-2003 and that he believed he was working for pakistan 's nuclear energy program - even when two libyan engineers arrived in south africa to inspect the plant in 2002 .
" the realization dawned " after meyer received a payment from libya in 2003 , but wisser only pulled the plug on the plant when italian and us authorities intercepted a ship carrying parts for libya 's nuclear program off the coast of italy in october 2003 , exposing moammar gadhafi 's then atomic ambitions .

among the most dramatic was that of hanns martin schleyer , president of the federation of german industries . on sept .
5 , 1977 , a red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- commando opened fire on a convoy in which hanns martin schleyer , head of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , was traveling .
his four escorts were shot dead and schleyer was dragged out of the car and kidnapped .
it was the beginning of what has gone down in history as the " deutscher herbst , " germany 's autumn of terror . the militant , left-wing raf staged the murders and abduction in a bid to blackmail the state into releasing 11 members of its group who were in prison in stuttgart for numerous bomb attacks .
among the inmates were the heart and mind of the red army faction , andreas baader , gudrun ensslin and jan-carl raspe .
from their cells , they continued to control the armed battle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas baader and gudrun ensslin meanwhile a second generation red army faction had evolved , no longer set on causes such as the fight against capitalism , but on securing the release of the ringleaders . government refused to meet demands but the german government under chancellor helmut schmidt was not prepared to play ball .
four hours after schleyer 's abduction , he gave a television address in which he spoke directly to the kidnappers . " they might , right now , be experiencing a feeling of triumph , " he said .
" but they should not be mistaken .
terrorism stands no chance in the long term . " for the 44 days in which schleyer was held captive , germany was in a state of emergency .
ministries in the capital , bonn , were barricaded with barbed wire , armored vehicles drove through the streets and crisis meetings between the government and the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- met several times daily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanns martin schleyer " prisoner for 31 days " suspecting that the schleyer attack had been masterminded from inside the stuttgart prison , the government quickly passed a law prohibiting raf inmates from speaking to one another or to their lawyers . the bka launched an extensive search operation , combing through thousands of apartments and distributing millions of flyers with mug shots of raf members .
but the kidnappers insisted on their conditions and the investigators failed to find schleyer , who with his nazi background and powerful position in the economy , represented everything the terrorists deemed the enemy . hijacking reiterated demands schleyer was still alive on oct .
13 , 1977 when four palestinian terrorists , who supported the activities of the raf , hijacked a lufthansa plane with 87 people on board .
the hostage-takers threatened to kill the passengers if the german government did n't release the prisoners in stuttgart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hijacked lufthansa plane after a dramatic odyssey , the plane landed in the somalian capital mogadishu where it stayed for five days until a german special unit moved in and secured the release of 86 people .
the pilot had been killed earlier . when the raf prisoners heard the news in their cells , they committed suicide the same night .
one day later , the body of schleyer was found in the trunk of a car .
even today , it is not known who fired the fatal shot . raf debate continues today bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former raf terrorist christian klar schleyer 's death marked the end of the autumn of terror , but the memories of the 1977 terrorism have not been forgotten . even now , 30 years later , there is still intense public debate about how the state should treat former raf terrorists , such as christian klar .
he has been in prison since 1982 , in part for the collaborative kidnapping and murder of schleyer .
german president horst köhler rejected his plea for clemency in may of this year .
other raf have been released from prison after courts said they no longer posed a threat to society . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

wisser , former managing director of johannesburg engineering company krisch , admitted he had played a role in a global black market in atomic weapons technology headed by disgraced pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan , who has admitted to helping nations under international embargo develop their weapons programs .
the case is part of an international effort to crack down on a network that has helped libya , north korea and iran skirt sanctions in their pursuit of nuclear technology .
the sentence also sets a precedent for the possible prosecution of other members in europe or asia , and wisser has agreed to cooperate with south african and overseas authorities in their investigations .
wisser denied he had suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a capsule of enriched uranium from iran his guilty plea marked a surprise turnaround in wisser 's case .
despite having worked on south africa 's secret apartheid-era nuclear program in the 1980s , wisser insisted he had suspected nothing when he was approached in 2000 by a nuclear industry contact about manufacturing a " compact pipework system " for an anonymous client , german news service dpa reported .
the client had paid him one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- to find a company in south africa to carry out the work .
wisser and his employee , swiss-born engineer daniel geiges , soon realized that the drawings were for a uranium enrichment plant .
wisser has always claimed that it never occurred to him that it could be for use in a nuclear weapons program .
ha awarded the contract to an old friend and fellow engineer with experience in the nuclear industry , johan meyer of tradefin engineering near johannesburg .
wisser repeatedly claimed he did not suspect he was abetting libya 's nuclear program until mid-2003 and that he believed he was working for pakistan 's nuclear energy program - even when two libyan engineers arrived in south africa to inspect the plant in 2002 .
" the realization dawned " after meyer received a payment from libya in 2003 , but wisser only pulled the plug on the plant when italian and us authorities intercepted a ship carrying parts for libya 's nuclear program off the coast of italy in october 2003 , exposing moammar gadhafi 's then atomic ambitions .
the order was given in a text message to meyer urging him " to destroy the bird -lrb- plant -rrb- and all its feathers -lrb- project -rrb- . "
meyer , who later turned state witness , ignored the instructions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wissser admitted to manufacturing nuclear material when south african authorities raided tradefin 's premises near johannesburg in september 2004 , they found the bones of a two-storey uranium enrichment plant packed and ready for shipment .
according to experts , it could have been used to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for several nuclear bombs a year .
factors for a lenient sentence wisser 's agreement to cooperate with authorities in south africa and abroad in the investigation of other players in the network may have helped secure his lenient sentence .
state prosecutor r c macadam also cited wisser 's age and the prosecution 's desire to avoid a potentially years-long trial in explaining the plea bargain , which also sees wisser forfeit six million rand -lrb- $ 800,000 -rrb- in cash and over 2.8 million euros in overseas assets .
" we regard the conviction as a significant step in combating nuclear proliferation networks , " said south africa 's national prosecuting authority -lrb- npa -rrb- in a statement . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the days between the raf 's kidnapping on sept .
5 of hanns martin schleyer , president of the federation of german industries , and the discovery of his body on oct .
19 , plunged the country into a state of emergency .
the militant , left-wing group staged the abduction in a bid to blackmail the state into releasing 11 members of its group who were in prison in stuttgart-stammheim for numerous bomb attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz tens of thousands of police officers spent weeks searching for the kidnappers and their hostage .
politicians called for the death penalty .
captains of industry , judges and politicians were considered prime terrorist targets .
these weeks marked a watershed for post-war germany .
terrorism is a useful tool for political activists who lack influence - be they the left-wing rebels of germany 's red army faction , al qaeda fanatics or the taliban .
an act of terrorism is , literally , the last resort of the self-righteous revolutionary who has lost all sense of moderation and humanity .
then , potential targets are not just the captains of industry , judges and politicians , but anyone who simply happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time - from the businesspeople and tourists milling around the world trade center on sept.11 , 2001 to the passengers on a madrid commuter train and the crowds packed on to a double-decker bus in london in 2005 . unfailingly , terrorism unleashes panic , whether its target is us imperialism or the " pig state " invoked by the raf . when their back is against the wall , societies tend to turn to overreact , employing such standard defense mechanisms as revenge .
anyone who remembers the mood in germany in the fateful autumn of 1977 will recall the loud clamors for a reintroduction of the death penalty - and how these calls seemed as excessive a reaction as the us-led attack on iraq as retaliation for sept .
11 seemed four years ago , notwithstanding the substantial differences between raf and islamist terrorism . raf terrorism was a targeted attack against those it saw as " arch capitalists . "
this was the group 's derogatory terms for all those who bore any degree of responsibility in democratic , free-market west germany .
to the raf , they were " guilty , " and victims such as the driver who died in a hail of bullets during schleyer 's abduction , were merely collateral damages .
in contrast , the terrorism of al qaeda might be highly precise in terms of its execution , but it claims lives randomly .
its victims are citizens of the free world .
to the raf , the enemy was the german state .
to the jihadists , the enemy is the western world , with all its freedom of belief and rampant consumerism . then and now , a society need to show terrorists that it will not be blackmailed .
germany paid a high price for refusing to release the raf terrorists held in stammheim - the life of hanns martin schleyer .
those in charge of negotiations that fateful autumn - including former chancellor helmut schmidt - are personally indebted to the schleyer family .
but they believed that the decision they made to sacrifice his life was justified , because they maintained the state 's integrity and stability . in 2007 , a similarly steadfast line needs to be taken when innocent hostages are taken by the taliban in afghanistan or gangs of rebels in iraq .
whether it comes in the form of kidnappings or suicide bombings , terrorism can only be dealt with by remaining strong .
negotiations and concessions are grist to the mill of international terrorism . but remaining strong is far from easy .
thirty years ago , the accusations that germany 's left was made up of " intellectual desk criminals " was an inappropriate as today 's attempt to blame islam for the actions of fanatical islamist terrorists .
only when religious freedom endures , even in times of terrorist threats , will freedom serve as proof of western strength .
and only when the state 's protective measures stop short of restricting individual freedoms will citizens start to show a long-term willingness to defend society 's values , liberal laws and democracies - an important principle to remember when the specter of terrorism is looming large . as the west continues to fight its war on terror , the lessons learnt 30 years ago seem more relevant than ever . daniel scheschkewitz was dw-radio 's us correspondent and now works as a special correspondent -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

damascus has been accused of smuggling weapons to militants in lebanon - a charge the syrian government has denied . praise for regaining control of refugee camp the chancellor praised the lebanese army 's ability to regain control last week of the nahr al-bared palestinian refugee camp from fatah al-islam militants . " it was possible to demonstrate the authority of the lebanese state there , and i think this was a very important moment for lebanon , " merkel said at the news conference . siniora , for his part , told reporters he would like germany to help arm and train his country 's army so that it can protect the nation from militant groups threatening stability . the prime minister said his country 's army needs support to establish itself as a real " deterrent force . "
he also asked for help in rebuilding the nahr al-bared camp that was battered during three months of fighting . an estimated 400,000 palestinian refugees in lebanon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many refugees had to flee the camp without making any promises of military aid , merkel said germany would examine what it could do to assist in reconstruction of the camp located on lebanon 's northern coast . german economic cooperation and development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul also met with siniora and pledged another 2 million euros -lrb- $ 2.7 million -rrb- in aid to ease the burden on the estimated 400,000 palestinian refugees in lebanon . the aid will come in addition to 2 million euros to be used primarily for infrastructure improvements that the minister promised on a july trip to lebanon . wieczorek-zeul said the aid was intended to improve living conditions for the palestinian refugees , many of whom have lived their entire lives in the camps . germany extended maritime task force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ships are still patrolling lebanon 's mediterranean coast under a 1969 arab agreement , the lebanese army was banned from conduction military operations in lebanon 's 12 palestinian refugee camps .
that agreement was later annulled , but government forces largely stayed out of the camps until the nahr al-bared battle began . last month , the german government decided to extend its leadership of the united nations maritime task force in lebanon for another year .

among the most dramatic was that of hanns martin schleyer , president of the federation of german industries . on sept .
5 , 1977 , a red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- commando opened fire on a convoy in which hanns martin schleyer , head of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , was traveling .
his four escorts were shot dead and schleyer was dragged out of the car and kidnapped .
it was the beginning of what has gone down in history as the " deutscher herbst , " germany 's autumn of terror . the militant , left-wing raf staged the murders and abduction in a bid to blackmail the state into releasing 11 members of its group who were in prison in stuttgart for numerous bomb attacks .
among the inmates were the heart and mind of the red army faction , andreas baader , gudrun ensslin and jan-carl raspe .
from their cells , they continued to control the armed battle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas baader and gudrun ensslin meanwhile a second generation red army faction had evolved , no longer set on causes such as the fight against capitalism , but on securing the release of the ringleaders . government refused to meet demands but the german government under chancellor helmut schmidt was not prepared to play ball .
four hours after schleyer 's abduction , he gave a television address in which he spoke directly to the kidnappers . " they might , right now , be experiencing a feeling of triumph , " he said .
" but they should not be mistaken .
terrorism stands no chance in the long term . " for the 44 days in which schleyer was held captive , germany was in a state of emergency .
ministries in the capital , bonn , were barricaded with barbed wire , armored vehicles drove through the streets and crisis meetings between the government and the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- met several times daily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanns martin schleyer " prisoner for 31 days " suspecting that the schleyer attack had been masterminded from inside the stuttgart prison , the government quickly passed a law prohibiting raf inmates from speaking to one another or to their lawyers . the bka launched an extensive search operation , combing through thousands of apartments and distributing millions of flyers with mug shots of raf members .
but the kidnappers insisted on their conditions and the investigators failed to find schleyer , who with his nazi background and powerful position in the economy , represented everything the terrorists deemed the enemy . hijacking reiterated demands schleyer was still alive on oct .
13 , 1977 when four palestinian terrorists , who supported the activities of the raf , hijacked a lufthansa plane with 87 people on board .
the hostage-takers threatened to kill the passengers if the german government did n't release the prisoners in stuttgart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hijacked lufthansa plane after a dramatic odyssey , the plane landed in the somalian capital mogadishu where it stayed for five days until a german special unit moved in and secured the release of 86 people .
the pilot had been killed earlier . when the raf prisoners heard the news in their cells , they committed suicide the same night .
one day later , the body of schleyer was found in the trunk of a car .
even today , it is not known who fired the fatal shot . raf debate continues today bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former raf terrorist christian klar schleyer 's death marked the end of the autumn of terror , but the memories of the 1977 terrorism have not been forgotten . even now , 30 years later , there is still intense public debate about how the state should treat former raf terrorists , such as christian klar .
he has been in prison since 1982 , in part for the collaborative kidnapping and murder of schleyer .
german president horst köhler rejected his plea for clemency in may of this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 05.09.2007 german engineer guilty of nuclear-technology smuggling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard wisser -lrb- r -rrb- and daniel geiges -lrb- l -rrb- : players in a global black market a south african court has found a german engineer guilty of seven charges of contravening the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction act and the nuclear energy act , and two counts of forgery . gerhard wisser was sentenced to three years under house arrest and given a suspended jail sentence of 18 years .
the 68-year-old engineer struck a plea bargain with prosecutors after he admitted in the pretoria high court to being involved in attempts to supply parts for libya 's aborted nuclear weapons program .
wisser , former managing director of johannesburg engineering company krisch , admitted he had played a role in a global black market in atomic weapons technology headed by disgraced pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan , who has admitted to helping nations under international embargo develop their weapons programs .
the case is part of an international effort to crack down on a network that has helped libya , north korea and iran skirt sanctions in their pursuit of nuclear technology .
the sentence also sets a precedent for the possible prosecution of other members in europe or asia , and wisser has agreed to cooperate with south african and overseas authorities in their investigations .
wisser denied he had suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a capsule of enriched uranium from iran his guilty plea marked a surprise turnaround in wisser 's case .
despite having worked on south africa 's secret apartheid-era nuclear program in the 1980s , wisser insisted he had suspected nothing when he was approached in 2000 by a nuclear industry contact about manufacturing a " compact pipework system " for an anonymous client , german news service dpa reported .
the client had paid him one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- to find a company in south africa to carry out the work .
wisser and his employee , swiss-born engineer daniel geiges , soon realized that the drawings were for a uranium enrichment plant .
wisser has always claimed that it never occurred to him that it could be for use in a nuclear weapons program .
ha awarded the contract to an old friend and fellow engineer with experience in the nuclear industry , johan meyer of tradefin engineering near johannesburg .
wisser repeatedly claimed he did not suspect he was abetting libya 's nuclear program until mid-2003 and that he believed he was working for pakistan 's nuclear energy program - even when two libyan engineers arrived in south africa to inspect the plant in 2002 .
" the realization dawned " after meyer received a payment from libya in 2003 , but wisser only pulled the plug on the plant when italian and us authorities intercepted a ship carrying parts for libya 's nuclear program off the coast of italy in october 2003 , exposing moammar gadhafi 's then atomic ambitions .
the order was given in a text message to meyer urging him " to destroy the bird -lrb- plant -rrb- and all its feathers -lrb- project -rrb- . "
meyer , who later turned state witness , ignored the instructions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wissser admitted to manufacturing nuclear material when south african authorities raided tradefin 's premises near johannesburg in september 2004 , they found the bones of a two-storey uranium enrichment plant packed and ready for shipment .
according to experts , it could have been used to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for several nuclear bombs a year .
factors for a lenient sentence wisser 's agreement to cooperate with authorities in south africa and abroad in the investigation of other players in the network may have helped secure his lenient sentence .
state prosecutor r c macadam also cited wisser 's age and the prosecution 's desire to avoid a potentially years-long trial in explaining the plea bargain , which also sees wisser forfeit six million rand -lrb- $ 800,000 -rrb- in cash and over 2.8 million euros in overseas assets .
" we regard the conviction as a significant step in combating nuclear proliferation networks , " said south africa 's national prosecuting authority -lrb- npa -rrb- in a statement . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the militant , left-wing group staged the abduction in a bid to blackmail the state into releasing 11 members of its group who were in prison in stuttgart-stammheim for numerous bomb attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz tens of thousands of police officers spent weeks searching for the kidnappers and their hostage .
politicians called for the death penalty .
captains of industry , judges and politicians were considered prime terrorist targets .
these weeks marked a watershed for post-war germany .
terrorism is a useful tool for political activists who lack influence - be they the left-wing rebels of germany 's red army faction , al qaeda fanatics or the taliban .
an act of terrorism is , literally , the last resort of the self-righteous revolutionary who has lost all sense of moderation and humanity .
then , potential targets are not just the captains of industry , judges and politicians , but anyone who simply happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time - from the businesspeople and tourists milling around the world trade center on sept.11 , 2001 to the passengers on a madrid commuter train and the crowds packed on to a double-decker bus in london in 2005 . unfailingly , terrorism unleashes panic , whether its target is us imperialism or the " pig state " invoked by the raf . when their back is against the wall , societies tend to turn to overreact , employing such standard defense mechanisms as revenge .
anyone who remembers the mood in germany in the fateful autumn of 1977 will recall the loud clamors for a reintroduction of the death penalty - and how these calls seemed as excessive a reaction as the us-led attack on iraq as retaliation for sept .
11 seemed four years ago , notwithstanding the substantial differences between raf and islamist terrorism . raf terrorism was a targeted attack against those it saw as " arch capitalists . "
this was the group 's derogatory terms for all those who bore any degree of responsibility in democratic , free-market west germany .
to the raf , they were " guilty , " and victims such as the driver who died in a hail of bullets during schleyer 's abduction , were merely collateral damages .
in contrast , the terrorism of al qaeda might be highly precise in terms of its execution , but it claims lives randomly .
its victims are citizens of the free world .
to the raf , the enemy was the german state .
to the jihadists , the enemy is the western world , with all its freedom of belief and rampant consumerism . then and now , a society need to show terrorists that it will not be blackmailed .
germany paid a high price for refusing to release the raf terrorists held in stammheim - the life of hanns martin schleyer .
those in charge of negotiations that fateful autumn - including former chancellor helmut schmidt - are personally indebted to the schleyer family .
but they believed that the decision they made to sacrifice his life was justified , because they maintained the state 's integrity and stability . in 2007 , a similarly steadfast line needs to be taken when innocent hostages are taken by the taliban in afghanistan or gangs of rebels in iraq .
whether it comes in the form of kidnappings or suicide bombings , terrorism can only be dealt with by remaining strong .
negotiations and concessions are grist to the mill of international terrorism . but remaining strong is far from easy .
thirty years ago , the accusations that germany 's left was made up of " intellectual desk criminals " was an inappropriate as today 's attempt to blame islam for the actions of fanatical islamist terrorists .
only when religious freedom endures , even in times of terrorist threats , will freedom serve as proof of western strength .
and only when the state 's protective measures stop short of restricting individual freedoms will citizens start to show a long-term willingness to defend society 's values , liberal laws and democracies - an important principle to remember when the specter of terrorism is looming large . as the west continues to fight its war on terror , the lessons learnt 30 years ago seem more relevant than ever . daniel scheschkewitz was dw-radio 's us correspondent and now works as a special correspondent -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the days between the raf 's kidnapping on sept .
5 of hanns martin schleyer , president of the federation of german industries , and the discovery of his body on oct .
19 , plunged the country into a state of emergency .
the militant , left-wing group staged the abduction in a bid to blackmail the state into releasing 11 members of its group who were in prison in stuttgart-stammheim for numerous bomb attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz tens of thousands of police officers spent weeks searching for the kidnappers and their hostage .
politicians called for the death penalty .
captains of industry , judges and politicians were considered prime terrorist targets .
these weeks marked a watershed for post-war germany .
terrorism is a useful tool for political activists who lack influence - be they the left-wing rebels of germany 's red army faction , al qaeda fanatics or the taliban .
an act of terrorism is , literally , the last resort of the self-righteous revolutionary who has lost all sense of moderation and humanity .
then , potential targets are not just the captains of industry , judges and politicians , but anyone who simply happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time - from the businesspeople and tourists milling around the world trade center on sept.11 , 2001 to the passengers on a madrid commuter train and the crowds packed on to a double-decker bus in london in 2005 . unfailingly , terrorism unleashes panic , whether its target is us imperialism or the " pig state " invoked by the raf . when their back is against the wall , societies tend to turn to overreact , employing such standard defense mechanisms as revenge .
anyone who remembers the mood in germany in the fateful autumn of 1977 will recall the loud clamors for a reintroduction of the death penalty - and how these calls seemed as excessive a reaction as the us-led attack on iraq as retaliation for sept .
11 seemed four years ago , notwithstanding the substantial differences between raf and islamist terrorism . raf terrorism was a targeted attack against those it saw as " arch capitalists . "
this was the group 's derogatory terms for all those who bore any degree of responsibility in democratic , free-market west germany .
to the raf , they were " guilty , " and victims such as the driver who died in a hail of bullets during schleyer 's abduction , were merely collateral damages .
in contrast , the terrorism of al qaeda might be highly precise in terms of its execution , but it claims lives randomly .
its victims are citizens of the free world .
to the raf , the enemy was the german state .
to the jihadists , the enemy is the western world , with all its freedom of belief and rampant consumerism . then and now , a society need to show terrorists that it will not be blackmailed .
germany paid a high price for refusing to release the raf terrorists held in stammheim - the life of hanns martin schleyer .
those in charge of negotiations that fateful autumn - including former chancellor helmut schmidt - are personally indebted to the schleyer family .
but they believed that the decision they made to sacrifice his life was justified , because they maintained the state 's integrity and stability . in 2007 , a similarly steadfast line needs to be taken when innocent hostages are taken by the taliban in afghanistan or gangs of rebels in iraq .
whether it comes in the form of kidnappings or suicide bombings , terrorism can only be dealt with by remaining strong .
negotiations and concessions are grist to the mill of international terrorism . but remaining strong is far from easy .
thirty years ago , the accusations that germany 's left was made up of " intellectual desk criminals " was an inappropriate as today 's attempt to blame islam for the actions of fanatical islamist terrorists .
only when religious freedom endures , even in times of terrorist threats , will freedom serve as proof of western strength .
and only when the state 's protective measures stop short of restricting individual freedoms will citizens start to show a long-term willingness to defend society 's values , liberal laws and democracies - an important principle to remember when the specter of terrorism is looming large . as the west continues to fight its war on terror , the lessons learnt 30 years ago seem more relevant than ever . daniel scheschkewitz was dw-radio 's us correspondent and now works as a special correspondent -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 68-year-old engineer struck a plea bargain with prosecutors after he admitted in the pretoria high court to being involved in attempts to supply parts for libya 's aborted nuclear weapons program .
wisser , former managing director of johannesburg engineering company krisch , admitted he had played a role in a global black market in atomic weapons technology headed by disgraced pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan , who has admitted to helping nations under international embargo develop their weapons programs .
the case is part of an international effort to crack down on a network that has helped libya , north korea and iran skirt sanctions in their pursuit of nuclear technology .
the sentence also sets a precedent for the possible prosecution of other members in europe or asia , and wisser has agreed to cooperate with south african and overseas authorities in their investigations .
wisser denied he had suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a capsule of enriched uranium from iran his guilty plea marked a surprise turnaround in wisser 's case .
despite having worked on south africa 's secret apartheid-era nuclear program in the 1980s , wisser insisted he had suspected nothing when he was approached in 2000 by a nuclear industry contact about manufacturing a " compact pipework system " for an anonymous client , german news service dpa reported .
the client had paid him one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- to find a company in south africa to carry out the work .
wisser and his employee , swiss-born engineer daniel geiges , soon realized that the drawings were for a uranium enrichment plant .
wisser has always claimed that it never occurred to him that it could be for use in a nuclear weapons program .
ha awarded the contract to an old friend and fellow engineer with experience in the nuclear industry , johan meyer of tradefin engineering near johannesburg .
wisser repeatedly claimed he did not suspect he was abetting libya 's nuclear program until mid-2003 and that he believed he was working for pakistan 's nuclear energy program - even when two libyan engineers arrived in south africa to inspect the plant in 2002 .
" the realization dawned " after meyer received a payment from libya in 2003 , but wisser only pulled the plug on the plant when italian and us authorities intercepted a ship carrying parts for libya 's nuclear program off the coast of italy in october 2003 , exposing moammar gadhafi 's then atomic ambitions .
the order was given in a text message to meyer urging him " to destroy the bird -lrb- plant -rrb- and all its feathers -lrb- project -rrb- . "
meyer , who later turned state witness , ignored the instructions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wissser admitted to manufacturing nuclear material when south african authorities raided tradefin 's premises near johannesburg in september 2004 , they found the bones of a two-storey uranium enrichment plant packed and ready for shipment .
according to experts , it could have been used to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for several nuclear bombs a year .
factors for a lenient sentence wisser 's agreement to cooperate with authorities in south africa and abroad in the investigation of other players in the network may have helped secure his lenient sentence .
state prosecutor r c macadam also cited wisser 's age and the prosecution 's desire to avoid a potentially years-long trial in explaining the plea bargain , which also sees wisser forfeit six million rand -lrb- $ 800,000 -rrb- in cash and over 2.8 million euros in overseas assets .
" we regard the conviction as a significant step in combating nuclear proliferation networks , " said south africa 's national prosecuting authority -lrb- npa -rrb- in a statement . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 05.09.2007 german engineer guilty of nuclear-technology smuggling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard wisser -lrb- r -rrb- and daniel geiges -lrb- l -rrb- : players in a global black market a south african court has found a german engineer guilty of seven charges of contravening the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction act and the nuclear energy act , and two counts of forgery . gerhard wisser was sentenced to three years under house arrest and given a suspended jail sentence of 18 years .
the 68-year-old engineer struck a plea bargain with prosecutors after he admitted in the pretoria high court to being involved in attempts to supply parts for libya 's aborted nuclear weapons program .
wisser , former managing director of johannesburg engineering company krisch , admitted he had played a role in a global black market in atomic weapons technology headed by disgraced pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan , who has admitted to helping nations under international embargo develop their weapons programs .
the case is part of an international effort to crack down on a network that has helped libya , north korea and iran skirt sanctions in their pursuit of nuclear technology .
the sentence also sets a precedent for the possible prosecution of other members in europe or asia , and wisser has agreed to cooperate with south african and overseas authorities in their investigations .
wisser denied he had suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a capsule of enriched uranium from iran his guilty plea marked a surprise turnaround in wisser 's case .
despite having worked on south africa 's secret apartheid-era nuclear program in the 1980s , wisser insisted he had suspected nothing when he was approached in 2000 by a nuclear industry contact about manufacturing a " compact pipework system " for an anonymous client , german news service dpa reported .
the client had paid him one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- to find a company in south africa to carry out the work .
wisser and his employee , swiss-born engineer daniel geiges , soon realized that the drawings were for a uranium enrichment plant .
wisser has always claimed that it never occurred to him that it could be for use in a nuclear weapons program .
ha awarded the contract to an old friend and fellow engineer with experience in the nuclear industry , johan meyer of tradefin engineering near johannesburg .
wisser repeatedly claimed he did not suspect he was abetting libya 's nuclear program until mid-2003 and that he believed he was working for pakistan 's nuclear energy program - even when two libyan engineers arrived in south africa to inspect the plant in 2002 .
" the realization dawned " after meyer received a payment from libya in 2003 , but wisser only pulled the plug on the plant when italian and us authorities intercepted a ship carrying parts for libya 's nuclear program off the coast of italy in october 2003 , exposing moammar gadhafi 's then atomic ambitions .
the order was given in a text message to meyer urging him " to destroy the bird -lrb- plant -rrb- and all its feathers -lrb- project -rrb- . "
meyer , who later turned state witness , ignored the instructions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wissser admitted to manufacturing nuclear material when south african authorities raided tradefin 's premises near johannesburg in september 2004 , they found the bones of a two-storey uranium enrichment plant packed and ready for shipment .
according to experts , it could have been used to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for several nuclear bombs a year .
factors for a lenient sentence wisser 's agreement to cooperate with authorities in south africa and abroad in the investigation of other players in the network may have helped secure his lenient sentence .
state prosecutor r c macadam also cited wisser 's age and the prosecution 's desire to avoid a potentially years-long trial in explaining the plea bargain , which also sees wisser forfeit six million rand -lrb- $ 800,000 -rrb- in cash and over 2.8 million euros in overseas assets .

the days between the raf 's kidnapping on sept .
5 of hanns martin schleyer , president of the federation of german industries , and the discovery of his body on oct .
19 , plunged the country into a state of emergency .
the militant , left-wing group staged the abduction in a bid to blackmail the state into releasing 11 members of its group who were in prison in stuttgart-stammheim for numerous bomb attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz tens of thousands of police officers spent weeks searching for the kidnappers and their hostage .
politicians called for the death penalty .
captains of industry , judges and politicians were considered prime terrorist targets .
these weeks marked a watershed for post-war germany .
terrorism is a useful tool for political activists who lack influence - be they the left-wing rebels of germany 's red army faction , al qaeda fanatics or the taliban .
an act of terrorism is , literally , the last resort of the self-righteous revolutionary who has lost all sense of moderation and humanity .
then , potential targets are not just the captains of industry , judges and politicians , but anyone who simply happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time - from the businesspeople and tourists milling around the world trade center on sept.11 , 2001 to the passengers on a madrid commuter train and the crowds packed on to a double-decker bus in london in 2005 . unfailingly , terrorism unleashes panic , whether its target is us imperialism or the " pig state " invoked by the raf . when their back is against the wall , societies tend to turn to overreact , employing such standard defense mechanisms as revenge .
anyone who remembers the mood in germany in the fateful autumn of 1977 will recall the loud clamors for a reintroduction of the death penalty - and how these calls seemed as excessive a reaction as the us-led attack on iraq as retaliation for sept .
11 seemed four years ago , notwithstanding the substantial differences between raf and islamist terrorism . raf terrorism was a targeted attack against those it saw as " arch capitalists . "
this was the group 's derogatory terms for all those who bore any degree of responsibility in democratic , free-market west germany .
to the raf , they were " guilty , " and victims such as the driver who died in a hail of bullets during schleyer 's abduction , were merely collateral damages .
in contrast , the terrorism of al qaeda might be highly precise in terms of its execution , but it claims lives randomly .
its victims are citizens of the free world .
to the raf , the enemy was the german state .
to the jihadists , the enemy is the western world , with all its freedom of belief and rampant consumerism . then and now , a society need to show terrorists that it will not be blackmailed .
germany paid a high price for refusing to release the raf terrorists held in stammheim - the life of hanns martin schleyer .
those in charge of negotiations that fateful autumn - including former chancellor helmut schmidt - are personally indebted to the schleyer family .
but they believed that the decision they made to sacrifice his life was justified , because they maintained the state 's integrity and stability . in 2007 , a similarly steadfast line needs to be taken when innocent hostages are taken by the taliban in afghanistan or gangs of rebels in iraq .
whether it comes in the form of kidnappings or suicide bombings , terrorism can only be dealt with by remaining strong .
negotiations and concessions are grist to the mill of international terrorism . but remaining strong is far from easy .
thirty years ago , the accusations that germany 's left was made up of " intellectual desk criminals " was an inappropriate as today 's attempt to blame islam for the actions of fanatical islamist terrorists .
only when religious freedom endures , even in times of terrorist threats , will freedom serve as proof of western strength .
and only when the state 's protective measures stop short of restricting individual freedoms will citizens start to show a long-term willingness to defend society 's values , liberal laws and democracies - an important principle to remember when the specter of terrorism is looming large . as the west continues to fight its war on terror , the lessons learnt 30 years ago seem more relevant than ever . daniel scheschkewitz was dw-radio 's us correspondent and now works as a special correspondent -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

terrorism is a useful tool for political activists who lack influence - be they the left-wing rebels of germany 's red army faction , al qaeda fanatics or the taliban .
an act of terrorism is , literally , the last resort of the self-righteous revolutionary who has lost all sense of moderation and humanity .
then , potential targets are not just the captains of industry , judges and politicians , but anyone who simply happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time - from the businesspeople and tourists milling around the world trade center on sept.11 , 2001 to the passengers on a madrid commuter train and the crowds packed on to a double-decker bus in london in 2005 . unfailingly , terrorism unleashes panic , whether its target is us imperialism or the " pig state " invoked by the raf . when their back is against the wall , societies tend to turn to overreact , employing such standard defense mechanisms as revenge .

11 seemed four years ago , notwithstanding the substantial differences between raf and islamist terrorism . raf terrorism was a targeted attack against those it saw as " arch capitalists . "
this was the group 's derogatory terms for all those who bore any degree of responsibility in democratic , free-market west germany .
to the raf , they were " guilty , " and victims such as the driver who died in a hail of bullets during schleyer 's abduction , were merely collateral damages .
in contrast , the terrorism of al qaeda might be highly precise in terms of its execution , but it claims lives randomly .
its victims are citizens of the free world .
to the raf , the enemy was the german state .
to the jihadists , the enemy is the western world , with all its freedom of belief and rampant consumerism . then and now , a society need to show terrorists that it will not be blackmailed .
germany paid a high price for refusing to release the raf terrorists held in stammheim - the life of hanns martin schleyer .
those in charge of negotiations that fateful autumn - including former chancellor helmut schmidt - are personally indebted to the schleyer family .
but they believed that the decision they made to sacrifice his life was justified , because they maintained the state 's integrity and stability . in 2007 , a similarly steadfast line needs to be taken when innocent hostages are taken by the taliban in afghanistan or gangs of rebels in iraq .
whether it comes in the form of kidnappings or suicide bombings , terrorism can only be dealt with by remaining strong .
negotiations and concessions are grist to the mill of international terrorism . but remaining strong is far from easy .
thirty years ago , the accusations that germany 's left was made up of " intellectual desk criminals " was an inappropriate as today 's attempt to blame islam for the actions of fanatical islamist terrorists .
only when religious freedom endures , even in times of terrorist threats , will freedom serve as proof of western strength .
and only when the state 's protective measures stop short of restricting individual freedoms will citizens start to show a long-term willingness to defend society 's values , liberal laws and democracies - an important principle to remember when the specter of terrorism is looming large . as the west continues to fight its war on terror , the lessons learnt 30 years ago seem more relevant than ever . daniel scheschkewitz was dw-radio 's us correspondent and now works as a special correspondent -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

shifting the focus from military action to civil reconstruction , berlin aims to help reform and improve the afghan justice ministry and judicial system . german chancellor angela merkel has repeatedly stressed the need for both military and civil involvement in the region . defense minister franz josef jung again ruled out deploying german troops to troubled southern afghanistan from their bases in the relatively secure north of the country .
he also stressed the need to continue political and civil rebuilding efforts . " we aim to push on with the training of afghan security forces in the north , " jung told national public television wednesday .
" there will be no deployment of our troops to the south . " german military means are insufficient to bring stability to afghanistan ; and reconstruction and development are needed , he added . no ' resting spot ' for terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel would like to boost the afghan justice system berlin aims to keep afghanistan from returning to a " resting , hiding , and regeneration spot for international terrorists , " the afp news service quoted from the cabinet paper . the german parliament still needs to approve the administration 's plan . the public needs to look at germany 's military deployment in afghanistan as a means of domestic protection against terrorism , merkel and foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier have said in earlier interviews . " in that way , the afghanistan engagement serves german interests , " the government 's position paper said . opposition politicians and critics responded hotly to the newly approved policy plan , demanding a series of improvements . the german government missed the chance for a " desperately needed strategy change , " said greens parliamentary party leader jürgen trittin on wednesday after the cabinet 's decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung says he wo n't send his soldiers south the children 's aid organization world vision said germany should be involved in rebuilding efforts rather than military deployments in afghanistan . the current security environment continues to be worrisome , especially in southern and eastern afghanistan , where nato troops are fighting against the taliban . jung said the german troops were prepared to help in emergency situations , but bundeswehr training officers would not accompany the afghan forces they had trained on deployments in the south . bundeswehr deployment expected to continue on tuesday , merkel predicted the german deployment would last several years .
former german defense minister and current social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- parliamentary leader peter struck estimated on saturday that the international community , including germany , would remain in afghanistan for at least a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany sent tornado surveillance jets to afghanistan the german parliament has approved a mandate for up to 3,000 troops to serve in northern afghanistan .
in addition , six tornado reconnaissance jets have been deployed with up to 500 personnel under a six-month mandate since april . the government plans to combine these two mandates , both of which are part of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , and to seek renewed approval for them from parliament next month . third mandate questioned a third mandate for up to 100 german special forces to be deployed to the us-led operation enduring freedom -lrb- oef -rrb- comes up for renewal in november and is more controversial among german politicians . the troops are not currently taking part in military operations , and there is considerable parliamentary opposition to renewing their mandate , although merkel is in favor of extending it .

the 68-year-old engineer struck a plea bargain with prosecutors after he admitted in the pretoria high court to being involved in attempts to supply parts for libya 's aborted nuclear weapons program .
wisser , former managing director of johannesburg engineering company krisch , admitted he had played a role in a global black market in atomic weapons technology headed by disgraced pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan , who has admitted to helping nations under international embargo develop their weapons programs .
the case is part of an international effort to crack down on a network that has helped libya , north korea and iran skirt sanctions in their pursuit of nuclear technology .
the sentence also sets a precedent for the possible prosecution of other members in europe or asia , and wisser has agreed to cooperate with south african and overseas authorities in their investigations .
wisser denied he had suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a capsule of enriched uranium from iran his guilty plea marked a surprise turnaround in wisser 's case .
despite having worked on south africa 's secret apartheid-era nuclear program in the 1980s , wisser insisted he had suspected nothing when he was approached in 2000 by a nuclear industry contact about manufacturing a " compact pipework system " for an anonymous client , german news service dpa reported .
the client had paid him one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- to find a company in south africa to carry out the work .
wisser and his employee , swiss-born engineer daniel geiges , soon realized that the drawings were for a uranium enrichment plant .
wisser has always claimed that it never occurred to him that it could be for use in a nuclear weapons program .
ha awarded the contract to an old friend and fellow engineer with experience in the nuclear industry , johan meyer of tradefin engineering near johannesburg .
wisser repeatedly claimed he did not suspect he was abetting libya 's nuclear program until mid-2003 and that he believed he was working for pakistan 's nuclear energy program - even when two libyan engineers arrived in south africa to inspect the plant in 2002 .
" the realization dawned " after meyer received a payment from libya in 2003 , but wisser only pulled the plug on the plant when italian and us authorities intercepted a ship carrying parts for libya 's nuclear program off the coast of italy in october 2003 , exposing moammar gadhafi 's then atomic ambitions .
the order was given in a text message to meyer urging him " to destroy the bird -lrb- plant -rrb- and all its feathers -lrb- project -rrb- . "
meyer , who later turned state witness , ignored the instructions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wissser admitted to manufacturing nuclear material when south african authorities raided tradefin 's premises near johannesburg in september 2004 , they found the bones of a two-storey uranium enrichment plant packed and ready for shipment .
according to experts , it could have been used to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for several nuclear bombs a year .
factors for a lenient sentence wisser 's agreement to cooperate with authorities in south africa and abroad in the investigation of other players in the network may have helped secure his lenient sentence .
state prosecutor r c macadam also cited wisser 's age and the prosecution 's desire to avoid a potentially years-long trial in explaining the plea bargain , which also sees wisser forfeit six million rand -lrb- $ 800,000 -rrb- in cash and over 2.8 million euros in overseas assets .

investigators suggested that us military facilities in germany could have been the targets . german federal prosecutor monika harms said the three men arrested tuesday were two german converts to islam and a turkish muslim , all in their 20s .
the men are being held on charges of membership in a terrorist organization and preparing a bomb attack . harms said the men were members of the islamic jihad union , which has its origins in uzbekistan .
the three suspects attended a militant training camp in pakistan last year , she said at a press conference wednesday in karlsruhe . prosecutors also said investigators were still looking for another five suspects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seized containers of hydrogen peroxide solution harms said the men in custody , identified as fritz g. , adem y. and daniel s. , had been able to collect massive quantities of hydrogen peroxide . that same household chemical was used by suicide bombers in the 2005 london public transport attacks that killed 56 people . she said once turned into bombs , the material could have created an explosion with the same strength as 550 kilograms -lrb- 1,210 pounds -rrb- of dynamite . links to al qaeda german security forces were able to apprehend the three suspects and seize the materials tuesday in the small town of oberschledorn in the state of north rhine-westphalia . german chancellor angela merkel said the arrests showed terror attacks in germany were " not an abstract danger but a very real threat . " defense minister franz josef jung said police had stopped an " imminent threat " to germany . jörg ziercke , head of germany 's federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the islamic jihad union had ties to the al qaeda terrorist network and that the men accused of planning the attacks in germany were " driven by a hatred of us citizens . " ziercke said security forces decided to move in on the suspects tuesday when it became clear the three had begun creating bombs .
harms added that the suspects were taken into custody before making a functioning explosive . us bases could have been targets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harms -lrb- left -rrb- and ziercke in karlsruhe refering to the terror suspects ' aims , deputy interior minister august hanning told journalists in berlin : " there were no concrete targets .

among the most dramatic was that of hanns martin schleyer , president of the federation of german industries . on sept .
5 , 1977 , a red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- commando opened fire on a convoy in which hanns martin schleyer , head of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , was traveling .
his four escorts were shot dead and schleyer was dragged out of the car and kidnapped .
it was the beginning of what has gone down in history as the " deutscher herbst , " germany 's autumn of terror . the militant , left-wing raf staged the murders and abduction in a bid to blackmail the state into releasing 11 members of its group who were in prison in stuttgart for numerous bomb attacks .
among the inmates were the heart and mind of the red army faction , andreas baader , gudrun ensslin and jan-carl raspe .
from their cells , they continued to control the armed battle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas baader and gudrun ensslin meanwhile a second generation red army faction had evolved , no longer set on causes such as the fight against capitalism , but on securing the release of the ringleaders . government refused to meet demands but the german government under chancellor helmut schmidt was not prepared to play ball .
four hours after schleyer 's abduction , he gave a television address in which he spoke directly to the kidnappers . " they might , right now , be experiencing a feeling of triumph , " he said .
" but they should not be mistaken .
terrorism stands no chance in the long term . " for the 44 days in which schleyer was held captive , germany was in a state of emergency .
ministries in the capital , bonn , were barricaded with barbed wire , armored vehicles drove through the streets and crisis meetings between the government and the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- met several times daily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanns martin schleyer " prisoner for 31 days " suspecting that the schleyer attack had been masterminded from inside the stuttgart prison , the government quickly passed a law prohibiting raf inmates from speaking to one another or to their lawyers . the bka launched an extensive search operation , combing through thousands of apartments and distributing millions of flyers with mug shots of raf members .
but the kidnappers insisted on their conditions and the investigators failed to find schleyer , who with his nazi background and powerful position in the economy , represented everything the terrorists deemed the enemy . hijacking reiterated demands schleyer was still alive on oct .
13 , 1977 when four palestinian terrorists , who supported the activities of the raf , hijacked a lufthansa plane with 87 people on board .
the hostage-takers threatened to kill the passengers if the german government did n't release the prisoners in stuttgart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hijacked lufthansa plane after a dramatic odyssey , the plane landed in the somalian capital mogadishu where it stayed for five days until a german special unit moved in and secured the release of 86 people .
the pilot had been killed earlier . when the raf prisoners heard the news in their cells , they committed suicide the same night .
one day later , the body of schleyer was found in the trunk of a car .
even today , it is not known who fired the fatal shot . raf debate continues today bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former raf terrorist christian klar schleyer 's death marked the end of the autumn of terror , but the memories of the 1977 terrorism have not been forgotten . even now , 30 years later , there is still intense public debate about how the state should treat former raf terrorists , such as christian klar .
he has been in prison since 1982 , in part for the collaborative kidnapping and murder of schleyer .
german president horst köhler rejected his plea for clemency in may of this year .

it was the beginning of what has gone down in history as the " deutscher herbst , " germany 's autumn of terror . the militant , left-wing raf staged the murders and abduction in a bid to blackmail the state into releasing 11 members of its group who were in prison in stuttgart for numerous bomb attacks .
among the inmates were the heart and mind of the red army faction , andreas baader , gudrun ensslin and jan-carl raspe .
from their cells , they continued to control the armed battle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas baader and gudrun ensslin meanwhile a second generation red army faction had evolved , no longer set on causes such as the fight against capitalism , but on securing the release of the ringleaders . government refused to meet demands but the german government under chancellor helmut schmidt was not prepared to play ball .
four hours after schleyer 's abduction , he gave a television address in which he spoke directly to the kidnappers . " they might , right now , be experiencing a feeling of triumph , " he said .
" but they should not be mistaken .
terrorism stands no chance in the long term . " for the 44 days in which schleyer was held captive , germany was in a state of emergency .
ministries in the capital , bonn , were barricaded with barbed wire , armored vehicles drove through the streets and crisis meetings between the government and the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- met several times daily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanns martin schleyer " prisoner for 31 days " suspecting that the schleyer attack had been masterminded from inside the stuttgart prison , the government quickly passed a law prohibiting raf inmates from speaking to one another or to their lawyers . the bka launched an extensive search operation , combing through thousands of apartments and distributing millions of flyers with mug shots of raf members .
but the kidnappers insisted on their conditions and the investigators failed to find schleyer , who with his nazi background and powerful position in the economy , represented everything the terrorists deemed the enemy . hijacking reiterated demands schleyer was still alive on oct .
13 , 1977 when four palestinian terrorists , who supported the activities of the raf , hijacked a lufthansa plane with 87 people on board .
the hostage-takers threatened to kill the passengers if the german government did n't release the prisoners in stuttgart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hijacked lufthansa plane after a dramatic odyssey , the plane landed in the somalian capital mogadishu where it stayed for five days until a german special unit moved in and secured the release of 86 people .
the pilot had been killed earlier . when the raf prisoners heard the news in their cells , they committed suicide the same night .
one day later , the body of schleyer was found in the trunk of a car .
even today , it is not known who fired the fatal shot . raf debate continues today bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former raf terrorist christian klar schleyer 's death marked the end of the autumn of terror , but the memories of the 1977 terrorism have not been forgotten . even now , 30 years later , there is still intense public debate about how the state should treat former raf terrorists , such as christian klar .
he has been in prison since 1982 , in part for the collaborative kidnapping and murder of schleyer .
german president horst köhler rejected his plea for clemency in may of this year .
other raf have been released from prison after courts said they no longer posed a threat to society . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 05.09.2007 german engineer guilty of nuclear-technology smuggling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard wisser -lrb- r -rrb- and daniel geiges -lrb- l -rrb- : players in a global black market a south african court has found a german engineer guilty of seven charges of contravening the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction act and the nuclear energy act , and two counts of forgery . gerhard wisser was sentenced to three years under house arrest and given a suspended jail sentence of 18 years .
the 68-year-old engineer struck a plea bargain with prosecutors after he admitted in the pretoria high court to being involved in attempts to supply parts for libya 's aborted nuclear weapons program .
wisser , former managing director of johannesburg engineering company krisch , admitted he had played a role in a global black market in atomic weapons technology headed by disgraced pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan , who has admitted to helping nations under international embargo develop their weapons programs .
the case is part of an international effort to crack down on a network that has helped libya , north korea and iran skirt sanctions in their pursuit of nuclear technology .
the sentence also sets a precedent for the possible prosecution of other members in europe or asia , and wisser has agreed to cooperate with south african and overseas authorities in their investigations .
wisser denied he had suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a capsule of enriched uranium from iran his guilty plea marked a surprise turnaround in wisser 's case .
despite having worked on south africa 's secret apartheid-era nuclear program in the 1980s , wisser insisted he had suspected nothing when he was approached in 2000 by a nuclear industry contact about manufacturing a " compact pipework system " for an anonymous client , german news service dpa reported .
the client had paid him one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- to find a company in south africa to carry out the work .
wisser and his employee , swiss-born engineer daniel geiges , soon realized that the drawings were for a uranium enrichment plant .
wisser has always claimed that it never occurred to him that it could be for use in a nuclear weapons program .
ha awarded the contract to an old friend and fellow engineer with experience in the nuclear industry , johan meyer of tradefin engineering near johannesburg .
wisser repeatedly claimed he did not suspect he was abetting libya 's nuclear program until mid-2003 and that he believed he was working for pakistan 's nuclear energy program - even when two libyan engineers arrived in south africa to inspect the plant in 2002 .
" the realization dawned " after meyer received a payment from libya in 2003 , but wisser only pulled the plug on the plant when italian and us authorities intercepted a ship carrying parts for libya 's nuclear program off the coast of italy in october 2003 , exposing moammar gadhafi 's then atomic ambitions .
the order was given in a text message to meyer urging him " to destroy the bird -lrb- plant -rrb- and all its feathers -lrb- project -rrb- . "
meyer , who later turned state witness , ignored the instructions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wissser admitted to manufacturing nuclear material when south african authorities raided tradefin 's premises near johannesburg in september 2004 , they found the bones of a two-storey uranium enrichment plant packed and ready for shipment .
according to experts , it could have been used to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for several nuclear bombs a year .
factors for a lenient sentence wisser 's agreement to cooperate with authorities in south africa and abroad in the investigation of other players in the network may have helped secure his lenient sentence .
state prosecutor r c macadam also cited wisser 's age and the prosecution 's desire to avoid a potentially years-long trial in explaining the plea bargain , which also sees wisser forfeit six million rand -lrb- $ 800,000 -rrb- in cash and over 2.8 million euros in overseas assets .
" we regard the conviction as a significant step in combating nuclear proliferation networks , " said south africa 's national prosecuting authority -lrb- npa -rrb- in a statement . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

among the most dramatic was that of hanns martin schleyer , president of the federation of german industries . on sept .
5 , 1977 , a red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- commando opened fire on a convoy in which hanns martin schleyer , head of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , was traveling .
his four escorts were shot dead and schleyer was dragged out of the car and kidnapped .
it was the beginning of what has gone down in history as the " deutscher herbst , " germany 's autumn of terror . the militant , left-wing raf staged the murders and abduction in a bid to blackmail the state into releasing 11 members of its group who were in prison in stuttgart for numerous bomb attacks .
among the inmates were the heart and mind of the red army faction , andreas baader , gudrun ensslin and jan-carl raspe .
from their cells , they continued to control the armed battle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas baader and gudrun ensslin meanwhile a second generation red army faction had evolved , no longer set on causes such as the fight against capitalism , but on securing the release of the ringleaders . government refused to meet demands but the german government under chancellor helmut schmidt was not prepared to play ball .
four hours after schleyer 's abduction , he gave a television address in which he spoke directly to the kidnappers . " they might , right now , be experiencing a feeling of triumph , " he said .
" but they should not be mistaken .
terrorism stands no chance in the long term . " for the 44 days in which schleyer was held captive , germany was in a state of emergency .
ministries in the capital , bonn , were barricaded with barbed wire , armored vehicles drove through the streets and crisis meetings between the government and the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- met several times daily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanns martin schleyer " prisoner for 31 days " suspecting that the schleyer attack had been masterminded from inside the stuttgart prison , the government quickly passed a law prohibiting raf inmates from speaking to one another or to their lawyers . the bka launched an extensive search operation , combing through thousands of apartments and distributing millions of flyers with mug shots of raf members .
but the kidnappers insisted on their conditions and the investigators failed to find schleyer , who with his nazi background and powerful position in the economy , represented everything the terrorists deemed the enemy . hijacking reiterated demands schleyer was still alive on oct .

the 68-year-old engineer struck a plea bargain with prosecutors after he admitted in the pretoria high court to being involved in attempts to supply parts for libya 's aborted nuclear weapons program .
wisser , former managing director of johannesburg engineering company krisch , admitted he had played a role in a global black market in atomic weapons technology headed by disgraced pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan , who has admitted to helping nations under international embargo develop their weapons programs .
the case is part of an international effort to crack down on a network that has helped libya , north korea and iran skirt sanctions in their pursuit of nuclear technology .
the sentence also sets a precedent for the possible prosecution of other members in europe or asia , and wisser has agreed to cooperate with south african and overseas authorities in their investigations .
wisser denied he had suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a capsule of enriched uranium from iran his guilty plea marked a surprise turnaround in wisser 's case .
despite having worked on south africa 's secret apartheid-era nuclear program in the 1980s , wisser insisted he had suspected nothing when he was approached in 2000 by a nuclear industry contact about manufacturing a " compact pipework system " for an anonymous client , german news service dpa reported .
the client had paid him one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- to find a company in south africa to carry out the work .
wisser and his employee , swiss-born engineer daniel geiges , soon realized that the drawings were for a uranium enrichment plant .
wisser has always claimed that it never occurred to him that it could be for use in a nuclear weapons program .
ha awarded the contract to an old friend and fellow engineer with experience in the nuclear industry , johan meyer of tradefin engineering near johannesburg .
wisser repeatedly claimed he did not suspect he was abetting libya 's nuclear program until mid-2003 and that he believed he was working for pakistan 's nuclear energy program - even when two libyan engineers arrived in south africa to inspect the plant in 2002 .
" the realization dawned " after meyer received a payment from libya in 2003 , but wisser only pulled the plug on the plant when italian and us authorities intercepted a ship carrying parts for libya 's nuclear program off the coast of italy in october 2003 , exposing moammar gadhafi 's then atomic ambitions .
the order was given in a text message to meyer urging him " to destroy the bird -lrb- plant -rrb- and all its feathers -lrb- project -rrb- . "
meyer , who later turned state witness , ignored the instructions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wissser admitted to manufacturing nuclear material when south african authorities raided tradefin 's premises near johannesburg in september 2004 , they found the bones of a two-storey uranium enrichment plant packed and ready for shipment .
according to experts , it could have been used to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for several nuclear bombs a year .
factors for a lenient sentence wisser 's agreement to cooperate with authorities in south africa and abroad in the investigation of other players in the network may have helped secure his lenient sentence .
state prosecutor r c macadam also cited wisser 's age and the prosecution 's desire to avoid a potentially years-long trial in explaining the plea bargain , which also sees wisser forfeit six million rand -lrb- $ 800,000 -rrb- in cash and over 2.8 million euros in overseas assets .
" we regard the conviction as a significant step in combating nuclear proliferation networks , " said south africa 's national prosecuting authority -lrb- npa -rrb- in a statement . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 , 1977 , a red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- commando opened fire on a convoy in which hanns martin schleyer , head of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , was traveling .
his four escorts were shot dead and schleyer was dragged out of the car and kidnapped .
it was the beginning of what has gone down in history as the " deutscher herbst , " germany 's autumn of terror . the militant , left-wing raf staged the murders and abduction in a bid to blackmail the state into releasing 11 members of its group who were in prison in stuttgart for numerous bomb attacks .
among the inmates were the heart and mind of the red army faction , andreas baader , gudrun ensslin and jan-carl raspe .
from their cells , they continued to control the armed battle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas baader and gudrun ensslin meanwhile a second generation red army faction had evolved , no longer set on causes such as the fight against capitalism , but on securing the release of the ringleaders . government refused to meet demands but the german government under chancellor helmut schmidt was not prepared to play ball .
four hours after schleyer 's abduction , he gave a television address in which he spoke directly to the kidnappers . " they might , right now , be experiencing a feeling of triumph , " he said .
" but they should not be mistaken .
terrorism stands no chance in the long term . " for the 44 days in which schleyer was held captive , germany was in a state of emergency .
ministries in the capital , bonn , were barricaded with barbed wire , armored vehicles drove through the streets and crisis meetings between the government and the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- met several times daily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanns martin schleyer " prisoner for 31 days " suspecting that the schleyer attack had been masterminded from inside the stuttgart prison , the government quickly passed a law prohibiting raf inmates from speaking to one another or to their lawyers . the bka launched an extensive search operation , combing through thousands of apartments and distributing millions of flyers with mug shots of raf members .
but the kidnappers insisted on their conditions and the investigators failed to find schleyer , who with his nazi background and powerful position in the economy , represented everything the terrorists deemed the enemy . hijacking reiterated demands schleyer was still alive on oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 05.09.2007 german engineer guilty of nuclear-technology smuggling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard wisser -lrb- r -rrb- and daniel geiges -lrb- l -rrb- : players in a global black market a south african court has found a german engineer guilty of seven charges of contravening the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction act and the nuclear energy act , and two counts of forgery . gerhard wisser was sentenced to three years under house arrest and given a suspended jail sentence of 18 years .
the 68-year-old engineer struck a plea bargain with prosecutors after he admitted in the pretoria high court to being involved in attempts to supply parts for libya 's aborted nuclear weapons program .
wisser , former managing director of johannesburg engineering company krisch , admitted he had played a role in a global black market in atomic weapons technology headed by disgraced pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan , who has admitted to helping nations under international embargo develop their weapons programs .
the case is part of an international effort to crack down on a network that has helped libya , north korea and iran skirt sanctions in their pursuit of nuclear technology .
the sentence also sets a precedent for the possible prosecution of other members in europe or asia , and wisser has agreed to cooperate with south african and overseas authorities in their investigations .
wisser denied he had suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a capsule of enriched uranium from iran his guilty plea marked a surprise turnaround in wisser 's case .
despite having worked on south africa 's secret apartheid-era nuclear program in the 1980s , wisser insisted he had suspected nothing when he was approached in 2000 by a nuclear industry contact about manufacturing a " compact pipework system " for an anonymous client , german news service dpa reported .
the client had paid him one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- to find a company in south africa to carry out the work .
wisser and his employee , swiss-born engineer daniel geiges , soon realized that the drawings were for a uranium enrichment plant .
wisser has always claimed that it never occurred to him that it could be for use in a nuclear weapons program .
ha awarded the contract to an old friend and fellow engineer with experience in the nuclear industry , johan meyer of tradefin engineering near johannesburg .
wisser repeatedly claimed he did not suspect he was abetting libya 's nuclear program until mid-2003 and that he believed he was working for pakistan 's nuclear energy program - even when two libyan engineers arrived in south africa to inspect the plant in 2002 .
" the realization dawned " after meyer received a payment from libya in 2003 , but wisser only pulled the plug on the plant when italian and us authorities intercepted a ship carrying parts for libya 's nuclear program off the coast of italy in october 2003 , exposing moammar gadhafi 's then atomic ambitions .
the order was given in a text message to meyer urging him " to destroy the bird -lrb- plant -rrb- and all its feathers -lrb- project -rrb- . "
meyer , who later turned state witness , ignored the instructions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wissser admitted to manufacturing nuclear material when south african authorities raided tradefin 's premises near johannesburg in september 2004 , they found the bones of a two-storey uranium enrichment plant packed and ready for shipment .
according to experts , it could have been used to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for several nuclear bombs a year .
factors for a lenient sentence wisser 's agreement to cooperate with authorities in south africa and abroad in the investigation of other players in the network may have helped secure his lenient sentence .
state prosecutor r c macadam also cited wisser 's age and the prosecution 's desire to avoid a potentially years-long trial in explaining the plea bargain , which also sees wisser forfeit six million rand -lrb- $ 800,000 -rrb- in cash and over 2.8 million euros in overseas assets .
" we regard the conviction as a significant step in combating nuclear proliferation networks , " said south africa 's national prosecuting authority -lrb- npa -rrb- in a statement . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 68-year-old engineer struck a plea bargain with prosecutors after he admitted in the pretoria high court to being involved in attempts to supply parts for libya 's aborted nuclear weapons program .
wisser , former managing director of johannesburg engineering company krisch , admitted he had played a role in a global black market in atomic weapons technology headed by disgraced pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan , who has admitted to helping nations under international embargo develop their weapons programs .
the case is part of an international effort to crack down on a network that has helped libya , north korea and iran skirt sanctions in their pursuit of nuclear technology .
the sentence also sets a precedent for the possible prosecution of other members in europe or asia , and wisser has agreed to cooperate with south african and overseas authorities in their investigations .
wisser denied he had suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a capsule of enriched uranium from iran his guilty plea marked a surprise turnaround in wisser 's case .
despite having worked on south africa 's secret apartheid-era nuclear program in the 1980s , wisser insisted he had suspected nothing when he was approached in 2000 by a nuclear industry contact about manufacturing a " compact pipework system " for an anonymous client , german news service dpa reported .
the client had paid him one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- to find a company in south africa to carry out the work .
wisser and his employee , swiss-born engineer daniel geiges , soon realized that the drawings were for a uranium enrichment plant .
wisser has always claimed that it never occurred to him that it could be for use in a nuclear weapons program .
ha awarded the contract to an old friend and fellow engineer with experience in the nuclear industry , johan meyer of tradefin engineering near johannesburg .
wisser repeatedly claimed he did not suspect he was abetting libya 's nuclear program until mid-2003 and that he believed he was working for pakistan 's nuclear energy program - even when two libyan engineers arrived in south africa to inspect the plant in 2002 .
" the realization dawned " after meyer received a payment from libya in 2003 , but wisser only pulled the plug on the plant when italian and us authorities intercepted a ship carrying parts for libya 's nuclear program off the coast of italy in october 2003 , exposing moammar gadhafi 's then atomic ambitions .
the order was given in a text message to meyer urging him " to destroy the bird -lrb- plant -rrb- and all its feathers -lrb- project -rrb- . "
meyer , who later turned state witness , ignored the instructions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wissser admitted to manufacturing nuclear material when south african authorities raided tradefin 's premises near johannesburg in september 2004 , they found the bones of a two-storey uranium enrichment plant packed and ready for shipment .
according to experts , it could have been used to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for several nuclear bombs a year .
factors for a lenient sentence wisser 's agreement to cooperate with authorities in south africa and abroad in the investigation of other players in the network may have helped secure his lenient sentence .
state prosecutor r c macadam also cited wisser 's age and the prosecution 's desire to avoid a potentially years-long trial in explaining the plea bargain , which also sees wisser forfeit six million rand -lrb- $ 800,000 -rrb- in cash and over 2.8 million euros in overseas assets .

the days between the raf 's kidnapping on sept .
5 of hanns martin schleyer , president of the federation of german industries , and the discovery of his body on oct .
19 , plunged the country into a state of emergency .
the militant , left-wing group staged the abduction in a bid to blackmail the state into releasing 11 members of its group who were in prison in stuttgart-stammheim for numerous bomb attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz tens of thousands of police officers spent weeks searching for the kidnappers and their hostage .
politicians called for the death penalty .
captains of industry , judges and politicians were considered prime terrorist targets .
these weeks marked a watershed for post-war germany .
terrorism is a useful tool for political activists who lack influence - be they the left-wing rebels of germany 's red army faction , al qaeda fanatics or the taliban .
an act of terrorism is , literally , the last resort of the self-righteous revolutionary who has lost all sense of moderation and humanity .
then , potential targets are not just the captains of industry , judges and politicians , but anyone who simply happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time - from the businesspeople and tourists milling around the world trade center on sept.11 , 2001 to the passengers on a madrid commuter train and the crowds packed on to a double-decker bus in london in 2005 . unfailingly , terrorism unleashes panic , whether its target is us imperialism or the " pig state " invoked by the raf . when their back is against the wall , societies tend to turn to overreact , employing such standard defense mechanisms as revenge .
anyone who remembers the mood in germany in the fateful autumn of 1977 will recall the loud clamors for a reintroduction of the death penalty - and how these calls seemed as excessive a reaction as the us-led attack on iraq as retaliation for sept .
11 seemed four years ago , notwithstanding the substantial differences between raf and islamist terrorism . raf terrorism was a targeted attack against those it saw as " arch capitalists . "
this was the group 's derogatory terms for all those who bore any degree of responsibility in democratic , free-market west germany .
to the raf , they were " guilty , " and victims such as the driver who died in a hail of bullets during schleyer 's abduction , were merely collateral damages .
in contrast , the terrorism of al qaeda might be highly precise in terms of its execution , but it claims lives randomly .
its victims are citizens of the free world .
to the raf , the enemy was the german state .
to the jihadists , the enemy is the western world , with all its freedom of belief and rampant consumerism . then and now , a society need to show terrorists that it will not be blackmailed .
germany paid a high price for refusing to release the raf terrorists held in stammheim - the life of hanns martin schleyer .
those in charge of negotiations that fateful autumn - including former chancellor helmut schmidt - are personally indebted to the schleyer family .
but they believed that the decision they made to sacrifice his life was justified , because they maintained the state 's integrity and stability . in 2007 , a similarly steadfast line needs to be taken when innocent hostages are taken by the taliban in afghanistan or gangs of rebels in iraq .
whether it comes in the form of kidnappings or suicide bombings , terrorism can only be dealt with by remaining strong .
negotiations and concessions are grist to the mill of international terrorism . but remaining strong is far from easy .
thirty years ago , the accusations that germany 's left was made up of " intellectual desk criminals " was an inappropriate as today 's attempt to blame islam for the actions of fanatical islamist terrorists .
only when religious freedom endures , even in times of terrorist threats , will freedom serve as proof of western strength .
and only when the state 's protective measures stop short of restricting individual freedoms will citizens start to show a long-term willingness to defend society 's values , liberal laws and democracies - an important principle to remember when the specter of terrorism is looming large . as the west continues to fight its war on terror , the lessons learnt 30 years ago seem more relevant than ever . daniel scheschkewitz was dw-radio 's us correspondent and now works as a special correspondent -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

among the most dramatic was that of hanns martin schleyer , president of the federation of german industries . on sept .
5 , 1977 , a red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- commando opened fire on a convoy in which hanns martin schleyer , head of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , was traveling .
his four escorts were shot dead and schleyer was dragged out of the car and kidnapped .
it was the beginning of what has gone down in history as the " deutscher herbst , " germany 's autumn of terror . the militant , left-wing raf staged the murders and abduction in a bid to blackmail the state into releasing 11 members of its group who were in prison in stuttgart for numerous bomb attacks .
among the inmates were the heart and mind of the red army faction , andreas baader , gudrun ensslin and jan-carl raspe .
from their cells , they continued to control the armed battle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas baader and gudrun ensslin meanwhile a second generation red army faction had evolved , no longer set on causes such as the fight against capitalism , but on securing the release of the ringleaders . government refused to meet demands but the german government under chancellor helmut schmidt was not prepared to play ball .
four hours after schleyer 's abduction , he gave a television address in which he spoke directly to the kidnappers . " they might , right now , be experiencing a feeling of triumph , " he said .
" but they should not be mistaken .
terrorism stands no chance in the long term . " for the 44 days in which schleyer was held captive , germany was in a state of emergency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 05.09.2007 german engineer guilty of nuclear-technology smuggling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard wisser -lrb- r -rrb- and daniel geiges -lrb- l -rrb- : players in a global black market a south african court has found a german engineer guilty of seven charges of contravening the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction act and the nuclear energy act , and two counts of forgery . gerhard wisser was sentenced to three years under house arrest and given a suspended jail sentence of 18 years .
the 68-year-old engineer struck a plea bargain with prosecutors after he admitted in the pretoria high court to being involved in attempts to supply parts for libya 's aborted nuclear weapons program .
wisser , former managing director of johannesburg engineering company krisch , admitted he had played a role in a global black market in atomic weapons technology headed by disgraced pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan , who has admitted to helping nations under international embargo develop their weapons programs .
the case is part of an international effort to crack down on a network that has helped libya , north korea and iran skirt sanctions in their pursuit of nuclear technology .
the sentence also sets a precedent for the possible prosecution of other members in europe or asia , and wisser has agreed to cooperate with south african and overseas authorities in their investigations .
wisser denied he had suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a capsule of enriched uranium from iran his guilty plea marked a surprise turnaround in wisser 's case .
despite having worked on south africa 's secret apartheid-era nuclear program in the 1980s , wisser insisted he had suspected nothing when he was approached in 2000 by a nuclear industry contact about manufacturing a " compact pipework system " for an anonymous client , german news service dpa reported .
the client had paid him one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- to find a company in south africa to carry out the work .
wisser and his employee , swiss-born engineer daniel geiges , soon realized that the drawings were for a uranium enrichment plant .
wisser has always claimed that it never occurred to him that it could be for use in a nuclear weapons program .
ha awarded the contract to an old friend and fellow engineer with experience in the nuclear industry , johan meyer of tradefin engineering near johannesburg .
wisser repeatedly claimed he did not suspect he was abetting libya 's nuclear program until mid-2003 and that he believed he was working for pakistan 's nuclear energy program - even when two libyan engineers arrived in south africa to inspect the plant in 2002 .
" the realization dawned " after meyer received a payment from libya in 2003 , but wisser only pulled the plug on the plant when italian and us authorities intercepted a ship carrying parts for libya 's nuclear program off the coast of italy in october 2003 , exposing moammar gadhafi 's then atomic ambitions .
the order was given in a text message to meyer urging him " to destroy the bird -lrb- plant -rrb- and all its feathers -lrb- project -rrb- . "
meyer , who later turned state witness , ignored the instructions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wissser admitted to manufacturing nuclear material when south african authorities raided tradefin 's premises near johannesburg in september 2004 , they found the bones of a two-storey uranium enrichment plant packed and ready for shipment .
according to experts , it could have been used to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for several nuclear bombs a year .
factors for a lenient sentence wisser 's agreement to cooperate with authorities in south africa and abroad in the investigation of other players in the network may have helped secure his lenient sentence .
state prosecutor r c macadam also cited wisser 's age and the prosecution 's desire to avoid a potentially years-long trial in explaining the plea bargain , which also sees wisser forfeit six million rand -lrb- $ 800,000 -rrb- in cash and over 2.8 million euros in overseas assets .
" we regard the conviction as a significant step in combating nuclear proliferation networks , " said south africa 's national prosecuting authority -lrb- npa -rrb- in a statement . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 68-year-old engineer struck a plea bargain with prosecutors after he admitted in the pretoria high court to being involved in attempts to supply parts for libya 's aborted nuclear weapons program .
wisser , former managing director of johannesburg engineering company krisch , admitted he had played a role in a global black market in atomic weapons technology headed by disgraced pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan , who has admitted to helping nations under international embargo develop their weapons programs .
the case is part of an international effort to crack down on a network that has helped libya , north korea and iran skirt sanctions in their pursuit of nuclear technology .
the sentence also sets a precedent for the possible prosecution of other members in europe or asia , and wisser has agreed to cooperate with south african and overseas authorities in their investigations .
wisser denied he had suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a capsule of enriched uranium from iran his guilty plea marked a surprise turnaround in wisser 's case .
despite having worked on south africa 's secret apartheid-era nuclear program in the 1980s , wisser insisted he had suspected nothing when he was approached in 2000 by a nuclear industry contact about manufacturing a " compact pipework system " for an anonymous client , german news service dpa reported .
the client had paid him one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- to find a company in south africa to carry out the work .
wisser and his employee , swiss-born engineer daniel geiges , soon realized that the drawings were for a uranium enrichment plant .
wisser has always claimed that it never occurred to him that it could be for use in a nuclear weapons program .
ha awarded the contract to an old friend and fellow engineer with experience in the nuclear industry , johan meyer of tradefin engineering near johannesburg .
wisser repeatedly claimed he did not suspect he was abetting libya 's nuclear program until mid-2003 and that he believed he was working for pakistan 's nuclear energy program - even when two libyan engineers arrived in south africa to inspect the plant in 2002 .
" the realization dawned " after meyer received a payment from libya in 2003 , but wisser only pulled the plug on the plant when italian and us authorities intercepted a ship carrying parts for libya 's nuclear program off the coast of italy in october 2003 , exposing moammar gadhafi 's then atomic ambitions .
the order was given in a text message to meyer urging him " to destroy the bird -lrb- plant -rrb- and all its feathers -lrb- project -rrb- . "
meyer , who later turned state witness , ignored the instructions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wissser admitted to manufacturing nuclear material when south african authorities raided tradefin 's premises near johannesburg in september 2004 , they found the bones of a two-storey uranium enrichment plant packed and ready for shipment .
according to experts , it could have been used to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for several nuclear bombs a year .
factors for a lenient sentence wisser 's agreement to cooperate with authorities in south africa and abroad in the investigation of other players in the network may have helped secure his lenient sentence .
state prosecutor r c macadam also cited wisser 's age and the prosecution 's desire to avoid a potentially years-long trial in explaining the plea bargain , which also sees wisser forfeit six million rand -lrb- $ 800,000 -rrb- in cash and over 2.8 million euros in overseas assets .

the days between the raf 's kidnapping on sept .
5 of hanns martin schleyer , president of the federation of german industries , and the discovery of his body on oct .
19 , plunged the country into a state of emergency .
the militant , left-wing group staged the abduction in a bid to blackmail the state into releasing 11 members of its group who were in prison in stuttgart-stammheim for numerous bomb attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz tens of thousands of police officers spent weeks searching for the kidnappers and their hostage .
politicians called for the death penalty .
captains of industry , judges and politicians were considered prime terrorist targets .
these weeks marked a watershed for post-war germany .
terrorism is a useful tool for political activists who lack influence - be they the left-wing rebels of germany 's red army faction , al qaeda fanatics or the taliban .
an act of terrorism is , literally , the last resort of the self-righteous revolutionary who has lost all sense of moderation and humanity .
then , potential targets are not just the captains of industry , judges and politicians , but anyone who simply happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time - from the businesspeople and tourists milling around the world trade center on sept.11 , 2001 to the passengers on a madrid commuter train and the crowds packed on to a double-decker bus in london in 2005 . unfailingly , terrorism unleashes panic , whether its target is us imperialism or the " pig state " invoked by the raf . when their back is against the wall , societies tend to turn to overreact , employing such standard defense mechanisms as revenge .
anyone who remembers the mood in germany in the fateful autumn of 1977 will recall the loud clamors for a reintroduction of the death penalty - and how these calls seemed as excessive a reaction as the us-led attack on iraq as retaliation for sept .
11 seemed four years ago , notwithstanding the substantial differences between raf and islamist terrorism . raf terrorism was a targeted attack against those it saw as " arch capitalists . "
this was the group 's derogatory terms for all those who bore any degree of responsibility in democratic , free-market west germany .
to the raf , they were " guilty , " and victims such as the driver who died in a hail of bullets during schleyer 's abduction , were merely collateral damages .
in contrast , the terrorism of al qaeda might be highly precise in terms of its execution , but it claims lives randomly .
its victims are citizens of the free world .
to the raf , the enemy was the german state .
to the jihadists , the enemy is the western world , with all its freedom of belief and rampant consumerism . then and now , a society need to show terrorists that it will not be blackmailed .
germany paid a high price for refusing to release the raf terrorists held in stammheim - the life of hanns martin schleyer .
those in charge of negotiations that fateful autumn - including former chancellor helmut schmidt - are personally indebted to the schleyer family .
but they believed that the decision they made to sacrifice his life was justified , because they maintained the state 's integrity and stability . in 2007 , a similarly steadfast line needs to be taken when innocent hostages are taken by the taliban in afghanistan or gangs of rebels in iraq .
whether it comes in the form of kidnappings or suicide bombings , terrorism can only be dealt with by remaining strong .
negotiations and concessions are grist to the mill of international terrorism . but remaining strong is far from easy .
thirty years ago , the accusations that germany 's left was made up of " intellectual desk criminals " was an inappropriate as today 's attempt to blame islam for the actions of fanatical islamist terrorists .
only when religious freedom endures , even in times of terrorist threats , will freedom serve as proof of western strength .
and only when the state 's protective measures stop short of restricting individual freedoms will citizens start to show a long-term willingness to defend society 's values , liberal laws and democracies - an important principle to remember when the specter of terrorism is looming large . as the west continues to fight its war on terror , the lessons learnt 30 years ago seem more relevant than ever . daniel scheschkewitz was dw-radio 's us correspondent and now works as a special correspondent -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 68-year-old engineer struck a plea bargain with prosecutors after he admitted in the pretoria high court to being involved in attempts to supply parts for libya 's aborted nuclear weapons program .
wisser , former managing director of johannesburg engineering company krisch , admitted he had played a role in a global black market in atomic weapons technology headed by disgraced pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan , who has admitted to helping nations under international embargo develop their weapons programs .
the case is part of an international effort to crack down on a network that has helped libya , north korea and iran skirt sanctions in their pursuit of nuclear technology .
the sentence also sets a precedent for the possible prosecution of other members in europe or asia , and wisser has agreed to cooperate with south african and overseas authorities in their investigations .
wisser denied he had suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a capsule of enriched uranium from iran his guilty plea marked a surprise turnaround in wisser 's case .
despite having worked on south africa 's secret apartheid-era nuclear program in the 1980s , wisser insisted he had suspected nothing when he was approached in 2000 by a nuclear industry contact about manufacturing a " compact pipework system " for an anonymous client , german news service dpa reported .
the client had paid him one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- to find a company in south africa to carry out the work .
wisser and his employee , swiss-born engineer daniel geiges , soon realized that the drawings were for a uranium enrichment plant .
wisser has always claimed that it never occurred to him that it could be for use in a nuclear weapons program .
ha awarded the contract to an old friend and fellow engineer with experience in the nuclear industry , johan meyer of tradefin engineering near johannesburg .
wisser repeatedly claimed he did not suspect he was abetting libya 's nuclear program until mid-2003 and that he believed he was working for pakistan 's nuclear energy program - even when two libyan engineers arrived in south africa to inspect the plant in 2002 .
" the realization dawned " after meyer received a payment from libya in 2003 , but wisser only pulled the plug on the plant when italian and us authorities intercepted a ship carrying parts for libya 's nuclear program off the coast of italy in october 2003 , exposing moammar gadhafi 's then atomic ambitions .
the order was given in a text message to meyer urging him " to destroy the bird -lrb- plant -rrb- and all its feathers -lrb- project -rrb- . "
meyer , who later turned state witness , ignored the instructions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wissser admitted to manufacturing nuclear material when south african authorities raided tradefin 's premises near johannesburg in september 2004 , they found the bones of a two-storey uranium enrichment plant packed and ready for shipment .
according to experts , it could have been used to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for several nuclear bombs a year .
factors for a lenient sentence wisser 's agreement to cooperate with authorities in south africa and abroad in the investigation of other players in the network may have helped secure his lenient sentence .
state prosecutor r c macadam also cited wisser 's age and the prosecution 's desire to avoid a potentially years-long trial in explaining the plea bargain , which also sees wisser forfeit six million rand -lrb- $ 800,000 -rrb- in cash and over 2.8 million euros in overseas assets .

the 68-year-old engineer struck a plea bargain with prosecutors after he admitted in the pretoria high court to being involved in attempts to supply parts for libya 's aborted nuclear weapons program .
wisser , former managing director of johannesburg engineering company krisch , admitted he had played a role in a global black market in atomic weapons technology headed by disgraced pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan , who has admitted to helping nations under international embargo develop their weapons programs .
the case is part of an international effort to crack down on a network that has helped libya , north korea and iran skirt sanctions in their pursuit of nuclear technology .
the sentence also sets a precedent for the possible prosecution of other members in europe or asia , and wisser has agreed to cooperate with south african and overseas authorities in their investigations .
wisser denied he had suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a capsule of enriched uranium from iran his guilty plea marked a surprise turnaround in wisser 's case .
despite having worked on south africa 's secret apartheid-era nuclear program in the 1980s , wisser insisted he had suspected nothing when he was approached in 2000 by a nuclear industry contact about manufacturing a " compact pipework system " for an anonymous client , german news service dpa reported .
the client had paid him one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- to find a company in south africa to carry out the work .
wisser and his employee , swiss-born engineer daniel geiges , soon realized that the drawings were for a uranium enrichment plant .
wisser has always claimed that it never occurred to him that it could be for use in a nuclear weapons program .
ha awarded the contract to an old friend and fellow engineer with experience in the nuclear industry , johan meyer of tradefin engineering near johannesburg .
wisser repeatedly claimed he did not suspect he was abetting libya 's nuclear program until mid-2003 and that he believed he was working for pakistan 's nuclear energy program - even when two libyan engineers arrived in south africa to inspect the plant in 2002 .
" the realization dawned " after meyer received a payment from libya in 2003 , but wisser only pulled the plug on the plant when italian and us authorities intercepted a ship carrying parts for libya 's nuclear program off the coast of italy in october 2003 , exposing moammar gadhafi 's then atomic ambitions .
the order was given in a text message to meyer urging him " to destroy the bird -lrb- plant -rrb- and all its feathers -lrb- project -rrb- . "
meyer , who later turned state witness , ignored the instructions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wissser admitted to manufacturing nuclear material when south african authorities raided tradefin 's premises near johannesburg in september 2004 , they found the bones of a two-storey uranium enrichment plant packed and ready for shipment .
according to experts , it could have been used to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for several nuclear bombs a year .
factors for a lenient sentence wisser 's agreement to cooperate with authorities in south africa and abroad in the investigation of other players in the network may have helped secure his lenient sentence .
state prosecutor r c macadam also cited wisser 's age and the prosecution 's desire to avoid a potentially years-long trial in explaining the plea bargain , which also sees wisser forfeit six million rand -lrb- $ 800,000 -rrb- in cash and over 2.8 million euros in overseas assets .

the 68-year-old engineer struck a plea bargain with prosecutors after he admitted in the pretoria high court to being involved in attempts to supply parts for libya 's aborted nuclear weapons program .
wisser , former managing director of johannesburg engineering company krisch , admitted he had played a role in a global black market in atomic weapons technology headed by disgraced pakistani scientist abdul qadeer khan , who has admitted to helping nations under international embargo develop their weapons programs .
the case is part of an international effort to crack down on a network that has helped libya , north korea and iran skirt sanctions in their pursuit of nuclear technology .
the sentence also sets a precedent for the possible prosecution of other members in europe or asia , and wisser has agreed to cooperate with south african and overseas authorities in their investigations .
wisser denied he had suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a capsule of enriched uranium from iran his guilty plea marked a surprise turnaround in wisser 's case .
despite having worked on south africa 's secret apartheid-era nuclear program in the 1980s , wisser insisted he had suspected nothing when he was approached in 2000 by a nuclear industry contact about manufacturing a " compact pipework system " for an anonymous client , german news service dpa reported .
the client had paid him one million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- to find a company in south africa to carry out the work .
wisser and his employee , swiss-born engineer daniel geiges , soon realized that the drawings were for a uranium enrichment plant .
wisser has always claimed that it never occurred to him that it could be for use in a nuclear weapons program .
ha awarded the contract to an old friend and fellow engineer with experience in the nuclear industry , johan meyer of tradefin engineering near johannesburg .
wisser repeatedly claimed he did not suspect he was abetting libya 's nuclear program until mid-2003 and that he believed he was working for pakistan 's nuclear energy program - even when two libyan engineers arrived in south africa to inspect the plant in 2002 .
" the realization dawned " after meyer received a payment from libya in 2003 , but wisser only pulled the plug on the plant when italian and us authorities intercepted a ship carrying parts for libya 's nuclear program off the coast of italy in october 2003 , exposing moammar gadhafi 's then atomic ambitions .
the order was given in a text message to meyer urging him " to destroy the bird -lrb- plant -rrb- and all its feathers -lrb- project -rrb- . "
meyer , who later turned state witness , ignored the instructions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wissser admitted to manufacturing nuclear material when south african authorities raided tradefin 's premises near johannesburg in september 2004 , they found the bones of a two-storey uranium enrichment plant packed and ready for shipment .
according to experts , it could have been used to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for several nuclear bombs a year .
factors for a lenient sentence wisser 's agreement to cooperate with authorities in south africa and abroad in the investigation of other players in the network may have helped secure his lenient sentence .
state prosecutor r c macadam also cited wisser 's age and the prosecution 's desire to avoid a potentially years-long trial in explaining the plea bargain , which also sees wisser forfeit six million rand -lrb- $ 800,000 -rrb- in cash and over 2.8 million euros in overseas assets .
" we regard the conviction as a significant step in combating nuclear proliferation networks , " said south africa 's national prosecuting authority -lrb- npa -rrb- in a statement . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

among the most dramatic was that of hanns martin schleyer , president of the federation of german industries . on sept .
5 , 1977 , a red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- commando opened fire on a convoy in which hanns martin schleyer , head of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- , was traveling .
his four escorts were shot dead and schleyer was dragged out of the car and kidnapped .
it was the beginning of what has gone down in history as the " deutscher herbst , " germany 's autumn of terror . the militant , left-wing raf staged the murders and abduction in a bid to blackmail the state into releasing 11 members of its group who were in prison in stuttgart for numerous bomb attacks .
among the inmates were the heart and mind of the red army faction , andreas baader , gudrun ensslin and jan-carl raspe .
from their cells , they continued to control the armed battle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas baader and gudrun ensslin meanwhile a second generation red army faction had evolved , no longer set on causes such as the fight against capitalism , but on securing the release of the ringleaders . government refused to meet demands but the german government under chancellor helmut schmidt was not prepared to play ball .
four hours after schleyer 's abduction , he gave a television address in which he spoke directly to the kidnappers . " they might , right now , be experiencing a feeling of triumph , " he said .
" but they should not be mistaken .
terrorism stands no chance in the long term . " for the 44 days in which schleyer was held captive , germany was in a state of emergency .
ministries in the capital , bonn , were barricaded with barbed wire , armored vehicles drove through the streets and crisis meetings between the government and the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- met several times daily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanns martin schleyer " prisoner for 31 days " suspecting that the schleyer attack had been masterminded from inside the stuttgart prison , the government quickly passed a law prohibiting raf inmates from speaking to one another or to their lawyers . the bka launched an extensive search operation , combing through thousands of apartments and distributing millions of flyers with mug shots of raf members .
but the kidnappers insisted on their conditions and the investigators failed to find schleyer , who with his nazi background and powerful position in the economy , represented everything the terrorists deemed the enemy . hijacking reiterated demands schleyer was still alive on oct .
13 , 1977 when four palestinian terrorists , who supported the activities of the raf , hijacked a lufthansa plane with 87 people on board .
the hostage-takers threatened to kill the passengers if the german government did n't release the prisoners in stuttgart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hijacked lufthansa plane after a dramatic odyssey , the plane landed in the somalian capital mogadishu where it stayed for five days until a german special unit moved in and secured the release of 86 people .
the pilot had been killed earlier . when the raf prisoners heard the news in their cells , they committed suicide the same night .
one day later , the body of schleyer was found in the trunk of a car .
even today , it is not known who fired the fatal shot . raf debate continues today bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former raf terrorist christian klar schleyer 's death marked the end of the autumn of terror , but the memories of the 1977 terrorism have not been forgotten . even now , 30 years later , there is still intense public debate about how the state should treat former raf terrorists , such as christian klar .
he has been in prison since 1982 , in part for the collaborative kidnapping and murder of schleyer .
german president horst köhler rejected his plea for clemency in may of this year .
other raf have been released from prison after courts said they no longer posed a threat to society . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politicians called for the death penalty .

these weeks marked a watershed for post-war germany .
terrorism is a useful tool for political activists who lack influence - be they the left-wing rebels of germany 's red army faction , al qaeda fanatics or the taliban .
an act of terrorism is , literally , the last resort of the self-righteous revolutionary who has lost all sense of moderation and humanity .
then , potential targets are not just the captains of industry , judges and politicians , but anyone who simply happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time - from the businesspeople and tourists milling around the world trade center on sept.11 , 2001 to the passengers on a madrid commuter train and the crowds packed on to a double-decker bus in london in 2005 . unfailingly , terrorism unleashes panic , whether its target is us imperialism or the " pig state " invoked by the raf . when their back is against the wall , societies tend to turn to overreact , employing such standard defense mechanisms as revenge .

11 seemed four years ago , notwithstanding the substantial differences between raf and islamist terrorism . raf terrorism was a targeted attack against those it saw as " arch capitalists . "
this was the group 's derogatory terms for all those who bore any degree of responsibility in democratic , free-market west germany .
to the raf , they were " guilty , " and victims such as the driver who died in a hail of bullets during schleyer 's abduction , were merely collateral damages .
in contrast , the terrorism of al qaeda might be highly precise in terms of its execution , but it claims lives randomly .
its victims are citizens of the free world .
to the raf , the enemy was the german state .
to the jihadists , the enemy is the western world , with all its freedom of belief and rampant consumerism . then and now , a society need to show terrorists that it will not be blackmailed .
germany paid a high price for refusing to release the raf terrorists held in stammheim - the life of hanns martin schleyer .
those in charge of negotiations that fateful autumn - including former chancellor helmut schmidt - are personally indebted to the schleyer family .
but they believed that the decision they made to sacrifice his life was justified , because they maintained the state 's integrity and stability . in 2007 , a similarly steadfast line needs to be taken when innocent hostages are taken by the taliban in afghanistan or gangs of rebels in iraq .

the militant , left-wing group staged the abduction in a bid to blackmail the state into releasing 11 members of its group who were in prison in stuttgart-stammheim for numerous bomb attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz tens of thousands of police officers spent weeks searching for the kidnappers and their hostage .
politicians called for the death penalty .
captains of industry , judges and politicians were considered prime terrorist targets .
these weeks marked a watershed for post-war germany .
terrorism is a useful tool for political activists who lack influence - be they the left-wing rebels of germany 's red army faction , al qaeda fanatics or the taliban .
an act of terrorism is , literally , the last resort of the self-righteous revolutionary who has lost all sense of moderation and humanity .
then , potential targets are not just the captains of industry , judges and politicians , but anyone who simply happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time - from the businesspeople and tourists milling around the world trade center on sept.11 , 2001 to the passengers on a madrid commuter train and the crowds packed on to a double-decker bus in london in 2005 . unfailingly , terrorism unleashes panic , whether its target is us imperialism or the " pig state " invoked by the raf . when their back is against the wall , societies tend to turn to overreact , employing such standard defense mechanisms as revenge .
anyone who remembers the mood in germany in the fateful autumn of 1977 will recall the loud clamors for a reintroduction of the death penalty - and how these calls seemed as excessive a reaction as the us-led attack on iraq as retaliation for sept .
11 seemed four years ago , notwithstanding the substantial differences between raf and islamist terrorism . raf terrorism was a targeted attack against those it saw as " arch capitalists . "
this was the group 's derogatory terms for all those who bore any degree of responsibility in democratic , free-market west germany .
to the raf , they were " guilty , " and victims such as the driver who died in a hail of bullets during schleyer 's abduction , were merely collateral damages .
in contrast , the terrorism of al qaeda might be highly precise in terms of its execution , but it claims lives randomly .
its victims are citizens of the free world .
to the raf , the enemy was the german state .
to the jihadists , the enemy is the western world , with all its freedom of belief and rampant consumerism . then and now , a society need to show terrorists that it will not be blackmailed .
germany paid a high price for refusing to release the raf terrorists held in stammheim - the life of hanns martin schleyer .
those in charge of negotiations that fateful autumn - including former chancellor helmut schmidt - are personally indebted to the schleyer family .
but they believed that the decision they made to sacrifice his life was justified , because they maintained the state 's integrity and stability . in 2007 , a similarly steadfast line needs to be taken when innocent hostages are taken by the taliban in afghanistan or gangs of rebels in iraq .
whether it comes in the form of kidnappings or suicide bombings , terrorism can only be dealt with by remaining strong .
negotiations and concessions are grist to the mill of international terrorism . but remaining strong is far from easy .
thirty years ago , the accusations that germany 's left was made up of " intellectual desk criminals " was an inappropriate as today 's attempt to blame islam for the actions of fanatical islamist terrorists .

the days between the raf 's kidnapping on sept .
5 of hanns martin schleyer , president of the federation of german industries , and the discovery of his body on oct .
19 , plunged the country into a state of emergency .
the militant , left-wing group staged the abduction in a bid to blackmail the state into releasing 11 members of its group who were in prison in stuttgart-stammheim for numerous bomb attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz tens of thousands of police officers spent weeks searching for the kidnappers and their hostage .
politicians called for the death penalty .
captains of industry , judges and politicians were considered prime terrorist targets .
these weeks marked a watershed for post-war germany .
terrorism is a useful tool for political activists who lack influence - be they the left-wing rebels of germany 's red army faction , al qaeda fanatics or the taliban .
an act of terrorism is , literally , the last resort of the self-righteous revolutionary who has lost all sense of moderation and humanity .
then , potential targets are not just the captains of industry , judges and politicians , but anyone who simply happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time - from the businesspeople and tourists milling around the world trade center on sept.11 , 2001 to the passengers on a madrid commuter train and the crowds packed on to a double-decker bus in london in 2005 . unfailingly , terrorism unleashes panic , whether its target is us imperialism or the " pig state " invoked by the raf . when their back is against the wall , societies tend to turn to overreact , employing such standard defense mechanisms as revenge .
anyone who remembers the mood in germany in the fateful autumn of 1977 will recall the loud clamors for a reintroduction of the death penalty - and how these calls seemed as excessive a reaction as the us-led attack on iraq as retaliation for sept .
11 seemed four years ago , notwithstanding the substantial differences between raf and islamist terrorism . raf terrorism was a targeted attack against those it saw as " arch capitalists . "
this was the group 's derogatory terms for all those who bore any degree of responsibility in democratic , free-market west germany .
to the raf , they were " guilty , " and victims such as the driver who died in a hail of bullets during schleyer 's abduction , were merely collateral damages .
in contrast , the terrorism of al qaeda might be highly precise in terms of its execution , but it claims lives randomly .
its victims are citizens of the free world .
to the raf , the enemy was the german state .
to the jihadists , the enemy is the western world , with all its freedom of belief and rampant consumerism . then and now , a society need to show terrorists that it will not be blackmailed .
germany paid a high price for refusing to release the raf terrorists held in stammheim - the life of hanns martin schleyer .
those in charge of negotiations that fateful autumn - including former chancellor helmut schmidt - are personally indebted to the schleyer family .
but they believed that the decision they made to sacrifice his life was justified , because they maintained the state 's integrity and stability . in 2007 , a similarly steadfast line needs to be taken when innocent hostages are taken by the taliban in afghanistan or gangs of rebels in iraq .
whether it comes in the form of kidnappings or suicide bombings , terrorism can only be dealt with by remaining strong .
negotiations and concessions are grist to the mill of international terrorism . but remaining strong is far from easy .
thirty years ago , the accusations that germany 's left was made up of " intellectual desk criminals " was an inappropriate as today 's attempt to blame islam for the actions of fanatical islamist terrorists .
only when religious freedom endures , even in times of terrorist threats , will freedom serve as proof of western strength .
and only when the state 's protective measures stop short of restricting individual freedoms will citizens start to show a long-term willingness to defend society 's values , liberal laws and democracies - an important principle to remember when the specter of terrorism is looming large . as the west continues to fight its war on terror , the lessons learnt 30 years ago seem more relevant than ever . daniel scheschkewitz was dw-radio 's us correspondent and now works as a special correspondent -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the days between the raf 's kidnapping on sept .
5 of hanns martin schleyer , president of the federation of german industries , and the discovery of his body on oct .
19 , plunged the country into a state of emergency .
the militant , left-wing group staged the abduction in a bid to blackmail the state into releasing 11 members of its group who were in prison in stuttgart-stammheim for numerous bomb attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz tens of thousands of police officers spent weeks searching for the kidnappers and their hostage .
politicians called for the death penalty .
captains of industry , judges and politicians were considered prime terrorist targets .
these weeks marked a watershed for post-war germany .
terrorism is a useful tool for political activists who lack influence - be they the left-wing rebels of germany 's red army faction , al qaeda fanatics or the taliban .
an act of terrorism is , literally , the last resort of the self-righteous revolutionary who has lost all sense of moderation and humanity .
then , potential targets are not just the captains of industry , judges and politicians , but anyone who simply happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time - from the businesspeople and tourists milling around the world trade center on sept.11 , 2001 to the passengers on a madrid commuter train and the crowds packed on to a double-decker bus in london in 2005 . unfailingly , terrorism unleashes panic , whether its target is us imperialism or the " pig state " invoked by the raf . when their back is against the wall , societies tend to turn to overreact , employing such standard defense mechanisms as revenge .
anyone who remembers the mood in germany in the fateful autumn of 1977 will recall the loud clamors for a reintroduction of the death penalty - and how these calls seemed as excessive a reaction as the us-led attack on iraq as retaliation for sept .
11 seemed four years ago , notwithstanding the substantial differences between raf and islamist terrorism . raf terrorism was a targeted attack against those it saw as " arch capitalists . "
this was the group 's derogatory terms for all those who bore any degree of responsibility in democratic , free-market west germany .
to the raf , they were " guilty , " and victims such as the driver who died in a hail of bullets during schleyer 's abduction , were merely collateral damages .
in contrast , the terrorism of al qaeda might be highly precise in terms of its execution , but it claims lives randomly .
its victims are citizens of the free world .
to the raf , the enemy was the german state .
to the jihadists , the enemy is the western world , with all its freedom of belief and rampant consumerism . then and now , a society need to show terrorists that it will not be blackmailed .
germany paid a high price for refusing to release the raf terrorists held in stammheim - the life of hanns martin schleyer .
those in charge of negotiations that fateful autumn - including former chancellor helmut schmidt - are personally indebted to the schleyer family .
but they believed that the decision they made to sacrifice his life was justified , because they maintained the state 's integrity and stability . in 2007 , a similarly steadfast line needs to be taken when innocent hostages are taken by the taliban in afghanistan or gangs of rebels in iraq .
whether it comes in the form of kidnappings or suicide bombings , terrorism can only be dealt with by remaining strong .
negotiations and concessions are grist to the mill of international terrorism . but remaining strong is far from easy .
thirty years ago , the accusations that germany 's left was made up of " intellectual desk criminals " was an inappropriate as today 's attempt to blame islam for the actions of fanatical islamist terrorists .
only when religious freedom endures , even in times of terrorist threats , will freedom serve as proof of western strength .
and only when the state 's protective measures stop short of restricting individual freedoms will citizens start to show a long-term willingness to defend society 's values , liberal laws and democracies - an important principle to remember when the specter of terrorism is looming large . as the west continues to fight its war on terror , the lessons learnt 30 years ago seem more relevant than ever . daniel scheschkewitz was dw-radio 's us correspondent and now works as a special correspondent -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

terrorism is a useful tool for political activists who lack influence - be they the left-wing rebels of germany 's red army faction , al qaeda fanatics or the taliban .

germany paid a high price for refusing to release the raf terrorists held in stammheim - the life of hanns martin schleyer .
those in charge of negotiations that fateful autumn - including former chancellor helmut schmidt - are personally indebted to the schleyer family .

the days between the raf 's kidnapping on sept .
5 of hanns martin schleyer , president of the federation of german industries , and the discovery of his body on oct .
19 , plunged the country into a state of emergency .
the militant , left-wing group staged the abduction in a bid to blackmail the state into releasing 11 members of its group who were in prison in stuttgart-stammheim for numerous bomb attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz tens of thousands of police officers spent weeks searching for the kidnappers and their hostage .
politicians called for the death penalty .
captains of industry , judges and politicians were considered prime terrorist targets .
these weeks marked a watershed for post-war germany .
terrorism is a useful tool for political activists who lack influence - be they the left-wing rebels of germany 's red army faction , al qaeda fanatics or the taliban .
an act of terrorism is , literally , the last resort of the self-righteous revolutionary who has lost all sense of moderation and humanity .
then , potential targets are not just the captains of industry , judges and politicians , but anyone who simply happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time - from the businesspeople and tourists milling around the world trade center on sept.11 , 2001 to the passengers on a madrid commuter train and the crowds packed on to a double-decker bus in london in 2005 . unfailingly , terrorism unleashes panic , whether its target is us imperialism or the " pig state " invoked by the raf . when their back is against the wall , societies tend to turn to overreact , employing such standard defense mechanisms as revenge .
anyone who remembers the mood in germany in the fateful autumn of 1977 will recall the loud clamors for a reintroduction of the death penalty - and how these calls seemed as excessive a reaction as the us-led attack on iraq as retaliation for sept .
11 seemed four years ago , notwithstanding the substantial differences between raf and islamist terrorism . raf terrorism was a targeted attack against those it saw as " arch capitalists . "
this was the group 's derogatory terms for all those who bore any degree of responsibility in democratic , free-market west germany .
to the raf , they were " guilty , " and victims such as the driver who died in a hail of bullets during schleyer 's abduction , were merely collateral damages .
in contrast , the terrorism of al qaeda might be highly precise in terms of its execution , but it claims lives randomly .
its victims are citizens of the free world .
to the raf , the enemy was the german state .
to the jihadists , the enemy is the western world , with all its freedom of belief and rampant consumerism . then and now , a society need to show terrorists that it will not be blackmailed .
germany paid a high price for refusing to release the raf terrorists held in stammheim - the life of hanns martin schleyer .
those in charge of negotiations that fateful autumn - including former chancellor helmut schmidt - are personally indebted to the schleyer family .
but they believed that the decision they made to sacrifice his life was justified , because they maintained the state 's integrity and stability . in 2007 , a similarly steadfast line needs to be taken when innocent hostages are taken by the taliban in afghanistan or gangs of rebels in iraq .
whether it comes in the form of kidnappings or suicide bombings , terrorism can only be dealt with by remaining strong .
negotiations and concessions are grist to the mill of international terrorism . but remaining strong is far from easy .
thirty years ago , the accusations that germany 's left was made up of " intellectual desk criminals " was an inappropriate as today 's attempt to blame islam for the actions of fanatical islamist terrorists .
only when religious freedom endures , even in times of terrorist threats , will freedom serve as proof of western strength .
and only when the state 's protective measures stop short of restricting individual freedoms will citizens start to show a long-term willingness to defend society 's values , liberal laws and democracies - an important principle to remember when the specter of terrorism is looming large . as the west continues to fight its war on terror , the lessons learnt 30 years ago seem more relevant than ever . daniel scheschkewitz was dw-radio 's us correspondent and now works as a special correspondent -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

terrorism is a useful tool for political activists who lack influence - be they the left-wing rebels of germany 's red army faction , al qaeda fanatics or the taliban .
an act of terrorism is , literally , the last resort of the self-righteous revolutionary who has lost all sense of moderation and humanity .

in contrast , the terrorism of al qaeda might be highly precise in terms of its execution , but it claims lives randomly .
its victims are citizens of the free world .
to the raf , the enemy was the german state .
to the jihadists , the enemy is the western world , with all its freedom of belief and rampant consumerism . then and now , a society need to show terrorists that it will not be blackmailed .
germany paid a high price for refusing to release the raf terrorists held in stammheim - the life of hanns martin schleyer .

it was the beginning of what has gone down in history as the " deutscher herbst , " germany 's autumn of terror . the militant , left-wing raf staged the murders and abduction in a bid to blackmail the state into releasing 11 members of its group who were in prison in stuttgart for numerous bomb attacks .

but the kidnappers insisted on their conditions and the investigators failed to find schleyer , who with his nazi background and powerful position in the economy , represented everything the terrorists deemed the enemy . hijacking reiterated demands schleyer was still alive on oct .

ministries in the capital , bonn , were barricaded with barbed wire , armored vehicles drove through the streets and crisis meetings between the government and the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- met several times daily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanns martin schleyer " prisoner for 31 days " suspecting that the schleyer attack had been masterminded from inside the stuttgart prison , the government quickly passed a law prohibiting raf inmates from speaking to one another or to their lawyers . the bka launched an extensive search operation , combing through thousands of apartments and distributing millions of flyers with mug shots of raf members .
but the kidnappers insisted on their conditions and the investigators failed to find schleyer , who with his nazi background and powerful position in the economy , represented everything the terrorists deemed the enemy . hijacking reiterated demands schleyer was still alive on oct .
13 , 1977 when four palestinian terrorists , who supported the activities of the raf , hijacked a lufthansa plane with 87 people on board .

the pilot had been killed earlier . when the raf prisoners heard the news in their cells , they committed suicide the same night .
one day later , the body of schleyer was found in the trunk of a car .
even today , it is not known who fired the fatal shot . raf debate continues today bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former raf terrorist christian klar schleyer 's death marked the end of the autumn of terror , but the memories of the 1977 terrorism have not been forgotten . even now , 30 years later , there is still intense public debate about how the state should treat former raf terrorists , such as christian klar .
he has been in prison since 1982 , in part for the collaborative kidnapping and murder of schleyer .
german president horst köhler rejected his plea for clemency in may of this year .

maj ryan said conditions for mr fossett 's flight had been " optimal " , with calm to light winds .
steve is a tough old boot .
i suspect he is waiting by his plane right now for someone to pick him up sir richard branson profile : steve fossett " the civil air patrol is looking for him .
one problem is he does n't appear to have filed a flight plan , " federal aviation administration spokesman ian gregor told the associated press news agency .
mr gregor said the air force 's rescue co-ordination center in langley , virginia was overseeing the search .
officials say mr fossett 's plane was fitted with an electronic beacon which can be picked up by satellites , but have refused to comment on whether any signal has been located .

" the ranch he took off from covers a huge area and steve has had far tougher challenges to overcome in the past .
based on his track record , i feel confident we 'll get some good news soon . "
mr branson 's spokesman said mr fossett was carrying four full tanks of fuel , and was searching for empty lake beds suitable for a forthcoming attempt at the land speed record .
trooper chuck allen from the nevada highway patrol told the bbc that teams from neighbouring california were aiding the search .
" several aircraft -lrb- are -rrb- flying many hundreds of square miles doing a very extensive grid search to try to locate this particular aircraft , " he said .
the search was later suspended for the night .
record breaker mr fossett reportedly took off from an airstrip near yerington , nevada , owned by william barron hilton , heir and co-chairman of the hilton hotel chain .
since the 1960s the airstrip has been regarded as a mecca for pilots and a popular haunt for world class aviators and astronauts alike .

playsets include dream puppy house and dream kitty condo .
no actual barbies are included .
mattel said 2,540 toys were being recalled in total .
they were sold between october 2006 and august 2007 .
the firm , which has already had two recalls this summer , said the latest notice was a result of its investigation of toys made in china .
' we apologise again ' globally the firm is recalling 700,000 toys that have excessive amounts of lead paint .
we are hopeful consumers will judge us by our actions , not by the fact that we discovered some sub-contractors that did not do the right thing mattel 's international vice president , brian stockton the firm said in a statement that it had now implemented a strengthened , three-point check system to test toys throughout the manufacturing process .
and it had completed a testing programme for most of its toys .
robert a eckert , mattel chairman and chief executive officer , said : " we apologise again to everyone affected and promise that we will continue to focus on ensuring the safety and quality of our toys . "
the recalled barbie accessories include : dream puppy house playset -lrb- j9485 -rrb- sold since 13 october 2006 , because of the paint on the dog dream kitty condo playset -lrb- j9486 -rrb- sold since 13 october 2006 , because of the paint on the cat table & chairs kitchen playset -lrb- k8606 -rrb- sold since 30 october 2006 because of the paint on two dinner plates , the dog , the crisp bowl and the salad bowl bathtub & toilet bathroom playset -lrb- k8607 -rrb- sold since 30 october because of the brown on the cat futon & table living room playset -lrb- k8608 -rrb- sold since 30 october 2006 because of the brown on the cat desk & chair bedroom playset -lrb- k8609 -rrb- sold since 30 october 2006 because of the brown on the dog couch & table living room playset -lrb- k8613 -rrb- sold since 30 october 2006 because of the yellow flower on the handbag .
the firm said the playsets had been made by holder plastic company , which had subcontracted the painting of some of the pieces to firms dong lian fa and yip sing .
neither of these were now producing toys for mattel , it said .
customers who think they have an affected toy should check the bottom of the toys for their model numbers .
they can then give this number to mattel online or over the phone .
if affected , they will be sent a pre-paid label to return the parts , and mattel will then send out replacements .
the firm said it would also send out bonus pieces and parts .
' no sympathy ' last month mattel recalled 94,000 fisher-price toys in the uk , and a fortnight later two million polly pocket , batman and barbie toys , on both occasions blaming the chinese manufacturers .
christopher devereux , managing director of chinasavvy , which helps foreign buyers find chinese factories that make products such as plastic parts , said foreign buyers must constantly monitor and inspect their chinese suppliers .
" i really do n't have any sympathy for mattel , " he said .
" there 's no excuse to let so much product go through with lead in its paint .
they should be testing .
" it 's not difficult .
there are hundreds of quality control laboratories in china . "
mattel 's international vice president , brian stockton , said the firm was " being open , honest and forthright with consumers about what is going on " .
" we are hopeful consumers will judge us by our actions , not by the fact that we discovered some sub-contractors that did not do the right thing . "
the republic of ireland is not affected by this recall .
anyone concerned can ring mattel on 0808 234 8437 .

when it opened in november 2004 there was some scepticism about whether the venue would meet its financial targets .
but with over 1.5m visitors since , the centre is on track to meet its targets for the third year running .
meanwhile , two other city entertainment venues said they had sustained their ticket sales since wmc 's arrival .
bet davies , advisor to the wmc , said when it had first opened there was " some cynicism " that people would not travel to the venue , and it would only attract a local audience .
but she said the £ 106m centre was now taking its place on the " world stage " .
the wmc 's biggest selling shows include : guys and dolls miss saigon wizard of oz swan lake on ice buena vista social club rumble ms davies said tickets to see wagner 's epic ring cycle in march last year had sold out in just four hours and 58 % of ticket sales to that event were from outside wales , she said .
however , month-on-month 79 % of the audience were from south east wales , with 10-11 % travelling from west wales , she said .
about 9-10 % were from " across the border " with around 3 % of the audience making the journey from north wales .
" we are working with coach operators to develop more packages to increase the audience from north wales , " ms davies said .
" we are always working to maintain our existing audiences , but also to attract new audiences through innovative programming , " she added .
announcing the centre had passed £ 20m in ticket sales , the centre 's chairman also highlighted efforts to attract new audiences .
lord rowe-beddoe said : " these are landmark figures for a cultural centre which has been operating for less than three years .
" over 1.5 million visitors have now visited the centre .
" what 's more , we continue to attract new audiences - for example , 49 % of all the audiences for the recent new musical ' never forget ' , were first time ticket buyers " .
wmc chief executive judith isherwood said the centre was now looking at " restructuring and streamlining " in response to changes at the site , including the construction of a base for the bbc national orchestra of wales .
st david 's hall but she denied the objective was to cut jobs .
" there is the possibility that the arts council of wales will relocate down there , " ms isherwood said .
" so once that development is finished we will have over 1,000 people working on that site every day .
" we need to review the way we 're doing things to accommodate that ... but also look to the other things we want to do . "
cardiff 's st david 's hall and the new theatre said they had " sustained " ticket sales since the wmc had opened .
a spokesperson said : " both venues have been proactive in repositioning their programmes - in the case of the new theatre to fill weeks previously held by the welsh national opera with highly successful drama and children 's shows .
" st david 's hall , as a purpose built symphonic concert hall with a world-class acoustic , is developing its music programme and new strands of activity . "

more than 200 were asked how business had been over the summer months for the welsh assembly government survey .
two-thirds said their turnover had been the same - or better - than the previous year .
however , 40 % said the number of visitors was down with the vast majority blaming the bad weather .
this summer appears to have been britain 's wettest since rainfall records began in 1914 , according to provisional data from the uk 's met office .
if you minus a couple of hundred people who are normally around to buy drinks and food then that is going to make a difference to the whole area jayne wainwright although the record rainfall was driven by conditions in england , parts of powys and the vale of glamorgan were among areas of wales hit by flooding .
one llandudno hotelier said the bad weather had ruined what should have been a good year .
margaret longmire bounds , who runs the waverley hotel said : " unless we get a really good september to make up for a very , very bad july , it will not be a good season at all . "
jayne wainwright , the director of the tyn y coed inn in capel curig said business had been " up and down " through the season , " mostly due to the bad weather " .
" out-door people in general are fairly robust and tend to go on holiday whatever the weather 's like , so we 've probably done a lot better than the seaside areas , " ms wainwright said .
however , on a couple of occasions local campsites had been " underwater " , she said .
the seaside resort of barry was hit by flash floods " if you minus a couple of hundred people who are normally around to buy drinks and food then that is going to make a difference to the whole area . "

the national botanic garden of wales in carmarthenshire said visitors had increased by 9 % on the previous july - and 12 % on those in august 2006 .
head of operations ray butt , said it had been a " very busy and excellent season " .
heritage minister rhodri glyn thomas said : " given the appalling weather of june and july , i do n't think that anyone is surprised that there has been a dip in the fortunes of some tourism operators . "
' more resilient ' mr thomas added he was " heartened " by the level of confidence the industry had shown at prospects for the autumn .
the minister said he was not worried 2007 's wet summer would keep visitors away .
" most people will see that the law of averages probably tells us that next year will be a lot better than this year .
" if they enjoyed their visit to wales and the weather was n't too good , hopefully they 'll come back and have far better weather next year . "
julian burrell , chairman of the wales tourism alliance , said the industry had changed over the last five years and was not so reliant on the weather .
" i think we are a lot more confident industry now , we 've got a lot less of the rollercoaster peaks and troughs of business .
" the wettest summer on record is bound to have some effect , bound to have some effect on people in coastal industries especially so we ca n't get over that .

" however , these benefits are not guaranteed , but require significant additional government funding for tourism if they are to be achieved . "
a spokesman for the department for culture , media and sport said the tourism industry needed to " up its game " in the run up to 2012 to ensure the country reaped the potential economic benefits .

over the last three months an average 106 vehicles a week have waited more than 50 minutes to deliver patients , the welsh ambulance service confirmed .
wales 's biggest hospital blamed bed blocking and people needlessly turning up at casualty .
in february there were delays at two hospitals due to a high volume of 999 calls and a shortage of beds .
the university hospital of wales in cardiff , said 160 of its beds were unavailable due to bed blocking .
we know that more than 30 % of people who come to our emergency unit could be treated by their gp or pharmacist hugh ross , chief executive of cardiff and vale nhs trust in a statement , it said a third of emergency patients could be treated by a gp or pharmacist .
hugh ross , chief executive of cardiff and vale nhs trust , which runs the hospital , said : " our emergency unit has been under greater pressure this summer than in previous years .
" this has meant more patients have experienced delays , and the trust regrets that this has been the case .
" we know that more than 30 % of people who come to our emergency unit could be treated by their gp or pharmacist , based on welsh assembly government surveys . "
he said 160 beds were unavailable because of delayed transfers of care - or bed blocking - and the length of these delays was " greater than in the past " .
the ambulance trust said it was addressing the issue with accident and emergency departments as a matter of urgency .
the summer months are traditionally a quiet time but the ambulance service said it has been encountering problems at major district hospitals .
the issue is of great concern to the service and we are , as a matter of urgency , addressing the situation with the hospitals welsh ambulance service spokesperson however , a spokesman said that figures had improved this week to an average of 85 ambulances waiting at hospitals for more than 50 minutes .
mike cassidy , director of ambulance services in wales , said how often and how long ambulances were having to wait varied .
but , he added : " we 've experienced some difficulties , maybe one or two days every couple of weeks just when the system overheats a bit and when demand is extremely high for us . "
he said that since february most serious patients had been admitted immediately while some less serious cases waited three to four hours " on occasions " .
measures had been put in place to help ease pressure on a & e , such as employing gps in ambulance service control centres .
mr cassidy added that it was important to make the public aware of the alternatives to calling an ambulance so resources were kept for the most seriously ill .
" i think quite often people call ambulances because they do n't really know what the alternatives are , and i think it 's about us trying to get information to the public to let them know what alternatives are available , for example , general practice and nhs direct wales , " he said .
' great concern ' a spokesman for the ambulance trust said it was working with hospitals to find ways of easing the pressure on accident and emergency departments .
the ambulance service experienced a crisis in 2006 which saw several bosses quit .
it had failed to meet response time targets and was branded " appalling " and " unacceptable " in a report by a committee of ams in march this year .
but in may , it claimed its performance was the best in its history , after hitting response targets for the second month running .
just last month , its chief alan murray said he had helped restore some pride and credibility after one year in the job .
have you been affected by ambulance queues at accident and emergency ?
were you , or a member of your family left waiting in an ambulance for hours because there was no room in the hospital ?
below is a selection of your comments .
in this event it is nothing to do with the reliability / unreliability of the ambulance service .
this is about the only two sectots within the nhs that actually do any work as everyone else just fobs off jobs .
the guys and gals on the ambulances and a & e are frontline troops that take abuse from all quarters when they produce positive results time after time in spite of the lack of back up from nhs bosses , wag and joe public .
r pardoe , radnorshire i 'm an experienced a & e nurse and part of my job involves helping patients access the right health care provider at the right time .
my employer empowers me to treat patients myself , refer them to a gp , an a & e doctor or another health care professional .
it 's not rocket science but not many trusts allow experienced nurses to use their skills in this way to help patients access appropriate care.as an example , if you cut your hand on glass you should be in a & e because you need to know there is no glass in your wound and that there is no damage to the nerves or tendons .
your gp is not the best person to treat you .
accident and emergency departments are the experts in treating injuries -lrb- no matter how slight -rrb- or emergencies , but it 's not always easy for the public to decide .
a & e nurse , monmouthshire i was on holiday in monmouthshire a few months ago . -lrb- funnily enough a & e nurse . -rrb-
my seriously disabled wife fell ill during the evening .
luckily she had been visited by a district nurse that day and we had been given the out of hours number of the local doctor .
i phoned this number and was told by a recorded message that the out of hours doctor was not available .
my circumstances meant that i had no option but to phone 999 .
i explained to the emergency services what had happened and that we probably just needed to see a doctor .
they decided that as the doctor was not available an ambulance must be deployed and my wife was taken to a & e. i 'll just repeat that : i said i just wanted the services of the out of hours gp .
they said that as one was n't available , an ambulance would be sent .
so who is responsible for clogging up a & e with patients who should really be seeing a gp ?
t james , cardiff the issues surrounding access to urgent and emergency care are not new .
the department of health in england successfully addressed most of issues with the establishment of the 'emergency services collaborative 'about four years ago - much work to maintain performance and standards continues .
in essence the problem is not about isolated emergency departments or the ambulance service it is a hospital and primary care wide concern .
the welsh assembly could learn much from the work done in england - the problems relating to emergency access are the same .
mike paynter , somerset i experienced a delay at a & e morriston hospital in february this year when my daughter was rushed by ambulance following a horrific injury to her face .
i waited with an embarrassed ambulance crew for almost 45 minutes before care was handed over to the hospital .
other ambulance crews -lrb- 4 -rrb- were also waiting to hand over care .
it is a disgrace and money is being wasted tying up paramedics who may be needed to attend other life or death incidents .
i complained to the then health minister brian gibbons only to be told that it was an operational matter for the hospital concerned and the welsh ambulance trust .
what they need in these hospitals is the staff to be able to take over the care of patients to release the ambulance staff .
that can not be too hard to sort out can it ?
david jones , neath my girlfeirnd was taken to morriston hospital a month ago with severe abdominal pains and she was forced to wait 3 hours for an ambulance to transfer her to singleton hospital for a scan on our unborn child .
to me this is simply not acceptable as it makes me wonder what our taxes get spent on ! ! !
mark , ystradgynlais this is just another example of how our ambulance service in wales is still failing , even after the arrival of mr murray .
fast response times mean absolutely nothing if the patient ca n't get into a place of treatment .
j.evans , north wales in a statement , it said a third of emergency patients could be treated by a gp or pharmacist .
then why not turn them away .
people will learn .
as usual this country is bending over backwards to please everyone where we need to prioritise and act on common sense !
daniel kynes-hughes , birmingham , uk we experienced the same thing in may this year with my father .
llandough hospital was so busy patients could n't be offloaded from the ambulances as there was no-where to put them in a & e - the situation is intolerable and the hospital staff would be the first to agree .
something urgently needs to be done about this unacceptable matter .
rob wheaton , cardiff about people ' needlessly turning up at casualty ' .
a few months ago i cut my hand on some glass .
nothing dramatic but deep enough for me to have problems in stopping the bleeding .
so i went to my local gp and hoped the nurse would look at it for me .
they refused , because i 'd cut myself on glass , and sent me off to the casualty in carmarthen .
there i waited for an hour and the staff quickly treated and dressed the wound .
now why could n't a trained nurse in a surgery do that ?
can anyone explain ?
richard crookston , pencader , carmerthenshire , wales it must be very difficult for paramedics when there are so many people calling an ambulance uneccesarily but i thougt that when an ambulance responded to any call it was up to the paramedics to determine whether the person needed to be taken to hospital or not .
if they do not need to go to hospital the ambulance therefore does not have to take them .
if the people are waiting in ambulances to be seen is this not a complete waste of an ambulance which could be needed in an emergency sarah williams , powys the problem is not a simple one .
it would not make any difference whether you doubled the number of staff in the a & e departments or had twice the number of ambulances available .
as hugh ross continues to say the beds are blocked .
until the assembly government sort out the problems of getting social care packages financed this will continue to be the case .
they know what the problem is but because the sums of money involved are huge they chose to let the situation continue and blame the trusts and the ambulance service .
chris gill , cardiff wales sort it out by having a combined minor injuries unit gp nurse lead and an urgent care and treatment centre within the acidnet and emergency unit the cuts bumps and scrapes are triaged through the minor injuries unit the asthams suspected heart attacks and other cases through the urgent care and treatment centre with full blown accident and emergency cases taken straight away to the accident and emergency rooms not rocket sciene is it in fact frnak dobson former health minister suggested this about ten years ago aint rocket science is it kevin taylor , omagh north ireland we have to say the north wales ambulance service has been brilliant with my husband who had a major accident in work 2 years ago the para medics were really good with him and when he came home theyd come and pick him up for his clinic appoimtments every 4 weeks so we cant fault the service here.he was taken to the maelor hospital in wrexham who also gave him the best of treatment .

over the last three months an average 106 vehicles a week have waited more than 50 minutes to deliver patients , the welsh ambulance service confirmed .
wales 's biggest hospital blamed bed blocking and people needlessly turning up at casualty .
in february there were delays at two hospitals due to a high volume of 999 calls and a shortage of beds .
the university hospital of wales in cardiff , said 160 of its beds were unavailable due to bed blocking .
we know that more than 30 % of people who come to our emergency unit could be treated by their gp or pharmacist hugh ross , chief executive of cardiff and vale nhs trust in a statement , it said a third of emergency patients could be treated by a gp or pharmacist .
hugh ross , chief executive of cardiff and vale nhs trust , which runs the hospital , said : " our emergency unit has been under greater pressure this summer than in previous years .
" this has meant more patients have experienced delays , and the trust regrets that this has been the case .
" we know that more than 30 % of people who come to our emergency unit could be treated by their gp or pharmacist , based on welsh assembly government surveys . "
he said 160 beds were unavailable because of delayed transfers of care - or bed blocking - and the length of these delays was " greater than in the past " .
the ambulance trust said it was addressing the issue with accident and emergency departments as a matter of urgency .
the summer months are traditionally a quiet time but the ambulance service said it has been encountering problems at major district hospitals .
the issue is of great concern to the service and we are , as a matter of urgency , addressing the situation with the hospitals welsh ambulance service spokesperson however , a spokesman said that figures had improved this week to an average of 85 ambulances waiting at hospitals for more than 50 minutes .
mike cassidy , director of ambulance services in wales , said how often and how long ambulances were having to wait varied .
but , he added : " we 've experienced some difficulties , maybe one or two days every couple of weeks just when the system overheats a bit and when demand is extremely high for us . "
he said that since february most serious patients had been admitted immediately while some less serious cases waited three to four hours " on occasions " .
measures had been put in place to help ease pressure on a & e , such as employing gps in ambulance service control centres .
mr cassidy added that it was important to make the public aware of the alternatives to calling an ambulance so resources were kept for the most seriously ill .
" i think quite often people call ambulances because they do n't really know what the alternatives are , and i think it 's about us trying to get information to the public to let them know what alternatives are available , for example , general practice and nhs direct wales , " he said .
' great concern ' a spokesman for the ambulance trust said it was working with hospitals to find ways of easing the pressure on accident and emergency departments .
the ambulance service experienced a crisis in 2006 which saw several bosses quit .
it had failed to meet response time targets and was branded " appalling " and " unacceptable " in a report by a committee of ams in march this year .
but in may , it claimed its performance was the best in its history , after hitting response targets for the second month running .
just last month , its chief alan murray said he had helped restore some pride and credibility after one year in the job .
have you been affected by ambulance queues at accident and emergency ?
were you , or a member of your family left waiting in an ambulance for hours because there was no room in the hospital ?
below is a selection of your comments .
in this event it is nothing to do with the reliability / unreliability of the ambulance service .
this is about the only two sectots within the nhs that actually do any work as everyone else just fobs off jobs .
the guys and gals on the ambulances and a & e are frontline troops that take abuse from all quarters when they produce positive results time after time in spite of the lack of back up from nhs bosses , wag and joe public .
r pardoe , radnorshire i 'm an experienced a & e nurse and part of my job involves helping patients access the right health care provider at the right time .
my employer empowers me to treat patients myself , refer them to a gp , an a & e doctor or another health care professional .
it 's not rocket science but not many trusts allow experienced nurses to use their skills in this way to help patients access appropriate care.as an example , if you cut your hand on glass you should be in a & e because you need to know there is no glass in your wound and that there is no damage to the nerves or tendons .
your gp is not the best person to treat you .
accident and emergency departments are the experts in treating injuries -lrb- no matter how slight -rrb- or emergencies , but it 's not always easy for the public to decide .
a & e nurse , monmouthshire i was on holiday in monmouthshire a few months ago . -lrb- funnily enough a & e nurse . -rrb-
my seriously disabled wife fell ill during the evening .
luckily she had been visited by a district nurse that day and we had been given the out of hours number of the local doctor .
i phoned this number and was told by a recorded message that the out of hours doctor was not available .
my circumstances meant that i had no option but to phone 999 .
i explained to the emergency services what had happened and that we probably just needed to see a doctor .
they decided that as the doctor was not available an ambulance must be deployed and my wife was taken to a & e. i 'll just repeat that : i said i just wanted the services of the out of hours gp .
they said that as one was n't available , an ambulance would be sent .
so who is responsible for clogging up a & e with patients who should really be seeing a gp ?
t james , cardiff the issues surrounding access to urgent and emergency care are not new .
the department of health in england successfully addressed most of issues with the establishment of the 'emergency services collaborative 'about four years ago - much work to maintain performance and standards continues .
in essence the problem is not about isolated emergency departments or the ambulance service it is a hospital and primary care wide concern .
the welsh assembly could learn much from the work done in england - the problems relating to emergency access are the same .
mike paynter , somerset i experienced a delay at a & e morriston hospital in february this year when my daughter was rushed by ambulance following a horrific injury to her face .
i waited with an embarrassed ambulance crew for almost 45 minutes before care was handed over to the hospital .
other ambulance crews -lrb- 4 -rrb- were also waiting to hand over care .
it is a disgrace and money is being wasted tying up paramedics who may be needed to attend other life or death incidents .
i complained to the then health minister brian gibbons only to be told that it was an operational matter for the hospital concerned and the welsh ambulance trust .
what they need in these hospitals is the staff to be able to take over the care of patients to release the ambulance staff .
that can not be too hard to sort out can it ?
david jones , neath my girlfeirnd was taken to morriston hospital a month ago with severe abdominal pains and she was forced to wait 3 hours for an ambulance to transfer her to singleton hospital for a scan on our unborn child .
to me this is simply not acceptable as it makes me wonder what our taxes get spent on ! ! !
mark , ystradgynlais this is just another example of how our ambulance service in wales is still failing , even after the arrival of mr murray .
fast response times mean absolutely nothing if the patient ca n't get into a place of treatment .
j.evans , north wales in a statement , it said a third of emergency patients could be treated by a gp or pharmacist .
then why not turn them away .
people will learn .
as usual this country is bending over backwards to please everyone where we need to prioritise and act on common sense !
daniel kynes-hughes , birmingham , uk we experienced the same thing in may this year with my father .
llandough hospital was so busy patients could n't be offloaded from the ambulances as there was no-where to put them in a & e - the situation is intolerable and the hospital staff would be the first to agree .
something urgently needs to be done about this unacceptable matter .
rob wheaton , cardiff about people ' needlessly turning up at casualty ' .
a few months ago i cut my hand on some glass .
nothing dramatic but deep enough for me to have problems in stopping the bleeding .
so i went to my local gp and hoped the nurse would look at it for me .
they refused , because i 'd cut myself on glass , and sent me off to the casualty in carmarthen .
there i waited for an hour and the staff quickly treated and dressed the wound .
now why could n't a trained nurse in a surgery do that ?
can anyone explain ?
richard crookston , pencader , carmerthenshire , wales it must be very difficult for paramedics when there are so many people calling an ambulance uneccesarily but i thougt that when an ambulance responded to any call it was up to the paramedics to determine whether the person needed to be taken to hospital or not .
if they do not need to go to hospital the ambulance therefore does not have to take them .
if the people are waiting in ambulances to be seen is this not a complete waste of an ambulance which could be needed in an emergency sarah williams , powys the problem is not a simple one .
it would not make any difference whether you doubled the number of staff in the a & e departments or had twice the number of ambulances available .
as hugh ross continues to say the beds are blocked .
until the assembly government sort out the problems of getting social care packages financed this will continue to be the case .
they know what the problem is but because the sums of money involved are huge they chose to let the situation continue and blame the trusts and the ambulance service .

now why could n't a trained nurse in a surgery do that ?
can anyone explain ?

over the last three months an average 106 vehicles a week have waited more than 50 minutes to deliver patients , the welsh ambulance service confirmed .
wales 's biggest hospital blamed bed blocking and people needlessly turning up at casualty .
in february there were delays at two hospitals due to a high volume of 999 calls and a shortage of beds .
the university hospital of wales in cardiff , said 160 of its beds were unavailable due to bed blocking . "
we know that more than 30 % of people who come to our emergency unit could be treated by their gp or pharmacist " hugh ross , chief executive of cardiff and vale nhs trust in a statement , it said a third of emergency patients could be treated by a gp or pharmacist .
hugh ross , chief executive of cardiff and vale nhs trust , which runs the hospital , said : " our emergency unit has been under greater pressure this summer than in previous years .
" this has meant more patients have experienced delays , and the trust regrets that this has been the case .
" we know that more than 30 % of people who come to our emergency unit could be treated by their gp or pharmacist , based on welsh assembly government surveys . "
he said 160 beds were unavailable because of delayed transfers of care - or bed blocking - and the length of these delays was " greater than in the past " .
the ambulance trust said it was addressing the issue with accident and emergency departments as a matter of urgency .
the summer months are traditionally a quiet time but the ambulance service said it has been encountering problems at major district hospitals . "
the issue is of great concern to the service and we are , as a matter of urgency , addressing the situation with the hospitals " welsh ambulance service spokesperson however , a spokesman said that figures had improved this week to an average of 85 ambulances waiting at hospitals for more than 50 minutes .
mike cassidy , director of ambulance services in wales , said how often and how long ambulances were having to wait varied .
but , he added : " we 've experienced some difficulties , maybe one or two days every couple of weeks just when the system overheats a bit and when demand is extremely high for us . "
he said that since february most serious patients had been admitted immediately while some less serious cases waited three to four hours " on occasions " .
measures had been put in place to help ease pressure on a & e , such as employing gps in ambulance service control centres .
mr cassidy added that it was important to make the public aware of the alternatives to calling an ambulance so resources were kept for the most seriously ill .
" i think quite often people call ambulances because they do n't really know what the alternatives are , and i think it 's about us trying to get information to the public to let them know what alternatives are available , for example , general practice and nhs direct wales , " he said .
' great concern ' a spokesman for the ambulance trust said it was working with hospitals to find ways of easing the pressure on accident and emergency departments .
the ambulance service experienced a crisis in 2006 which saw several bosses quit .
it had failed to meet response time targets and was branded " appalling " and " unacceptable " in a report by a committee of ams in march this year .
but in may , it claimed its performance was the best in its history , after hitting response targets for the second month running .
just last month , its chief alan murray said he had helped restore some pride and credibility after one year in the job .
have you been affected by ambulance queues at accident and emergency ?
were you , or a member of your family left waiting in an ambulance for hours because there was no room in the hospital ?
below is a selection of your comments .
in this event it is nothing to do with the reliability / unreliability of the ambulance service .
this is about the only two sectots within the nhs that actually do any work as everyone else just fobs off jobs .
the guys and gals on the ambulances and a & e are frontline troops that take abuse from all quarters when they produce positive results time after time in spite of the lack of back up from nhs bosses , wag and joe public .
r pardoe , radnorshire i 'm an experienced a & e nurse and part of my job involves helping patients access the right health care provider at the right time .
my employer empowers me to treat patients myself , refer them to a gp , an a & e doctor or another health care professional .
it 's not rocket science but not many trusts allow experienced nurses to use their skills in this way to help patients access appropriate care.as an example , if you cut your hand on glass you should be in a & e because you need to know there is no glass in your wound and that there is no damage to the nerves or tendons .
your gp is not the best person to treat you .
accident and emergency departments are the experts in treating injuries -lrb- no matter how slight -rrb- or emergencies , but it 's not always easy for the public to decide .
a & e nurse , monmouthshire i was on holiday in monmouthshire a few months ago . -lrb- funnily enough a & e nurse . -rrb-
my seriously disabled wife fell ill during the evening .
luckily she had been visited by a district nurse that day and we had been given the out of hours number of the local doctor .
i phoned this number and was told by a recorded message that the out of hours doctor was not available .
my circumstances meant that i had no option but to phone 999 .
i explained to the emergency services what had happened and that we probably just needed to see a doctor .
they decided that as the doctor was not available an ambulance must be deployed and my wife was taken to a & e. i 'll just repeat that : i said i just wanted the services of the out of hours gp .
they said that as one was n't available , an ambulance would be sent .
so who is responsible for clogging up a & e with patients who should really be seeing a gp ?
t james , cardiff the issues surrounding access to urgent and emergency care are not new .
the department of health in england successfully addressed most of issues with the establishment of the 'emergency services collaborative 'about four years ago - much work to maintain performance and standards continues .
in essence the problem is not about isolated emergency departments or the ambulance service it is a hospital and primary care wide concern .
the welsh assembly could learn much from the work done in england - the problems relating to emergency access are the same .
mike paynter , somerset i experienced a delay at a & e morriston hospital in february this year when my daughter was rushed by ambulance following a horrific injury to her face .
i waited with an embarrassed ambulance crew for almost 45 minutes before care was handed over to the hospital .
other ambulance crews -lrb- 4 -rrb- were also waiting to hand over care .
it is a disgrace and money is being wasted tying up paramedics who may be needed to attend other life or death incidents .
i complained to the then health minister brian gibbons only to be told that it was an operational matter for the hospital concerned and the welsh ambulance trust .
what they need in these hospitals is the staff to be able to take over the care of patients to release the ambulance staff .
that can not be too hard to sort out can it ?

but a quick scan of today 's tech titans , such as google , microsoft and apple , reveals few that originate in the uk .
the growing a big gorilla conference in cambridge is hoping to help redress the balance .
bbc news website technology reporter jonathan fildes and bbc technology correspondent rory cellan-jones are reporting from the meeting as it happens .
17.30 wednesday 5 september , jonathan fildes the conference is winding up for the day and the would be gorillas are heading back to their nests .
there has been a lot of debate here about how to grow big companies - the gorillas - in the uk .
and , as with a lot of things , the answer was about money .
there seemed to be a feeling that although the uk was brimming with ideas , there was not enough funding at early stages .
a particular need , identified by many , was for so-called business angels , affluent individuals who provides capital for business start-ups .
" we 've got a really small number and they are people that will only invest £ 50,000 or £ 100,000 .
in the states there are lots of people willing to put in millions , " said peter hornby , a conference organiser .
it was a view echoed by mike lynch of autonomy in his opening address .
however , there seemed to be a catch 22 situation : the reason that there are so few business angels is because there are so few serial entrepreneurs who had made enough money to invest in new tech start-ups in the first place .
it was clear that it was a situation that needed to be addressed if the uk was to grow big gorillas he said .
in addition , mr hornby said , there needed to be a cultural shift in the uk before firms become the tech titans of the future .
" in the uk people generally sell out to overseas firms , " he said .
he said uk entrepreneurs were willing to walk away from a project at a relatively early stage .
" they say : ' i 've made £ 5m , what am i going to do with £ 10m ' . "
in the states there is a mentality that ' i have made 100 million , now how do i make a billion ' , " he said .
so the bottom line , it seems , is if you want to grow into a big gorilla you have to remain hungry .
17.15 wednesday 5 september , jonathan fildes in one of my earlier posts i asked whether growing into huge global concerns was the right aspiration for uk tech start-ups .
an article in the guardian had posited that wikinomics - effectively open source collaboration over the internet - could spell the end of the big business .
peter hornby , one of the conference organisers disagreed .
" i agree that there has been a change and an ever increasing pace of change ; whether it will be the end of the big company , i suspect not , " he said .
he pointed to large organisations such as glaxo smithkline and proctor and gamble that had already embraced open practices for its research and development .
he said businesses were interested in this way of working because it opened up " vast opportunities that have never been available before and tap into resources . "
bbc news website readers agreed that it would change business practices .
ken from london wrote : i agree new ways of mass audience collaboration is changing how business is done .
it 's the law of abundance at work .
which means you 're bound to get more solutions to problems when you have more brains working on it ?
whilst john ferguson from ballymena wrote : ' wikinomics ' will not change basic economics , as shown by the goldcorp example .
the company offered a reward for a service and people offered their services .
so perhaps growing big should still be an ambition of uk tech start-ups but perhaps the route to becoming bigger is changing .
16.45 wednesday 5 september , jonathan fildes there are now almost three billion mobile phone users worldwide .
so it 's no surprise that a number of the gorillas of tomorrow displaying their wares here are hoping to exploit that massive user base .
alongside home alarm systems that use text messages to alert a user to a break-in or fire at their home and a range of maps to put on your gps enabled phone are a host of other uk innovations .
one , called gridsure , is a collaboration with mobile security firm masabi .
its technology hopes to make pin numbers redundant .
" instead of a pin you have a shape , " said ben whitaker of masabi .
each user chooses their own shape made of four squares on a five by five grid .
when they need to use a pin number they are shown a grid on their mobile phone and they enter the 4 digits which are in the squares that make up their shape .
the numbers in the grid change each time .
another technology , called capturatalk , uses a camera phone to translate text to speech .
the technology is aimed at people with learning difficulties and dyslexia .
it has been developed by dutch researchers and uk firm iansyst .
a user points the camera at the text they want to read ¿ perhaps on a road sign or in a book ¿ takes a picture and the onboard software does the rest , converting the text into audio .
the interface is totally icon based .
" it has to be as simple as possible , ' said neil milliken of iansyst .
it is currently only available on a phone made by htc , but the firm eventually hopes to offer it as a download .
along with english , the technology can already be used with swedish , danish and importantly spanish software .
" we 're looking to take it to the states and obviously that 's one of the most widely used languages , " said mr milliken .
15.00 wednesday 5 september , jonathan fildes alongside some of the more charismatic pieces of technology - the flying saucer , the chemical sensor that uses live bees - are , perhaps , the more specialist , less attention grabbing ones .
there is enval that has built a pilot recycling plant to cope with aluminium and waste plastic .
across the room are a couple of medical applications : computer models of cancers designed by horizons discovery to help the search for better drugs and an invention called ear scaffold , funded by the nhs , that reduces the need for surgery for people with prominent ears .
alongside these is inkski , another firm whose display looks like it has been transported straight from the laboratory bench .
the firm says it is using nanotechnology to change the printing industry .
simply put , the firm has invented a new high-speed inkjet nozzle that could allow commercial printers - newspapers , and magazines - to go completely digital .
at the moment , the last stage of the printing process is still mechanical - using large printing plates to put ink to paper .
last minute changes are therefore difficult and production runs are small .
using the inkski nozzle , the company claims , could change that .
it uses a rapidly spinning cylinder and a laser to selectively fire ink on to the paper to form an image .
the researchers say it is 20 times the speed of conventional inkjet printing .
" the ultimate objective is to print at the same throughput as conventional commercial printing , " said dr daniel hall , ceo and co-founder of the firm .
he believes if the industry did take up his idea , it could change the entire concept of a paper .
" it makes it possible to customise the content for the readership , " he said .
" there 's no reason why if you sign up for a sunday paper , you could n't have two pages of ebay adverts in the middle for things that you are particularly interested in . " 14.20 wednesday 5 september , jonathan fildes the technology demonstrations have started as part of the gorillas of tomorrow display .
the gadget that grabbed most attention was a remote controlled flying saucer from a company called gfs .
there are no bizarre acronyms here .
the name stands for geoff 's flying saucers , after the inventor and founder geoff hatton .
the discs , equipped with cameras , have been developed as a surveillance platform .
geoff happily showed off the saucers as they whizzed around the quad here at churchill college .
a flying saucer is supposedly more stable than a helicopter but has similar manoeuvrability - and unlike current unmanned aerial vehicles , it can land anywhere .
the company already has a contract from the us military and will compete in a uk military technology competition next year .
but mr hatton says there are far more uses for the eyes-in-the-sky than just defence , including agriculture and wildlife tracking .
the sky 's the limit for geoff .
13.05 wednesday 5 september , rory cellan-jones some firms seeking funding find novel uses for old technologies .
a company adapting tried and tested systems in innovative ways is alertme .
it sets up a data base of your home 's security systems and monitors what is happening .
so , if you go out without locking a door it will phone you .
it will also alert you if a window is opened while you are away .
the question is , is this significantly different enough to systems already on the market to attract investment . ? 13.00 wednesday 5 september , jonathan fildes it seems if you are a uk tech start-up you are not much different to the latest boy band or budding actress ; you need to break america .
that was the message from mike lynch , founder of global software firm autonomy in his opening speech to the growing big gorillas conference , " the us is not a choice , " he told delegates .
he should know .
he has managed to grow a gorilla that started out with $ 2000 -lrb- £ 995 -rrb- to a $ 4bn dollar -lrb- £ 1.9bn -rrb- global concern .
" moderate success in the us will dwarf success in any of the european markets , " he said .
but , he warned , do n't be sucked in by marketing spin by state governments trying to attract you to set up in a backwater in the centre of the us .
silicon valley , boston and austin in texas he said were the places to go if you needed the people and the infrastructure to break the country .
he also talked about the climate of innovation in the uk .
he said that the uk was bursting with good ideas , and tech people , but , unlike silicon valley , companies were poor at marketing themselves and their ideas .
change that , add some extra funding for early ideas and get rid of the mindset of trying to beat silicon valley -lrb- " turn your competitors into customers " -rrb- and the uk , and silicon fen in particular , could begin to grow more gorillas , or " orang-utans " as one person referred to his company .
11.50 wednesday 5 september , rory cellan-jones a whole host of firms in cambridge , eager to seek investment for their ideas .
many companies are including green policies in their portfolios amid concerns over global warming and pollution .
security has also risen up the political agenda - provoking increasingly inventive ways of detecting illegal or dangerous substances .
hertfordshire-based research firm inscentinel is at the conference , hoping to find a backer for its concept of using bees to find substances such as explosives .
it trains the bees , measures their reactions , then returns them to their colony once their work is done .
10.30 wednesday 5 september , jonathan fildes there 's an interesting piece in today 's guardian called the wiki way .
it 's essentially an overview of don tapscott 's new book wikinomics : how mass collaboration changes everything .
in it he argues that we have barely begun to imagine how the internet will change the way we live and work .
in particular , he says , the rise of collaboration will change the nature of business .
the guardian article highlights the case of a struggling gold mining company , goldcorp .
in 2000 , the firm made the bold decision to make all off its complex geological data online and offered prize money to anyone who could identify where potential new gold reserves may lay .
the company received 100 recommendations , half of which the company had never considered .
four fifths of those contained gold .
the company 's value has since rocketed from $ 100m -lrb- £ 49.7m -rrb- to $ 9bn -lrb- £ 4.4bn -rrb- .
the article suggests that the rise of this kind of collaboration could spell the end of large companies .
" we could yet see the day when big companies such as google seem prehistoric , " the article says .
which all made me wonder whether the goal of trying to grow " gorillas " - the theme of this conference - was now an outdated concept .
so , in the interest of collaboration : what do you think ?
will the internet change the rules of the game ?
is it game over for big corporations or is the rise of wikinomics just a passing fad ? 0900 wednesday 5 september , jonathan fildes growing big gorillas is n't an obvious name to pick for a business conference .
after all , it conjures up images of king kong-inspired scientists hoping to breed a lineage of oversized apes .
the one-day conference , being held at churchill college , cambridge , is -lrb- unfortunately -rrb- not about that .
rather , it is a chance for budding entrepreneurs to listen to the people behind some of the uk 's most successful start-ups and find out how to grow their business into a large international company - a " big gorilla " in the words of the conference organisers .
speakers include dr mike lynch , ceo of autonomy , a successful cambridge university spin-out company that develops software , some of which sits in products from the likes of oracle , symantec , hewlett packard and ibm .
autonomy is already a gorilla - a leader in its field - but the conference organisers hope they can inspire another generation .
and some of those are on display in an emerging technology show , aptly named gorillas of tomorrow .
gadgets developed by some of these would-be giants include a sensitive chemical detector that uses trained bees ; unmanned flying saucers for surveillance and reconnaissance , and a smartphone application that photographs text and reads it out .
the latter , known as capturatalk , is aimed at people with dyslexia or visual impairments .
throughout the day i 'll be dipping in and out of the conference sessions and taking a closer look at some of the devices and gadgets on display .
i 'll be trying to find out what makes a gorilla and whether the uk has the right environment for one to grow .
in short , i 'll be trying to spot a gorilla in our midst .

lack of funding for firms in the early stages there has been a lot of debate here about how to grow big companies - the gorillas - in the uk .
and , as with a lot of things , the answer was about money .
there seemed to be a feeling that although the uk was brimming with ideas , there was not enough funding at early stages .
a particular need , identified by many , was for so-called business angels , affluent individuals who provides capital for business start-ups .
" we 've got a really small number and they are people that will only invest £ 50,000 or £ 100,000 .
in the states there are lots of people willing to put in millions , " said peter hornby , a conference organiser .
it was a view echoed by mike lynch of autonomy in his opening address .
however , there seemed to be a catch 22 situation : the reason that there are so few business angels is because there are so few serial entrepreneurs who had made enough money to invest in new tech start-ups in the first place .
it was clear that it was a situation that needed to be addressed if the uk was to grow big gorillas he said .
in addition , mr hornby said , there needed to be a cultural shift in the uk before firms become the tech titans of the future .
" in the uk people generally sell out to overseas firms , " he said .
he said uk entrepreneurs were willing to walk away from a project at a relatively early stage .
" they say : ' i 've made £ 5m , what am i going to do with £ 10m ' . "
in the states there is a mentality that ' i have made 100 million , now how do i make a billion ' , " he said .
so the bottom line , it seems , is if you want to grow into a big gorilla you have to remain hungry .
17.15 wednesday 5 september , jonathan fildes in one of my earlier posts i asked whether growing into huge global concerns was the right aspiration for uk tech start-ups .
big business is embracing open practices for research an article in the guardian had posited that wikinomics - effectively open source collaboration over the internet - could spell the end of the big business .
peter hornby , one of the conference organisers disagreed .
" i agree that there has been a change and an ever increasing pace of change ; whether it will be the end of the big company , i suspect not , " he said .
he pointed to large organisations such as glaxo smithkline and proctor and gamble that had already embraced open practices for its research and development .
he said businesses were interested in this way of working because it opened up " vast opportunities that have never been available before and tap into resources . "
bbc news website readers agreed that it would change business practices .
ken from london wrote : i agree new ways of mass audience collaboration is changing how business is done .
it 's the law of abundance at work .
which means you 're bound to get more solutions to problems when you have more brains working on it ?
whilst john ferguson from ballymena wrote : ' wikinomics ' will not change basic economics , as shown by the goldcorp example .
the company offered a reward for a service and people offered their services .
so perhaps growing big should still be an ambition of uk tech start-ups but perhaps the route to becoming bigger is changing .
16.45 wednesday 5 september , jonathan fildes pins ' to be scrapped ' there are now almost three billion mobile phone users worldwide .
so it 's no surprise that a number of the gorillas of tomorrow displaying their wares here are hoping to exploit that massive user base .
alongside home alarm systems that use text messages to alert a user to a break-in or fire at their home and a range of maps to put on your gps enabled phone are a host of other uk innovations .
one , called gridsure , is a collaboration with mobile security firm masabi .
its technology hopes to make pin numbers redundant .
" instead of a pin you have a shape , " said ben whitaker of masabi .
each user chooses their own shape made of four squares on a five by five grid .
when they need to use a pin number they are shown a grid on their mobile phone and they enter the 4 digits which are in the squares that make up their shape .
the numbers in the grid change each time .
another technology , called capturatalk , uses a camera phone to translate text to speech .
the technology is aimed at people with learning difficulties and dyslexia .
it has been developed by dutch researchers and uk firm iansyst .
a user points the camera at the text they want to read ¿ perhaps on a road sign or in a book ¿ takes a picture and the onboard software does the rest , converting the text into audio .
the interface is totally icon based .
" it has to be as simple as possible , ' said neil milliken of iansyst .
it is currently only available on a phone made by htc , but the firm eventually hopes to offer it as a download .
along with english , the technology can already be used with swedish , danish and importantly spanish software .
" we 're looking to take it to the states and obviously that 's one of the most widely used languages , " said mr milliken .
15.00 wednesday 5 september , jonathan fildes alongside some of the more charismatic pieces of technology - the flying saucer , the chemical sensor that uses live bees - are , perhaps , the more specialist , less attention grabbing ones .
one invention promises help for those with prominent ears there is enval that has built a pilot recycling plant to cope with aluminium and waste plastic .
across the room are a couple of medical applications : computer models of cancers designed by horizons discovery to help the search for better drugs and an invention called ear scaffold , funded by the nhs , that reduces the need for surgery for people with prominent ears .
alongside these is inkski , another firm whose display looks like it has been transported straight from the laboratory bench .
the firm says it is using nanotechnology to change the printing industry .
simply put , the firm has invented a new high-speed inkjet nozzle that could allow commercial printers - newspapers , and magazines - to go completely digital .
at the moment , the last stage of the printing process is still mechanical - using large printing plates to put ink to paper .
last minute changes are therefore difficult and production runs are small .
using the inkski nozzle , the company claims , could change that .
it uses a rapidly spinning cylinder and a laser to selectively fire ink on to the paper to form an image .
the researchers say it is 20 times the speed of conventional inkjet printing .
" the ultimate objective is to print at the same throughput as conventional commercial printing , " said dr daniel hall , ceo and co-founder of the firm .
he believes if the industry did take up his idea , it could change the entire concept of a paper .
" it makes it possible to customise the content for the readership , " he said .
" there 's no reason why if you sign up for a sunday paper , you could n't have two pages of ebay adverts in the middle for things that you are particularly interested in . " 14.20 wednesday 5 september , jonathan fildes spying flying saucer the technology demonstrations have started as part of the gorillas of tomorrow display .
the gadget that grabbed most attention was a remote controlled flying saucer from a company called gfs .
there are no bizarre acronyms here .
the name stands for geoff 's flying saucers , after the inventor and founder geoff hatton .
the discs , equipped with cameras , have been developed as a surveillance platform .
geoff happily showed off the saucers as they whizzed around the quad here at churchill college .
a flying saucer is supposedly more stable than a helicopter but has similar manoeuvrability - and unlike current unmanned aerial vehicles , it can land anywhere .
the company already has a contract from the us military and will compete in a uk military technology competition next year .
but mr hatton says there are far more uses for the eyes-in-the-sky than just defence , including agriculture and wildlife tracking .
the sky 's the limit for geoff .
13.05 wednesday 5 september , rory cellan-jones alarm that phones some firms seeking funding find novel uses for old technologies .
a company adapting tried and tested systems in innovative ways is alertme .
it sets up a data base of your home 's security systems and monitors what is happening .
so , if you go out without locking a door it will phone you .
it will also alert you if a window is opened while you are away .
the question is , is this significantly different enough to systems already on the market to attract investment . ? 13.00 wednesday 5 september , jonathan fildes it seems if you are a uk tech start-up you are not much different to the latest boy band or budding actress ; you need to break america .
breaking america is essential that was the message from mike lynch , founder of global software firm autonomy in his opening speech to the growing big gorillas conference , " the us is not a choice , " he told delegates .
he should know .
he has managed to grow a gorilla that started out with $ 2000 -lrb- £ 995 -rrb- to a $ 4bn dollar -lrb- £ 1.9bn -rrb- global concern .
" moderate success in the us will dwarf success in any of the european markets , " he said .
but , he warned , do n't be sucked in by marketing spin by state governments trying to attract you to set up in a backwater in the centre of the us .
silicon valley , boston and austin in texas he said were the places to go if you needed the people and the infrastructure to break the country .
he also talked about the climate of innovation in the uk .
he said that the uk was bursting with good ideas , and tech people , but , unlike silicon valley , companies were poor at marketing themselves and their ideas .
change that , add some extra funding for early ideas and get rid of the mindset of trying to beat silicon valley -lrb- " turn your competitors into customers " -rrb- and the uk , and silicon fen in particular , could begin to grow more gorillas , or " orang-utans " as one person referred to his company .
11.50 wednesday 5 september , rory cellan-jones bee firm seeks cash a whole host of firms in cambridge , eager to seek investment for their ideas .
many companies are including green policies in their portfolios amid concerns over global warming and pollution .
security has also risen up the political agenda - provoking increasingly inventive ways of detecting illegal or dangerous substances .
hertfordshire-based research firm inscentinel is at the conference , hoping to find a backer for its concept of using bees to find substances such as explosives .
it trains the bees , measures their reactions , then returns them to their colony once their work is done .
10.30 wednesday 5 september , jonathan fildes there 's an interesting piece in today 's guardian called the wiki way .
has collaboration rendered traditional economics redundant ?
it 's essentially an overview of don tapscott 's new book wikinomics : how mass collaboration changes everything .
in it he argues that we have barely begun to imagine how the internet will change the way we live and work .
in particular , he says , the rise of collaboration will change the nature of business .
the guardian article highlights the case of a struggling gold mining company , goldcorp .
in 2000 , the firm made the bold decision to make all off its complex geological data online and offered prize money to anyone who could identify where potential new gold reserves may lay .
the company received 100 recommendations , half of which the company had never considered .
four fifths of those contained gold .
the company 's value has since rocketed from $ 100m -lrb- £ 49.7m -rrb- to $ 9bn -lrb- £ 4.4bn -rrb- .
the article suggests that the rise of this kind of collaboration could spell the end of large companies .
" we could yet see the day when big companies such as google seem prehistoric , " the article says .
which all made me wonder whether the goal of trying to grow " gorillas " - the theme of this conference - was now an outdated concept .
so , in the interest of collaboration : what do you think ?
will the internet change the rules of the game ?
is it game over for big corporations or is the rise of wikinomics just a passing fad ?
let us know your thoughts 0900 wednesday 5 september , jonathan fildes the conference hopes to help the gorillas of tomorrow growing big gorillas is n't an obvious name to pick for a business conference .
after all , it conjures up images of king kong-inspired scientists hoping to breed a lineage of oversized apes .
the one-day conference , being held at churchill college , cambridge , is -lrb- unfortunately -rrb- not about that .
rather , it is a chance for budding entrepreneurs to listen to the people behind some of the uk 's most successful start-ups and find out how to grow their business into a large international company - a " big gorilla " in the words of the conference organisers .
speakers include dr mike lynch , ceo of autonomy , a successful cambridge university spin-out company that develops software , some of which sits in products from the likes of oracle , symantec , hewlett packard and ibm .
autonomy is already a gorilla - a leader in its field - but the conference organisers hope they can inspire another generation .
and some of those are on display in an emerging technology show , aptly named gorillas of tomorrow .
gadgets developed by some of these would-be giants include a sensitive chemical detector that uses trained bees ; unmanned flying saucers for surveillance and reconnaissance , and a smartphone application that photographs text and reads it out .
the latter , known as capturatalk , is aimed at people with dyslexia or visual impairments .
throughout the day i 'll be dipping in and out of the conference sessions and taking a closer look at some of the devices and gadgets on display .
i 'll be trying to find out what makes a gorilla and whether the uk has the right environment for one to grow .
in short , i 'll be trying to spot a gorilla in our midst .
