" we want more control mechanisms , " she said .
" whenever you are in shop buying a computer or video game it is going to be clear - this is not to be in children 's hands . " fears follow school shootings the move comes in the wake of increasing german concern about the effects of violent media on young people and possible links to extreme acts of violence by young people in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen called for larger warning labels on violent video games and movies in november last year , an 18-year-old student shot and injured 32 people at his former high school , before committing suicide at the scene .
according to his former schoolmates , the young man was a fanatical player of the violent computer game " counter-strike . "
at the time , parents and politicians called for action against such games . von der leyen 's plans include bigger warning labels , similar to those on cigarette packets warning of the dangers of smoking , on computer games .
the amendments also call for violent computer games with age restrictions to produce a beeping sound when scanned at cash registers to alert the cashier .
some games and films would also no longer be available at general shops at all . the second part of her strategy involves greater information for parents , including several online portals that will soon be available to inform parents about the content of computer games on the market problem beyond borders armin laschet , youth minister of the state of north rhine-westphalia , supported the move but also said eu-wide action is needed . " we need a european debate because games are produced in every member state of the european union and abroad from asia or the united states , " laschet said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent games do not necessarily lead to violent actions , an expert said however , not everyone agrees on the alleged link between violent entertainment and violent action .
klaus hurrelmann , a specialist in sociology and child development at the university of bielefeld , said the evidence does n't support the connection made by politicians . " we have to rely on research in this case that says there is no lineal or causal relationship between computer games and violent behavior , " he said .
" we have , first , the vulnerable personality that really triggers violence , and , second , finding a fitting context .
only if these things come together does the vicious circle begin .

-lrb- 16.01.2007 -rrb- no causal relationship between video games and violence exists politicians have raised the issue of whether violent video games contributed to a school shooting in germany this week .

" the report was endorsed , after sifting through 270 proposed amendments , by 382 representatives , another 256 voted against it and there were 74 abstentions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian mp claudio fava : it was a wider practice as well as condemning " the acceptance and concealing " of the clandestine prisoner transfers by the secret services and governments of certain european countries , the report expressed grave doubts over assertions by nations that they were unaware of the practice . the parliament , the eu 's only directly elected body , called for pressure to be put on the concerned governments " to give full and true information " about the operations and " where necessary to start hearings and commission an independent investigation without delay .

' not a couple of episodes ' the program began in late 2001 , following the sept .

" if we put all the eye witness accounts together , then we can see that it was not a question of a couple of episodes , but of a wider practice , " fava told german public television station ard . pressure on the vote with almost half the total eu members implicated , there were reports of pressure from national governments on the meps ahead of the vote , as well as splits within the parliamentary groupings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz and his lawyer addressed the eu parliament the report named 13 eu nations - austria , britain , cyprus , denmark , germany , greece , ireland , italy , poland , portugal , romania , spain and sweden - along with non-eu countries bosnia , macedonia and turkey . over six months , the parliamentary commission took evidence from 130 people , including government officials , secret service agents , judges , lawyers , journalists and ngo representatives . call for enquiries eu justice commissioner franco frattini urged member states to hold national inquiries into the matter . " the governments need to reveal the truth , even if the truth is disturbing , " he told the parliament . magistrates and governments should hold administrative enquiries and punish officials found guilty of colluding with illegal cia action , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice minister franco frattini urges national enquiries günter gloser , european affairs minister for germany , which holds the rotating eu presidency , said the eu parliament 's report included conclusions " that go very far . " he deplored that some " assertions are swiftly transformed into facts " and added that " from our point of view , more moderated statements would be preferable . " the parliamentary vote came at a moment when judges in germany , italy and spain are investigating suspected transfers of terrorism suspects . in germany , news has focused on two cases .
in one , a german of lebanese descent , khalid el masri , was taken in late 2003 by the cia from macedonia to a prison in afghanistan , in a case of mistaken identity . murat kurnaz , a german-born turk who lived in bremen , spent four years in the us military prison at guantanamo bay , after having been held in afghanistan .

but a change in format has made the uefa cup harder .
it 's a trophy teams want to win . if you believe what you hear , you could be fooled into thinking that there is only one big european fixture on the horizon for germany 's teams in the next week . with their domestic league form mixed at best , bayern munich 's season hinges on their champions league clash against real madrid on feb .
20 .
it is undoubtedly a huge game ; if bayern lose the tie over two legs , they will have to resign themselves to a season without silverware . but the bavarian giants are not the only german team still in the hunt for european honors .
bayer leverkusen and werder bremen take on difficult opposition on wednesday night in the first knock-out round of the uefa cup .
leverkusen take on english premiership side blackburn rovers while werder have a tricky tie against ajax amsterdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uefa cup -lrb- r . -rrb- with its more prestigious relative despite its reputation as the champions league 's poorer relation , the uefa cup is still a hard fought and extremely difficult competition to win .
after format changes in the 2004/05 season that introduced a league round and the inclusion of those third-placed champions league sides that missed out on qualification , the uefa cup now has more games and now features tougher teams . german clubs go for first win in a decade it has been exactly ten years since a german team last won the trophy - schalke 04 beating inter milan on penalties in the 1996/07 final - and the list of winners since shows that the uefa cup is hardly a competition for minnows . leverkusen and bremen both hope to mark the anniversary by bringing the cup back to germany for the first time in a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen entered the uefa cup after losing to barca for werder , the uefa cup may at first seem like an anti-climax .
thrust into undoubtedly the hardest group stage of this season 's champions league , thomas schaaf 's side cruelly missed out on an historic qualification from group a by one point after beating english champions chelsea at the weserstadion and holding the current european champions barcelona to a draw . werder dropped into the uefa cup at the start of the knock-out stages and instantly became one of the favorites to win the trophy on the back of their bundesliga form and improving european credentials .
however , if bremen thought they were in for an easy time , the draw had them thinking again . bremen face dutch masters in sticky knock-out tie ajax amsterdam have four european cups to their name , one uefa cup , 29 dutch championship titles and are currently second in the dutch league .
a club which did much to introduce the concept of total football to the world , a fluid system which allows the outfield players the freedom to swap positions , ajax will prove to be a real test for bremen . while not exactly a team known for a lack of confidence , two successive defeats in the bundesliga have put werder six points behind leaders schalke 04 and have knocked them out of their free-scoring rhythm .
" we 'll have to see whether this latest defeat gives us the spur we need - or not , " bremen 's germany striker miroslav klose said tuesday . bildunterschrift : ajax players prepare for wednesday 's clash in bremen ajax , whose dutch title hopes have been re-ignited by closest rivals psv eindhoven 's poor run , have defensive worries with injuries ruling out defenders urby emanuelson , zdenek grygera and thomas vermaelen . recently re-signed amsterdam legend edgar davids is cup-tied for the remainder of the competition after featuring for former club tottenham hotspur in the group stage . for bayer leverkusen , the uefa cup offers a glamorous respite from the rigors of their mediocre bundesliga campaign .
however , things will have to pick up for michael skibbe 's team if they are to carry on enjoying its distractions . unconvincing leverkusen meet battling blackburn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benni mccarthy -lrb- center -rrb- has blackburn dreaming currently lying seventh in the league , bayer have had a mixed season domestically and have also struggled to maintain any consistency in europe .
leverkusen limped out of group b in third place with just four points and will meet group e winners blackburn , a team that only dropped two points in qualifying . blackburn are also enduring a less than exemplary season in the premiership but have definitely reserved their best performances for the uefa cup , fired by pre-season signing benni mccarthy , a uefa cup winner with fc porto in 2003 . rovers play a robust game as one would expect from a team managed by the combative mark hughes , a former bayern munich player .
leverkusen 's progress is far from assured . injuries plague both sides ahead of clash things have been made worse by injuries to defenders juan and roque junior and coach skibbe may also have to do without captain carsten ramelow .
the influential midfielder made his comeback from a knee operation in saturday 's 2-2 draw against eintracht frankfurt but he is still far from fully match fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten ramelow , left , may not be risked against blackburn " the comeback was way too soon but i needed him , " said skibbe , who will have to think hard before asking ramelow to play a second game in five days . blackburn hope midfielder david dunn will have recovered from a dead leg in time for the leverkusen match after picking up the injury at the weekend .
" it should settle down and it should n't be a problem for him , " hughes told the club 's web site on tuesday . rovers will also be without long-term injury victims robbie savage and andre ooijer , who are both recovering from broken legs . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german clubs learn next uefa cup foes tuesday saw the draw for the group stage of the uefa cup .

after format changes in the 2004/05 season that introduced a league round and the inclusion of those third-placed champions league sides that missed out on qualification , the uefa cup now has more games and now features tougher teams . german clubs go for first win in a decade it has been exactly ten years since a german team last won the trophy - schalke 04 beating inter milan on penalties in the 1996/07 final - and the list of winners since shows that the uefa cup is hardly a competition for minnows . leverkusen and bremen both hope to mark the anniversary by bringing the cup back to germany for the first time in a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen entered the uefa cup after losing to barca for werder , the uefa cup may at first seem like an anti-climax .
thrust into undoubtedly the hardest group stage of this season 's champions league , thomas schaaf 's side cruelly missed out on an historic qualification from group a by one point after beating english champions chelsea at the weserstadion and holding the current european champions barcelona to a draw . werder dropped into the uefa cup at the start of the knock-out stages and instantly became one of the favorites to win the trophy on the back of their bundesliga form and improving european credentials .
however , if bremen thought they were in for an easy time , the draw had them thinking again . bremen face dutch masters in sticky knock-out tie ajax amsterdam have four european cups to their name , one uefa cup , 29 dutch championship titles and are currently second in the dutch league .
a club which did much to introduce the concept of total football to the world , a fluid system which allows the outfield players the freedom to swap positions , ajax will prove to be a real test for bremen . while not exactly a team known for a lack of confidence , two successive defeats in the bundesliga have put werder six points behind leaders schalke 04 and have knocked them out of their free-scoring rhythm .
" we 'll have to see whether this latest defeat gives us the spur we need - or not , " bremen 's germany striker miroslav klose said tuesday . bildunterschrift : ajax players prepare for wednesday 's clash in bremen ajax , whose dutch title hopes have been re-ignited by closest rivals psv eindhoven 's poor run , have defensive worries with injuries ruling out defenders urby emanuelson , zdenek grygera and thomas vermaelen . recently re-signed amsterdam legend edgar davids is cup-tied for the remainder of the competition after featuring for former club tottenham hotspur in the group stage . for bayer leverkusen , the uefa cup offers a glamorous respite from the rigors of their mediocre bundesliga campaign .
however , things will have to pick up for michael skibbe 's team if they are to carry on enjoying its distractions . unconvincing leverkusen meet battling blackburn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benni mccarthy -lrb- center -rrb- has blackburn dreaming currently lying seventh in the league , bayer have had a mixed season domestically and have also struggled to maintain any consistency in europe .
leverkusen limped out of group b in third place with just four points and will meet group e winners blackburn , a team that only dropped two points in qualifying . blackburn are also enduring a less than exemplary season in the premiership but have definitely reserved their best performances for the uefa cup , fired by pre-season signing benni mccarthy , a uefa cup winner with fc porto in 2003 . rovers play a robust game as one would expect from a team managed by the combative mark hughes , a former bayern munich player .
leverkusen 's progress is far from assured . injuries plague both sides ahead of clash things have been made worse by injuries to defenders juan and roque junior and coach skibbe may also have to do without captain carsten ramelow .
the influential midfielder made his comeback from a knee operation in saturday 's 2-2 draw against eintracht frankfurt but he is still far from fully match fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten ramelow , left , may not be risked against blackburn " the comeback was way too soon but i needed him , " said skibbe , who will have to think hard before asking ramelow to play a second game in five days . blackburn hope midfielder david dunn will have recovered from a dead leg in time for the leverkusen match after picking up the injury at the weekend .
" it should settle down and it should n't be a problem for him , " hughes told the club 's web site on tuesday . rovers will also be without long-term injury victims robbie savage and andre ooijer , who are both recovering from broken legs . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german clubs learn next uefa cup foes tuesday saw the draw for the group stage of the uefa cup .

britain got a failing grade , coming in dead last while northern europe came out on top . a unicef study that compared the situation of children in 21 industrialized nations put german children squarely in the middle of the list , at 11th place . the report by the united nations children 's advocacy agency compared six markers , including material wealth , health , education , relationship to parents and peers , behaviors and risks , as well as the children 's own assessment of their situation , to determine the rankings . typical of poor scoring nations were children who did not trust their friends , rarely spent time with parents , and overate .
poverty among minorities and a lack of books in homes also dragged down scores . northern europe scores high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kinder beim essen top marks went mostly to northern european countries .
the netherlands garnered first place , followed by sweden , denmark , finland , spain and switzerland .
france took 16th place , while the uk landed a miserable 21st slot . the honorary chairwoman of german unicef , heide simonis , called germany 's middle-of-the-pack showing " unsatisfying . "
she told bavarian state radio the country needs more full-day schools and more childcare for very young children .
in addition , she said , politicians have to take the problems of youth more seriously . german family minster ursula von der leyen this week proposed spending 3 million -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- euros more on expanding childcare in germany , a plan that has received approval from political leaders though the proposal still lacks a funding plan . germany scored poorly on its schools , which mostly operate in the morning only , and its lack of success helping immigrant children . regional disparities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians have called for more childcare centers simonis noted that the german education system suffers under severe regional disparities as some states offer a better education than others . simonis also noted that germany scored poorly when it came to cigarette and alcohol use .
the country - the last bastion for smokers in europe - has more teen smokers under the age of 15 than in any other . " germans share with the british the dubious honor of having the children and teenagers who drink alcohol most often , " she added . moreover , the study showed nearly 40 percent of surveyed german children said their parents " never really talk " to them . germans less aggressive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , with britain , reported the most underage drinking simonis stressed that there were some positive results , too .
for example , german children and teens were relatively less aggressive than in other countries . the caritas aid organization told news agencies that the study clearly showed that the lack of a reliable living environment can be a serious detriment to the development of children in german society , especially for less-educated and immigrant families . there was also dismay over the results in britain , with commentators saying the low ratings for personal relationships were evidence of a dog-eat-dog society where too many children hang around on the streets . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside " the german parliament 's commission for children 's concerns this week discussed including children 's rights in the constitution .
in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue .
-lrb- 22.11.2006 -rrb- experts shed light on germany 's poverty and welfare woes new studies in germany shed light on the twin problems of growing poverty and a deficit in the child-welfare system that could be related .
experts have spoken out on both issues .

but a change in format has made the uefa cup harder .
it 's a trophy teams want to win . if you believe what you hear , you could be fooled into thinking that there is only one big european fixture on the horizon for germany 's teams in the next week . with their domestic league form mixed at best , bayern munich 's season hinges on their champions league clash against real madrid on feb .

but a change in format has made the uefa cup harder .
it 's a trophy teams want to win . if you believe what you hear , you could be fooled into thinking that there is only one big european fixture on the horizon for germany 's teams in the next week . with their domestic league form mixed at best , bayern munich 's season hinges on their champions league clash against real madrid on feb .
20 .
it is undoubtedly a huge game ; if bayern lose the tie over two legs , they will have to resign themselves to a season without silverware . but the bavarian giants are not the only german team still in the hunt for european honors .
bayer leverkusen and werder bremen take on difficult opposition on wednesday night in the first knock-out round of the uefa cup .
leverkusen take on english premiership side blackburn rovers while werder have a tricky tie against ajax amsterdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uefa cup -lrb- r . -rrb- with its more prestigious relative despite its reputation as the champions league 's poorer relation , the uefa cup is still a hard fought and extremely difficult competition to win .
after format changes in the 2004/05 season that introduced a league round and the inclusion of those third-placed champions league sides that missed out on qualification , the uefa cup now has more games and now features tougher teams . german clubs go for first win in a decade it has been exactly ten years since a german team last won the trophy - schalke 04 beating inter milan on penalties in the 1996/07 final - and the list of winners since shows that the uefa cup is hardly a competition for minnows . leverkusen and bremen both hope to mark the anniversary by bringing the cup back to germany for the first time in a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen entered the uefa cup after losing to barca for werder , the uefa cup may at first seem like an anti-climax .
thrust into undoubtedly the hardest group stage of this season 's champions league , thomas schaaf 's side cruelly missed out on an historic qualification from group a by one point after beating english champions chelsea at the weserstadion and holding the current european champions barcelona to a draw . werder dropped into the uefa cup at the start of the knock-out stages and instantly became one of the favorites to win the trophy on the back of their bundesliga form and improving european credentials .
however , if bremen thought they were in for an easy time , the draw had them thinking again . bremen face dutch masters in sticky knock-out tie ajax amsterdam have four european cups to their name , one uefa cup , 29 dutch championship titles and are currently second in the dutch league .
a club which did much to introduce the concept of total football to the world , a fluid system which allows the outfield players the freedom to swap positions , ajax will prove to be a real test for bremen . while not exactly a team known for a lack of confidence , two successive defeats in the bundesliga have put werder six points behind leaders schalke 04 and have knocked them out of their free-scoring rhythm .
" we 'll have to see whether this latest defeat gives us the spur we need - or not , " bremen 's germany striker miroslav klose said tuesday . bildunterschrift : ajax players prepare for wednesday 's clash in bremen ajax , whose dutch title hopes have been re-ignited by closest rivals psv eindhoven 's poor run , have defensive worries with injuries ruling out defenders urby emanuelson , zdenek grygera and thomas vermaelen . recently re-signed amsterdam legend edgar davids is cup-tied for the remainder of the competition after featuring for former club tottenham hotspur in the group stage . for bayer leverkusen , the uefa cup offers a glamorous respite from the rigors of their mediocre bundesliga campaign .
however , things will have to pick up for michael skibbe 's team if they are to carry on enjoying its distractions . unconvincing leverkusen meet battling blackburn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benni mccarthy -lrb- center -rrb- has blackburn dreaming currently lying seventh in the league , bayer have had a mixed season domestically and have also struggled to maintain any consistency in europe .
leverkusen limped out of group b in third place with just four points and will meet group e winners blackburn , a team that only dropped two points in qualifying . blackburn are also enduring a less than exemplary season in the premiership but have definitely reserved their best performances for the uefa cup , fired by pre-season signing benni mccarthy , a uefa cup winner with fc porto in 2003 . rovers play a robust game as one would expect from a team managed by the combative mark hughes , a former bayern munich player .
leverkusen 's progress is far from assured . injuries plague both sides ahead of clash things have been made worse by injuries to defenders juan and roque junior and coach skibbe may also have to do without captain carsten ramelow .
the influential midfielder made his comeback from a knee operation in saturday 's 2-2 draw against eintracht frankfurt but he is still far from fully match fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten ramelow , left , may not be risked against blackburn " the comeback was way too soon but i needed him , " said skibbe , who will have to think hard before asking ramelow to play a second game in five days . blackburn hope midfielder david dunn will have recovered from a dead leg in time for the leverkusen match after picking up the injury at the weekend .
" it should settle down and it should n't be a problem for him , " hughes told the club 's web site on tuesday . rovers will also be without long-term injury victims robbie savage and andre ooijer , who are both recovering from broken legs . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german clubs learn next uefa cup foes tuesday saw the draw for the group stage of the uefa cup .

some 39 officers were injured and six hooligans temporarily detained . the german soccer community , politicians and police were outraged over saturday 's soccer violence , which was a stark contrast to last summer 's festive world cup matches played in leipzig , the only tournament venue in the former east germany . germans are asking how flares and fireworks that were used as ammunition at the riot could have been brought into the stadium .
they blame lax security at fourth division club lokomotiv leipzig , whose fans were responsible for the violent clashes with the police . dfb : no games without security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no security assurances , no games , says the dfb 's zwanziger " if we are n't able to offer secure stadiums , or prevent such incidents , then we ca n't allow soccer matches to take place there , " theo zwanziger , head of the germany soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , when announcing that all lower-league matches in saxony for this weekend would be cancelled . zwanziger made it clear that the cancellation of some 60 lower league matches is a symbolic act , a message of solidarity to the police that is meant to show that violence is not tolerated in and around football stadiums in saxony . but some soccer clubs said they feel a sweeping cancellation is not fair .
fc sachsen leipzig had a match planned for saturday , which is now going to be held the following week . " it 's a signal in the wrong direction , " said fc sachsen 's goalkeeper steffen süssner .
" the situation should have been solved differently ; now , we 're just punishing the clubs and the fans , i do n't think that 's right . " politicians must make the decisions , says coach fc sachsen leipzig coach eduard geier said the politicians were taking the easy way out . " politicians need to act here , we all do , we have to be role models and make sure that there are orderly games and fair play on the field , " he said .
" politicians have to deal with the rest .
we ca n't do it without them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig fans were blamed for the violence last weekend politicians have meanwhile come up with a handful of possible solutions .
saxony 's interior minister albrecht buttolo has vowed tougher measures for the future , with sports prosecutors on hand at high-risk games to issue arrest warrants on the spot if violent scenes occur .
buttolo also threatened games behind closed doors , as were recently played in italy after the death of a police officer there , in the case of further incidents . geier was skeptical of such plans . " as along as the perpetrators are let go every time , and as long as they 're never punished , the chaotic situation wo n't change , " the fc sachsen leipzig coach said . dagmar breitenbach -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scores injured as hooligans battle police in leipzig riot forty-two people , including 36 policemen , were injured in crowd trouble after a german regional soccer cup match between two amateur teams in the eastern city of leipzig , police said sunday .

some 39 officers were injured and six hooligans temporarily detained . the german soccer community , politicians and police were outraged over saturday 's soccer violence , which was a stark contrast to last summer 's festive world cup matches played in leipzig , the only tournament venue in the former east germany . germans are asking how flares and fireworks that were used as ammunition at the riot could have been brought into the stadium .
they blame lax security at fourth division club lokomotiv leipzig , whose fans were responsible for the violent clashes with the police . dfb : no games without security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no security assurances , no games , says the dfb 's zwanziger " if we are n't able to offer secure stadiums , or prevent such incidents , then we ca n't allow soccer matches to take place there , " theo zwanziger , head of the germany soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , when announcing that all lower-league matches in saxony for this weekend would be cancelled . zwanziger made it clear that the cancellation of some 60 lower league matches is a symbolic act , a message of solidarity to the police that is meant to show that violence is not tolerated in and around football stadiums in saxony . but some soccer clubs said they feel a sweeping cancellation is not fair .
fc sachsen leipzig had a match planned for saturday , which is now going to be held the following week . " it 's a signal in the wrong direction , " said fc sachsen 's goalkeeper steffen süssner .
" the situation should have been solved differently ; now , we 're just punishing the clubs and the fans , i do n't think that 's right . " politicians must make the decisions , says coach fc sachsen leipzig coach eduard geier said the politicians were taking the easy way out . " politicians need to act here , we all do , we have to be role models and make sure that there are orderly games and fair play on the field , " he said .
" politicians have to deal with the rest .
we ca n't do it without them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig fans were blamed for the violence last weekend politicians have meanwhile come up with a handful of possible solutions .
saxony 's interior minister albrecht buttolo has vowed tougher measures for the future , with sports prosecutors on hand at high-risk games to issue arrest warrants on the spot if violent scenes occur .
buttolo also threatened games behind closed doors , as were recently played in italy after the death of a police officer there , in the case of further incidents . geier was skeptical of such plans . " as along as the perpetrators are let go every time , and as long as they 're never punished , the chaotic situation wo n't change , " the fc sachsen leipzig coach said . dagmar breitenbach -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scores injured as hooligans battle police in leipzig riot forty-two people , including 36 policemen , were injured in crowd trouble after a german regional soccer cup match between two amateur teams in the eastern city of leipzig , police said sunday .

" google said in paris that it would appeal against the decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google co-founders larry page , left , and sergey brin " google regrets today 's decision and will appeal , " said google news legal counsel for europe yoram elkaim in paris .
" we continue to believe that the google news service conforms with copyright law and benefits publishers as much as internet users , " he said . the president of the copiepresse grouping of belgium 's french-language newspapers , margaret boribon , said the group did not intend to keep up the legal battle " for the fun of it " and preferred to " negotiate " a settlement . long-standing suit a year ago copiepresse lodged a belgian lawsuit against google news to require the internet group to request permission from copiepresse and to pay it to show its articles on the google news site . on september 5 , a belgian court ordered google news to stop reproducing content from french-language and german-language newspapers in belgium on its belgian website and imposed fines as long as it did not respect the decision . in that ruling , the court told the company to pay copiepresse a million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- each day that the forbidden articles , pictures and graphics appeared on its site . in tuesday 's decision , the judge backed google 's claim that the fines were " disproportionate " and reduced them to a more " reasonable " 25,000 euros per day . copiepresse lawyer bernard magrez said that meant google would no longer have to pay a total of 130 million euros but three million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court decision is being hailed as a victory for news providers in a hearing in november , google 's lawyers argued that the papers were seeking to profit from its immense financial success in recent years . google 's main defense was that it is a search engine that helps users find information on other websites and not a so-called portal that hosts its own information . case could have broader implications the case in belgium is being closely watched by other news providers , including agence france-presse , which has been in dispute with google in france as well as in the united states . a spokesman for the paris-based world association of newspapers welcomed the court 's ruling and said that google and other internet companies would now have to be more careful about treading on papers ' copyrights . " it shows that content providers and publishers have to be part of the discussion with search engines , otherwise it 's going to end up in court , " said wan spokesman larry kilman . afp chief executive pierre louette also welcomed the decision . " it 's important that a court recognizes that permission must be given before using content , " he said in paris . after opening news websites for about thirty countries in four years , google launched a belgian version in january 2006 , much to the concern of the country 's french-speaking newspapers . the newspapers had also asked microsoft to stop the unauthorized publishing of articles on its " www.msn.be " site , which the company later did .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 14.02.2007 problems arise as germany moves to free hostages in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government 's emergency task force is working hard to free the hostages the government 's efforts to secure the release of two germans kidnapped in iraq are complicated by the fact that a key iraqi mediator who helped free former hostages has been left in the lurch by berlin . a spokeswoman for the german foreign ministry said on wednesday that the emergency task force , headed up by deputy foreign minister reinhard silberberg , is " making every effort to secure the safe return of the germans to their families . " the german government has kept a tight lid on information regarding the missing citizens . but foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on monday did not exclude the possibility of a " violent kidnapping . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has a tough job on his hands meanwhile , anonymous intelligence sources have confirmed to the web site of germany 's der spiegel news magazine that the wife of a baghdad-based iraqi man and her son , a technician at the iraqi foreign ministry , were kidnapped by iraqi gunmen last week . it is unclear whether the kidnappers are politically motivated or simply interested in a ransom payment .
according to initial media reports , the kidnappers contacted the young man 's sister in berlin , who then alerted german authorities .
but officials have since interrogated the woman , and subsequent reports could not confirm that the kidnappers had contacted her . key iraqi mediator also kidnapped this is germany 's third hostage crisis since the start of the iraq war in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was kidnapped in iraq in 2005 at the end of 2005 , bavarian archaeologist susanne osthoff and her driver were taken hostage .
the german government eventually secured their release , allegedly after paying a hefty ransom .
in january 2006 , iraqi gunmen abducted two technicians , rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke .
the pair was also freed unharmed . in all three cases , the head of the baghdad-based german-iraqi club , dr. abdulhalim al-hijjaj helped the german government mediate their release .
al-hijjaj speaks fluent german and is connected with local tribal leaders in the so-called sunni triangle just north of baghdad . the german foreign ministry rewarded the man for his assistance with two tickets to a soccer world cup game in stuttgart .
but the iraqi mediator never saw germany beat portugal 3-1 .
seven days prior to the game , al-hijjaj himself was snatched up off the street by two gunmen . the kidnappers had allegedly learned of his mediation efforts for the german government , and assumed he had been richly rewarded .
the german government could not help al-hijjaj , and he was only freed on july 7 after his wife had emptied the family bank account and paid a ransom of 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 197,115 -rrb- .
the couple then fled to jordan , where they now live an impoverished life , according to media reports . no help for the helper al-hijjaj 's plight has prompted calls from some in germany to help the man who played a valuable role in securing the release of former german nationals taken hostage in iraq . peter bienert , the head of the leipzig-based firm cryotec , where former hostages bräunlich and nitzschke are employed , told german news agency dpa " the man -lrb- al-hijjaj -rrb- has been abandoned . "
bienert has reportedly collected several thousand euros in donations for al-hijjaj . meanwhile , opposition leaders in the german parliament have called on the government to offer him some assistance .
the foreign ministry and the chancellery claim there is no room in the budget for this . but werner hoyer , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp said financing was not a problem . " of course something can be done there , " he said .
" to simply pretend there is no leeway in the budget is nonsense . " indeed , german foreign ministers have discretionary funds at their disposal for emergencies .
but cdu parliamentarian siegfried kauder said the foreign ministry is reluctant to tap into these funds .
that sort of " non-bureaucratic assistance would create a precedent " for future kidnappers , he said . kauder recommended hijjaj contact the white ring , a relief organization for victims of violence . " he has to be the victim of a violent crime , and he has to be in financial need , " said kauder , who is a member of the organization 's board of directors . " then we can offer non-bureaucratic help - also to foreigners .

britain got a failing grade , coming in dead last while northern europe came out on top . a unicef study that compared the situation of children in 21 industrialized nations put german children squarely in the middle of the list , at 11th place . the report by the united nations children 's advocacy agency compared six markers , including material wealth , health , education , relationship to parents and peers , behaviors and risks , as well as the children 's own assessment of their situation , to determine the rankings . typical of poor scoring nations were children who did not trust their friends , rarely spent time with parents , and overate .
poverty among minorities and a lack of books in homes also dragged down scores . northern europe scores high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kinder beim essen top marks went mostly to northern european countries .
the netherlands garnered first place , followed by sweden , denmark , finland , spain and switzerland .
france took 16th place , while the uk landed a miserable 21st slot . the honorary chairwoman of german unicef , heide simonis , called germany 's middle-of-the-pack showing " unsatisfying . "
she told bavarian state radio the country needs more full-day schools and more childcare for very young children .
in addition , she said , politicians have to take the problems of youth more seriously . german family minster ursula von der leyen this week proposed spending 3 million -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- euros more on expanding childcare in germany , a plan that has received approval from political leaders though the proposal still lacks a funding plan . germany scored poorly on its schools , which mostly operate in the morning only , and its lack of success helping immigrant children . regional disparities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians have called for more childcare centers simonis noted that the german education system suffers under severe regional disparities as some states offer a better education than others . simonis also noted that germany scored poorly when it came to cigarette and alcohol use .
the country - the last bastion for smokers in europe - has more teen smokers under the age of 15 than in any other . " germans share with the british the dubious honor of having the children and teenagers who drink alcohol most often , " she added . moreover , the study showed nearly 40 percent of surveyed german children said their parents " never really talk " to them . germans less aggressive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , with britain , reported the most underage drinking simonis stressed that there were some positive results , too .
for example , german children and teens were relatively less aggressive than in other countries . the caritas aid organization told news agencies that the study clearly showed that the lack of a reliable living environment can be a serious detriment to the development of children in german society , especially for less-educated and immigrant families . there was also dismay over the results in britain , with commentators saying the low ratings for personal relationships were evidence of a dog-eat-dog society where too many children hang around on the streets . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside " the german parliament 's commission for children 's concerns this week discussed including children 's rights in the constitution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 14.02.2007 happiness is … love and vacation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for most germans , it does n't get any better than this valentine 's day is the day of love .
if a new study is right , germans should be their happiest then on wednesday - in addition to during their holidays . there is no shortage of stereotypes about europeans .
the romantic french immediately pop to mind , as do the witty english and their dry sense of humor .
italians and spaniards share the top place for being most fiery , and the germans ?
these teutonic people are best known for their seriousness and hard work , not though for their happy disposition . but a new study presented this week showed that more than two-thirds of germans tend to be happy .
there is a hitch , though .
of those surveyed , 84 percent said they especially experienced happy moments when they were in love or on vacation .
while the love aspect may have to be left up to fate , it 's certainly a good thing that german employees have an average of six weeks paid annual vacation .
that would make anyone happy . the polling institute allensbach surveyed over 1,700 men and women between the ages of 16 and 69 for the magazine emotion .
it found that mostly women , young people or the better educated are most happy . but if a gloomy day comes along , over half of germans will pep up their spirits by listening to music , seeing their partner or meeting up with friends . it also appears that germans believe the old saying that every man is the architect of his own fortune .
almost two-thirds of those surveyed said they believed they could in part influence their own happiness . sex and money will not make you happy anyone who thinks sex is the key to happiness is just high on oxytocin .
the allensbach study showed that sex in fact does not make people happy .
only every third german said a satisfied sex life played a role in their happiness .
the same was true for professional success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : true love can make swans happy , too and the old saying that money ca n't buy you happiness was once again proven in the study : only 20 percent of those surveyed believe that a lot of money could make them happy . trend researcher matthias horx said he believed germans were " happiness sourpusses " compared to other nations .
horx said an increasing number of germans were breaking out of the typical pessimistic way of thinking and trying to work on their happiness .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children -pipe- 14.02.2007 germany gets middling score in unicef child welfare study großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's poor job of integrating immigrant children helped lower its score a comparative study on the well-being of children in the industrialized world showed german children in the middle of the pack .
britain got a failing grade , coming in dead last while northern europe came out on top . a unicef study that compared the situation of children in 21 industrialized nations put german children squarely in the middle of the list , at 11th place . the report by the united nations children 's advocacy agency compared six markers , including material wealth , health , education , relationship to parents and peers , behaviors and risks , as well as the children 's own assessment of their situation , to determine the rankings . typical of poor scoring nations were children who did not trust their friends , rarely spent time with parents , and overate .
poverty among minorities and a lack of books in homes also dragged down scores . northern europe scores high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kinder beim essen top marks went mostly to northern european countries .
the netherlands garnered first place , followed by sweden , denmark , finland , spain and switzerland .
france took 16th place , while the uk landed a miserable 21st slot . the honorary chairwoman of german unicef , heide simonis , called germany 's middle-of-the-pack showing " unsatisfying . "
she told bavarian state radio the country needs more full-day schools and more childcare for very young children .
in addition , she said , politicians have to take the problems of youth more seriously . german family minster ursula von der leyen this week proposed spending 3 million -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- euros more on expanding childcare in germany , a plan that has received approval from political leaders though the proposal still lacks a funding plan . germany scored poorly on its schools , which mostly operate in the morning only , and its lack of success helping immigrant children . regional disparities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians have called for more childcare centers simonis noted that the german education system suffers under severe regional disparities as some states offer a better education than others . simonis also noted that germany scored poorly when it came to cigarette and alcohol use .
the country - the last bastion for smokers in europe - has more teen smokers under the age of 15 than in any other . " germans share with the british the dubious honor of having the children and teenagers who drink alcohol most often , " she added . moreover , the study showed nearly 40 percent of surveyed german children said their parents " never really talk " to them . germans less aggressive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , with britain , reported the most underage drinking simonis stressed that there were some positive results , too .
for example , german children and teens were relatively less aggressive than in other countries . the caritas aid organization told news agencies that the study clearly showed that the lack of a reliable living environment can be a serious detriment to the development of children in german society , especially for less-educated and immigrant families . there was also dismay over the results in britain , with commentators saying the low ratings for personal relationships were evidence of a dog-eat-dog society where too many children hang around on the streets . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside " the german parliament 's commission for children 's concerns this week discussed including children 's rights in the constitution .
in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue .
-lrb- 22.11.2006 -rrb- experts shed light on germany 's poverty and welfare woes new studies in germany shed light on the twin problems of growing poverty and a deficit in the child-welfare system that could be related .
experts have spoken out on both issues .

the company presented a plan for chrysler at its annual earnings conference on wednesday . daimlerchrysler is putting the future of its subsidiary chrysler to the test .
the company said it was considering a sale , but also examining strategic options with partners to restructure its us business . an immediate step presented at the company 's earning conference wednesday was to close one chrysler plant in the us , resulting in some13,000 job cuts from 2007 to 2009 , the company announced wednesday .
when the layoffs are complete , the chrysler group will be nearly half the size it was at its peak when it was purchased by daimler benz in 1999 . the auto giant 's frankfurt office released a statement saying the job cuts were part of a three-year chrysler " recovery and transformation plan that seeks a return to profitability by 2008 .

however , the company 's troubled chrysler division suffered a loss of 1.1 billion euros . " we are not ruling out any option in order to find the best solution for the chrysler group and daimlerchrysler , " the company said in an ad hoc announcement .

britain got a failing grade , coming in dead last while northern europe came out on top . a unicef study that compared the situation of children in 21 industrialized nations put german children squarely in the middle of the list , at 11th place . the report by the united nations children 's advocacy agency compared six markers , including material wealth , health , education , relationship to parents and peers , behaviors and risks , as well as the children 's own assessment of their situation , to determine the rankings . typical of poor scoring nations were children who did not trust their friends , rarely spent time with parents , and overate .
poverty among minorities and a lack of books in homes also dragged down scores . northern europe scores high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kinder beim essen top marks went mostly to northern european countries .
the netherlands garnered first place , followed by sweden , denmark , finland , spain and switzerland .

britain got a failing grade , coming in dead last while northern europe came out on top . a unicef study that compared the situation of children in 21 industrialized nations put german children squarely in the middle of the list , at 11th place . the report by the united nations children 's advocacy agency compared six markers , including material wealth , health , education , relationship to parents and peers , behaviors and risks , as well as the children 's own assessment of their situation , to determine the rankings . typical of poor scoring nations were children who did not trust their friends , rarely spent time with parents , and overate .
poverty among minorities and a lack of books in homes also dragged down scores . northern europe scores high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kinder beim essen top marks went mostly to northern european countries .
the netherlands garnered first place , followed by sweden , denmark , finland , spain and switzerland .

" the german government has kept a tight lid on information regarding the missing citizens . but foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on monday did not exclude the possibility of a " violent kidnapping . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has a tough job on his hands meanwhile , anonymous intelligence sources have confirmed to the web site of germany 's der spiegel news magazine that the wife of a baghdad-based iraqi man and her son , a technician at the iraqi foreign ministry , were kidnapped by iraqi gunmen last week . it is unclear whether the kidnappers are politically motivated or simply interested in a ransom payment .
according to initial media reports , the kidnappers contacted the young man 's sister in berlin , who then alerted german authorities .
but officials have since interrogated the woman , and subsequent reports could not confirm that the kidnappers had contacted her . key iraqi mediator also kidnapped this is germany 's third hostage crisis since the start of the iraq war in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was kidnapped in iraq in 2005 at the end of 2005 , bavarian archaeologist susanne osthoff and her driver were taken hostage .
the german government eventually secured their release , allegedly after paying a hefty ransom .
in january 2006 , iraqi gunmen abducted two technicians , rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke .
the pair was also freed unharmed . in all three cases , the head of the baghdad-based german-iraqi club , dr. abdulhalim al-hijjaj helped the german government mediate their release .
al-hijjaj speaks fluent german and is connected with local tribal leaders in the so-called sunni triangle just north of baghdad . the german foreign ministry rewarded the man for his assistance with two tickets to a soccer world cup game in stuttgart .
but the iraqi mediator never saw germany beat portugal 3-1 .
seven days prior to the game , al-hijjaj himself was snatched up off the street by two gunmen . the kidnappers had allegedly learned of his mediation efforts for the german government , and assumed he had been richly rewarded .
the german government could not help al-hijjaj , and he was only freed on july 7 after his wife had emptied the family bank account and paid a ransom of 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 197,115 -rrb- .
the couple then fled to jordan , where they now live an impoverished life , according to media reports . no help for the helper al-hijjaj 's plight has prompted calls from some in germany to help the man who played a valuable role in securing the release of former german nationals taken hostage in iraq . peter bienert , the head of the leipzig-based firm cryotec , where former hostages bräunlich and nitzschke are employed , told german news agency dpa " the man -lrb- al-hijjaj -rrb- has been abandoned . "
bienert has reportedly collected several thousand euros in donations for al-hijjaj . meanwhile , opposition leaders in the german parliament have called on the government to offer him some assistance .
the foreign ministry and the chancellery claim there is no room in the budget for this . but werner hoyer , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp said financing was not a problem . " of course something can be done there , " he said .
" to simply pretend there is no leeway in the budget is nonsense . " indeed , german foreign ministers have discretionary funds at their disposal for emergencies .
but cdu parliamentarian siegfried kauder said the foreign ministry is reluctant to tap into these funds .
that sort of " non-bureaucratic assistance would create a precedent " for future kidnappers , he said . kauder recommended hijjaj contact the white ring , a relief organization for victims of violence .

" the german government has kept a tight lid on information regarding the missing citizens . but foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on monday did not exclude the possibility of a " violent kidnapping . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has a tough job on his hands meanwhile , anonymous intelligence sources have confirmed to the web site of germany 's der spiegel news magazine that the wife of a baghdad-based iraqi man and her son , a technician at the iraqi foreign ministry , were kidnapped by iraqi gunmen last week . it is unclear whether the kidnappers are politically motivated or simply interested in a ransom payment .
according to initial media reports , the kidnappers contacted the young man 's sister in berlin , who then alerted german authorities .
but officials have since interrogated the woman , and subsequent reports could not confirm that the kidnappers had contacted her . key iraqi mediator also kidnapped this is germany 's third hostage crisis since the start of the iraq war in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was kidnapped in iraq in 2005 at the end of 2005 , bavarian archaeologist susanne osthoff and her driver were taken hostage .
the german government eventually secured their release , allegedly after paying a hefty ransom .
in january 2006 , iraqi gunmen abducted two technicians , rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke .
the pair was also freed unharmed . in all three cases , the head of the baghdad-based german-iraqi club , dr. abdulhalim al-hijjaj helped the german government mediate their release .
al-hijjaj speaks fluent german and is connected with local tribal leaders in the so-called sunni triangle just north of baghdad . the german foreign ministry rewarded the man for his assistance with two tickets to a soccer world cup game in stuttgart .
but the iraqi mediator never saw germany beat portugal 3-1 .
seven days prior to the game , al-hijjaj himself was snatched up off the street by two gunmen . the kidnappers had allegedly learned of his mediation efforts for the german government , and assumed he had been richly rewarded .

in one , a german of lebanese descent , khalid el masri , was taken in late 2003 by the cia from macedonia to a prison in afghanistan , in a case of mistaken identity . murat kurnaz , a german-born turk who lived in bremen , spent four years in the us military prison at guantanamo bay , after having been held in afghanistan .

" google said in paris that it would appeal against the decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google co-founders larry page , left , and sergey brin " google regrets today 's decision and will appeal , " said google news legal counsel for europe yoram elkaim in paris .
" we continue to believe that the google news service conforms with copyright law and benefits publishers as much as internet users , " he said . the president of the copiepresse grouping of belgium 's french-language newspapers , margaret boribon , said the group did not intend to keep up the legal battle " for the fun of it " and preferred to " negotiate " a settlement . long-standing suit a year ago copiepresse lodged a belgian lawsuit against google news to require the internet group to request permission from copiepresse and to pay it to show its articles on the google news site . on september 5 , a belgian court ordered google news to stop reproducing content from french-language and german-language newspapers in belgium on its belgian website and imposed fines as long as it did not respect the decision . in that ruling , the court told the company to pay copiepresse a million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- each day that the forbidden articles , pictures and graphics appeared on its site . in tuesday 's decision , the judge backed google 's claim that the fines were " disproportionate " and reduced them to a more " reasonable " 25,000 euros per day . copiepresse lawyer bernard magrez said that meant google would no longer have to pay a total of 130 million euros but three million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court decision is being hailed as a victory for news providers in a hearing in november , google 's lawyers argued that the papers were seeking to profit from its immense financial success in recent years . google 's main defense was that it is a search engine that helps users find information on other websites and not a so-called portal that hosts its own information . case could have broader implications the case in belgium is being closely watched by other news providers , including agence france-presse , which has been in dispute with google in france as well as in the united states . a spokesman for the paris-based world association of newspapers welcomed the court 's ruling and said that google and other internet companies would now have to be more careful about treading on papers ' copyrights . " it shows that content providers and publishers have to be part of the discussion with search engines , otherwise it 's going to end up in court , " said wan spokesman larry kilman . afp chief executive pierre louette also welcomed the decision . " it 's important that a court recognizes that permission must be given before using content , " he said in paris . after opening news websites for about thirty countries in four years , google launched a belgian version in january 2006 , much to the concern of the country 's french-speaking newspapers . the newspapers had also asked microsoft to stop the unauthorized publishing of articles on its " www.msn.be " site , which the company later did .

some 39 officers were injured and six hooligans temporarily detained . the german soccer community , politicians and police were outraged over saturday 's soccer violence , which was a stark contrast to last summer 's festive world cup matches played in leipzig , the only tournament venue in the former east germany . germans are asking how flares and fireworks that were used as ammunition at the riot could have been brought into the stadium .
they blame lax security at fourth division club lokomotiv leipzig , whose fans were responsible for the violent clashes with the police . dfb : no games without security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no security assurances , no games , says the dfb 's zwanziger " if we are n't able to offer secure stadiums , or prevent such incidents , then we ca n't allow soccer matches to take place there , " theo zwanziger , head of the germany soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , when announcing that all lower-league matches in saxony for this weekend would be cancelled . zwanziger made it clear that the cancellation of some 60 lower league matches is a symbolic act , a message of solidarity to the police that is meant to show that violence is not tolerated in and around football stadiums in saxony . but some soccer clubs said they feel a sweeping cancellation is not fair .
fc sachsen leipzig had a match planned for saturday , which is now going to be held the following week . " it 's a signal in the wrong direction , " said fc sachsen 's goalkeeper steffen süssner .
" the situation should have been solved differently ; now , we 're just punishing the clubs and the fans , i do n't think that 's right . " politicians must make the decisions , says coach fc sachsen leipzig coach eduard geier said the politicians were taking the easy way out .

but a change in format has made the uefa cup harder .
it 's a trophy teams want to win . if you believe what you hear , you could be fooled into thinking that there is only one big european fixture on the horizon for germany 's teams in the next week . with their domestic league form mixed at best , bayern munich 's season hinges on their champions league clash against real madrid on feb .
20 .
it is undoubtedly a huge game ; if bayern lose the tie over two legs , they will have to resign themselves to a season without silverware . but the bavarian giants are not the only german team still in the hunt for european honors .
bayer leverkusen and werder bremen take on difficult opposition on wednesday night in the first knock-out round of the uefa cup .
leverkusen take on english premiership side blackburn rovers while werder have a tricky tie against ajax amsterdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uefa cup -lrb- r . -rrb- with its more prestigious relative despite its reputation as the champions league 's poorer relation , the uefa cup is still a hard fought and extremely difficult competition to win .
after format changes in the 2004/05 season that introduced a league round and the inclusion of those third-placed champions league sides that missed out on qualification , the uefa cup now has more games and now features tougher teams . german clubs go for first win in a decade it has been exactly ten years since a german team last won the trophy - schalke 04 beating inter milan on penalties in the 1996/07 final - and the list of winners since shows that the uefa cup is hardly a competition for minnows . leverkusen and bremen both hope to mark the anniversary by bringing the cup back to germany for the first time in a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen entered the uefa cup after losing to barca for werder , the uefa cup may at first seem like an anti-climax .
thrust into undoubtedly the hardest group stage of this season 's champions league , thomas schaaf 's side cruelly missed out on an historic qualification from group a by one point after beating english champions chelsea at the weserstadion and holding the current european champions barcelona to a draw . werder dropped into the uefa cup at the start of the knock-out stages and instantly became one of the favorites to win the trophy on the back of their bundesliga form and improving european credentials .
however , if bremen thought they were in for an easy time , the draw had them thinking again . bremen face dutch masters in sticky knock-out tie ajax amsterdam have four european cups to their name , one uefa cup , 29 dutch championship titles and are currently second in the dutch league .
a club which did much to introduce the concept of total football to the world , a fluid system which allows the outfield players the freedom to swap positions , ajax will prove to be a real test for bremen . while not exactly a team known for a lack of confidence , two successive defeats in the bundesliga have put werder six points behind leaders schalke 04 and have knocked them out of their free-scoring rhythm .
" we 'll have to see whether this latest defeat gives us the spur we need - or not , " bremen 's germany striker miroslav klose said tuesday . bildunterschrift : ajax players prepare for wednesday 's clash in bremen ajax , whose dutch title hopes have been re-ignited by closest rivals psv eindhoven 's poor run , have defensive worries with injuries ruling out defenders urby emanuelson , zdenek grygera and thomas vermaelen . recently re-signed amsterdam legend edgar davids is cup-tied for the remainder of the competition after featuring for former club tottenham hotspur in the group stage . for bayer leverkusen , the uefa cup offers a glamorous respite from the rigors of their mediocre bundesliga campaign .
however , things will have to pick up for michael skibbe 's team if they are to carry on enjoying its distractions . unconvincing leverkusen meet battling blackburn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benni mccarthy -lrb- center -rrb- has blackburn dreaming currently lying seventh in the league , bayer have had a mixed season domestically and have also struggled to maintain any consistency in europe .
leverkusen limped out of group b in third place with just four points and will meet group e winners blackburn , a team that only dropped two points in qualifying . blackburn are also enduring a less than exemplary season in the premiership but have definitely reserved their best performances for the uefa cup , fired by pre-season signing benni mccarthy , a uefa cup winner with fc porto in 2003 . rovers play a robust game as one would expect from a team managed by the combative mark hughes , a former bayern munich player .
leverkusen 's progress is far from assured . injuries plague both sides ahead of clash things have been made worse by injuries to defenders juan and roque junior and coach skibbe may also have to do without captain carsten ramelow .
the influential midfielder made his comeback from a knee operation in saturday 's 2-2 draw against eintracht frankfurt but he is still far from fully match fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten ramelow , left , may not be risked against blackburn " the comeback was way too soon but i needed him , " said skibbe , who will have to think hard before asking ramelow to play a second game in five days . blackburn hope midfielder david dunn will have recovered from a dead leg in time for the leverkusen match after picking up the injury at the weekend .
" it should settle down and it should n't be a problem for him , " hughes told the club 's web site on tuesday . rovers will also be without long-term injury victims robbie savage and andre ooijer , who are both recovering from broken legs . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german clubs learn next uefa cup foes tuesday saw the draw for the group stage of the uefa cup .

" it shows that content providers and publishers have to be part of the discussion with search engines , otherwise it 's going to end up in court , " said wan spokesman larry kilman . afp chief executive pierre louette also welcomed the decision . " it 's important that a court recognizes that permission must be given before using content , " he said in paris . after opening news websites for about thirty countries in four years , google launched a belgian version in january 2006 , much to the concern of the country 's french-speaking newspapers . the newspapers had also asked microsoft to stop the unauthorized publishing of articles on its " www.msn.be " site , which the company later did .

german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler confirmed that it is no longer ruling out the sale of its loss-making us subsidiary chrysler .
the company presented a plan for chrysler at its annual earnings conference on wednesday . daimlerchrysler is putting the future of its subsidiary chrysler to the test .
the company said it was considering a sale , but also examining strategic options with partners to restructure its us business . an immediate step presented at the company 's earning conference wednesday was to close one chrysler plant in the us , resulting in some13,000 job cuts from 2007 to 2009 , the company announced wednesday .
when the layoffs are complete , the chrysler group will be nearly half the size it was at its peak when it was purchased by daimler benz in 1999 . the auto giant 's frankfurt office released a statement saying the job cuts were part of a three-year chrysler " recovery and transformation plan that seeks a return to profitability by 2008 . " daimlerchrysler up , chrysler down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least one us chrysler plant is slated for closure daimlerchrysler 's operating profit in 2006 rose to 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- from 5.2 billion euros the previous year .
however , the company 's troubled chrysler division suffered a loss of 1.1 billion euros . " we are not ruling out any option in order to find the best solution for the chrysler group and daimlerchrysler , " the company said in an ad hoc announcement .
" the board of management intends to consider other , more far-reaching strategic options with partners in order to support and facilitate the program . " it could be a bitter end - ironically on st. valentine 's day - for a tie-up that was originally hailed as a marriage made in heaven nearly nine years ago .
in fact , the love affair between german group daimler , with its up-brand mercedes-benz market on the one hand , and us car maker chrysler on the other soured fairly early on . already six years ago , daimlerchrysler 's chief executive dieter zetsche , then head of chrysler , prescribed a massive reorganization of the us subsidiary , including the closure of six plants and the loss of 26,000 jobs . the announcement confirms reports in german media that zetsche was considering a whole or partial sale of the troubled chrysler unit .
quoting sources on the supervisory board , the business daily handelsblatt said zetsche had instructed an investment bank to sound out all possibilities . last-ditch restructuring plan expected for chrysler this week 's meeting marked the first time daimlerchrysler held its annual earnings conference at its us headquarters instead of the traditional stuttgart venue in southwest germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zetsche wants to slim down the carmaking giant like the other two of the so-called " big three " us auto makers , ford and general motors , chrysler has been sideswiped by cut-throat competition from asian automobile manufacturers in its home market . chrysler 's product range , tilted heavily towards pick-up trucks and four-wheel drives , has been overtaken by us consumers ' increasing desire for smaller , more fuel-efficient cars . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers move into higher gear in india mesmerized by india 's thundering economy and increasing demand for cars , the german auto industry has notched up investment in the country with key players setting up new plants and expanding existing production .

" google said in paris that it would appeal against the decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google co-founders larry page , left , and sergey brin " google regrets today 's decision and will appeal , " said google news legal counsel for europe yoram elkaim in paris .
" we continue to believe that the google news service conforms with copyright law and benefits publishers as much as internet users , " he said . the president of the copiepresse grouping of belgium 's french-language newspapers , margaret boribon , said the group did not intend to keep up the legal battle " for the fun of it " and preferred to " negotiate " a settlement . long-standing suit a year ago copiepresse lodged a belgian lawsuit against google news to require the internet group to request permission from copiepresse and to pay it to show its articles on the google news site . on september 5 , a belgian court ordered google news to stop reproducing content from french-language and german-language newspapers in belgium on its belgian website and imposed fines as long as it did not respect the decision . in that ruling , the court told the company to pay copiepresse a million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- each day that the forbidden articles , pictures and graphics appeared on its site . in tuesday 's decision , the judge backed google 's claim that the fines were " disproportionate " and reduced them to a more " reasonable " 25,000 euros per day . copiepresse lawyer bernard magrez said that meant google would no longer have to pay a total of 130 million euros but three million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court decision is being hailed as a victory for news providers in a hearing in november , google 's lawyers argued that the papers were seeking to profit from its immense financial success in recent years . google 's main defense was that it is a search engine that helps users find information on other websites and not a so-called portal that hosts its own information . case could have broader implications the case in belgium is being closely watched by other news providers , including agence france-presse , which has been in dispute with google in france as well as in the united states . a spokesman for the paris-based world association of newspapers welcomed the court 's ruling and said that google and other internet companies would now have to be more careful about treading on papers ' copyrights . " it shows that content providers and publishers have to be part of the discussion with search engines , otherwise it 's going to end up in court , " said wan spokesman larry kilman . afp chief executive pierre louette also welcomed the decision . " it 's important that a court recognizes that permission must be given before using content , " he said in paris . after opening news websites for about thirty countries in four years , google launched a belgian version in january 2006 , much to the concern of the country 's french-speaking newspapers . the newspapers had also asked microsoft to stop the unauthorized publishing of articles on its " www.msn.be " site , which the company later did .

but a change in format has made the uefa cup harder .
it 's a trophy teams want to win . if you believe what you hear , you could be fooled into thinking that there is only one big european fixture on the horizon for germany 's teams in the next week . with their domestic league form mixed at best , bayern munich 's season hinges on their champions league clash against real madrid on feb .
20 .
it is undoubtedly a huge game ; if bayern lose the tie over two legs , they will have to resign themselves to a season without silverware . but the bavarian giants are not the only german team still in the hunt for european honors .
bayer leverkusen and werder bremen take on difficult opposition on wednesday night in the first knock-out round of the uefa cup .
leverkusen take on english premiership side blackburn rovers while werder have a tricky tie against ajax amsterdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uefa cup -lrb- r . -rrb- with its more prestigious relative despite its reputation as the champions league 's poorer relation , the uefa cup is still a hard fought and extremely difficult competition to win .
after format changes in the 2004/05 season that introduced a league round and the inclusion of those third-placed champions league sides that missed out on qualification , the uefa cup now has more games and now features tougher teams . german clubs go for first win in a decade it has been exactly ten years since a german team last won the trophy - schalke 04 beating inter milan on penalties in the 1996/07 final - and the list of winners since shows that the uefa cup is hardly a competition for minnows . leverkusen and bremen both hope to mark the anniversary by bringing the cup back to germany for the first time in a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen entered the uefa cup after losing to barca for werder , the uefa cup may at first seem like an anti-climax .
thrust into undoubtedly the hardest group stage of this season 's champions league , thomas schaaf 's side cruelly missed out on an historic qualification from group a by one point after beating english champions chelsea at the weserstadion and holding the current european champions barcelona to a draw . werder dropped into the uefa cup at the start of the knock-out stages and instantly became one of the favorites to win the trophy on the back of their bundesliga form and improving european credentials .
however , if bremen thought they were in for an easy time , the draw had them thinking again . bremen face dutch masters in sticky knock-out tie ajax amsterdam have four european cups to their name , one uefa cup , 29 dutch championship titles and are currently second in the dutch league .
a club which did much to introduce the concept of total football to the world , a fluid system which allows the outfield players the freedom to swap positions , ajax will prove to be a real test for bremen . while not exactly a team known for a lack of confidence , two successive defeats in the bundesliga have put werder six points behind leaders schalke 04 and have knocked them out of their free-scoring rhythm .
" we 'll have to see whether this latest defeat gives us the spur we need - or not , " bremen 's germany striker miroslav klose said tuesday . bildunterschrift : ajax players prepare for wednesday 's clash in bremen ajax , whose dutch title hopes have been re-ignited by closest rivals psv eindhoven 's poor run , have defensive worries with injuries ruling out defenders urby emanuelson , zdenek grygera and thomas vermaelen . recently re-signed amsterdam legend edgar davids is cup-tied for the remainder of the competition after featuring for former club tottenham hotspur in the group stage . for bayer leverkusen , the uefa cup offers a glamorous respite from the rigors of their mediocre bundesliga campaign .
however , things will have to pick up for michael skibbe 's team if they are to carry on enjoying its distractions . unconvincing leverkusen meet battling blackburn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benni mccarthy -lrb- center -rrb- has blackburn dreaming currently lying seventh in the league , bayer have had a mixed season domestically and have also struggled to maintain any consistency in europe .
leverkusen limped out of group b in third place with just four points and will meet group e winners blackburn , a team that only dropped two points in qualifying . blackburn are also enduring a less than exemplary season in the premiership but have definitely reserved their best performances for the uefa cup , fired by pre-season signing benni mccarthy , a uefa cup winner with fc porto in 2003 . rovers play a robust game as one would expect from a team managed by the combative mark hughes , a former bayern munich player .
leverkusen 's progress is far from assured . injuries plague both sides ahead of clash things have been made worse by injuries to defenders juan and roque junior and coach skibbe may also have to do without captain carsten ramelow .
the influential midfielder made his comeback from a knee operation in saturday 's 2-2 draw against eintracht frankfurt but he is still far from fully match fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten ramelow , left , may not be risked against blackburn " the comeback was way too soon but i needed him , " said skibbe , who will have to think hard before asking ramelow to play a second game in five days . blackburn hope midfielder david dunn will have recovered from a dead leg in time for the leverkusen match after picking up the injury at the weekend .
" it should settle down and it should n't be a problem for him , " hughes told the club 's web site on tuesday . rovers will also be without long-term injury victims robbie savage and andre ooijer , who are both recovering from broken legs . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german clubs learn next uefa cup foes tuesday saw the draw for the group stage of the uefa cup .

the state even went beyond german demands at the time . belgium actively helped the occupying german forces round up and deport the country 's jewish population during the second world war , according to historians from the center for historical research and documentation on war and contemporary society -lrb- ceges -rrb- in brussels . " the belgian state adopted a docile and cooperative attitude in some very diverse , but crucial domains providing collaboration unworthy of a democracy , with a policy that was disastrous for belgian and foreign jews , " the historians said . the report " docile belgium , " commissioned by the belgian parliament , said the state collaborated with the nazis for " economic , as well as ideological and legal-administrative " reasons .
it is the first time belgium 's cooperation with the nazis has been presented in such detail . project leader rudi van doorslaer said " a xenophobic and sometimes anti-semitic culture of the ruling elite " in the 1930s had prepared belgium psychologically for the persecution of the jews .
the " democratic deficit " in the years from 1930 to 1940 had also played a role , doorslaer said . " the step from passive to active collaboration was quickly taken , " doorslaer said as he read the report 's conclusions to the parliament on tuesday . government in exile authorized cooperation with the nazis doorslaer said the country had closed its doors to jews fleeing germany after hitler came to power in 1933 .
according to the ceges study , the deportations began shortly after may 10 , 1940 , when german annexed predominantly german-speaking cantons in eastern belgium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of belgian jews were killed in the auschwitz concentration camp following the nazi invasion in 1940 , the belgian government fled to britain .

the state even went beyond german demands at the time . belgium actively helped the occupying german forces round up and deport the country 's jewish population during the second world war , according to historians from the center for historical research and documentation on war and contemporary society -lrb- ceges -rrb- in brussels . " the belgian state adopted a docile and cooperative attitude in some very diverse , but crucial domains providing collaboration unworthy of a democracy , with a policy that was disastrous for belgian and foreign jews , " the historians said . the report " docile belgium , " commissioned by the belgian parliament , said the state collaborated with the nazis for " economic , as well as ideological and legal-administrative " reasons .
it is the first time belgium 's cooperation with the nazis has been presented in such detail . project leader rudi van doorslaer said " a xenophobic and sometimes anti-semitic culture of the ruling elite " in the 1930s had prepared belgium psychologically for the persecution of the jews .
the " democratic deficit " in the years from 1930 to 1940 had also played a role , doorslaer said . " the step from passive to active collaboration was quickly taken , " doorslaer said as he read the report 's conclusions to the parliament on tuesday . government in exile authorized cooperation with the nazis doorslaer said the country had closed its doors to jews fleeing germany after hitler came to power in 1933 .
according to the ceges study , the deportations began shortly after may 10 , 1940 , when german annexed predominantly german-speaking cantons in eastern belgium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of belgian jews were killed in the auschwitz concentration camp following the nazi invasion in 1940 , the belgian government fled to britain .
but the report found that the government in exile in london during the war " never let it be known that policies had to be adapted and that the behavior of leading civil servants and magistrates was unconstitutional and democratically reprehensible . " however , belgian authorities were not aware in summer 1942 that jews deported to poland were being exterminated , the report said . some 50,000 jews lived in belgium in the 1930s .
about half were killed during the holocaust . many belgians tried to save jewish people belgian jewish groups reacted positively to the study . " this report is fundamental and it is a victory for enlightened democracy , " said philippe markiewicz , head of the coordination committee of belgian jewish organizations . markiewicz said despite the negative impact of the report , there were many belgians who risked their lives to save jews . findings should go into the history books the ceges historians spent three years researching and writing the 1,114-page study and were able to view documents previously unused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis forced the jewish population to wear the yellow star of david prime minister guy verhofstadt apologized already to the jewish community in 2002 for belgium 's role in the holocaust .
his spokesman said that verhofstadt felt the ceges findings should be incorporated into history textbooks . the historians worked out the details of three major phases relating to the persecution of belgian jews .
in october and november 1940 , the central government followed the nazis ' request to require all jews to register with their local authorities . in the summer of 1942 , when the nazi regime began massively deporting belgians of jewish origin , collaboration started diminishing .
brussels refused to make jews wear yellow stars , which the nazis prescribed in order to identify them more easily .
the police in antwerp , on the other hand , arbitrarily arrested 1,243 jews and handed them over to the germans . after the end of the war , belgian military judicial authorities decided that investigating the deportation of the jewish people was too " delicate " to be allowed to continue . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film on wiesenthal 's legacy opens at berlinale a documentary about the life of famous nazi hunter simon wiesenthal has premiered at the berlin international film festival .

some 39 officers were injured and six hooligans temporarily detained . the german soccer community , politicians and police were outraged over saturday 's soccer violence , which was a stark contrast to last summer 's festive world cup matches played in leipzig , the only tournament venue in the former east germany . germans are asking how flares and fireworks that were used as ammunition at the riot could have been brought into the stadium .
they blame lax security at fourth division club lokomotiv leipzig , whose fans were responsible for the violent clashes with the police . dfb : no games without security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no security assurances , no games , says the dfb 's zwanziger " if we are n't able to offer secure stadiums , or prevent such incidents , then we ca n't allow soccer matches to take place there , " theo zwanziger , head of the germany soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , when announcing that all lower-league matches in saxony for this weekend would be cancelled . zwanziger made it clear that the cancellation of some 60 lower league matches is a symbolic act , a message of solidarity to the police that is meant to show that violence is not tolerated in and around football stadiums in saxony . but some soccer clubs said they feel a sweeping cancellation is not fair .
fc sachsen leipzig had a match planned for saturday , which is now going to be held the following week . " it 's a signal in the wrong direction , " said fc sachsen 's goalkeeper steffen süssner .
" the situation should have been solved differently ; now , we 're just punishing the clubs and the fans , i do n't think that 's right . " politicians must make the decisions , says coach fc sachsen leipzig coach eduard geier said the politicians were taking the easy way out . " politicians need to act here , we all do , we have to be role models and make sure that there are orderly games and fair play on the field , " he said .
" politicians have to deal with the rest .
we ca n't do it without them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig fans were blamed for the violence last weekend politicians have meanwhile come up with a handful of possible solutions .
saxony 's interior minister albrecht buttolo has vowed tougher measures for the future , with sports prosecutors on hand at high-risk games to issue arrest warrants on the spot if violent scenes occur .
buttolo also threatened games behind closed doors , as were recently played in italy after the death of a police officer there , in the case of further incidents . geier was skeptical of such plans . " as along as the perpetrators are let go every time , and as long as they 're never punished , the chaotic situation wo n't change , " the fc sachsen leipzig coach said . dagmar breitenbach -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scores injured as hooligans battle police in leipzig riot forty-two people , including 36 policemen , were injured in crowd trouble after a german regional soccer cup match between two amateur teams in the eastern city of leipzig , police said sunday .

if a new study is right , germans should be their happiest then on wednesday - in addition to during their holidays . there is no shortage of stereotypes about europeans .
the romantic french immediately pop to mind , as do the witty english and their dry sense of humor .
italians and spaniards share the top place for being most fiery , and the germans ?
these teutonic people are best known for their seriousness and hard work , not though for their happy disposition . but a new study presented this week showed that more than two-thirds of germans tend to be happy .
there is a hitch , though .
of those surveyed , 84 percent said they especially experienced happy moments when they were in love or on vacation .
while the love aspect may have to be left up to fate , it 's certainly a good thing that german employees have an average of six weeks paid annual vacation .
that would make anyone happy . the polling institute allensbach surveyed over 1,700 men and women between the ages of 16 and 69 for the magazine emotion .
it found that mostly women , young people or the better educated are most happy . but if a gloomy day comes along , over half of germans will pep up their spirits by listening to music , seeing their partner or meeting up with friends . it also appears that germans believe the old saying that every man is the architect of his own fortune .
almost two-thirds of those surveyed said they believed they could in part influence their own happiness . sex and money will not make you happy anyone who thinks sex is the key to happiness is just high on oxytocin .
the allensbach study showed that sex in fact does not make people happy .
only every third german said a satisfied sex life played a role in their happiness .
the same was true for professional success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : true love can make swans happy , too and the old saying that money ca n't buy you happiness was once again proven in the study : only 20 percent of those surveyed believe that a lot of money could make them happy . trend researcher matthias horx said he believed germans were " happiness sourpusses " compared to other nations .
horx said an increasing number of germans were breaking out of the typical pessimistic way of thinking and trying to work on their happiness .
but too many germans were still too passive and place too much emphasis on security in order to believe in self-made happiness , horx said . " overcoming fear is not our thing , " horx said .
" germans may be relatively content , but they still think that the world is going downhill . " can a celebrity be happy in germany ? so what does your typical happy german look like ?
they believe predominantly in their own personal success -lrb- 71 percent -rrb- , like to take responsibility -lrb- 68 percent -rrb- and have a lot of interests -lrb- 68 percent -rrb- .
they 're surrounded by longtime friends and acquaintances and seldom have the feeling that others are making more out of their lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher : the face of a happy german man you 'd think then that the country 's chancellor angela merkel would be on top of the world .
she may be , but only five percent of her nation think she is happy . so who does the average german consider the happiest vip in the population ?
most voted for sevenfold formula one race car driver michael schumacher and former tennis star steffi graf .
both , by the way , do n't live in germany . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 14.02.2007 happiness is … love and vacation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for most germans , it does n't get any better than this valentine 's day is the day of love .
if a new study is right , germans should be their happiest then on wednesday - in addition to during their holidays . there is no shortage of stereotypes about europeans .
the romantic french immediately pop to mind , as do the witty english and their dry sense of humor .
italians and spaniards share the top place for being most fiery , and the germans ?
these teutonic people are best known for their seriousness and hard work , not though for their happy disposition . but a new study presented this week showed that more than two-thirds of germans tend to be happy .
there is a hitch , though .
of those surveyed , 84 percent said they especially experienced happy moments when they were in love or on vacation .
while the love aspect may have to be left up to fate , it 's certainly a good thing that german employees have an average of six weeks paid annual vacation .
that would make anyone happy . the polling institute allensbach surveyed over 1,700 men and women between the ages of 16 and 69 for the magazine emotion .
it found that mostly women , young people or the better educated are most happy . but if a gloomy day comes along , over half of germans will pep up their spirits by listening to music , seeing their partner or meeting up with friends . it also appears that germans believe the old saying that every man is the architect of his own fortune .
almost two-thirds of those surveyed said they believed they could in part influence their own happiness . sex and money will not make you happy anyone who thinks sex is the key to happiness is just high on oxytocin .
the allensbach study showed that sex in fact does not make people happy .
only every third german said a satisfied sex life played a role in their happiness .
the same was true for professional success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : true love can make swans happy , too and the old saying that money ca n't buy you happiness was once again proven in the study : only 20 percent of those surveyed believe that a lot of money could make them happy . trend researcher matthias horx said he believed germans were " happiness sourpusses " compared to other nations .
horx said an increasing number of germans were breaking out of the typical pessimistic way of thinking and trying to work on their happiness .
but too many germans were still too passive and place too much emphasis on security in order to believe in self-made happiness , horx said . " overcoming fear is not our thing , " horx said .
" germans may be relatively content , but they still think that the world is going downhill . " can a celebrity be happy in germany ? so what does your typical happy german look like ?
they believe predominantly in their own personal success -lrb- 71 percent -rrb- , like to take responsibility -lrb- 68 percent -rrb- and have a lot of interests -lrb- 68 percent -rrb- .
they 're surrounded by longtime friends and acquaintances and seldom have the feeling that others are making more out of their lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher : the face of a happy german man you 'd think then that the country 's chancellor angela merkel would be on top of the world .
she may be , but only five percent of her nation think she is happy . so who does the average german consider the happiest vip in the population ?
most voted for sevenfold formula one race car driver michael schumacher and former tennis star steffi graf .
both , by the way , do n't live in germany . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

but a change in format has made the uefa cup harder .
it 's a trophy teams want to win . if you believe what you hear , you could be fooled into thinking that there is only one big european fixture on the horizon for germany 's teams in the next week . with their domestic league form mixed at best , bayern munich 's season hinges on their champions league clash against real madrid on feb .
20 .
it is undoubtedly a huge game ; if bayern lose the tie over two legs , they will have to resign themselves to a season without silverware . but the bavarian giants are not the only german team still in the hunt for european honors .
bayer leverkusen and werder bremen take on difficult opposition on wednesday night in the first knock-out round of the uefa cup .
leverkusen take on english premiership side blackburn rovers while werder have a tricky tie against ajax amsterdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uefa cup -lrb- r . -rrb- with its more prestigious relative despite its reputation as the champions league 's poorer relation , the uefa cup is still a hard fought and extremely difficult competition to win .
after format changes in the 2004/05 season that introduced a league round and the inclusion of those third-placed champions league sides that missed out on qualification , the uefa cup now has more games and now features tougher teams . german clubs go for first win in a decade it has been exactly ten years since a german team last won the trophy - schalke 04 beating inter milan on penalties in the 1996/07 final - and the list of winners since shows that the uefa cup is hardly a competition for minnows . leverkusen and bremen both hope to mark the anniversary by bringing the cup back to germany for the first time in a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen entered the uefa cup after losing to barca for werder , the uefa cup may at first seem like an anti-climax .
thrust into undoubtedly the hardest group stage of this season 's champions league , thomas schaaf 's side cruelly missed out on an historic qualification from group a by one point after beating english champions chelsea at the weserstadion and holding the current european champions barcelona to a draw . werder dropped into the uefa cup at the start of the knock-out stages and instantly became one of the favorites to win the trophy on the back of their bundesliga form and improving european credentials .

italians and spaniards share the top place for being most fiery , and the germans ?
these teutonic people are best known for their seriousness and hard work , not though for their happy disposition . but a new study presented this week showed that more than two-thirds of germans tend to be happy .
there is a hitch , though .
of those surveyed , 84 percent said they especially experienced happy moments when they were in love or on vacation .
while the love aspect may have to be left up to fate , it 's certainly a good thing that german employees have an average of six weeks paid annual vacation .
that would make anyone happy . the polling institute allensbach surveyed over 1,700 men and women between the ages of 16 and 69 for the magazine emotion .
it found that mostly women , young people or the better educated are most happy . but if a gloomy day comes along , over half of germans will pep up their spirits by listening to music , seeing their partner or meeting up with friends . it also appears that germans believe the old saying that every man is the architect of his own fortune .
almost two-thirds of those surveyed said they believed they could in part influence their own happiness . sex and money will not make you happy anyone who thinks sex is the key to happiness is just high on oxytocin .
the allensbach study showed that sex in fact does not make people happy .

horx said an increasing number of germans were breaking out of the typical pessimistic way of thinking and trying to work on their happiness .
but too many germans were still too passive and place too much emphasis on security in order to believe in self-made happiness , horx said . " overcoming fear is not our thing , " horx said .
" germans may be relatively content , but they still think that the world is going downhill . " can a celebrity be happy in germany ? so what does your typical happy german look like ?

she may be , but only five percent of her nation think she is happy . so who does the average german consider the happiest vip in the population ?

if a new study is right , germans should be their happiest then on wednesday - in addition to during their holidays . there is no shortage of stereotypes about europeans .
the romantic french immediately pop to mind , as do the witty english and their dry sense of humor .
italians and spaniards share the top place for being most fiery , and the germans ?
these teutonic people are best known for their seriousness and hard work , not though for their happy disposition . but a new study presented this week showed that more than two-thirds of germans tend to be happy .
there is a hitch , though .
of those surveyed , 84 percent said they especially experienced happy moments when they were in love or on vacation .
while the love aspect may have to be left up to fate , it 's certainly a good thing that german employees have an average of six weeks paid annual vacation .
that would make anyone happy . the polling institute allensbach surveyed over 1,700 men and women between the ages of 16 and 69 for the magazine emotion .
it found that mostly women , young people or the better educated are most happy . but if a gloomy day comes along , over half of germans will pep up their spirits by listening to music , seeing their partner or meeting up with friends . it also appears that germans believe the old saying that every man is the architect of his own fortune .
almost two-thirds of those surveyed said they believed they could in part influence their own happiness . sex and money will not make you happy anyone who thinks sex is the key to happiness is just high on oxytocin .
the allensbach study showed that sex in fact does not make people happy .
only every third german said a satisfied sex life played a role in their happiness .
the same was true for professional success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : true love can make swans happy , too and the old saying that money ca n't buy you happiness was once again proven in the study : only 20 percent of those surveyed believe that a lot of money could make them happy . trend researcher matthias horx said he believed germans were " happiness sourpusses " compared to other nations .

" the situation should have been solved differently ; now , we 're just punishing the clubs and the fans , i do n't think that 's right . " politicians must make the decisions , says coach fc sachsen leipzig coach eduard geier said the politicians were taking the easy way out . " politicians need to act here , we all do , we have to be role models and make sure that there are orderly games and fair play on the field , " he said .
" politicians have to deal with the rest .
we ca n't do it without them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig fans were blamed for the violence last weekend politicians have meanwhile come up with a handful of possible solutions .
saxony 's interior minister albrecht buttolo has vowed tougher measures for the future , with sports prosecutors on hand at high-risk games to issue arrest warrants on the spot if violent scenes occur .
buttolo also threatened games behind closed doors , as were recently played in italy after the death of a police officer there , in the case of further incidents . geier was skeptical of such plans . " as along as the perpetrators are let go every time , and as long as they 're never punished , the chaotic situation wo n't change , " the fc sachsen leipzig coach said . dagmar breitenbach -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scores injured as hooligans battle police in leipzig riot forty-two people , including 36 policemen , were injured in crowd trouble after a german regional soccer cup match between two amateur teams in the eastern city of leipzig , police said sunday .

but as time runs out , angela merkel is the leader most likely to achieve his goals . when tony blair flew to berlin on tuesday for talks on climate change with german chancellor angela merkel , there was more to the meeting than just two international figures attempting to keep the slowly turning wheels of environmental politics going . while the british prime minister arrived in the german capital intent on capitalizing on the slight recent shift in global thinking towards tackling climate change by discussing plans with the current eu president and leader of the g8 , blair was also seizing what many observers see as his last chance to leave a positive legacy when his premiership comes to an end . blair has embarked on many missions during his 10-year tenure in downing street .
his desire to be remembered for one great success on the global stage has led him to pursue campaigns to resolve the israeli-palestinian conflict and bring peace to the middle east , to rebuild the bridges between the united states and europe , and to bring the world together in a binding international agreement on climate change . the war in iraq put paid to both blair 's influence in the middle east and his credibility as the link between europe and the us .
his visit to berlin shows , that with time running out , he has to work with the woman who has replaced him as the point person on all the major issues he held dear if he wants to go down in history as the leader who attempted to save the world from environmental disaster . merkel getting results in the middle east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel gets access and results seemingly beyond blair merkel 's more pragmatic and candid approach to the volatile situation in the middle east , as seen during her recent peacemaking tour of egypt , saudi arabia and the gulf , has so far achieved more than blair could have ever expected from his own efforts . merkel personally persuaded us president george w. bush to accept the link between iraq and a wider middle east settlement ; encouraged the americans to revive the mideast quartet negotiating forum and rallied a number of arab states behind her vision of peace . in another example where she has seemingly succeeded where blair failed , merkel has kept germany free from washington 's apron strings in pursuing dialogue with iran and syria , and a two-state solution of the arab-israeli conflict while maintaining good relations with the white house . meanwhile blair is left to privately rue his decision to join the us in the war against iraq while germany takes the initiative in pushing for a resolution in the middle east , according to mark halsey , author of the book " blair 's legacy . " " iraq pretty much killed his dream of securing peace in the middle east , " halsey said .
" his attempts to save his tarnished reputation in the region by pressing for movement on the arab-israeli peace process also failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has found bush to be a fickle bed-fellow " he was defeated by washington 's pro-israeli neoconservatives , who believe israel should be free to settle its conflict with the palestinians , syria and hezbollah in lebanon on its own terms , " halsey added .
" that ended any real hope of blair leading the way in any peace process , or the americans letting him take the lead . " while germany 's nazi past will never allow it to put serious pressure on israel , merkel has maintained a level of independence in her dealing in the middle east , which has to some extent met with us acceptance and support . a challenging trans-atlantic relationship after the obvious divisions between the us and much of europe over the iraq war , the bush administration expressed relief after germany 's 2005 election when it found a leader it could be civil with after bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , descended into icy silence after the war began . even as us-german relations are back to normal on the surface after the schröder years , germany and the us do not share all the same interests , strategies and perceptions .
iraq and climate change being the clearest examples .
meanwhile , merkel 's boldest trans-atlantic initiative - an economic zone between europe and the us - has also raised little excitement in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is seen as europe 's point person by washington despite the differences , it is now merkel and not blair that the americans come to talk to on the current hot topics .
us experts say the bush administration views merkel as the " anchor point " for its dealings with the eu .
while blair is seen as a lame duck premier who has served his purpose , merkel is a leader on the rise . " she 's the big player in europe right now , " kurt volker , the bush administration 's principal deputy assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs , was quoted as saying after merkel ’ s visit to washington earlier this year . marginalized blair seeks climate agreement blair is expected to stand down as prime minister this spring .
but before he does , he wants to sign off on a new environmental agreement which would bind all the main players to a set of goals on the stabilization of emissions and the establishment of a global price for carbon trading . ironically , as blair pursues his last remaining legacy option , angela merkel is the person best equipped to take the lead in the global climate debate .
as a physicist and the former environment minister who negotiated the kyoto protocol for germany in 1997 , merkel knows that the basic science of climate change is no longer in dispute .
she also knows that the scale and urgency of the challenge the world faces is worse than previously thought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is forced to watch merkel make all the decisions as well as chairing the eu spring summit in march , where leaders will make major decisions on the future of climate and energy security policies , merkel will put climate change at the top of the agenda for this year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .
she will then lead the negotiations for securing agreement on the principles of a more comprehensive deal ahead of a united nations meeting in bali later in the year . by then , blair may have played his last part on the world stage ; watching from the wings as germany 's first female chancellor makes progress on all the issues that eluded him during his time as prime minister . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , blair push for action to prevent climate change german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday after a meeting with british prime minster tony blair that she hopes to set concrete goals on climate protection at the g8 summit of the world 's richest nations in june .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign relations -pipe- 14.02.2007 merkel in the ascendency as blair 's star fades großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power shift : blair needs merkel 's help to get an agreement on climate change tony blair has pursued many issues in search of a lasting positive legacy ; mideast peace , strong eu-us ties and climate change .
but as time runs out , angela merkel is the leader most likely to achieve his goals . when tony blair flew to berlin on tuesday for talks on climate change with german chancellor angela merkel , there was more to the meeting than just two international figures attempting to keep the slowly turning wheels of environmental politics going . while the british prime minister arrived in the german capital intent on capitalizing on the slight recent shift in global thinking towards tackling climate change by discussing plans with the current eu president and leader of the g8 , blair was also seizing what many observers see as his last chance to leave a positive legacy when his premiership comes to an end . blair has embarked on many missions during his 10-year tenure in downing street .
his desire to be remembered for one great success on the global stage has led him to pursue campaigns to resolve the israeli-palestinian conflict and bring peace to the middle east , to rebuild the bridges between the united states and europe , and to bring the world together in a binding international agreement on climate change . the war in iraq put paid to both blair 's influence in the middle east and his credibility as the link between europe and the us .
his visit to berlin shows , that with time running out , he has to work with the woman who has replaced him as the point person on all the major issues he held dear if he wants to go down in history as the leader who attempted to save the world from environmental disaster . merkel getting results in the middle east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel gets access and results seemingly beyond blair merkel 's more pragmatic and candid approach to the volatile situation in the middle east , as seen during her recent peacemaking tour of egypt , saudi arabia and the gulf , has so far achieved more than blair could have ever expected from his own efforts . merkel personally persuaded us president george w. bush to accept the link between iraq and a wider middle east settlement ; encouraged the americans to revive the mideast quartet negotiating forum and rallied a number of arab states behind her vision of peace . in another example where she has seemingly succeeded where blair failed , merkel has kept germany free from washington 's apron strings in pursuing dialogue with iran and syria , and a two-state solution of the arab-israeli conflict while maintaining good relations with the white house . meanwhile blair is left to privately rue his decision to join the us in the war against iraq while germany takes the initiative in pushing for a resolution in the middle east , according to mark halsey , author of the book " blair 's legacy . " " iraq pretty much killed his dream of securing peace in the middle east , " halsey said .
" his attempts to save his tarnished reputation in the region by pressing for movement on the arab-israeli peace process also failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has found bush to be a fickle bed-fellow " he was defeated by washington 's pro-israeli neoconservatives , who believe israel should be free to settle its conflict with the palestinians , syria and hezbollah in lebanon on its own terms , " halsey added .
" that ended any real hope of blair leading the way in any peace process , or the americans letting him take the lead . " while germany 's nazi past will never allow it to put serious pressure on israel , merkel has maintained a level of independence in her dealing in the middle east , which has to some extent met with us acceptance and support . a challenging trans-atlantic relationship after the obvious divisions between the us and much of europe over the iraq war , the bush administration expressed relief after germany 's 2005 election when it found a leader it could be civil with after bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , descended into icy silence after the war began . even as us-german relations are back to normal on the surface after the schröder years , germany and the us do not share all the same interests , strategies and perceptions .
iraq and climate change being the clearest examples .
meanwhile , merkel 's boldest trans-atlantic initiative - an economic zone between europe and the us - has also raised little excitement in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is seen as europe 's point person by washington despite the differences , it is now merkel and not blair that the americans come to talk to on the current hot topics .
us experts say the bush administration views merkel as the " anchor point " for its dealings with the eu .
while blair is seen as a lame duck premier who has served his purpose , merkel is a leader on the rise . " she 's the big player in europe right now , " kurt volker , the bush administration 's principal deputy assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs , was quoted as saying after merkel ’ s visit to washington earlier this year . marginalized blair seeks climate agreement blair is expected to stand down as prime minister this spring .
but before he does , he wants to sign off on a new environmental agreement which would bind all the main players to a set of goals on the stabilization of emissions and the establishment of a global price for carbon trading . ironically , as blair pursues his last remaining legacy option , angela merkel is the person best equipped to take the lead in the global climate debate .
as a physicist and the former environment minister who negotiated the kyoto protocol for germany in 1997 , merkel knows that the basic science of climate change is no longer in dispute .
she also knows that the scale and urgency of the challenge the world faces is worse than previously thought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is forced to watch merkel make all the decisions as well as chairing the eu spring summit in march , where leaders will make major decisions on the future of climate and energy security policies , merkel will put climate change at the top of the agenda for this year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .
she will then lead the negotiations for securing agreement on the principles of a more comprehensive deal ahead of a united nations meeting in bali later in the year . by then , blair may have played his last part on the world stage ; watching from the wings as germany 's first female chancellor makes progress on all the issues that eluded him during his time as prime minister . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , blair push for action to prevent climate change german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday after a meeting with british prime minster tony blair that she hopes to set concrete goals on climate protection at the g8 summit of the world 's richest nations in june .
germany faces daunting agenda for eu , g8 presidencies germany will fight to revive international efforts for middle east peace , relaunch the eu constitution and advocate a gentler form of globalization when it takes over the presidencies of the eu and the g8 monday .
-lrb- 01.01.2007 -rrb- merkel , bush stand united on middle east , iran us president bush and german chancellor merkel on thursday called for restraint in the middle east , un action on iran , and urged russia to stick with democratic reforms .

but in the past , italy and france have also had to decide how to battle left-wing terrorists . the italian marxist-leninist terrorist group brigate rosse or red brigades officially disbanded in the 1980s , but pockets have remained , as arrests on monday showed . italian authorities took 15 people into custody .
the suspects are allegedly linked to the red brigades for planning several attacks , including one on a company owned by former premier silvio berlusconi .
they have been accused of " associating with terrorists and participating in an armed group , " the italian interior ministry said . the group , founded in 1973 , has been mainly inoperative since the end of the cold war .
but in the 1970s and 1980s , it was responsible for thousands of acts of violence .
over 400 deaths are attributed to the red brigades . the climax of red brigades terror occurred in 1978 , when the group kidnapped former prime minister aldo moros and subsequently murdered him .
the period belonged to the most dramatic days that italy experienced since the end of the second world war . today , a small plaque on house number 9 in the via caetani in rome 's city center commemorates the moros murder .
on may 9 , 1978 , his body was found here , in the trunk of a parked car . groups had the same goals , but no cooperation left-wing extremists such as the brigate rosse in italy also existed in germany and france in the 1970s .
all groups wanted to build up an " anti-imperial european front , " said rolf tophoven , director of the institute for terrorism research and security policy in essen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf tophoven is a leading german terrorism expert germany 's red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , the red brigades and action directe in france had a social revolutionary approach in common .

" they were aiming for the revolutionary reorganization of society according to a marxist-leninist ideal . " the instrument they chose to meet this goal was violence , and the targets were mainly leading politicians and top managers from the business world .
but the groups never got further than an ideological linking . cross-border cooperation , such as that practiced by islamic terrorist groups today , never existed . justice collaborators helped break up the red brigades the red brigades had dreamt of a communist order in italy .
the result , though , was a climate of uncertainty and violence caused by numerous assaults and kidnappings .
the break came after the moros murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldo moro spent 55 days in the red brigades ' hands before he was killed " this event shocked all of italy , " tophoven said .
" for the first time , a wide front spanning across all political parties formed against the terror from the left . " the decisive aspect of the fight against terror in italy was the so-called pentiti , or justice collaborators .
it offered leading heads of the movement a milder sentence if they cooperated with the state . " this led to the breakup of the red brigades in 1982 , " tophoven said .
over 200 activists received sentences at the time - 85 of them for life . in the meantime , however , many have been released from prison or were granted day release .
in 1998 , when founder renato curcio was released after 24 years in prison , the discussion in italy was nowhere near as heated as in germany .
a german court ruled on monday that former raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt will be released on parole next month .
this has sparked a sharp debate across the country . public opinion in france forced government action in france in the 1980s , the government and president francois mitterrand initially reacted relatively reserved to action directe .
as opposed to germany , they did n't consider the state order directly endangered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joëlle aubron from action directe died of cancer in 2006 but with the action directe commando 's first casualties , public opinion changed .
the major left-wing liberal newspapers , such as le monde and libération condemned action directe .
the publications criticized the lacking reference to the working class , in whose name the group operated . the french government took a tougher stance after the murders of general rene audran in 1985 and renault director georges besse in 1986 .
one year later , the founders of the group , jean-marc rouillan , nathalie ménigon and georges cipriani were arrested and action directe fell apart . in 2006 , the three prisoners requested release on parole after serving the minimum time of 18 years .
but authorities denied the request due to their lack of remorse . raf dissolved itself following the successes in italy , the witness leniency program was introduced in germany , too .

but a change in format has made the uefa cup harder .
it 's a trophy teams want to win . if you believe what you hear , you could be fooled into thinking that there is only one big european fixture on the horizon for germany 's teams in the next week . with their domestic league form mixed at best , bayern munich 's season hinges on their champions league clash against real madrid on feb .
20 .
it is undoubtedly a huge game ; if bayern lose the tie over two legs , they will have to resign themselves to a season without silverware . but the bavarian giants are not the only german team still in the hunt for european honors .
bayer leverkusen and werder bremen take on difficult opposition on wednesday night in the first knock-out round of the uefa cup .
leverkusen take on english premiership side blackburn rovers while werder have a tricky tie against ajax amsterdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uefa cup -lrb- r . -rrb- with its more prestigious relative despite its reputation as the champions league 's poorer relation , the uefa cup is still a hard fought and extremely difficult competition to win .
after format changes in the 2004/05 season that introduced a league round and the inclusion of those third-placed champions league sides that missed out on qualification , the uefa cup now has more games and now features tougher teams . german clubs go for first win in a decade it has been exactly ten years since a german team last won the trophy - schalke 04 beating inter milan on penalties in the 1996/07 final - and the list of winners since shows that the uefa cup is hardly a competition for minnows . leverkusen and bremen both hope to mark the anniversary by bringing the cup back to germany for the first time in a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen entered the uefa cup after losing to barca for werder , the uefa cup may at first seem like an anti-climax .
thrust into undoubtedly the hardest group stage of this season 's champions league , thomas schaaf 's side cruelly missed out on an historic qualification from group a by one point after beating english champions chelsea at the weserstadion and holding the current european champions barcelona to a draw . werder dropped into the uefa cup at the start of the knock-out stages and instantly became one of the favorites to win the trophy on the back of their bundesliga form and improving european credentials .
however , if bremen thought they were in for an easy time , the draw had them thinking again . bremen face dutch masters in sticky knock-out tie ajax amsterdam have four european cups to their name , one uefa cup , 29 dutch championship titles and are currently second in the dutch league .
a club which did much to introduce the concept of total football to the world , a fluid system which allows the outfield players the freedom to swap positions , ajax will prove to be a real test for bremen . while not exactly a team known for a lack of confidence , two successive defeats in the bundesliga have put werder six points behind leaders schalke 04 and have knocked them out of their free-scoring rhythm .
" we 'll have to see whether this latest defeat gives us the spur we need - or not , " bremen 's germany striker miroslav klose said tuesday . bildunterschrift : ajax players prepare for wednesday 's clash in bremen ajax , whose dutch title hopes have been re-ignited by closest rivals psv eindhoven 's poor run , have defensive worries with injuries ruling out defenders urby emanuelson , zdenek grygera and thomas vermaelen . recently re-signed amsterdam legend edgar davids is cup-tied for the remainder of the competition after featuring for former club tottenham hotspur in the group stage . for bayer leverkusen , the uefa cup offers a glamorous respite from the rigors of their mediocre bundesliga campaign .
however , things will have to pick up for michael skibbe 's team if they are to carry on enjoying its distractions . unconvincing leverkusen meet battling blackburn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benni mccarthy -lrb- center -rrb- has blackburn dreaming currently lying seventh in the league , bayer have had a mixed season domestically and have also struggled to maintain any consistency in europe .
leverkusen limped out of group b in third place with just four points and will meet group e winners blackburn , a team that only dropped two points in qualifying . blackburn are also enduring a less than exemplary season in the premiership but have definitely reserved their best performances for the uefa cup , fired by pre-season signing benni mccarthy , a uefa cup winner with fc porto in 2003 . rovers play a robust game as one would expect from a team managed by the combative mark hughes , a former bayern munich player .
leverkusen 's progress is far from assured . injuries plague both sides ahead of clash things have been made worse by injuries to defenders juan and roque junior and coach skibbe may also have to do without captain carsten ramelow .
the influential midfielder made his comeback from a knee operation in saturday 's 2-2 draw against eintracht frankfurt but he is still far from fully match fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten ramelow , left , may not be risked against blackburn " the comeback was way too soon but i needed him , " said skibbe , who will have to think hard before asking ramelow to play a second game in five days . blackburn hope midfielder david dunn will have recovered from a dead leg in time for the leverkusen match after picking up the injury at the weekend .
" it should settle down and it should n't be a problem for him , " hughes told the club 's web site on tuesday . rovers will also be without long-term injury victims robbie savage and andre ooijer , who are both recovering from broken legs . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german clubs learn next uefa cup foes tuesday saw the draw for the group stage of the uefa cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 14.02.2007 report : belgium collaborated with nazis in deporting jews großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi germany raised its flag in belgium in 1940 belgian historians have concluded that the country actively cooperated with germany 's nazi regime during world war ii in deporting jews .
the state even went beyond german demands at the time . belgium actively helped the occupying german forces round up and deport the country 's jewish population during the second world war , according to historians from the center for historical research and documentation on war and contemporary society -lrb- ceges -rrb- in brussels . " the belgian state adopted a docile and cooperative attitude in some very diverse , but crucial domains providing collaboration unworthy of a democracy , with a policy that was disastrous for belgian and foreign jews , " the historians said . the report " docile belgium , " commissioned by the belgian parliament , said the state collaborated with the nazis for " economic , as well as ideological and legal-administrative " reasons .
it is the first time belgium 's cooperation with the nazis has been presented in such detail . project leader rudi van doorslaer said " a xenophobic and sometimes anti-semitic culture of the ruling elite " in the 1930s had prepared belgium psychologically for the persecution of the jews .
the " democratic deficit " in the years from 1930 to 1940 had also played a role , doorslaer said . " the step from passive to active collaboration was quickly taken , " doorslaer said as he read the report 's conclusions to the parliament on tuesday . government in exile authorized cooperation with the nazis doorslaer said the country had closed its doors to jews fleeing germany after hitler came to power in 1933 .
according to the ceges study , the deportations began shortly after may 10 , 1940 , when german annexed predominantly german-speaking cantons in eastern belgium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of belgian jews were killed in the auschwitz concentration camp following the nazi invasion in 1940 , the belgian government fled to britain .
but the report found that the government in exile in london during the war " never let it be known that policies had to be adapted and that the behavior of leading civil servants and magistrates was unconstitutional and democratically reprehensible . " however , belgian authorities were not aware in summer 1942 that jews deported to poland were being exterminated , the report said . some 50,000 jews lived in belgium in the 1930s .
about half were killed during the holocaust . many belgians tried to save jewish people belgian jewish groups reacted positively to the study . " this report is fundamental and it is a victory for enlightened democracy , " said philippe markiewicz , head of the coordination committee of belgian jewish organizations . markiewicz said despite the negative impact of the report , there were many belgians who risked their lives to save jews . findings should go into the history books the ceges historians spent three years researching and writing the 1,114-page study and were able to view documents previously unused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis forced the jewish population to wear the yellow star of david prime minister guy verhofstadt apologized already to the jewish community in 2002 for belgium 's role in the holocaust .
his spokesman said that verhofstadt felt the ceges findings should be incorporated into history textbooks . the historians worked out the details of three major phases relating to the persecution of belgian jews .
in october and november 1940 , the central government followed the nazis ' request to require all jews to register with their local authorities . in the summer of 1942 , when the nazi regime began massively deporting belgians of jewish origin , collaboration started diminishing .
brussels refused to make jews wear yellow stars , which the nazis prescribed in order to identify them more easily .
the police in antwerp , on the other hand , arbitrarily arrested 1,243 jews and handed them over to the germans . after the end of the war , belgian military judicial authorities decided that investigating the deportation of the jewish people was too " delicate " to be allowed to continue . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film on wiesenthal 's legacy opens at berlinale a documentary about the life of famous nazi hunter simon wiesenthal has premiered at the berlin international film festival .

the state even went beyond german demands at the time . belgium actively helped the occupying german forces round up and deport the country 's jewish population during the second world war , according to historians from the center for historical research and documentation on war and contemporary society -lrb- ceges -rrb- in brussels . " the belgian state adopted a docile and cooperative attitude in some very diverse , but crucial domains providing collaboration unworthy of a democracy , with a policy that was disastrous for belgian and foreign jews , " the historians said . the report " docile belgium , " commissioned by the belgian parliament , said the state collaborated with the nazis for " economic , as well as ideological and legal-administrative " reasons .
it is the first time belgium 's cooperation with the nazis has been presented in such detail . project leader rudi van doorslaer said " a xenophobic and sometimes anti-semitic culture of the ruling elite " in the 1930s had prepared belgium psychologically for the persecution of the jews .
the " democratic deficit " in the years from 1930 to 1940 had also played a role , doorslaer said . " the step from passive to active collaboration was quickly taken , " doorslaer said as he read the report 's conclusions to the parliament on tuesday . government in exile authorized cooperation with the nazis doorslaer said the country had closed its doors to jews fleeing germany after hitler came to power in 1933 .
according to the ceges study , the deportations began shortly after may 10 , 1940 , when german annexed predominantly german-speaking cantons in eastern belgium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of belgian jews were killed in the auschwitz concentration camp following the nazi invasion in 1940 , the belgian government fled to britain .
but the report found that the government in exile in london during the war " never let it be known that policies had to be adapted and that the behavior of leading civil servants and magistrates was unconstitutional and democratically reprehensible .

his spokesman said that verhofstadt felt the ceges findings should be incorporated into history textbooks . the historians worked out the details of three major phases relating to the persecution of belgian jews .
in october and november 1940 , the central government followed the nazis ' request to require all jews to register with their local authorities . in the summer of 1942 , when the nazi regime began massively deporting belgians of jewish origin , collaboration started diminishing .
brussels refused to make jews wear yellow stars , which the nazis prescribed in order to identify them more easily .

" google said in paris that it would appeal against the decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google co-founders larry page , left , and sergey brin " google regrets today 's decision and will appeal , " said google news legal counsel for europe yoram elkaim in paris .
" we continue to believe that the google news service conforms with copyright law and benefits publishers as much as internet users , " he said . the president of the copiepresse grouping of belgium 's french-language newspapers , margaret boribon , said the group did not intend to keep up the legal battle " for the fun of it " and preferred to " negotiate " a settlement . long-standing suit a year ago copiepresse lodged a belgian lawsuit against google news to require the internet group to request permission from copiepresse and to pay it to show its articles on the google news site . on september 5 , a belgian court ordered google news to stop reproducing content from french-language and german-language newspapers in belgium on its belgian website and imposed fines as long as it did not respect the decision . in that ruling , the court told the company to pay copiepresse a million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- each day that the forbidden articles , pictures and graphics appeared on its site . in tuesday 's decision , the judge backed google 's claim that the fines were " disproportionate " and reduced them to a more " reasonable " 25,000 euros per day . copiepresse lawyer bernard magrez said that meant google would no longer have to pay a total of 130 million euros but three million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court decision is being hailed as a victory for news providers in a hearing in november , google 's lawyers argued that the papers were seeking to profit from its immense financial success in recent years . google 's main defense was that it is a search engine that helps users find information on other websites and not a so-called portal that hosts its own information . case could have broader implications the case in belgium is being closely watched by other news providers , including agence france-presse , which has been in dispute with google in france as well as in the united states . a spokesman for the paris-based world association of newspapers welcomed the court 's ruling and said that google and other internet companies would now have to be more careful about treading on papers ' copyrights . " it shows that content providers and publishers have to be part of the discussion with search engines , otherwise it 's going to end up in court , " said wan spokesman larry kilman . afp chief executive pierre louette also welcomed the decision . " it 's important that a court recognizes that permission must be given before using content , " he said in paris . after opening news websites for about thirty countries in four years , google launched a belgian version in january 2006 , much to the concern of the country 's french-speaking newspapers . the newspapers had also asked microsoft to stop the unauthorized publishing of articles on its " www.msn.be " site , which the company later did .

" it shows that content providers and publishers have to be part of the discussion with search engines , otherwise it 's going to end up in court , " said wan spokesman larry kilman . afp chief executive pierre louette also welcomed the decision .

poverty among minorities and a lack of books in homes also dragged down scores . northern europe scores high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kinder beim essen top marks went mostly to northern european countries .
the netherlands garnered first place , followed by sweden , denmark , finland , spain and switzerland .
france took 16th place , while the uk landed a miserable 21st slot . the honorary chairwoman of german unicef , heide simonis , called germany 's middle-of-the-pack showing " unsatisfying . "
she told bavarian state radio the country needs more full-day schools and more childcare for very young children .
in addition , she said , politicians have to take the problems of youth more seriously . german family minster ursula von der leyen this week proposed spending 3 million -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- euros more on expanding childcare in germany , a plan that has received approval from political leaders though the proposal still lacks a funding plan . germany scored poorly on its schools , which mostly operate in the morning only , and its lack of success helping immigrant children . regional disparities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians have called for more childcare centers simonis noted that the german education system suffers under severe regional disparities as some states offer a better education than others . simonis also noted that germany scored poorly when it came to cigarette and alcohol use .
the country - the last bastion for smokers in europe - has more teen smokers under the age of 15 than in any other . " germans share with the british the dubious honor of having the children and teenagers who drink alcohol most often , " she added . moreover , the study showed nearly 40 percent of surveyed german children said their parents " never really talk " to them . germans less aggressive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , with britain , reported the most underage drinking simonis stressed that there were some positive results , too .
for example , german children and teens were relatively less aggressive than in other countries . the caritas aid organization told news agencies that the study clearly showed that the lack of a reliable living environment can be a serious detriment to the development of children in german society , especially for less-educated and immigrant families . there was also dismay over the results in britain , with commentators saying the low ratings for personal relationships were evidence of a dog-eat-dog society where too many children hang around on the streets . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside " the german parliament 's commission for children 's concerns this week discussed including children 's rights in the constitution .
in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue .

experts have spoken out on both issues .

according to initial media reports , the kidnappers contacted the young man 's sister in berlin , who then alerted german authorities .

al-hijjaj speaks fluent german and is connected with local tribal leaders in the so-called sunni triangle just north of baghdad . the german foreign ministry rewarded the man for his assistance with two tickets to a soccer world cup game in stuttgart .

the couple then fled to jordan , where they now live an impoverished life , according to media reports . no help for the helper al-hijjaj 's plight has prompted calls from some in germany to help the man who played a valuable role in securing the release of former german nationals taken hostage in iraq . peter bienert , the head of the leipzig-based firm cryotec , where former hostages bräunlich and nitzschke are employed , told german news agency dpa " the man -lrb- al-hijjaj -rrb- has been abandoned .

bienert has reportedly collected several thousand euros in donations for al-hijjaj . meanwhile , opposition leaders in the german parliament have called on the government to offer him some assistance .

if a new study is right , germans should be their happiest then on wednesday - in addition to during their holidays . there is no shortage of stereotypes about europeans .
the romantic french immediately pop to mind , as do the witty english and their dry sense of humor .
italians and spaniards share the top place for being most fiery , and the germans ?
these teutonic people are best known for their seriousness and hard work , not though for their happy disposition . but a new study presented this week showed that more than two-thirds of germans tend to be happy .
there is a hitch , though .
of those surveyed , 84 percent said they especially experienced happy moments when they were in love or on vacation .
while the love aspect may have to be left up to fate , it 's certainly a good thing that german employees have an average of six weeks paid annual vacation .
that would make anyone happy . the polling institute allensbach surveyed over 1,700 men and women between the ages of 16 and 69 for the magazine emotion .
it found that mostly women , young people or the better educated are most happy . but if a gloomy day comes along , over half of germans will pep up their spirits by listening to music , seeing their partner or meeting up with friends . it also appears that germans believe the old saying that every man is the architect of his own fortune .
almost two-thirds of those surveyed said they believed they could in part influence their own happiness . sex and money will not make you happy anyone who thinks sex is the key to happiness is just high on oxytocin .
the allensbach study showed that sex in fact does not make people happy .

horx said an increasing number of germans were breaking out of the typical pessimistic way of thinking and trying to work on their happiness .
but too many germans were still too passive and place too much emphasis on security in order to believe in self-made happiness , horx said . " overcoming fear is not our thing , " horx said .

the company presented a plan for chrysler at its annual earnings conference on wednesday . daimlerchrysler is putting the future of its subsidiary chrysler to the test .
the company said it was considering a sale , but also examining strategic options with partners to restructure its us business . an immediate step presented at the company 's earning conference wednesday was to close one chrysler plant in the us , resulting in some13,000 job cuts from 2007 to 2009 , the company announced wednesday .
when the layoffs are complete , the chrysler group will be nearly half the size it was at its peak when it was purchased by daimler benz in 1999 . the auto giant 's frankfurt office released a statement saying the job cuts were part of a three-year chrysler " recovery and transformation plan that seeks a return to profitability by 2008 .

but a change in format has made the uefa cup harder .
it 's a trophy teams want to win . if you believe what you hear , you could be fooled into thinking that there is only one big european fixture on the horizon for germany 's teams in the next week . with their domestic league form mixed at best , bayern munich 's season hinges on their champions league clash against real madrid on feb .
20 .
it is undoubtedly a huge game ; if bayern lose the tie over two legs , they will have to resign themselves to a season without silverware . but the bavarian giants are not the only german team still in the hunt for european honors .
bayer leverkusen and werder bremen take on difficult opposition on wednesday night in the first knock-out round of the uefa cup .
leverkusen take on english premiership side blackburn rovers while werder have a tricky tie against ajax amsterdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uefa cup -lrb- r . -rrb- with its more prestigious relative despite its reputation as the champions league 's poorer relation , the uefa cup is still a hard fought and extremely difficult competition to win .
after format changes in the 2004/05 season that introduced a league round and the inclusion of those third-placed champions league sides that missed out on qualification , the uefa cup now has more games and now features tougher teams . german clubs go for first win in a decade it has been exactly ten years since a german team last won the trophy - schalke 04 beating inter milan on penalties in the 1996/07 final - and the list of winners since shows that the uefa cup is hardly a competition for minnows . leverkusen and bremen both hope to mark the anniversary by bringing the cup back to germany for the first time in a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen entered the uefa cup after losing to barca for werder , the uefa cup may at first seem like an anti-climax .
thrust into undoubtedly the hardest group stage of this season 's champions league , thomas schaaf 's side cruelly missed out on an historic qualification from group a by one point after beating english champions chelsea at the weserstadion and holding the current european champions barcelona to a draw . werder dropped into the uefa cup at the start of the knock-out stages and instantly became one of the favorites to win the trophy on the back of their bundesliga form and improving european credentials .
however , if bremen thought they were in for an easy time , the draw had them thinking again . bremen face dutch masters in sticky knock-out tie ajax amsterdam have four european cups to their name , one uefa cup , 29 dutch championship titles and are currently second in the dutch league .
a club which did much to introduce the concept of total football to the world , a fluid system which allows the outfield players the freedom to swap positions , ajax will prove to be a real test for bremen . while not exactly a team known for a lack of confidence , two successive defeats in the bundesliga have put werder six points behind leaders schalke 04 and have knocked them out of their free-scoring rhythm .
" we 'll have to see whether this latest defeat gives us the spur we need - or not , " bremen 's germany striker miroslav klose said tuesday . bildunterschrift : ajax players prepare for wednesday 's clash in bremen ajax , whose dutch title hopes have been re-ignited by closest rivals psv eindhoven 's poor run , have defensive worries with injuries ruling out defenders urby emanuelson , zdenek grygera and thomas vermaelen . recently re-signed amsterdam legend edgar davids is cup-tied for the remainder of the competition after featuring for former club tottenham hotspur in the group stage . for bayer leverkusen , the uefa cup offers a glamorous respite from the rigors of their mediocre bundesliga campaign .
however , things will have to pick up for michael skibbe 's team if they are to carry on enjoying its distractions . unconvincing leverkusen meet battling blackburn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benni mccarthy -lrb- center -rrb- has blackburn dreaming currently lying seventh in the league , bayer have had a mixed season domestically and have also struggled to maintain any consistency in europe .
leverkusen limped out of group b in third place with just four points and will meet group e winners blackburn , a team that only dropped two points in qualifying . blackburn are also enduring a less than exemplary season in the premiership but have definitely reserved their best performances for the uefa cup , fired by pre-season signing benni mccarthy , a uefa cup winner with fc porto in 2003 . rovers play a robust game as one would expect from a team managed by the combative mark hughes , a former bayern munich player .
leverkusen 's progress is far from assured . injuries plague both sides ahead of clash things have been made worse by injuries to defenders juan and roque junior and coach skibbe may also have to do without captain carsten ramelow .
the influential midfielder made his comeback from a knee operation in saturday 's 2-2 draw against eintracht frankfurt but he is still far from fully match fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten ramelow , left , may not be risked against blackburn " the comeback was way too soon but i needed him , " said skibbe , who will have to think hard before asking ramelow to play a second game in five days . blackburn hope midfielder david dunn will have recovered from a dead leg in time for the leverkusen match after picking up the injury at the weekend .
" it should settle down and it should n't be a problem for him , " hughes told the club 's web site on tuesday . rovers will also be without long-term injury victims robbie savage and andre ooijer , who are both recovering from broken legs . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german clubs learn next uefa cup foes tuesday saw the draw for the group stage of the uefa cup .

but in the past , italy and france have also had to decide how to battle left-wing terrorists . the italian marxist-leninist terrorist group brigate rosse or red brigades officially disbanded in the 1980s , but pockets have remained , as arrests on monday showed . italian authorities took 15 people into custody .
the suspects are allegedly linked to the red brigades for planning several attacks , including one on a company owned by former premier silvio berlusconi .
they have been accused of " associating with terrorists and participating in an armed group , " the italian interior ministry said . the group , founded in 1973 , has been mainly inoperative since the end of the cold war .
but in the 1970s and 1980s , it was responsible for thousands of acts of violence .
over 400 deaths are attributed to the red brigades . the climax of red brigades terror occurred in 1978 , when the group kidnapped former prime minister aldo moros and subsequently murdered him .
the period belonged to the most dramatic days that italy experienced since the end of the second world war . today , a small plaque on house number 9 in the via caetani in rome 's city center commemorates the moros murder .
on may 9 , 1978 , his body was found here , in the trunk of a parked car . groups had the same goals , but no cooperation left-wing extremists such as the brigate rosse in italy also existed in germany and france in the 1970s .
all groups wanted to build up an " anti-imperial european front , " said rolf tophoven , director of the institute for terrorism research and security policy in essen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf tophoven is a leading german terrorism expert germany 's red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , the red brigades and action directe in france had a social revolutionary approach in common . " they were against the state , against exploitation and for the interests of the working class , " tophoven said .
" they were aiming for the revolutionary reorganization of society according to a marxist-leninist ideal . " the instrument they chose to meet this goal was violence , and the targets were mainly leading politicians and top managers from the business world .
but the groups never got further than an ideological linking . cross-border cooperation , such as that practiced by islamic terrorist groups today , never existed . justice collaborators helped break up the red brigades the red brigades had dreamt of a communist order in italy .
the result , though , was a climate of uncertainty and violence caused by numerous assaults and kidnappings .
the break came after the moros murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldo moro spent 55 days in the red brigades ' hands before he was killed " this event shocked all of italy , " tophoven said .
" for the first time , a wide front spanning across all political parties formed against the terror from the left . " the decisive aspect of the fight against terror in italy was the so-called pentiti , or justice collaborators .
it offered leading heads of the movement a milder sentence if they cooperated with the state . " this led to the breakup of the red brigades in 1982 , " tophoven said .
over 200 activists received sentences at the time - 85 of them for life . in the meantime , however , many have been released from prison or were granted day release .
in 1998 , when founder renato curcio was released after 24 years in prison , the discussion in italy was nowhere near as heated as in germany .
a german court ruled on monday that former raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt will be released on parole next month .
this has sparked a sharp debate across the country . public opinion in france forced government action in france in the 1980s , the government and president francois mitterrand initially reacted relatively reserved to action directe .
as opposed to germany , they did n't consider the state order directly endangered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joëlle aubron from action directe died of cancer in 2006 but with the action directe commando 's first casualties , public opinion changed .
the major left-wing liberal newspapers , such as le monde and libération condemned action directe .
the publications criticized the lacking reference to the working class , in whose name the group operated . the french government took a tougher stance after the murders of general rene audran in 1985 and renault director georges besse in 1986 .
one year later , the founders of the group , jean-marc rouillan , nathalie ménigon and georges cipriani were arrested and action directe fell apart . in 2006 , the three prisoners requested release on parole after serving the minimum time of 18 years .
but authorities denied the request due to their lack of remorse . raf dissolved itself following the successes in italy , the witness leniency program was introduced in germany , too .
but the raf dissolved itself .
in a letter in 1992 , it declared its fight as useless and the raf experiment as failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack on federal prosecutor siegfried buback left three dead following the decision to release mohnhaupt on parole , three raf members remain in prison : christian klar , eva sybille haule and birgit hogefeld .
their prison sentences could also be changed into a suspended sentence after 2009 . " in all three countries , the social revolutionary experiments drenched in violence and terrorist attacks failed , " tophoven said .
the virtually worldwide collapse of real socialism ultimately contributed , too . " the story of the anti-imperialist european front is a story of failure , " tophoven said . ina rottscheidt -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de release of former militant sparks mixed feelings in germany most german political parties consider the release of the one-time terrorist and red army faction leader brigitte mohnhaupt as a sign of justice .

but in the past , italy and france have also had to decide how to battle left-wing terrorists . the italian marxist-leninist terrorist group brigate rosse or red brigades officially disbanded in the 1980s , but pockets have remained , as arrests on monday showed . italian authorities took 15 people into custody .
the suspects are allegedly linked to the red brigades for planning several attacks , including one on a company owned by former premier silvio berlusconi .
they have been accused of " associating with terrorists and participating in an armed group , " the italian interior ministry said . the group , founded in 1973 , has been mainly inoperative since the end of the cold war .
but in the 1970s and 1980s , it was responsible for thousands of acts of violence .
over 400 deaths are attributed to the red brigades . the climax of red brigades terror occurred in 1978 , when the group kidnapped former prime minister aldo moros and subsequently murdered him .
the period belonged to the most dramatic days that italy experienced since the end of the second world war . today , a small plaque on house number 9 in the via caetani in rome 's city center commemorates the moros murder .
on may 9 , 1978 , his body was found here , in the trunk of a parked car . groups had the same goals , but no cooperation left-wing extremists such as the brigate rosse in italy also existed in germany and france in the 1970s .
all groups wanted to build up an " anti-imperial european front , " said rolf tophoven , director of the institute for terrorism research and security policy in essen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf tophoven is a leading german terrorism expert germany 's red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , the red brigades and action directe in france had a social revolutionary approach in common . " they were against the state , against exploitation and for the interests of the working class , " tophoven said .
" they were aiming for the revolutionary reorganization of society according to a marxist-leninist ideal . " the instrument they chose to meet this goal was violence , and the targets were mainly leading politicians and top managers from the business world .
but the groups never got further than an ideological linking . cross-border cooperation , such as that practiced by islamic terrorist groups today , never existed . justice collaborators helped break up the red brigades the red brigades had dreamt of a communist order in italy .
the result , though , was a climate of uncertainty and violence caused by numerous assaults and kidnappings .
the break came after the moros murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldo moro spent 55 days in the red brigades ' hands before he was killed " this event shocked all of italy , " tophoven said .
" for the first time , a wide front spanning across all political parties formed against the terror from the left . " the decisive aspect of the fight against terror in italy was the so-called pentiti , or justice collaborators .
it offered leading heads of the movement a milder sentence if they cooperated with the state . " this led to the breakup of the red brigades in 1982 , " tophoven said .
over 200 activists received sentences at the time - 85 of them for life . in the meantime , however , many have been released from prison or were granted day release .
in 1998 , when founder renato curcio was released after 24 years in prison , the discussion in italy was nowhere near as heated as in germany .
a german court ruled on monday that former raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt will be released on parole next month .
this has sparked a sharp debate across the country . public opinion in france forced government action in france in the 1980s , the government and president francois mitterrand initially reacted relatively reserved to action directe .
as opposed to germany , they did n't consider the state order directly endangered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joëlle aubron from action directe died of cancer in 2006 but with the action directe commando 's first casualties , public opinion changed .
the major left-wing liberal newspapers , such as le monde and libération condemned action directe .
the publications criticized the lacking reference to the working class , in whose name the group operated . the french government took a tougher stance after the murders of general rene audran in 1985 and renault director georges besse in 1986 .
one year later , the founders of the group , jean-marc rouillan , nathalie ménigon and georges cipriani were arrested and action directe fell apart . in 2006 , the three prisoners requested release on parole after serving the minimum time of 18 years .
but authorities denied the request due to their lack of remorse . raf dissolved itself following the successes in italy , the witness leniency program was introduced in germany , too .
but the raf dissolved itself .
in a letter in 1992 , it declared its fight as useless and the raf experiment as failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack on federal prosecutor siegfried buback left three dead following the decision to release mohnhaupt on parole , three raf members remain in prison : christian klar , eva sybille haule and birgit hogefeld .
their prison sentences could also be changed into a suspended sentence after 2009 . " in all three countries , the social revolutionary experiments drenched in violence and terrorist attacks failed , " tophoven said .
the virtually worldwide collapse of real socialism ultimately contributed , too . " the story of the anti-imperialist european front is a story of failure , " tophoven said . ina rottscheidt -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de release of former militant sparks mixed feelings in germany most german political parties consider the release of the one-time terrorist and red army faction leader brigitte mohnhaupt as a sign of justice .

over 400 deaths are attributed to the red brigades . the climax of red brigades terror occurred in 1978 , when the group kidnapped former prime minister aldo moros and subsequently murdered him .
the period belonged to the most dramatic days that italy experienced since the end of the second world war . today , a small plaque on house number 9 in the via caetani in rome 's city center commemorates the moros murder .
on may 9 , 1978 , his body was found here , in the trunk of a parked car . groups had the same goals , but no cooperation left-wing extremists such as the brigate rosse in italy also existed in germany and france in the 1970s .
all groups wanted to build up an " anti-imperial european front , " said rolf tophoven , director of the institute for terrorism research and security policy in essen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf tophoven is a leading german terrorism expert germany 's red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , the red brigades and action directe in france had a social revolutionary approach in common . " they were against the state , against exploitation and for the interests of the working class , " tophoven said .
" they were aiming for the revolutionary reorganization of society according to a marxist-leninist ideal . " the instrument they chose to meet this goal was violence , and the targets were mainly leading politicians and top managers from the business world .
but the groups never got further than an ideological linking . cross-border cooperation , such as that practiced by islamic terrorist groups today , never existed . justice collaborators helped break up the red brigades the red brigades had dreamt of a communist order in italy .
the result , though , was a climate of uncertainty and violence caused by numerous assaults and kidnappings .
the break came after the moros murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldo moro spent 55 days in the red brigades ' hands before he was killed " this event shocked all of italy , " tophoven said .
" for the first time , a wide front spanning across all political parties formed against the terror from the left . " the decisive aspect of the fight against terror in italy was the so-called pentiti , or justice collaborators .
it offered leading heads of the movement a milder sentence if they cooperated with the state . " this led to the breakup of the red brigades in 1982 , " tophoven said .
over 200 activists received sentences at the time - 85 of them for life . in the meantime , however , many have been released from prison or were granted day release .
in 1998 , when founder renato curcio was released after 24 years in prison , the discussion in italy was nowhere near as heated as in germany .
a german court ruled on monday that former raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt will be released on parole next month .
this has sparked a sharp debate across the country . public opinion in france forced government action in france in the 1980s , the government and president francois mitterrand initially reacted relatively reserved to action directe .
as opposed to germany , they did n't consider the state order directly endangered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joëlle aubron from action directe died of cancer in 2006 but with the action directe commando 's first casualties , public opinion changed .
the major left-wing liberal newspapers , such as le monde and libération condemned action directe .
the publications criticized the lacking reference to the working class , in whose name the group operated . the french government took a tougher stance after the murders of general rene audran in 1985 and renault director georges besse in 1986 .
one year later , the founders of the group , jean-marc rouillan , nathalie ménigon and georges cipriani were arrested and action directe fell apart . in 2006 , the three prisoners requested release on parole after serving the minimum time of 18 years .
but authorities denied the request due to their lack of remorse . raf dissolved itself following the successes in italy , the witness leniency program was introduced in germany , too .
but the raf dissolved itself .
in a letter in 1992 , it declared its fight as useless and the raf experiment as failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack on federal prosecutor siegfried buback left three dead following the decision to release mohnhaupt on parole , three raf members remain in prison : christian klar , eva sybille haule and birgit hogefeld .
their prison sentences could also be changed into a suspended sentence after 2009 . " in all three countries , the social revolutionary experiments drenched in violence and terrorist attacks failed , " tophoven said .
the virtually worldwide collapse of real socialism ultimately contributed , too . " the story of the anti-imperialist european front is a story of failure , " tophoven said . ina rottscheidt -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de release of former militant sparks mixed feelings in germany most german political parties consider the release of the one-time terrorist and red army faction leader brigitte mohnhaupt as a sign of justice .
but conservative leaders and the victims ' families are more critical .

" the german government has kept a tight lid on information regarding the missing citizens . but foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on monday did not exclude the possibility of a " violent kidnapping . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has a tough job on his hands meanwhile , anonymous intelligence sources have confirmed to the web site of germany 's der spiegel news magazine that the wife of a baghdad-based iraqi man and her son , a technician at the iraqi foreign ministry , were kidnapped by iraqi gunmen last week . it is unclear whether the kidnappers are politically motivated or simply interested in a ransom payment .
according to initial media reports , the kidnappers contacted the young man 's sister in berlin , who then alerted german authorities .
but officials have since interrogated the woman , and subsequent reports could not confirm that the kidnappers had contacted her . key iraqi mediator also kidnapped this is germany 's third hostage crisis since the start of the iraq war in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was kidnapped in iraq in 2005 at the end of 2005 , bavarian archaeologist susanne osthoff and her driver were taken hostage .
the german government eventually secured their release , allegedly after paying a hefty ransom .
in january 2006 , iraqi gunmen abducted two technicians , rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke .
the pair was also freed unharmed . in all three cases , the head of the baghdad-based german-iraqi club , dr. abdulhalim al-hijjaj helped the german government mediate their release .
al-hijjaj speaks fluent german and is connected with local tribal leaders in the so-called sunni triangle just north of baghdad . the german foreign ministry rewarded the man for his assistance with two tickets to a soccer world cup game in stuttgart .
but the iraqi mediator never saw germany beat portugal 3-1 .
seven days prior to the game , al-hijjaj himself was snatched up off the street by two gunmen . the kidnappers had allegedly learned of his mediation efforts for the german government , and assumed he had been richly rewarded .
the german government could not help al-hijjaj , and he was only freed on july 7 after his wife had emptied the family bank account and paid a ransom of 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 197,115 -rrb- .
the couple then fled to jordan , where they now live an impoverished life , according to media reports . no help for the helper al-hijjaj 's plight has prompted calls from some in germany to help the man who played a valuable role in securing the release of former german nationals taken hostage in iraq . peter bienert , the head of the leipzig-based firm cryotec , where former hostages bräunlich and nitzschke are employed , told german news agency dpa " the man -lrb- al-hijjaj -rrb- has been abandoned . "
bienert has reportedly collected several thousand euros in donations for al-hijjaj . meanwhile , opposition leaders in the german parliament have called on the government to offer him some assistance .
the foreign ministry and the chancellery claim there is no room in the budget for this . but werner hoyer , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp said financing was not a problem . " of course something can be done there , " he said .
" to simply pretend there is no leeway in the budget is nonsense . " indeed , german foreign ministers have discretionary funds at their disposal for emergencies .
but cdu parliamentarian siegfried kauder said the foreign ministry is reluctant to tap into these funds .
that sort of " non-bureaucratic assistance would create a precedent " for future kidnappers , he said . kauder recommended hijjaj contact the white ring , a relief organization for victims of violence .

these teutonic people are best known for their seriousness and hard work , not though for their happy disposition . but a new study presented this week showed that more than two-thirds of germans tend to be happy .
there is a hitch , though .
of those surveyed , 84 percent said they especially experienced happy moments when they were in love or on vacation .

that would make anyone happy . the polling institute allensbach surveyed over 1,700 men and women between the ages of 16 and 69 for the magazine emotion .
it found that mostly women , young people or the better educated are most happy . but if a gloomy day comes along , over half of germans will pep up their spirits by listening to music , seeing their partner or meeting up with friends . it also appears that germans believe the old saying that every man is the architect of his own fortune .

horx said an increasing number of germans were breaking out of the typical pessimistic way of thinking and trying to work on their happiness .
but too many germans were still too passive and place too much emphasis on security in order to believe in self-made happiness , horx said . " overcoming fear is not our thing , " horx said .

the state even went beyond german demands at the time . belgium actively helped the occupying german forces round up and deport the country 's jewish population during the second world war , according to historians from the center for historical research and documentation on war and contemporary society -lrb- ceges -rrb- in brussels . " the belgian state adopted a docile and cooperative attitude in some very diverse , but crucial domains providing collaboration unworthy of a democracy , with a policy that was disastrous for belgian and foreign jews , " the historians said . the report " docile belgium , " commissioned by the belgian parliament , said the state collaborated with the nazis for " economic , as well as ideological and legal-administrative " reasons .
it is the first time belgium 's cooperation with the nazis has been presented in such detail . project leader rudi van doorslaer said " a xenophobic and sometimes anti-semitic culture of the ruling elite " in the 1930s had prepared belgium psychologically for the persecution of the jews .
the " democratic deficit " in the years from 1930 to 1940 had also played a role , doorslaer said . " the step from passive to active collaboration was quickly taken , " doorslaer said as he read the report 's conclusions to the parliament on tuesday . government in exile authorized cooperation with the nazis doorslaer said the country had closed its doors to jews fleeing germany after hitler came to power in 1933 .
according to the ceges study , the deportations began shortly after may 10 , 1940 , when german annexed predominantly german-speaking cantons in eastern belgium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of belgian jews were killed in the auschwitz concentration camp following the nazi invasion in 1940 , the belgian government fled to britain .
but the report found that the government in exile in london during the war " never let it be known that policies had to be adapted and that the behavior of leading civil servants and magistrates was unconstitutional and democratically reprehensible . " however , belgian authorities were not aware in summer 1942 that jews deported to poland were being exterminated , the report said . some 50,000 jews lived in belgium in the 1930s .

his spokesman said that verhofstadt felt the ceges findings should be incorporated into history textbooks . the historians worked out the details of three major phases relating to the persecution of belgian jews .
in october and november 1940 , the central government followed the nazis ' request to require all jews to register with their local authorities . in the summer of 1942 , when the nazi regime began massively deporting belgians of jewish origin , collaboration started diminishing .
brussels refused to make jews wear yellow stars , which the nazis prescribed in order to identify them more easily .
the police in antwerp , on the other hand , arbitrarily arrested 1,243 jews and handed them over to the germans . after the end of the war , belgian military judicial authorities decided that investigating the deportation of the jewish people was too " delicate " to be allowed to continue . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film on wiesenthal 's legacy opens at berlinale a documentary about the life of famous nazi hunter simon wiesenthal has premiered at the berlin international film festival .

the state even went beyond german demands at the time . belgium actively helped the occupying german forces round up and deport the country 's jewish population during the second world war , according to historians from the center for historical research and documentation on war and contemporary society -lrb- ceges -rrb- in brussels . " the belgian state adopted a docile and cooperative attitude in some very diverse , but crucial domains providing collaboration unworthy of a democracy , with a policy that was disastrous for belgian and foreign jews , " the historians said . the report " docile belgium , " commissioned by the belgian parliament , said the state collaborated with the nazis for " economic , as well as ideological and legal-administrative " reasons .
it is the first time belgium 's cooperation with the nazis has been presented in such detail . project leader rudi van doorslaer said " a xenophobic and sometimes anti-semitic culture of the ruling elite " in the 1930s had prepared belgium psychologically for the persecution of the jews .
the " democratic deficit " in the years from 1930 to 1940 had also played a role , doorslaer said . " the step from passive to active collaboration was quickly taken , " doorslaer said as he read the report 's conclusions to the parliament on tuesday . government in exile authorized cooperation with the nazis doorslaer said the country had closed its doors to jews fleeing germany after hitler came to power in 1933 .
according to the ceges study , the deportations began shortly after may 10 , 1940 , when german annexed predominantly german-speaking cantons in eastern belgium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of belgian jews were killed in the auschwitz concentration camp following the nazi invasion in 1940 , the belgian government fled to britain .
but the report found that the government in exile in london during the war " never let it be known that policies had to be adapted and that the behavior of leading civil servants and magistrates was unconstitutional and democratically reprehensible . " however , belgian authorities were not aware in summer 1942 that jews deported to poland were being exterminated , the report said . some 50,000 jews lived in belgium in the 1930s .

" this report is fundamental and it is a victory for enlightened democracy , " said philippe markiewicz , head of the coordination committee of belgian jewish organizations . markiewicz said despite the negative impact of the report , there were many belgians who risked their lives to save jews . findings should go into the history books the ceges historians spent three years researching and writing the 1,114-page study and were able to view documents previously unused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis forced the jewish population to wear the yellow star of david prime minister guy verhofstadt apologized already to the jewish community in 2002 for belgium 's role in the holocaust .
his spokesman said that verhofstadt felt the ceges findings should be incorporated into history textbooks . the historians worked out the details of three major phases relating to the persecution of belgian jews .
in october and november 1940 , the central government followed the nazis ' request to require all jews to register with their local authorities . in the summer of 1942 , when the nazi regime began massively deporting belgians of jewish origin , collaboration started diminishing .
brussels refused to make jews wear yellow stars , which the nazis prescribed in order to identify them more easily .
the police in antwerp , on the other hand , arbitrarily arrested 1,243 jews and handed them over to the germans . after the end of the war , belgian military judicial authorities decided that investigating the deportation of the jewish people was too " delicate " to be allowed to continue . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film on wiesenthal 's legacy opens at berlinale a documentary about the life of famous nazi hunter simon wiesenthal has premiered at the berlin international film festival .

" the german government has kept a tight lid on information regarding the missing citizens . but foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on monday did not exclude the possibility of a " violent kidnapping . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has a tough job on his hands meanwhile , anonymous intelligence sources have confirmed to the web site of germany 's der spiegel news magazine that the wife of a baghdad-based iraqi man and her son , a technician at the iraqi foreign ministry , were kidnapped by iraqi gunmen last week . it is unclear whether the kidnappers are politically motivated or simply interested in a ransom payment .
according to initial media reports , the kidnappers contacted the young man 's sister in berlin , who then alerted german authorities .
but officials have since interrogated the woman , and subsequent reports could not confirm that the kidnappers had contacted her . key iraqi mediator also kidnapped this is germany 's third hostage crisis since the start of the iraq war in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was kidnapped in iraq in 2005 at the end of 2005 , bavarian archaeologist susanne osthoff and her driver were taken hostage .
the german government eventually secured their release , allegedly after paying a hefty ransom .
in january 2006 , iraqi gunmen abducted two technicians , rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke .
the pair was also freed unharmed . in all three cases , the head of the baghdad-based german-iraqi club , dr. abdulhalim al-hijjaj helped the german government mediate their release .
al-hijjaj speaks fluent german and is connected with local tribal leaders in the so-called sunni triangle just north of baghdad . the german foreign ministry rewarded the man for his assistance with two tickets to a soccer world cup game in stuttgart .
but the iraqi mediator never saw germany beat portugal 3-1 .
seven days prior to the game , al-hijjaj himself was snatched up off the street by two gunmen . the kidnappers had allegedly learned of his mediation efforts for the german government , and assumed he had been richly rewarded .
the german government could not help al-hijjaj , and he was only freed on july 7 after his wife had emptied the family bank account and paid a ransom of 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 197,115 -rrb- .
the couple then fled to jordan , where they now live an impoverished life , according to media reports . no help for the helper al-hijjaj 's plight has prompted calls from some in germany to help the man who played a valuable role in securing the release of former german nationals taken hostage in iraq . peter bienert , the head of the leipzig-based firm cryotec , where former hostages bräunlich and nitzschke are employed , told german news agency dpa " the man -lrb- al-hijjaj -rrb- has been abandoned . "
bienert has reportedly collected several thousand euros in donations for al-hijjaj . meanwhile , opposition leaders in the german parliament have called on the government to offer him some assistance .
the foreign ministry and the chancellery claim there is no room in the budget for this . but werner hoyer , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp said financing was not a problem . " of course something can be done there , " he said .
" to simply pretend there is no leeway in the budget is nonsense . " indeed , german foreign ministers have discretionary funds at their disposal for emergencies .
but cdu parliamentarian siegfried kauder said the foreign ministry is reluctant to tap into these funds .
that sort of " non-bureaucratic assistance would create a precedent " for future kidnappers , he said . kauder recommended hijjaj contact the white ring , a relief organization for victims of violence .

" the german government has kept a tight lid on information regarding the missing citizens . but foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on monday did not exclude the possibility of a " violent kidnapping . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has a tough job on his hands meanwhile , anonymous intelligence sources have confirmed to the web site of germany 's der spiegel news magazine that the wife of a baghdad-based iraqi man and her son , a technician at the iraqi foreign ministry , were kidnapped by iraqi gunmen last week . it is unclear whether the kidnappers are politically motivated or simply interested in a ransom payment .
according to initial media reports , the kidnappers contacted the young man 's sister in berlin , who then alerted german authorities .
but officials have since interrogated the woman , and subsequent reports could not confirm that the kidnappers had contacted her . key iraqi mediator also kidnapped this is germany 's third hostage crisis since the start of the iraq war in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was kidnapped in iraq in 2005 at the end of 2005 , bavarian archaeologist susanne osthoff and her driver were taken hostage .
the german government eventually secured their release , allegedly after paying a hefty ransom .
in january 2006 , iraqi gunmen abducted two technicians , rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke .
the pair was also freed unharmed . in all three cases , the head of the baghdad-based german-iraqi club , dr. abdulhalim al-hijjaj helped the german government mediate their release .
al-hijjaj speaks fluent german and is connected with local tribal leaders in the so-called sunni triangle just north of baghdad . the german foreign ministry rewarded the man for his assistance with two tickets to a soccer world cup game in stuttgart .
but the iraqi mediator never saw germany beat portugal 3-1 .
seven days prior to the game , al-hijjaj himself was snatched up off the street by two gunmen . the kidnappers had allegedly learned of his mediation efforts for the german government , and assumed he had been richly rewarded .
the german government could not help al-hijjaj , and he was only freed on july 7 after his wife had emptied the family bank account and paid a ransom of 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 197,115 -rrb- .
the couple then fled to jordan , where they now live an impoverished life , according to media reports . no help for the helper al-hijjaj 's plight has prompted calls from some in germany to help the man who played a valuable role in securing the release of former german nationals taken hostage in iraq . peter bienert , the head of the leipzig-based firm cryotec , where former hostages bräunlich and nitzschke are employed , told german news agency dpa " the man -lrb- al-hijjaj -rrb- has been abandoned . "
bienert has reportedly collected several thousand euros in donations for al-hijjaj . meanwhile , opposition leaders in the german parliament have called on the government to offer him some assistance .
the foreign ministry and the chancellery claim there is no room in the budget for this . but werner hoyer , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp said financing was not a problem . " of course something can be done there , " he said .
" to simply pretend there is no leeway in the budget is nonsense . " indeed , german foreign ministers have discretionary funds at their disposal for emergencies .
but cdu parliamentarian siegfried kauder said the foreign ministry is reluctant to tap into these funds .
that sort of " non-bureaucratic assistance would create a precedent " for future kidnappers , he said . kauder recommended hijjaj contact the white ring , a relief organization for victims of violence . " he has to be the victim of a violent crime , and he has to be in financial need , " said kauder , who is a member of the organization 's board of directors . " then we can offer non-bureaucratic help - also to foreigners .

these teutonic people are best known for their seriousness and hard work , not though for their happy disposition . but a new study presented this week showed that more than two-thirds of germans tend to be happy .
there is a hitch , though .
of those surveyed , 84 percent said they especially experienced happy moments when they were in love or on vacation .
while the love aspect may have to be left up to fate , it 's certainly a good thing that german employees have an average of six weeks paid annual vacation .
that would make anyone happy . the polling institute allensbach surveyed over 1,700 men and women between the ages of 16 and 69 for the magazine emotion .
it found that mostly women , young people or the better educated are most happy . but if a gloomy day comes along , over half of germans will pep up their spirits by listening to music , seeing their partner or meeting up with friends . it also appears that germans believe the old saying that every man is the architect of his own fortune .
almost two-thirds of those surveyed said they believed they could in part influence their own happiness . sex and money will not make you happy anyone who thinks sex is the key to happiness is just high on oxytocin .

horx said an increasing number of germans were breaking out of the typical pessimistic way of thinking and trying to work on their happiness .
but too many germans were still too passive and place too much emphasis on security in order to believe in self-made happiness , horx said . " overcoming fear is not our thing , " horx said .

britain got a failing grade , coming in dead last while northern europe came out on top . a unicef study that compared the situation of children in 21 industrialized nations put german children squarely in the middle of the list , at 11th place . the report by the united nations children 's advocacy agency compared six markers , including material wealth , health , education , relationship to parents and peers , behaviors and risks , as well as the children 's own assessment of their situation , to determine the rankings . typical of poor scoring nations were children who did not trust their friends , rarely spent time with parents , and overate .
poverty among minorities and a lack of books in homes also dragged down scores . northern europe scores high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kinder beim essen top marks went mostly to northern european countries .
the netherlands garnered first place , followed by sweden , denmark , finland , spain and switzerland .
france took 16th place , while the uk landed a miserable 21st slot . the honorary chairwoman of german unicef , heide simonis , called germany 's middle-of-the-pack showing " unsatisfying . "
she told bavarian state radio the country needs more full-day schools and more childcare for very young children .
in addition , she said , politicians have to take the problems of youth more seriously . german family minster ursula von der leyen this week proposed spending 3 million -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- euros more on expanding childcare in germany , a plan that has received approval from political leaders though the proposal still lacks a funding plan . germany scored poorly on its schools , which mostly operate in the morning only , and its lack of success helping immigrant children . regional disparities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians have called for more childcare centers simonis noted that the german education system suffers under severe regional disparities as some states offer a better education than others . simonis also noted that germany scored poorly when it came to cigarette and alcohol use .

britain got a failing grade , coming in dead last while northern europe came out on top . a unicef study that compared the situation of children in 21 industrialized nations put german children squarely in the middle of the list , at 11th place . the report by the united nations children 's advocacy agency compared six markers , including material wealth , health , education , relationship to parents and peers , behaviors and risks , as well as the children 's own assessment of their situation , to determine the rankings . typical of poor scoring nations were children who did not trust their friends , rarely spent time with parents , and overate .
poverty among minorities and a lack of books in homes also dragged down scores . northern europe scores high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kinder beim essen top marks went mostly to northern european countries .
the netherlands garnered first place , followed by sweden , denmark , finland , spain and switzerland .
france took 16th place , while the uk landed a miserable 21st slot . the honorary chairwoman of german unicef , heide simonis , called germany 's middle-of-the-pack showing " unsatisfying . "
she told bavarian state radio the country needs more full-day schools and more childcare for very young children .
in addition , she said , politicians have to take the problems of youth more seriously . german family minster ursula von der leyen this week proposed spending 3 million -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- euros more on expanding childcare in germany , a plan that has received approval from political leaders though the proposal still lacks a funding plan . germany scored poorly on its schools , which mostly operate in the morning only , and its lack of success helping immigrant children . regional disparities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians have called for more childcare centers simonis noted that the german education system suffers under severe regional disparities as some states offer a better education than others . simonis also noted that germany scored poorly when it came to cigarette and alcohol use .
the country - the last bastion for smokers in europe - has more teen smokers under the age of 15 than in any other . " germans share with the british the dubious honor of having the children and teenagers who drink alcohol most often , " she added . moreover , the study showed nearly 40 percent of surveyed german children said their parents " never really talk " to them . germans less aggressive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , with britain , reported the most underage drinking simonis stressed that there were some positive results , too .
for example , german children and teens were relatively less aggressive than in other countries . the caritas aid organization told news agencies that the study clearly showed that the lack of a reliable living environment can be a serious detriment to the development of children in german society , especially for less-educated and immigrant families . there was also dismay over the results in britain , with commentators saying the low ratings for personal relationships were evidence of a dog-eat-dog society where too many children hang around on the streets . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we ca n't afford to leave kids by the wayside " the german parliament 's commission for children 's concerns this week discussed including children 's rights in the constitution .
in light of recent cases of deaths due to neglect , it 's becoming a pressing issue .

but a change in format has made the uefa cup harder .
it 's a trophy teams want to win . if you believe what you hear , you could be fooled into thinking that there is only one big european fixture on the horizon for germany 's teams in the next week . with their domestic league form mixed at best , bayern munich 's season hinges on their champions league clash against real madrid on feb .
20 .
it is undoubtedly a huge game ; if bayern lose the tie over two legs , they will have to resign themselves to a season without silverware . but the bavarian giants are not the only german team still in the hunt for european honors .
bayer leverkusen and werder bremen take on difficult opposition on wednesday night in the first knock-out round of the uefa cup .
leverkusen take on english premiership side blackburn rovers while werder have a tricky tie against ajax amsterdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uefa cup -lrb- r . -rrb- with its more prestigious relative despite its reputation as the champions league 's poorer relation , the uefa cup is still a hard fought and extremely difficult competition to win .
after format changes in the 2004/05 season that introduced a league round and the inclusion of those third-placed champions league sides that missed out on qualification , the uefa cup now has more games and now features tougher teams . german clubs go for first win in a decade it has been exactly ten years since a german team last won the trophy - schalke 04 beating inter milan on penalties in the 1996/07 final - and the list of winners since shows that the uefa cup is hardly a competition for minnows . leverkusen and bremen both hope to mark the anniversary by bringing the cup back to germany for the first time in a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen entered the uefa cup after losing to barca for werder , the uefa cup may at first seem like an anti-climax .
thrust into undoubtedly the hardest group stage of this season 's champions league , thomas schaaf 's side cruelly missed out on an historic qualification from group a by one point after beating english champions chelsea at the weserstadion and holding the current european champions barcelona to a draw . werder dropped into the uefa cup at the start of the knock-out stages and instantly became one of the favorites to win the trophy on the back of their bundesliga form and improving european credentials .
however , if bremen thought they were in for an easy time , the draw had them thinking again . bremen face dutch masters in sticky knock-out tie ajax amsterdam have four european cups to their name , one uefa cup , 29 dutch championship titles and are currently second in the dutch league .
a club which did much to introduce the concept of total football to the world , a fluid system which allows the outfield players the freedom to swap positions , ajax will prove to be a real test for bremen . while not exactly a team known for a lack of confidence , two successive defeats in the bundesliga have put werder six points behind leaders schalke 04 and have knocked them out of their free-scoring rhythm .
" we 'll have to see whether this latest defeat gives us the spur we need - or not , " bremen 's germany striker miroslav klose said tuesday . bildunterschrift : ajax players prepare for wednesday 's clash in bremen ajax , whose dutch title hopes have been re-ignited by closest rivals psv eindhoven 's poor run , have defensive worries with injuries ruling out defenders urby emanuelson , zdenek grygera and thomas vermaelen . recently re-signed amsterdam legend edgar davids is cup-tied for the remainder of the competition after featuring for former club tottenham hotspur in the group stage . for bayer leverkusen , the uefa cup offers a glamorous respite from the rigors of their mediocre bundesliga campaign .
however , things will have to pick up for michael skibbe 's team if they are to carry on enjoying its distractions . unconvincing leverkusen meet battling blackburn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benni mccarthy -lrb- center -rrb- has blackburn dreaming currently lying seventh in the league , bayer have had a mixed season domestically and have also struggled to maintain any consistency in europe .
leverkusen limped out of group b in third place with just four points and will meet group e winners blackburn , a team that only dropped two points in qualifying . blackburn are also enduring a less than exemplary season in the premiership but have definitely reserved their best performances for the uefa cup , fired by pre-season signing benni mccarthy , a uefa cup winner with fc porto in 2003 . rovers play a robust game as one would expect from a team managed by the combative mark hughes , a former bayern munich player .
leverkusen 's progress is far from assured . injuries plague both sides ahead of clash things have been made worse by injuries to defenders juan and roque junior and coach skibbe may also have to do without captain carsten ramelow .
the influential midfielder made his comeback from a knee operation in saturday 's 2-2 draw against eintracht frankfurt but he is still far from fully match fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten ramelow , left , may not be risked against blackburn " the comeback was way too soon but i needed him , " said skibbe , who will have to think hard before asking ramelow to play a second game in five days . blackburn hope midfielder david dunn will have recovered from a dead leg in time for the leverkusen match after picking up the injury at the weekend .

but a change in format has made the uefa cup harder .
it 's a trophy teams want to win . if you believe what you hear , you could be fooled into thinking that there is only one big european fixture on the horizon for germany 's teams in the next week . with their domestic league form mixed at best , bayern munich 's season hinges on their champions league clash against real madrid on feb .

it is undoubtedly a huge game ; if bayern lose the tie over two legs , they will have to resign themselves to a season without silverware . but the bavarian giants are not the only german team still in the hunt for european honors .
bayer leverkusen and werder bremen take on difficult opposition on wednesday night in the first knock-out round of the uefa cup .
leverkusen take on english premiership side blackburn rovers while werder have a tricky tie against ajax amsterdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uefa cup -lrb- r . -rrb- with its more prestigious relative despite its reputation as the champions league 's poorer relation , the uefa cup is still a hard fought and extremely difficult competition to win .
after format changes in the 2004/05 season that introduced a league round and the inclusion of those third-placed champions league sides that missed out on qualification , the uefa cup now has more games and now features tougher teams . german clubs go for first win in a decade it has been exactly ten years since a german team last won the trophy - schalke 04 beating inter milan on penalties in the 1996/07 final - and the list of winners since shows that the uefa cup is hardly a competition for minnows . leverkusen and bremen both hope to mark the anniversary by bringing the cup back to germany for the first time in a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen entered the uefa cup after losing to barca for werder , the uefa cup may at first seem like an anti-climax .
thrust into undoubtedly the hardest group stage of this season 's champions league , thomas schaaf 's side cruelly missed out on an historic qualification from group a by one point after beating english champions chelsea at the weserstadion and holding the current european champions barcelona to a draw . werder dropped into the uefa cup at the start of the knock-out stages and instantly became one of the favorites to win the trophy on the back of their bundesliga form and improving european credentials .
however , if bremen thought they were in for an easy time , the draw had them thinking again . bremen face dutch masters in sticky knock-out tie ajax amsterdam have four european cups to their name , one uefa cup , 29 dutch championship titles and are currently second in the dutch league .
a club which did much to introduce the concept of total football to the world , a fluid system which allows the outfield players the freedom to swap positions , ajax will prove to be a real test for bremen . while not exactly a team known for a lack of confidence , two successive defeats in the bundesliga have put werder six points behind leaders schalke 04 and have knocked them out of their free-scoring rhythm .
" we 'll have to see whether this latest defeat gives us the spur we need - or not , " bremen 's germany striker miroslav klose said tuesday . bildunterschrift : ajax players prepare for wednesday 's clash in bremen ajax , whose dutch title hopes have been re-ignited by closest rivals psv eindhoven 's poor run , have defensive worries with injuries ruling out defenders urby emanuelson , zdenek grygera and thomas vermaelen . recently re-signed amsterdam legend edgar davids is cup-tied for the remainder of the competition after featuring for former club tottenham hotspur in the group stage . for bayer leverkusen , the uefa cup offers a glamorous respite from the rigors of their mediocre bundesliga campaign .

leverkusen limped out of group b in third place with just four points and will meet group e winners blackburn , a team that only dropped two points in qualifying . blackburn are also enduring a less than exemplary season in the premiership but have definitely reserved their best performances for the uefa cup , fired by pre-season signing benni mccarthy , a uefa cup winner with fc porto in 2003 . rovers play a robust game as one would expect from a team managed by the combative mark hughes , a former bayern munich player .
leverkusen 's progress is far from assured . injuries plague both sides ahead of clash things have been made worse by injuries to defenders juan and roque junior and coach skibbe may also have to do without captain carsten ramelow .
the influential midfielder made his comeback from a knee operation in saturday 's 2-2 draw against eintracht frankfurt but he is still far from fully match fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten ramelow , left , may not be risked against blackburn " the comeback was way too soon but i needed him , " said skibbe , who will have to think hard before asking ramelow to play a second game in five days . blackburn hope midfielder david dunn will have recovered from a dead leg in time for the leverkusen match after picking up the injury at the weekend .

" the german government has kept a tight lid on information regarding the missing citizens . but foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on monday did not exclude the possibility of a " violent kidnapping . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has a tough job on his hands meanwhile , anonymous intelligence sources have confirmed to the web site of germany 's der spiegel news magazine that the wife of a baghdad-based iraqi man and her son , a technician at the iraqi foreign ministry , were kidnapped by iraqi gunmen last week . it is unclear whether the kidnappers are politically motivated or simply interested in a ransom payment .
according to initial media reports , the kidnappers contacted the young man 's sister in berlin , who then alerted german authorities .
but officials have since interrogated the woman , and subsequent reports could not confirm that the kidnappers had contacted her . key iraqi mediator also kidnapped this is germany 's third hostage crisis since the start of the iraq war in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was kidnapped in iraq in 2005 at the end of 2005 , bavarian archaeologist susanne osthoff and her driver were taken hostage .
the german government eventually secured their release , allegedly after paying a hefty ransom .
in january 2006 , iraqi gunmen abducted two technicians , rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke .
the pair was also freed unharmed . in all three cases , the head of the baghdad-based german-iraqi club , dr. abdulhalim al-hijjaj helped the german government mediate their release .
al-hijjaj speaks fluent german and is connected with local tribal leaders in the so-called sunni triangle just north of baghdad . the german foreign ministry rewarded the man for his assistance with two tickets to a soccer world cup game in stuttgart .
but the iraqi mediator never saw germany beat portugal 3-1 .
seven days prior to the game , al-hijjaj himself was snatched up off the street by two gunmen . the kidnappers had allegedly learned of his mediation efforts for the german government , and assumed he had been richly rewarded .
the german government could not help al-hijjaj , and he was only freed on july 7 after his wife had emptied the family bank account and paid a ransom of 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 197,115 -rrb- .
the couple then fled to jordan , where they now live an impoverished life , according to media reports . no help for the helper al-hijjaj 's plight has prompted calls from some in germany to help the man who played a valuable role in securing the release of former german nationals taken hostage in iraq . peter bienert , the head of the leipzig-based firm cryotec , where former hostages bräunlich and nitzschke are employed , told german news agency dpa " the man -lrb- al-hijjaj -rrb- has been abandoned . "
bienert has reportedly collected several thousand euros in donations for al-hijjaj . meanwhile , opposition leaders in the german parliament have called on the government to offer him some assistance .
the foreign ministry and the chancellery claim there is no room in the budget for this . but werner hoyer , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp said financing was not a problem . " of course something can be done there , " he said .
" to simply pretend there is no leeway in the budget is nonsense . " indeed , german foreign ministers have discretionary funds at their disposal for emergencies .
but cdu parliamentarian siegfried kauder said the foreign ministry is reluctant to tap into these funds .
that sort of " non-bureaucratic assistance would create a precedent " for future kidnappers , he said . kauder recommended hijjaj contact the white ring , a relief organization for victims of violence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign relations -pipe- 14.02.2007 merkel in the ascendency as blair 's star fades großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power shift : blair needs merkel 's help to get an agreement on climate change tony blair has pursued many issues in search of a lasting positive legacy ; mideast peace , strong eu-us ties and climate change .
but as time runs out , angela merkel is the leader most likely to achieve his goals . when tony blair flew to berlin on tuesday for talks on climate change with german chancellor angela merkel , there was more to the meeting than just two international figures attempting to keep the slowly turning wheels of environmental politics going . while the british prime minister arrived in the german capital intent on capitalizing on the slight recent shift in global thinking towards tackling climate change by discussing plans with the current eu president and leader of the g8 , blair was also seizing what many observers see as his last chance to leave a positive legacy when his premiership comes to an end . blair has embarked on many missions during his 10-year tenure in downing street .
his desire to be remembered for one great success on the global stage has led him to pursue campaigns to resolve the israeli-palestinian conflict and bring peace to the middle east , to rebuild the bridges between the united states and europe , and to bring the world together in a binding international agreement on climate change . the war in iraq put paid to both blair 's influence in the middle east and his credibility as the link between europe and the us .
his visit to berlin shows , that with time running out , he has to work with the woman who has replaced him as the point person on all the major issues he held dear if he wants to go down in history as the leader who attempted to save the world from environmental disaster . merkel getting results in the middle east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel gets access and results seemingly beyond blair merkel 's more pragmatic and candid approach to the volatile situation in the middle east , as seen during her recent peacemaking tour of egypt , saudi arabia and the gulf , has so far achieved more than blair could have ever expected from his own efforts . merkel personally persuaded us president george w. bush to accept the link between iraq and a wider middle east settlement ; encouraged the americans to revive the mideast quartet negotiating forum and rallied a number of arab states behind her vision of peace . in another example where she has seemingly succeeded where blair failed , merkel has kept germany free from washington 's apron strings in pursuing dialogue with iran and syria , and a two-state solution of the arab-israeli conflict while maintaining good relations with the white house . meanwhile blair is left to privately rue his decision to join the us in the war against iraq while germany takes the initiative in pushing for a resolution in the middle east , according to mark halsey , author of the book " blair 's legacy . " " iraq pretty much killed his dream of securing peace in the middle east , " halsey said .
" his attempts to save his tarnished reputation in the region by pressing for movement on the arab-israeli peace process also failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has found bush to be a fickle bed-fellow " he was defeated by washington 's pro-israeli neoconservatives , who believe israel should be free to settle its conflict with the palestinians , syria and hezbollah in lebanon on its own terms , " halsey added .
" that ended any real hope of blair leading the way in any peace process , or the americans letting him take the lead . " while germany 's nazi past will never allow it to put serious pressure on israel , merkel has maintained a level of independence in her dealing in the middle east , which has to some extent met with us acceptance and support . a challenging trans-atlantic relationship after the obvious divisions between the us and much of europe over the iraq war , the bush administration expressed relief after germany 's 2005 election when it found a leader it could be civil with after bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , descended into icy silence after the war began . even as us-german relations are back to normal on the surface after the schröder years , germany and the us do not share all the same interests , strategies and perceptions .
iraq and climate change being the clearest examples .
meanwhile , merkel 's boldest trans-atlantic initiative - an economic zone between europe and the us - has also raised little excitement in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is seen as europe 's point person by washington despite the differences , it is now merkel and not blair that the americans come to talk to on the current hot topics .
us experts say the bush administration views merkel as the " anchor point " for its dealings with the eu .
while blair is seen as a lame duck premier who has served his purpose , merkel is a leader on the rise . " she 's the big player in europe right now , " kurt volker , the bush administration 's principal deputy assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs , was quoted as saying after merkel ’ s visit to washington earlier this year . marginalized blair seeks climate agreement blair is expected to stand down as prime minister this spring .
but before he does , he wants to sign off on a new environmental agreement which would bind all the main players to a set of goals on the stabilization of emissions and the establishment of a global price for carbon trading . ironically , as blair pursues his last remaining legacy option , angela merkel is the person best equipped to take the lead in the global climate debate .
as a physicist and the former environment minister who negotiated the kyoto protocol for germany in 1997 , merkel knows that the basic science of climate change is no longer in dispute .
she also knows that the scale and urgency of the challenge the world faces is worse than previously thought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is forced to watch merkel make all the decisions as well as chairing the eu spring summit in march , where leaders will make major decisions on the future of climate and energy security policies , merkel will put climate change at the top of the agenda for this year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .
she will then lead the negotiations for securing agreement on the principles of a more comprehensive deal ahead of a united nations meeting in bali later in the year . by then , blair may have played his last part on the world stage ; watching from the wings as germany 's first female chancellor makes progress on all the issues that eluded him during his time as prime minister . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , blair push for action to prevent climate change german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday after a meeting with british prime minster tony blair that she hopes to set concrete goals on climate protection at the g8 summit of the world 's richest nations in june .

but as time runs out , angela merkel is the leader most likely to achieve his goals . when tony blair flew to berlin on tuesday for talks on climate change with german chancellor angela merkel , there was more to the meeting than just two international figures attempting to keep the slowly turning wheels of environmental politics going . while the british prime minister arrived in the german capital intent on capitalizing on the slight recent shift in global thinking towards tackling climate change by discussing plans with the current eu president and leader of the g8 , blair was also seizing what many observers see as his last chance to leave a positive legacy when his premiership comes to an end . blair has embarked on many missions during his 10-year tenure in downing street .
his desire to be remembered for one great success on the global stage has led him to pursue campaigns to resolve the israeli-palestinian conflict and bring peace to the middle east , to rebuild the bridges between the united states and europe , and to bring the world together in a binding international agreement on climate change . the war in iraq put paid to both blair 's influence in the middle east and his credibility as the link between europe and the us .
his visit to berlin shows , that with time running out , he has to work with the woman who has replaced him as the point person on all the major issues he held dear if he wants to go down in history as the leader who attempted to save the world from environmental disaster . merkel getting results in the middle east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel gets access and results seemingly beyond blair merkel 's more pragmatic and candid approach to the volatile situation in the middle east , as seen during her recent peacemaking tour of egypt , saudi arabia and the gulf , has so far achieved more than blair could have ever expected from his own efforts . merkel personally persuaded us president george w. bush to accept the link between iraq and a wider middle east settlement ; encouraged the americans to revive the mideast quartet negotiating forum and rallied a number of arab states behind her vision of peace . in another example where she has seemingly succeeded where blair failed , merkel has kept germany free from washington 's apron strings in pursuing dialogue with iran and syria , and a two-state solution of the arab-israeli conflict while maintaining good relations with the white house . meanwhile blair is left to privately rue his decision to join the us in the war against iraq while germany takes the initiative in pushing for a resolution in the middle east , according to mark halsey , author of the book " blair 's legacy . " " iraq pretty much killed his dream of securing peace in the middle east , " halsey said .
" his attempts to save his tarnished reputation in the region by pressing for movement on the arab-israeli peace process also failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has found bush to be a fickle bed-fellow " he was defeated by washington 's pro-israeli neoconservatives , who believe israel should be free to settle its conflict with the palestinians , syria and hezbollah in lebanon on its own terms , " halsey added .
" that ended any real hope of blair leading the way in any peace process , or the americans letting him take the lead . " while germany 's nazi past will never allow it to put serious pressure on israel , merkel has maintained a level of independence in her dealing in the middle east , which has to some extent met with us acceptance and support . a challenging trans-atlantic relationship after the obvious divisions between the us and much of europe over the iraq war , the bush administration expressed relief after germany 's 2005 election when it found a leader it could be civil with after bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , descended into icy silence after the war began . even as us-german relations are back to normal on the surface after the schröder years , germany and the us do not share all the same interests , strategies and perceptions .
iraq and climate change being the clearest examples .
meanwhile , merkel 's boldest trans-atlantic initiative - an economic zone between europe and the us - has also raised little excitement in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is seen as europe 's point person by washington despite the differences , it is now merkel and not blair that the americans come to talk to on the current hot topics .
us experts say the bush administration views merkel as the " anchor point " for its dealings with the eu .
while blair is seen as a lame duck premier who has served his purpose , merkel is a leader on the rise . " she 's the big player in europe right now , " kurt volker , the bush administration 's principal deputy assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs , was quoted as saying after merkel ’ s visit to washington earlier this year . marginalized blair seeks climate agreement blair is expected to stand down as prime minister this spring .
but before he does , he wants to sign off on a new environmental agreement which would bind all the main players to a set of goals on the stabilization of emissions and the establishment of a global price for carbon trading . ironically , as blair pursues his last remaining legacy option , angela merkel is the person best equipped to take the lead in the global climate debate .
as a physicist and the former environment minister who negotiated the kyoto protocol for germany in 1997 , merkel knows that the basic science of climate change is no longer in dispute .
she also knows that the scale and urgency of the challenge the world faces is worse than previously thought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is forced to watch merkel make all the decisions as well as chairing the eu spring summit in march , where leaders will make major decisions on the future of climate and energy security policies , merkel will put climate change at the top of the agenda for this year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .
she will then lead the negotiations for securing agreement on the principles of a more comprehensive deal ahead of a united nations meeting in bali later in the year . by then , blair may have played his last part on the world stage ; watching from the wings as germany 's first female chancellor makes progress on all the issues that eluded him during his time as prime minister . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , blair push for action to prevent climate change german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday after a meeting with british prime minster tony blair that she hopes to set concrete goals on climate protection at the g8 summit of the world 's richest nations in june .

his desire to be remembered for one great success on the global stage has led him to pursue campaigns to resolve the israeli-palestinian conflict and bring peace to the middle east , to rebuild the bridges between the united states and europe , and to bring the world together in a binding international agreement on climate change . the war in iraq put paid to both blair 's influence in the middle east and his credibility as the link between europe and the us .
his visit to berlin shows , that with time running out , he has to work with the woman who has replaced him as the point person on all the major issues he held dear if he wants to go down in history as the leader who attempted to save the world from environmental disaster . merkel getting results in the middle east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel gets access and results seemingly beyond blair merkel 's more pragmatic and candid approach to the volatile situation in the middle east , as seen during her recent peacemaking tour of egypt , saudi arabia and the gulf , has so far achieved more than blair could have ever expected from his own efforts . merkel personally persuaded us president george w. bush to accept the link between iraq and a wider middle east settlement ; encouraged the americans to revive the mideast quartet negotiating forum and rallied a number of arab states behind her vision of peace . in another example where she has seemingly succeeded where blair failed , merkel has kept germany free from washington 's apron strings in pursuing dialogue with iran and syria , and a two-state solution of the arab-israeli conflict while maintaining good relations with the white house . meanwhile blair is left to privately rue his decision to join the us in the war against iraq while germany takes the initiative in pushing for a resolution in the middle east , according to mark halsey , author of the book " blair 's legacy . " " iraq pretty much killed his dream of securing peace in the middle east , " halsey said .
" his attempts to save his tarnished reputation in the region by pressing for movement on the arab-israeli peace process also failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has found bush to be a fickle bed-fellow " he was defeated by washington 's pro-israeli neoconservatives , who believe israel should be free to settle its conflict with the palestinians , syria and hezbollah in lebanon on its own terms , " halsey added .
" that ended any real hope of blair leading the way in any peace process , or the americans letting him take the lead . " while germany 's nazi past will never allow it to put serious pressure on israel , merkel has maintained a level of independence in her dealing in the middle east , which has to some extent met with us acceptance and support . a challenging trans-atlantic relationship after the obvious divisions between the us and much of europe over the iraq war , the bush administration expressed relief after germany 's 2005 election when it found a leader it could be civil with after bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , descended into icy silence after the war began . even as us-german relations are back to normal on the surface after the schröder years , germany and the us do not share all the same interests , strategies and perceptions .
iraq and climate change being the clearest examples .
meanwhile , merkel 's boldest trans-atlantic initiative - an economic zone between europe and the us - has also raised little excitement in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is seen as europe 's point person by washington despite the differences , it is now merkel and not blair that the americans come to talk to on the current hot topics .
us experts say the bush administration views merkel as the " anchor point " for its dealings with the eu .
while blair is seen as a lame duck premier who has served his purpose , merkel is a leader on the rise . " she 's the big player in europe right now , " kurt volker , the bush administration 's principal deputy assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs , was quoted as saying after merkel ’ s visit to washington earlier this year . marginalized blair seeks climate agreement blair is expected to stand down as prime minister this spring .
but before he does , he wants to sign off on a new environmental agreement which would bind all the main players to a set of goals on the stabilization of emissions and the establishment of a global price for carbon trading . ironically , as blair pursues his last remaining legacy option , angela merkel is the person best equipped to take the lead in the global climate debate .
as a physicist and the former environment minister who negotiated the kyoto protocol for germany in 1997 , merkel knows that the basic science of climate change is no longer in dispute .
she also knows that the scale and urgency of the challenge the world faces is worse than previously thought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is forced to watch merkel make all the decisions as well as chairing the eu spring summit in march , where leaders will make major decisions on the future of climate and energy security policies , merkel will put climate change at the top of the agenda for this year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .
she will then lead the negotiations for securing agreement on the principles of a more comprehensive deal ahead of a united nations meeting in bali later in the year . by then , blair may have played his last part on the world stage ; watching from the wings as germany 's first female chancellor makes progress on all the issues that eluded him during his time as prime minister . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , blair push for action to prevent climate change german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday after a meeting with british prime minster tony blair that she hopes to set concrete goals on climate protection at the g8 summit of the world 's richest nations in june .
germany faces daunting agenda for eu , g8 presidencies germany will fight to revive international efforts for middle east peace , relaunch the eu constitution and advocate a gentler form of globalization when it takes over the presidencies of the eu and the g8 monday .

but in the past , italy and france have also had to decide how to battle left-wing terrorists . the italian marxist-leninist terrorist group brigate rosse or red brigades officially disbanded in the 1980s , but pockets have remained , as arrests on monday showed . italian authorities took 15 people into custody .
the suspects are allegedly linked to the red brigades for planning several attacks , including one on a company owned by former premier silvio berlusconi .
they have been accused of " associating with terrorists and participating in an armed group , " the italian interior ministry said . the group , founded in 1973 , has been mainly inoperative since the end of the cold war .
but in the 1970s and 1980s , it was responsible for thousands of acts of violence .
over 400 deaths are attributed to the red brigades . the climax of red brigades terror occurred in 1978 , when the group kidnapped former prime minister aldo moros and subsequently murdered him .
the period belonged to the most dramatic days that italy experienced since the end of the second world war . today , a small plaque on house number 9 in the via caetani in rome 's city center commemorates the moros murder .
on may 9 , 1978 , his body was found here , in the trunk of a parked car . groups had the same goals , but no cooperation left-wing extremists such as the brigate rosse in italy also existed in germany and france in the 1970s .
all groups wanted to build up an " anti-imperial european front , " said rolf tophoven , director of the institute for terrorism research and security policy in essen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf tophoven is a leading german terrorism expert germany 's red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , the red brigades and action directe in france had a social revolutionary approach in common . " they were against the state , against exploitation and for the interests of the working class , " tophoven said .
" they were aiming for the revolutionary reorganization of society according to a marxist-leninist ideal . " the instrument they chose to meet this goal was violence , and the targets were mainly leading politicians and top managers from the business world .
but the groups never got further than an ideological linking . cross-border cooperation , such as that practiced by islamic terrorist groups today , never existed . justice collaborators helped break up the red brigades the red brigades had dreamt of a communist order in italy .
the result , though , was a climate of uncertainty and violence caused by numerous assaults and kidnappings .
the break came after the moros murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldo moro spent 55 days in the red brigades ' hands before he was killed " this event shocked all of italy , " tophoven said .
" for the first time , a wide front spanning across all political parties formed against the terror from the left . " the decisive aspect of the fight against terror in italy was the so-called pentiti , or justice collaborators .
it offered leading heads of the movement a milder sentence if they cooperated with the state . " this led to the breakup of the red brigades in 1982 , " tophoven said .
over 200 activists received sentences at the time - 85 of them for life . in the meantime , however , many have been released from prison or were granted day release .
in 1998 , when founder renato curcio was released after 24 years in prison , the discussion in italy was nowhere near as heated as in germany .
a german court ruled on monday that former raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt will be released on parole next month .
this has sparked a sharp debate across the country . public opinion in france forced government action in france in the 1980s , the government and president francois mitterrand initially reacted relatively reserved to action directe .
as opposed to germany , they did n't consider the state order directly endangered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joëlle aubron from action directe died of cancer in 2006 but with the action directe commando 's first casualties , public opinion changed .
the major left-wing liberal newspapers , such as le monde and libération condemned action directe .
the publications criticized the lacking reference to the working class , in whose name the group operated . the french government took a tougher stance after the murders of general rene audran in 1985 and renault director georges besse in 1986 .
one year later , the founders of the group , jean-marc rouillan , nathalie ménigon and georges cipriani were arrested and action directe fell apart . in 2006 , the three prisoners requested release on parole after serving the minimum time of 18 years .

according to initial media reports , the kidnappers contacted the young man 's sister in berlin , who then alerted german authorities .

the pair was also freed unharmed . in all three cases , the head of the baghdad-based german-iraqi club , dr. abdulhalim al-hijjaj helped the german government mediate their release .
al-hijjaj speaks fluent german and is connected with local tribal leaders in the so-called sunni triangle just north of baghdad . the german foreign ministry rewarded the man for his assistance with two tickets to a soccer world cup game in stuttgart .

seven days prior to the game , al-hijjaj himself was snatched up off the street by two gunmen . the kidnappers had allegedly learned of his mediation efforts for the german government , and assumed he had been richly rewarded .

" the german government has kept a tight lid on information regarding the missing citizens . but foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on monday did not exclude the possibility of a " violent kidnapping . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has a tough job on his hands meanwhile , anonymous intelligence sources have confirmed to the web site of germany 's der spiegel news magazine that the wife of a baghdad-based iraqi man and her son , a technician at the iraqi foreign ministry , were kidnapped by iraqi gunmen last week . it is unclear whether the kidnappers are politically motivated or simply interested in a ransom payment .
according to initial media reports , the kidnappers contacted the young man 's sister in berlin , who then alerted german authorities .
but officials have since interrogated the woman , and subsequent reports could not confirm that the kidnappers had contacted her . key iraqi mediator also kidnapped this is germany 's third hostage crisis since the start of the iraq war in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was kidnapped in iraq in 2005 at the end of 2005 , bavarian archaeologist susanne osthoff and her driver were taken hostage .
the german government eventually secured their release , allegedly after paying a hefty ransom .
in january 2006 , iraqi gunmen abducted two technicians , rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke .
the pair was also freed unharmed . in all three cases , the head of the baghdad-based german-iraqi club , dr. abdulhalim al-hijjaj helped the german government mediate their release .
al-hijjaj speaks fluent german and is connected with local tribal leaders in the so-called sunni triangle just north of baghdad . the german foreign ministry rewarded the man for his assistance with two tickets to a soccer world cup game in stuttgart .
but the iraqi mediator never saw germany beat portugal 3-1 .
seven days prior to the game , al-hijjaj himself was snatched up off the street by two gunmen . the kidnappers had allegedly learned of his mediation efforts for the german government , and assumed he had been richly rewarded .
the german government could not help al-hijjaj , and he was only freed on july 7 after his wife had emptied the family bank account and paid a ransom of 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 197,115 -rrb- .
the couple then fled to jordan , where they now live an impoverished life , according to media reports . no help for the helper al-hijjaj 's plight has prompted calls from some in germany to help the man who played a valuable role in securing the release of former german nationals taken hostage in iraq . peter bienert , the head of the leipzig-based firm cryotec , where former hostages bräunlich and nitzschke are employed , told german news agency dpa " the man -lrb- al-hijjaj -rrb- has been abandoned . "
bienert has reportedly collected several thousand euros in donations for al-hijjaj . meanwhile , opposition leaders in the german parliament have called on the government to offer him some assistance .
the foreign ministry and the chancellery claim there is no room in the budget for this . but werner hoyer , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp said financing was not a problem . " of course something can be done there , " he said .
" to simply pretend there is no leeway in the budget is nonsense . " indeed , german foreign ministers have discretionary funds at their disposal for emergencies .
but cdu parliamentarian siegfried kauder said the foreign ministry is reluctant to tap into these funds .
that sort of " non-bureaucratic assistance would create a precedent " for future kidnappers , he said . kauder recommended hijjaj contact the white ring , a relief organization for victims of violence . " he has to be the victim of a violent crime , and he has to be in financial need , " said kauder , who is a member of the organization 's board of directors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 14.02.2007 happiness is … love and vacation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for most germans , it does n't get any better than this valentine 's day is the day of love .
if a new study is right , germans should be their happiest then on wednesday - in addition to during their holidays . there is no shortage of stereotypes about europeans .
the romantic french immediately pop to mind , as do the witty english and their dry sense of humor .
italians and spaniards share the top place for being most fiery , and the germans ?
these teutonic people are best known for their seriousness and hard work , not though for their happy disposition . but a new study presented this week showed that more than two-thirds of germans tend to be happy .
there is a hitch , though .
of those surveyed , 84 percent said they especially experienced happy moments when they were in love or on vacation .
while the love aspect may have to be left up to fate , it 's certainly a good thing that german employees have an average of six weeks paid annual vacation .
that would make anyone happy . the polling institute allensbach surveyed over 1,700 men and women between the ages of 16 and 69 for the magazine emotion .
it found that mostly women , young people or the better educated are most happy . but if a gloomy day comes along , over half of germans will pep up their spirits by listening to music , seeing their partner or meeting up with friends . it also appears that germans believe the old saying that every man is the architect of his own fortune .
almost two-thirds of those surveyed said they believed they could in part influence their own happiness . sex and money will not make you happy anyone who thinks sex is the key to happiness is just high on oxytocin .
the allensbach study showed that sex in fact does not make people happy .
only every third german said a satisfied sex life played a role in their happiness .
the same was true for professional success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : true love can make swans happy , too and the old saying that money ca n't buy you happiness was once again proven in the study : only 20 percent of those surveyed believe that a lot of money could make them happy . trend researcher matthias horx said he believed germans were " happiness sourpusses " compared to other nations .
horx said an increasing number of germans were breaking out of the typical pessimistic way of thinking and trying to work on their happiness .
but too many germans were still too passive and place too much emphasis on security in order to believe in self-made happiness , horx said . " overcoming fear is not our thing , " horx said .
" germans may be relatively content , but they still think that the world is going downhill . " can a celebrity be happy in germany ? so what does your typical happy german look like ?
they believe predominantly in their own personal success -lrb- 71 percent -rrb- , like to take responsibility -lrb- 68 percent -rrb- and have a lot of interests -lrb- 68 percent -rrb- .
they 're surrounded by longtime friends and acquaintances and seldom have the feeling that others are making more out of their lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher : the face of a happy german man you 'd think then that the country 's chancellor angela merkel would be on top of the world .
she may be , but only five percent of her nation think she is happy . so who does the average german consider the happiest vip in the population ?

fc sachsen leipzig had a match planned for saturday , which is now going to be held the following week . " it 's a signal in the wrong direction , " said fc sachsen 's goalkeeper steffen süssner .

buttolo also threatened games behind closed doors , as were recently played in italy after the death of a police officer there , in the case of further incidents . geier was skeptical of such plans .

the state even went beyond german demands at the time . belgium actively helped the occupying german forces round up and deport the country 's jewish population during the second world war , according to historians from the center for historical research and documentation on war and contemporary society -lrb- ceges -rrb- in brussels . " the belgian state adopted a docile and cooperative attitude in some very diverse , but crucial domains providing collaboration unworthy of a democracy , with a policy that was disastrous for belgian and foreign jews , " the historians said . the report " docile belgium , " commissioned by the belgian parliament , said the state collaborated with the nazis for " economic , as well as ideological and legal-administrative " reasons .
it is the first time belgium 's cooperation with the nazis has been presented in such detail . project leader rudi van doorslaer said " a xenophobic and sometimes anti-semitic culture of the ruling elite " in the 1930s had prepared belgium psychologically for the persecution of the jews .
the " democratic deficit " in the years from 1930 to 1940 had also played a role , doorslaer said . " the step from passive to active collaboration was quickly taken , " doorslaer said as he read the report 's conclusions to the parliament on tuesday . government in exile authorized cooperation with the nazis doorslaer said the country had closed its doors to jews fleeing germany after hitler came to power in 1933 .
according to the ceges study , the deportations began shortly after may 10 , 1940 , when german annexed predominantly german-speaking cantons in eastern belgium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of belgian jews were killed in the auschwitz concentration camp following the nazi invasion in 1940 , the belgian government fled to britain .
but the report found that the government in exile in london during the war " never let it be known that policies had to be adapted and that the behavior of leading civil servants and magistrates was unconstitutional and democratically reprehensible . " however , belgian authorities were not aware in summer 1942 that jews deported to poland were being exterminated , the report said . some 50,000 jews lived in belgium in the 1930s .
about half were killed during the holocaust . many belgians tried to save jewish people belgian jewish groups reacted positively to the study . " this report is fundamental and it is a victory for enlightened democracy , " said philippe markiewicz , head of the coordination committee of belgian jewish organizations . markiewicz said despite the negative impact of the report , there were many belgians who risked their lives to save jews . findings should go into the history books the ceges historians spent three years researching and writing the 1,114-page study and were able to view documents previously unused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis forced the jewish population to wear the yellow star of david prime minister guy verhofstadt apologized already to the jewish community in 2002 for belgium 's role in the holocaust .
his spokesman said that verhofstadt felt the ceges findings should be incorporated into history textbooks . the historians worked out the details of three major phases relating to the persecution of belgian jews .
in october and november 1940 , the central government followed the nazis ' request to require all jews to register with their local authorities . in the summer of 1942 , when the nazi regime began massively deporting belgians of jewish origin , collaboration started diminishing .
brussels refused to make jews wear yellow stars , which the nazis prescribed in order to identify them more easily .
the police in antwerp , on the other hand , arbitrarily arrested 1,243 jews and handed them over to the germans . after the end of the war , belgian military judicial authorities decided that investigating the deportation of the jewish people was too " delicate " to be allowed to continue . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film on wiesenthal 's legacy opens at berlinale a documentary about the life of famous nazi hunter simon wiesenthal has premiered at the berlin international film festival .

thrust into undoubtedly the hardest group stage of this season 's champions league , thomas schaaf 's side cruelly missed out on an historic qualification from group a by one point after beating english champions chelsea at the weserstadion and holding the current european champions barcelona to a draw . werder dropped into the uefa cup at the start of the knock-out stages and instantly became one of the favorites to win the trophy on the back of their bundesliga form and improving european credentials .
however , if bremen thought they were in for an easy time , the draw had them thinking again . bremen face dutch masters in sticky knock-out tie ajax amsterdam have four european cups to their name , one uefa cup , 29 dutch championship titles and are currently second in the dutch league .
a club which did much to introduce the concept of total football to the world , a fluid system which allows the outfield players the freedom to swap positions , ajax will prove to be a real test for bremen . while not exactly a team known for a lack of confidence , two successive defeats in the bundesliga have put werder six points behind leaders schalke 04 and have knocked them out of their free-scoring rhythm .
" we 'll have to see whether this latest defeat gives us the spur we need - or not , " bremen 's germany striker miroslav klose said tuesday . bildunterschrift : ajax players prepare for wednesday 's clash in bremen ajax , whose dutch title hopes have been re-ignited by closest rivals psv eindhoven 's poor run , have defensive worries with injuries ruling out defenders urby emanuelson , zdenek grygera and thomas vermaelen . recently re-signed amsterdam legend edgar davids is cup-tied for the remainder of the competition after featuring for former club tottenham hotspur in the group stage . for bayer leverkusen , the uefa cup offers a glamorous respite from the rigors of their mediocre bundesliga campaign .

leverkusen 's progress is far from assured . injuries plague both sides ahead of clash things have been made worse by injuries to defenders juan and roque junior and coach skibbe may also have to do without captain carsten ramelow .

the state even went beyond german demands at the time . belgium actively helped the occupying german forces round up and deport the country 's jewish population during the second world war , according to historians from the center for historical research and documentation on war and contemporary society -lrb- ceges -rrb- in brussels . " the belgian state adopted a docile and cooperative attitude in some very diverse , but crucial domains providing collaboration unworthy of a democracy , with a policy that was disastrous for belgian and foreign jews , " the historians said . the report " docile belgium , " commissioned by the belgian parliament , said the state collaborated with the nazis for " economic , as well as ideological and legal-administrative " reasons .
it is the first time belgium 's cooperation with the nazis has been presented in such detail . project leader rudi van doorslaer said " a xenophobic and sometimes anti-semitic culture of the ruling elite " in the 1930s had prepared belgium psychologically for the persecution of the jews .
the " democratic deficit " in the years from 1930 to 1940 had also played a role , doorslaer said . " the step from passive to active collaboration was quickly taken , " doorslaer said as he read the report 's conclusions to the parliament on tuesday . government in exile authorized cooperation with the nazis doorslaer said the country had closed its doors to jews fleeing germany after hitler came to power in 1933 .
according to the ceges study , the deportations began shortly after may 10 , 1940 , when german annexed predominantly german-speaking cantons in eastern belgium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of belgian jews were killed in the auschwitz concentration camp following the nazi invasion in 1940 , the belgian government fled to britain .

his spokesman said that verhofstadt felt the ceges findings should be incorporated into history textbooks . the historians worked out the details of three major phases relating to the persecution of belgian jews .
in october and november 1940 , the central government followed the nazis ' request to require all jews to register with their local authorities . in the summer of 1942 , when the nazi regime began massively deporting belgians of jewish origin , collaboration started diminishing .
brussels refused to make jews wear yellow stars , which the nazis prescribed in order to identify them more easily .

" this report is fundamental and it is a victory for enlightened democracy , " said philippe markiewicz , head of the coordination committee of belgian jewish organizations . markiewicz said despite the negative impact of the report , there were many belgians who risked their lives to save jews . findings should go into the history books the ceges historians spent three years researching and writing the 1,114-page study and were able to view documents previously unused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis forced the jewish population to wear the yellow star of david prime minister guy verhofstadt apologized already to the jewish community in 2002 for belgium 's role in the holocaust .
his spokesman said that verhofstadt felt the ceges findings should be incorporated into history textbooks . the historians worked out the details of three major phases relating to the persecution of belgian jews .
in october and november 1940 , the central government followed the nazis ' request to require all jews to register with their local authorities . in the summer of 1942 , when the nazi regime began massively deporting belgians of jewish origin , collaboration started diminishing .
brussels refused to make jews wear yellow stars , which the nazis prescribed in order to identify them more easily .
the police in antwerp , on the other hand , arbitrarily arrested 1,243 jews and handed them over to the germans . after the end of the war , belgian military judicial authorities decided that investigating the deportation of the jewish people was too " delicate " to be allowed to continue . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film on wiesenthal 's legacy opens at berlinale a documentary about the life of famous nazi hunter simon wiesenthal has premiered at the berlin international film festival .

" google said in paris that it would appeal against the decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google co-founders larry page , left , and sergey brin " google regrets today 's decision and will appeal , " said google news legal counsel for europe yoram elkaim in paris .
" we continue to believe that the google news service conforms with copyright law and benefits publishers as much as internet users , " he said . the president of the copiepresse grouping of belgium 's french-language newspapers , margaret boribon , said the group did not intend to keep up the legal battle " for the fun of it " and preferred to " negotiate " a settlement . long-standing suit a year ago copiepresse lodged a belgian lawsuit against google news to require the internet group to request permission from copiepresse and to pay it to show its articles on the google news site . on september 5 , a belgian court ordered google news to stop reproducing content from french-language and german-language newspapers in belgium on its belgian website and imposed fines as long as it did not respect the decision . in that ruling , the court told the company to pay copiepresse a million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- each day that the forbidden articles , pictures and graphics appeared on its site . in tuesday 's decision , the judge backed google 's claim that the fines were " disproportionate " and reduced them to a more " reasonable " 25,000 euros per day . copiepresse lawyer bernard magrez said that meant google would no longer have to pay a total of 130 million euros but three million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court decision is being hailed as a victory for news providers in a hearing in november , google 's lawyers argued that the papers were seeking to profit from its immense financial success in recent years . google 's main defense was that it is a search engine that helps users find information on other websites and not a so-called portal that hosts its own information . case could have broader implications the case in belgium is being closely watched by other news providers , including agence france-presse , which has been in dispute with google in france as well as in the united states . a spokesman for the paris-based world association of newspapers welcomed the court 's ruling and said that google and other internet companies would now have to be more careful about treading on papers ' copyrights . " it shows that content providers and publishers have to be part of the discussion with search engines , otherwise it 's going to end up in court , " said wan spokesman larry kilman . afp chief executive pierre louette also welcomed the decision . " it 's important that a court recognizes that permission must be given before using content , " he said in paris . after opening news websites for about thirty countries in four years , google launched a belgian version in january 2006 , much to the concern of the country 's french-speaking newspapers . the newspapers had also asked microsoft to stop the unauthorized publishing of articles on its " www.msn.be " site , which the company later did .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 14.02.2007 report : belgium collaborated with nazis in deporting jews großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi germany raised its flag in belgium in 1940 belgian historians have concluded that the country actively cooperated with germany 's nazi regime during world war ii in deporting jews .
the state even went beyond german demands at the time . belgium actively helped the occupying german forces round up and deport the country 's jewish population during the second world war , according to historians from the center for historical research and documentation on war and contemporary society -lrb- ceges -rrb- in brussels . " the belgian state adopted a docile and cooperative attitude in some very diverse , but crucial domains providing collaboration unworthy of a democracy , with a policy that was disastrous for belgian and foreign jews , " the historians said . the report " docile belgium , " commissioned by the belgian parliament , said the state collaborated with the nazis for " economic , as well as ideological and legal-administrative " reasons .
it is the first time belgium 's cooperation with the nazis has been presented in such detail . project leader rudi van doorslaer said " a xenophobic and sometimes anti-semitic culture of the ruling elite " in the 1930s had prepared belgium psychologically for the persecution of the jews .
the " democratic deficit " in the years from 1930 to 1940 had also played a role , doorslaer said . " the step from passive to active collaboration was quickly taken , " doorslaer said as he read the report 's conclusions to the parliament on tuesday . government in exile authorized cooperation with the nazis doorslaer said the country had closed its doors to jews fleeing germany after hitler came to power in 1933 .
according to the ceges study , the deportations began shortly after may 10 , 1940 , when german annexed predominantly german-speaking cantons in eastern belgium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of belgian jews were killed in the auschwitz concentration camp following the nazi invasion in 1940 , the belgian government fled to britain .
but the report found that the government in exile in london during the war " never let it be known that policies had to be adapted and that the behavior of leading civil servants and magistrates was unconstitutional and democratically reprehensible . " however , belgian authorities were not aware in summer 1942 that jews deported to poland were being exterminated , the report said . some 50,000 jews lived in belgium in the 1930s .
about half were killed during the holocaust . many belgians tried to save jewish people belgian jewish groups reacted positively to the study . " this report is fundamental and it is a victory for enlightened democracy , " said philippe markiewicz , head of the coordination committee of belgian jewish organizations . markiewicz said despite the negative impact of the report , there were many belgians who risked their lives to save jews . findings should go into the history books the ceges historians spent three years researching and writing the 1,114-page study and were able to view documents previously unused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis forced the jewish population to wear the yellow star of david prime minister guy verhofstadt apologized already to the jewish community in 2002 for belgium 's role in the holocaust .
his spokesman said that verhofstadt felt the ceges findings should be incorporated into history textbooks . the historians worked out the details of three major phases relating to the persecution of belgian jews .
in october and november 1940 , the central government followed the nazis ' request to require all jews to register with their local authorities . in the summer of 1942 , when the nazi regime began massively deporting belgians of jewish origin , collaboration started diminishing .
brussels refused to make jews wear yellow stars , which the nazis prescribed in order to identify them more easily .
the police in antwerp , on the other hand , arbitrarily arrested 1,243 jews and handed them over to the germans . after the end of the war , belgian military judicial authorities decided that investigating the deportation of the jewish people was too " delicate " to be allowed to continue . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film on wiesenthal 's legacy opens at berlinale a documentary about the life of famous nazi hunter simon wiesenthal has premiered at the berlin international film festival .

but in the past , italy and france have also had to decide how to battle left-wing terrorists . the italian marxist-leninist terrorist group brigate rosse or red brigades officially disbanded in the 1980s , but pockets have remained , as arrests on monday showed . italian authorities took 15 people into custody .
the suspects are allegedly linked to the red brigades for planning several attacks , including one on a company owned by former premier silvio berlusconi .
they have been accused of " associating with terrorists and participating in an armed group , " the italian interior ministry said . the group , founded in 1973 , has been mainly inoperative since the end of the cold war .
but in the 1970s and 1980s , it was responsible for thousands of acts of violence .
over 400 deaths are attributed to the red brigades . the climax of red brigades terror occurred in 1978 , when the group kidnapped former prime minister aldo moros and subsequently murdered him .
the period belonged to the most dramatic days that italy experienced since the end of the second world war . today , a small plaque on house number 9 in the via caetani in rome 's city center commemorates the moros murder .
on may 9 , 1978 , his body was found here , in the trunk of a parked car . groups had the same goals , but no cooperation left-wing extremists such as the brigate rosse in italy also existed in germany and france in the 1970s .
all groups wanted to build up an " anti-imperial european front , " said rolf tophoven , director of the institute for terrorism research and security policy in essen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf tophoven is a leading german terrorism expert germany 's red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , the red brigades and action directe in france had a social revolutionary approach in common . " they were against the state , against exploitation and for the interests of the working class , " tophoven said .
" they were aiming for the revolutionary reorganization of society according to a marxist-leninist ideal . " the instrument they chose to meet this goal was violence , and the targets were mainly leading politicians and top managers from the business world .
but the groups never got further than an ideological linking . cross-border cooperation , such as that practiced by islamic terrorist groups today , never existed . justice collaborators helped break up the red brigades the red brigades had dreamt of a communist order in italy .
the result , though , was a climate of uncertainty and violence caused by numerous assaults and kidnappings .
the break came after the moros murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldo moro spent 55 days in the red brigades ' hands before he was killed " this event shocked all of italy , " tophoven said .
" for the first time , a wide front spanning across all political parties formed against the terror from the left . " the decisive aspect of the fight against terror in italy was the so-called pentiti , or justice collaborators .
it offered leading heads of the movement a milder sentence if they cooperated with the state . " this led to the breakup of the red brigades in 1982 , " tophoven said .
over 200 activists received sentences at the time - 85 of them for life . in the meantime , however , many have been released from prison or were granted day release .
in 1998 , when founder renato curcio was released after 24 years in prison , the discussion in italy was nowhere near as heated as in germany .
a german court ruled on monday that former raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt will be released on parole next month .
this has sparked a sharp debate across the country . public opinion in france forced government action in france in the 1980s , the government and president francois mitterrand initially reacted relatively reserved to action directe .
as opposed to germany , they did n't consider the state order directly endangered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joëlle aubron from action directe died of cancer in 2006 but with the action directe commando 's first casualties , public opinion changed .
the major left-wing liberal newspapers , such as le monde and libération condemned action directe .
the publications criticized the lacking reference to the working class , in whose name the group operated . the french government took a tougher stance after the murders of general rene audran in 1985 and renault director georges besse in 1986 .
one year later , the founders of the group , jean-marc rouillan , nathalie ménigon and georges cipriani were arrested and action directe fell apart . in 2006 , the three prisoners requested release on parole after serving the minimum time of 18 years .
but authorities denied the request due to their lack of remorse . raf dissolved itself following the successes in italy , the witness leniency program was introduced in germany , too .
but the raf dissolved itself .
in a letter in 1992 , it declared its fight as useless and the raf experiment as failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack on federal prosecutor siegfried buback left three dead following the decision to release mohnhaupt on parole , three raf members remain in prison : christian klar , eva sybille haule and birgit hogefeld .
their prison sentences could also be changed into a suspended sentence after 2009 . " in all three countries , the social revolutionary experiments drenched in violence and terrorist attacks failed , " tophoven said .
the virtually worldwide collapse of real socialism ultimately contributed , too . " the story of the anti-imperialist european front is a story of failure , " tophoven said . ina rottscheidt -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de release of former militant sparks mixed feelings in germany most german political parties consider the release of the one-time terrorist and red army faction leader brigitte mohnhaupt as a sign of justice .

but as time runs out , angela merkel is the leader most likely to achieve his goals . when tony blair flew to berlin on tuesday for talks on climate change with german chancellor angela merkel , there was more to the meeting than just two international figures attempting to keep the slowly turning wheels of environmental politics going . while the british prime minister arrived in the german capital intent on capitalizing on the slight recent shift in global thinking towards tackling climate change by discussing plans with the current eu president and leader of the g8 , blair was also seizing what many observers see as his last chance to leave a positive legacy when his premiership comes to an end . blair has embarked on many missions during his 10-year tenure in downing street .
his desire to be remembered for one great success on the global stage has led him to pursue campaigns to resolve the israeli-palestinian conflict and bring peace to the middle east , to rebuild the bridges between the united states and europe , and to bring the world together in a binding international agreement on climate change . the war in iraq put paid to both blair 's influence in the middle east and his credibility as the link between europe and the us .
his visit to berlin shows , that with time running out , he has to work with the woman who has replaced him as the point person on all the major issues he held dear if he wants to go down in history as the leader who attempted to save the world from environmental disaster . merkel getting results in the middle east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel gets access and results seemingly beyond blair merkel 's more pragmatic and candid approach to the volatile situation in the middle east , as seen during her recent peacemaking tour of egypt , saudi arabia and the gulf , has so far achieved more than blair could have ever expected from his own efforts . merkel personally persuaded us president george w. bush to accept the link between iraq and a wider middle east settlement ; encouraged the americans to revive the mideast quartet negotiating forum and rallied a number of arab states behind her vision of peace . in another example where she has seemingly succeeded where blair failed , merkel has kept germany free from washington 's apron strings in pursuing dialogue with iran and syria , and a two-state solution of the arab-israeli conflict while maintaining good relations with the white house . meanwhile blair is left to privately rue his decision to join the us in the war against iraq while germany takes the initiative in pushing for a resolution in the middle east , according to mark halsey , author of the book " blair 's legacy . " " iraq pretty much killed his dream of securing peace in the middle east , " halsey said .
" his attempts to save his tarnished reputation in the region by pressing for movement on the arab-israeli peace process also failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has found bush to be a fickle bed-fellow " he was defeated by washington 's pro-israeli neoconservatives , who believe israel should be free to settle its conflict with the palestinians , syria and hezbollah in lebanon on its own terms , " halsey added .
" that ended any real hope of blair leading the way in any peace process , or the americans letting him take the lead . " while germany 's nazi past will never allow it to put serious pressure on israel , merkel has maintained a level of independence in her dealing in the middle east , which has to some extent met with us acceptance and support . a challenging trans-atlantic relationship after the obvious divisions between the us and much of europe over the iraq war , the bush administration expressed relief after germany 's 2005 election when it found a leader it could be civil with after bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , descended into icy silence after the war began . even as us-german relations are back to normal on the surface after the schröder years , germany and the us do not share all the same interests , strategies and perceptions .
iraq and climate change being the clearest examples .
meanwhile , merkel 's boldest trans-atlantic initiative - an economic zone between europe and the us - has also raised little excitement in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is seen as europe 's point person by washington despite the differences , it is now merkel and not blair that the americans come to talk to on the current hot topics .
us experts say the bush administration views merkel as the " anchor point " for its dealings with the eu .
while blair is seen as a lame duck premier who has served his purpose , merkel is a leader on the rise . " she 's the big player in europe right now , " kurt volker , the bush administration 's principal deputy assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs , was quoted as saying after merkel ’ s visit to washington earlier this year . marginalized blair seeks climate agreement blair is expected to stand down as prime minister this spring .
but before he does , he wants to sign off on a new environmental agreement which would bind all the main players to a set of goals on the stabilization of emissions and the establishment of a global price for carbon trading . ironically , as blair pursues his last remaining legacy option , angela merkel is the person best equipped to take the lead in the global climate debate .
as a physicist and the former environment minister who negotiated the kyoto protocol for germany in 1997 , merkel knows that the basic science of climate change is no longer in dispute .
she also knows that the scale and urgency of the challenge the world faces is worse than previously thought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is forced to watch merkel make all the decisions as well as chairing the eu spring summit in march , where leaders will make major decisions on the future of climate and energy security policies , merkel will put climate change at the top of the agenda for this year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .

but as time runs out , angela merkel is the leader most likely to achieve his goals . when tony blair flew to berlin on tuesday for talks on climate change with german chancellor angela merkel , there was more to the meeting than just two international figures attempting to keep the slowly turning wheels of environmental politics going . while the british prime minister arrived in the german capital intent on capitalizing on the slight recent shift in global thinking towards tackling climate change by discussing plans with the current eu president and leader of the g8 , blair was also seizing what many observers see as his last chance to leave a positive legacy when his premiership comes to an end . blair has embarked on many missions during his 10-year tenure in downing street .
his desire to be remembered for one great success on the global stage has led him to pursue campaigns to resolve the israeli-palestinian conflict and bring peace to the middle east , to rebuild the bridges between the united states and europe , and to bring the world together in a binding international agreement on climate change . the war in iraq put paid to both blair 's influence in the middle east and his credibility as the link between europe and the us .
his visit to berlin shows , that with time running out , he has to work with the woman who has replaced him as the point person on all the major issues he held dear if he wants to go down in history as the leader who attempted to save the world from environmental disaster . merkel getting results in the middle east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel gets access and results seemingly beyond blair merkel 's more pragmatic and candid approach to the volatile situation in the middle east , as seen during her recent peacemaking tour of egypt , saudi arabia and the gulf , has so far achieved more than blair could have ever expected from his own efforts . merkel personally persuaded us president george w. bush to accept the link between iraq and a wider middle east settlement ; encouraged the americans to revive the mideast quartet negotiating forum and rallied a number of arab states behind her vision of peace . in another example where she has seemingly succeeded where blair failed , merkel has kept germany free from washington 's apron strings in pursuing dialogue with iran and syria , and a two-state solution of the arab-israeli conflict while maintaining good relations with the white house . meanwhile blair is left to privately rue his decision to join the us in the war against iraq while germany takes the initiative in pushing for a resolution in the middle east , according to mark halsey , author of the book " blair 's legacy . " " iraq pretty much killed his dream of securing peace in the middle east , " halsey said .
" his attempts to save his tarnished reputation in the region by pressing for movement on the arab-israeli peace process also failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has found bush to be a fickle bed-fellow " he was defeated by washington 's pro-israeli neoconservatives , who believe israel should be free to settle its conflict with the palestinians , syria and hezbollah in lebanon on its own terms , " halsey added .
" that ended any real hope of blair leading the way in any peace process , or the americans letting him take the lead . " while germany 's nazi past will never allow it to put serious pressure on israel , merkel has maintained a level of independence in her dealing in the middle east , which has to some extent met with us acceptance and support . a challenging trans-atlantic relationship after the obvious divisions between the us and much of europe over the iraq war , the bush administration expressed relief after germany 's 2005 election when it found a leader it could be civil with after bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , descended into icy silence after the war began . even as us-german relations are back to normal on the surface after the schröder years , germany and the us do not share all the same interests , strategies and perceptions .
iraq and climate change being the clearest examples .
meanwhile , merkel 's boldest trans-atlantic initiative - an economic zone between europe and the us - has also raised little excitement in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is seen as europe 's point person by washington despite the differences , it is now merkel and not blair that the americans come to talk to on the current hot topics .
us experts say the bush administration views merkel as the " anchor point " for its dealings with the eu .
while blair is seen as a lame duck premier who has served his purpose , merkel is a leader on the rise . " she 's the big player in europe right now , " kurt volker , the bush administration 's principal deputy assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs , was quoted as saying after merkel ’ s visit to washington earlier this year . marginalized blair seeks climate agreement blair is expected to stand down as prime minister this spring .
but before he does , he wants to sign off on a new environmental agreement which would bind all the main players to a set of goals on the stabilization of emissions and the establishment of a global price for carbon trading . ironically , as blair pursues his last remaining legacy option , angela merkel is the person best equipped to take the lead in the global climate debate .
as a physicist and the former environment minister who negotiated the kyoto protocol for germany in 1997 , merkel knows that the basic science of climate change is no longer in dispute .
she also knows that the scale and urgency of the challenge the world faces is worse than previously thought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is forced to watch merkel make all the decisions as well as chairing the eu spring summit in march , where leaders will make major decisions on the future of climate and energy security policies , merkel will put climate change at the top of the agenda for this year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .
she will then lead the negotiations for securing agreement on the principles of a more comprehensive deal ahead of a united nations meeting in bali later in the year . by then , blair may have played his last part on the world stage ; watching from the wings as germany 's first female chancellor makes progress on all the issues that eluded him during his time as prime minister . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , blair push for action to prevent climate change german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday after a meeting with british prime minster tony blair that she hopes to set concrete goals on climate protection at the g8 summit of the world 's richest nations in june .

" google said in paris that it would appeal against the decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google co-founders larry page , left , and sergey brin " google regrets today 's decision and will appeal , " said google news legal counsel for europe yoram elkaim in paris .
" we continue to believe that the google news service conforms with copyright law and benefits publishers as much as internet users , " he said . the president of the copiepresse grouping of belgium 's french-language newspapers , margaret boribon , said the group did not intend to keep up the legal battle " for the fun of it " and preferred to " negotiate " a settlement . long-standing suit a year ago copiepresse lodged a belgian lawsuit against google news to require the internet group to request permission from copiepresse and to pay it to show its articles on the google news site . on september 5 , a belgian court ordered google news to stop reproducing content from french-language and german-language newspapers in belgium on its belgian website and imposed fines as long as it did not respect the decision . in that ruling , the court told the company to pay copiepresse a million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- each day that the forbidden articles , pictures and graphics appeared on its site . in tuesday 's decision , the judge backed google 's claim that the fines were " disproportionate " and reduced them to a more " reasonable " 25,000 euros per day . copiepresse lawyer bernard magrez said that meant google would no longer have to pay a total of 130 million euros but three million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court decision is being hailed as a victory for news providers in a hearing in november , google 's lawyers argued that the papers were seeking to profit from its immense financial success in recent years . google 's main defense was that it is a search engine that helps users find information on other websites and not a so-called portal that hosts its own information . case could have broader implications the case in belgium is being closely watched by other news providers , including agence france-presse , which has been in dispute with google in france as well as in the united states . a spokesman for the paris-based world association of newspapers welcomed the court 's ruling and said that google and other internet companies would now have to be more careful about treading on papers ' copyrights . " it shows that content providers and publishers have to be part of the discussion with search engines , otherwise it 's going to end up in court , " said wan spokesman larry kilman . afp chief executive pierre louette also welcomed the decision . " it 's important that a court recognizes that permission must be given before using content , " he said in paris . after opening news websites for about thirty countries in four years , google launched a belgian version in january 2006 , much to the concern of the country 's french-speaking newspapers . the newspapers had also asked microsoft to stop the unauthorized publishing of articles on its " www.msn.be " site , which the company later did .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 14.02.2007 report : belgium collaborated with nazis in deporting jews großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi germany raised its flag in belgium in 1940 belgian historians have concluded that the country actively cooperated with germany 's nazi regime during world war ii in deporting jews .
the state even went beyond german demands at the time . belgium actively helped the occupying german forces round up and deport the country 's jewish population during the second world war , according to historians from the center for historical research and documentation on war and contemporary society -lrb- ceges -rrb- in brussels . " the belgian state adopted a docile and cooperative attitude in some very diverse , but crucial domains providing collaboration unworthy of a democracy , with a policy that was disastrous for belgian and foreign jews , " the historians said . the report " docile belgium , " commissioned by the belgian parliament , said the state collaborated with the nazis for " economic , as well as ideological and legal-administrative " reasons .
it is the first time belgium 's cooperation with the nazis has been presented in such detail . project leader rudi van doorslaer said " a xenophobic and sometimes anti-semitic culture of the ruling elite " in the 1930s had prepared belgium psychologically for the persecution of the jews .
the " democratic deficit " in the years from 1930 to 1940 had also played a role , doorslaer said . " the step from passive to active collaboration was quickly taken , " doorslaer said as he read the report 's conclusions to the parliament on tuesday . government in exile authorized cooperation with the nazis doorslaer said the country had closed its doors to jews fleeing germany after hitler came to power in 1933 .
according to the ceges study , the deportations began shortly after may 10 , 1940 , when german annexed predominantly german-speaking cantons in eastern belgium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of belgian jews were killed in the auschwitz concentration camp following the nazi invasion in 1940 , the belgian government fled to britain .
but the report found that the government in exile in london during the war " never let it be known that policies had to be adapted and that the behavior of leading civil servants and magistrates was unconstitutional and democratically reprehensible . " however , belgian authorities were not aware in summer 1942 that jews deported to poland were being exterminated , the report said . some 50,000 jews lived in belgium in the 1930s .
about half were killed during the holocaust . many belgians tried to save jewish people belgian jewish groups reacted positively to the study . " this report is fundamental and it is a victory for enlightened democracy , " said philippe markiewicz , head of the coordination committee of belgian jewish organizations . markiewicz said despite the negative impact of the report , there were many belgians who risked their lives to save jews . findings should go into the history books the ceges historians spent three years researching and writing the 1,114-page study and were able to view documents previously unused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis forced the jewish population to wear the yellow star of david prime minister guy verhofstadt apologized already to the jewish community in 2002 for belgium 's role in the holocaust .
his spokesman said that verhofstadt felt the ceges findings should be incorporated into history textbooks . the historians worked out the details of three major phases relating to the persecution of belgian jews .
in october and november 1940 , the central government followed the nazis ' request to require all jews to register with their local authorities . in the summer of 1942 , when the nazi regime began massively deporting belgians of jewish origin , collaboration started diminishing .
brussels refused to make jews wear yellow stars , which the nazis prescribed in order to identify them more easily .
the police in antwerp , on the other hand , arbitrarily arrested 1,243 jews and handed them over to the germans . after the end of the war , belgian military judicial authorities decided that investigating the deportation of the jewish people was too " delicate " to be allowed to continue . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film on wiesenthal 's legacy opens at berlinale a documentary about the life of famous nazi hunter simon wiesenthal has premiered at the berlin international film festival .

there is a hitch , though .

it is the first time belgium 's cooperation with the nazis has been presented in such detail . project leader rudi van doorslaer said " a xenophobic and sometimes anti-semitic culture of the ruling elite " in the 1930s had prepared belgium psychologically for the persecution of the jews .
the " democratic deficit " in the years from 1930 to 1940 had also played a role , doorslaer said . " the step from passive to active collaboration was quickly taken , " doorslaer said as he read the report 's conclusions to the parliament on tuesday . government in exile authorized cooperation with the nazis doorslaer said the country had closed its doors to jews fleeing germany after hitler came to power in 1933 .
according to the ceges study , the deportations began shortly after may 10 , 1940 , when german annexed predominantly german-speaking cantons in eastern belgium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of belgian jews were killed in the auschwitz concentration camp following the nazi invasion in 1940 , the belgian government fled to britain .
but the report found that the government in exile in london during the war " never let it be known that policies had to be adapted and that the behavior of leading civil servants and magistrates was unconstitutional and democratically reprehensible . " however , belgian authorities were not aware in summer 1942 that jews deported to poland were being exterminated , the report said . some 50,000 jews lived in belgium in the 1930s .
about half were killed during the holocaust . many belgians tried to save jewish people belgian jewish groups reacted positively to the study . " this report is fundamental and it is a victory for enlightened democracy , " said philippe markiewicz , head of the coordination committee of belgian jewish organizations . markiewicz said despite the negative impact of the report , there were many belgians who risked their lives to save jews . findings should go into the history books the ceges historians spent three years researching and writing the 1,114-page study and were able to view documents previously unused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis forced the jewish population to wear the yellow star of david prime minister guy verhofstadt apologized already to the jewish community in 2002 for belgium 's role in the holocaust .
his spokesman said that verhofstadt felt the ceges findings should be incorporated into history textbooks . the historians worked out the details of three major phases relating to the persecution of belgian jews .
in october and november 1940 , the central government followed the nazis ' request to require all jews to register with their local authorities . in the summer of 1942 , when the nazi regime began massively deporting belgians of jewish origin , collaboration started diminishing .
brussels refused to make jews wear yellow stars , which the nazis prescribed in order to identify them more easily .
the police in antwerp , on the other hand , arbitrarily arrested 1,243 jews and handed them over to the germans . after the end of the war , belgian military judicial authorities decided that investigating the deportation of the jewish people was too " delicate " to be allowed to continue . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film on wiesenthal 's legacy opens at berlinale a documentary about the life of famous nazi hunter simon wiesenthal has premiered at the berlin international film festival .

some 39 officers were injured and six hooligans temporarily detained . the german soccer community , politicians and police were outraged over saturday 's soccer violence , which was a stark contrast to last summer 's festive world cup matches played in leipzig , the only tournament venue in the former east germany . germans are asking how flares and fireworks that were used as ammunition at the riot could have been brought into the stadium .
they blame lax security at fourth division club lokomotiv leipzig , whose fans were responsible for the violent clashes with the police . dfb : no games without security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no security assurances , no games , says the dfb 's zwanziger " if we are n't able to offer secure stadiums , or prevent such incidents , then we ca n't allow soccer matches to take place there , " theo zwanziger , head of the germany soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , when announcing that all lower-league matches in saxony for this weekend would be cancelled . zwanziger made it clear that the cancellation of some 60 lower league matches is a symbolic act , a message of solidarity to the police that is meant to show that violence is not tolerated in and around football stadiums in saxony . but some soccer clubs said they feel a sweeping cancellation is not fair .
fc sachsen leipzig had a match planned for saturday , which is now going to be held the following week . " it 's a signal in the wrong direction , " said fc sachsen 's goalkeeper steffen süssner .
" the situation should have been solved differently ; now , we 're just punishing the clubs and the fans , i do n't think that 's right . " politicians must make the decisions , says coach fc sachsen leipzig coach eduard geier said the politicians were taking the easy way out . " politicians need to act here , we all do , we have to be role models and make sure that there are orderly games and fair play on the field , " he said .
" politicians have to deal with the rest .
we ca n't do it without them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig fans were blamed for the violence last weekend politicians have meanwhile come up with a handful of possible solutions .
saxony 's interior minister albrecht buttolo has vowed tougher measures for the future , with sports prosecutors on hand at high-risk games to issue arrest warrants on the spot if violent scenes occur .
buttolo also threatened games behind closed doors , as were recently played in italy after the death of a police officer there , in the case of further incidents . geier was skeptical of such plans . " as along as the perpetrators are let go every time , and as long as they 're never punished , the chaotic situation wo n't change , " the fc sachsen leipzig coach said . dagmar breitenbach -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scores injured as hooligans battle police in leipzig riot forty-two people , including 36 policemen , were injured in crowd trouble after a german regional soccer cup match between two amateur teams in the eastern city of leipzig , police said sunday .

some 39 officers were injured and six hooligans temporarily detained . the german soccer community , politicians and police were outraged over saturday 's soccer violence , which was a stark contrast to last summer 's festive world cup matches played in leipzig , the only tournament venue in the former east germany . germans are asking how flares and fireworks that were used as ammunition at the riot could have been brought into the stadium .
they blame lax security at fourth division club lokomotiv leipzig , whose fans were responsible for the violent clashes with the police . dfb : no games without security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no security assurances , no games , says the dfb 's zwanziger " if we are n't able to offer secure stadiums , or prevent such incidents , then we ca n't allow soccer matches to take place there , " theo zwanziger , head of the germany soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , when announcing that all lower-league matches in saxony for this weekend would be cancelled . zwanziger made it clear that the cancellation of some 60 lower league matches is a symbolic act , a message of solidarity to the police that is meant to show that violence is not tolerated in and around football stadiums in saxony . but some soccer clubs said they feel a sweeping cancellation is not fair .
fc sachsen leipzig had a match planned for saturday , which is now going to be held the following week . " it 's a signal in the wrong direction , " said fc sachsen 's goalkeeper steffen süssner .
" the situation should have been solved differently ; now , we 're just punishing the clubs and the fans , i do n't think that 's right . " politicians must make the decisions , says coach fc sachsen leipzig coach eduard geier said the politicians were taking the easy way out . " politicians need to act here , we all do , we have to be role models and make sure that there are orderly games and fair play on the field , " he said .
" politicians have to deal with the rest .
we ca n't do it without them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig fans were blamed for the violence last weekend politicians have meanwhile come up with a handful of possible solutions .
saxony 's interior minister albrecht buttolo has vowed tougher measures for the future , with sports prosecutors on hand at high-risk games to issue arrest warrants on the spot if violent scenes occur .
buttolo also threatened games behind closed doors , as were recently played in italy after the death of a police officer there , in the case of further incidents . geier was skeptical of such plans . " as along as the perpetrators are let go every time , and as long as they 're never punished , the chaotic situation wo n't change , " the fc sachsen leipzig coach said . dagmar breitenbach -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scores injured as hooligans battle police in leipzig riot forty-two people , including 36 policemen , were injured in crowd trouble after a german regional soccer cup match between two amateur teams in the eastern city of leipzig , police said sunday .

" the german government has kept a tight lid on information regarding the missing citizens . but foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on monday did not exclude the possibility of a " violent kidnapping . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has a tough job on his hands meanwhile , anonymous intelligence sources have confirmed to the web site of germany 's der spiegel news magazine that the wife of a baghdad-based iraqi man and her son , a technician at the iraqi foreign ministry , were kidnapped by iraqi gunmen last week . it is unclear whether the kidnappers are politically motivated or simply interested in a ransom payment .
according to initial media reports , the kidnappers contacted the young man 's sister in berlin , who then alerted german authorities .
but officials have since interrogated the woman , and subsequent reports could not confirm that the kidnappers had contacted her . key iraqi mediator also kidnapped this is germany 's third hostage crisis since the start of the iraq war in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was kidnapped in iraq in 2005 at the end of 2005 , bavarian archaeologist susanne osthoff and her driver were taken hostage .
the german government eventually secured their release , allegedly after paying a hefty ransom .
in january 2006 , iraqi gunmen abducted two technicians , rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke .
the pair was also freed unharmed . in all three cases , the head of the baghdad-based german-iraqi club , dr. abdulhalim al-hijjaj helped the german government mediate their release .
al-hijjaj speaks fluent german and is connected with local tribal leaders in the so-called sunni triangle just north of baghdad . the german foreign ministry rewarded the man for his assistance with two tickets to a soccer world cup game in stuttgart .
but the iraqi mediator never saw germany beat portugal 3-1 .
seven days prior to the game , al-hijjaj himself was snatched up off the street by two gunmen . the kidnappers had allegedly learned of his mediation efforts for the german government , and assumed he had been richly rewarded .
the german government could not help al-hijjaj , and he was only freed on july 7 after his wife had emptied the family bank account and paid a ransom of 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 197,115 -rrb- .
the couple then fled to jordan , where they now live an impoverished life , according to media reports . no help for the helper al-hijjaj 's plight has prompted calls from some in germany to help the man who played a valuable role in securing the release of former german nationals taken hostage in iraq . peter bienert , the head of the leipzig-based firm cryotec , where former hostages bräunlich and nitzschke are employed , told german news agency dpa " the man -lrb- al-hijjaj -rrb- has been abandoned . "
bienert has reportedly collected several thousand euros in donations for al-hijjaj . meanwhile , opposition leaders in the german parliament have called on the government to offer him some assistance .
the foreign ministry and the chancellery claim there is no room in the budget for this . but werner hoyer , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp said financing was not a problem . " of course something can be done there , " he said .
" to simply pretend there is no leeway in the budget is nonsense . " indeed , german foreign ministers have discretionary funds at their disposal for emergencies .
but cdu parliamentarian siegfried kauder said the foreign ministry is reluctant to tap into these funds .
that sort of " non-bureaucratic assistance would create a precedent " for future kidnappers , he said . kauder recommended hijjaj contact the white ring , a relief organization for victims of violence . " he has to be the victim of a violent crime , and he has to be in financial need , " said kauder , who is a member of the organization 's board of directors . " then we can offer non-bureaucratic help - also to foreigners .

the couple then fled to jordan , where they now live an impoverished life , according to media reports . no help for the helper al-hijjaj 's plight has prompted calls from some in germany to help the man who played a valuable role in securing the release of former german nationals taken hostage in iraq . peter bienert , the head of the leipzig-based firm cryotec , where former hostages bräunlich and nitzschke are employed , told german news agency dpa " the man -lrb- al-hijjaj -rrb- has been abandoned . "
bienert has reportedly collected several thousand euros in donations for al-hijjaj . meanwhile , opposition leaders in the german parliament have called on the government to offer him some assistance .
the foreign ministry and the chancellery claim there is no room in the budget for this . but werner hoyer , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp said financing was not a problem . " of course something can be done there , " he said .
" to simply pretend there is no leeway in the budget is nonsense . " indeed , german foreign ministers have discretionary funds at their disposal for emergencies .
but cdu parliamentarian siegfried kauder said the foreign ministry is reluctant to tap into these funds .
that sort of " non-bureaucratic assistance would create a precedent " for future kidnappers , he said . kauder recommended hijjaj contact the white ring , a relief organization for victims of violence . " he has to be the victim of a violent crime , and he has to be in financial need , " said kauder , who is a member of the organization 's board of directors . " then we can offer non-bureaucratic help - also to foreigners .

it 's unclear whether the kidnappers want ransom money or political concessions .
the victims ' family in germany have allegedly been contacted by the kidnappers .
-lrb- 12.02.2007 -rrb- politicians call for inquiry into osthoff ransom allegations german politicians called for an investigation into the alleged payment of ransom for former hostage susanne osthoff .
but authorities are dismissing speculation that she was involved in her own abduction .

buttolo also threatened games behind closed doors , as were recently played in italy after the death of a police officer there , in the case of further incidents . geier was skeptical of such plans .

the state even went beyond german demands at the time . belgium actively helped the occupying german forces round up and deport the country 's jewish population during the second world war , according to historians from the center for historical research and documentation on war and contemporary society -lrb- ceges -rrb- in brussels . " the belgian state adopted a docile and cooperative attitude in some very diverse , but crucial domains providing collaboration unworthy of a democracy , with a policy that was disastrous for belgian and foreign jews , " the historians said . the report " docile belgium , " commissioned by the belgian parliament , said the state collaborated with the nazis for " economic , as well as ideological and legal-administrative " reasons .
it is the first time belgium 's cooperation with the nazis has been presented in such detail . project leader rudi van doorslaer said " a xenophobic and sometimes anti-semitic culture of the ruling elite " in the 1930s had prepared belgium psychologically for the persecution of the jews .
the " democratic deficit " in the years from 1930 to 1940 had also played a role , doorslaer said .

if a new study is right , germans should be their happiest then on wednesday - in addition to during their holidays . there is no shortage of stereotypes about europeans .
the romantic french immediately pop to mind , as do the witty english and their dry sense of humor .
italians and spaniards share the top place for being most fiery , and the germans ?
these teutonic people are best known for their seriousness and hard work , not though for their happy disposition . but a new study presented this week showed that more than two-thirds of germans tend to be happy .
there is a hitch , though .
of those surveyed , 84 percent said they especially experienced happy moments when they were in love or on vacation .
while the love aspect may have to be left up to fate , it 's certainly a good thing that german employees have an average of six weeks paid annual vacation .
that would make anyone happy . the polling institute allensbach surveyed over 1,700 men and women between the ages of 16 and 69 for the magazine emotion .
it found that mostly women , young people or the better educated are most happy . but if a gloomy day comes along , over half of germans will pep up their spirits by listening to music , seeing their partner or meeting up with friends . it also appears that germans believe the old saying that every man is the architect of his own fortune .
almost two-thirds of those surveyed said they believed they could in part influence their own happiness . sex and money will not make you happy anyone who thinks sex is the key to happiness is just high on oxytocin .
the allensbach study showed that sex in fact does not make people happy .
only every third german said a satisfied sex life played a role in their happiness .
the same was true for professional success . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : true love can make swans happy , too and the old saying that money ca n't buy you happiness was once again proven in the study : only 20 percent of those surveyed believe that a lot of money could make them happy . trend researcher matthias horx said he believed germans were " happiness sourpusses " compared to other nations .
horx said an increasing number of germans were breaking out of the typical pessimistic way of thinking and trying to work on their happiness .
but too many germans were still too passive and place too much emphasis on security in order to believe in self-made happiness , horx said . " overcoming fear is not our thing , " horx said .
" germans may be relatively content , but they still think that the world is going downhill . " can a celebrity be happy in germany ? so what does your typical happy german look like ?
they believe predominantly in their own personal success -lrb- 71 percent -rrb- , like to take responsibility -lrb- 68 percent -rrb- and have a lot of interests -lrb- 68 percent -rrb- .
they 're surrounded by longtime friends and acquaintances and seldom have the feeling that others are making more out of their lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael schumacher : the face of a happy german man you 'd think then that the country 's chancellor angela merkel would be on top of the world .
she may be , but only five percent of her nation think she is happy . so who does the average german consider the happiest vip in the population ?
most voted for sevenfold formula one race car driver michael schumacher and former tennis star steffi graf .
both , by the way , do n't live in germany . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

-lrb- 09.02.2007 -rrb- they are german and they smell like flowers nobody ever questions the german sense for personal hygiene .
but maybe somebody should , especially after a group of german teenagers , hooked on smelling like spring flowers , got an entire fire brigade busy .
-lrb- 09.02.2007 -rrb- buddy bankers get touchy-feely a german bank has decided to do away with the stiff-shirt mentality in the workplace , at least linguistically .
from now on , teambank , the buddy-buddy bank , is going with first names and the informal form of address .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 14.02.2007 report : belgium collaborated with nazis in deporting jews großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi germany raised its flag in belgium in 1940 belgian historians have concluded that the country actively cooperated with germany 's nazi regime during world war ii in deporting jews .
the state even went beyond german demands at the time . belgium actively helped the occupying german forces round up and deport the country 's jewish population during the second world war , according to historians from the center for historical research and documentation on war and contemporary society -lrb- ceges -rrb- in brussels . " the belgian state adopted a docile and cooperative attitude in some very diverse , but crucial domains providing collaboration unworthy of a democracy , with a policy that was disastrous for belgian and foreign jews , " the historians said . the report " docile belgium , " commissioned by the belgian parliament , said the state collaborated with the nazis for " economic , as well as ideological and legal-administrative " reasons .
it is the first time belgium 's cooperation with the nazis has been presented in such detail . project leader rudi van doorslaer said " a xenophobic and sometimes anti-semitic culture of the ruling elite " in the 1930s had prepared belgium psychologically for the persecution of the jews .
the " democratic deficit " in the years from 1930 to 1940 had also played a role , doorslaer said . " the step from passive to active collaboration was quickly taken , " doorslaer said as he read the report 's conclusions to the parliament on tuesday . government in exile authorized cooperation with the nazis doorslaer said the country had closed its doors to jews fleeing germany after hitler came to power in 1933 .
according to the ceges study , the deportations began shortly after may 10 , 1940 , when german annexed predominantly german-speaking cantons in eastern belgium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of belgian jews were killed in the auschwitz concentration camp following the nazi invasion in 1940 , the belgian government fled to britain .
but the report found that the government in exile in london during the war " never let it be known that policies had to be adapted and that the behavior of leading civil servants and magistrates was unconstitutional and democratically reprehensible . " however , belgian authorities were not aware in summer 1942 that jews deported to poland were being exterminated , the report said . some 50,000 jews lived in belgium in the 1930s .
about half were killed during the holocaust . many belgians tried to save jewish people belgian jewish groups reacted positively to the study . " this report is fundamental and it is a victory for enlightened democracy , " said philippe markiewicz , head of the coordination committee of belgian jewish organizations . markiewicz said despite the negative impact of the report , there were many belgians who risked their lives to save jews . findings should go into the history books the ceges historians spent three years researching and writing the 1,114-page study and were able to view documents previously unused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis forced the jewish population to wear the yellow star of david prime minister guy verhofstadt apologized already to the jewish community in 2002 for belgium 's role in the holocaust .
his spokesman said that verhofstadt felt the ceges findings should be incorporated into history textbooks . the historians worked out the details of three major phases relating to the persecution of belgian jews .
in october and november 1940 , the central government followed the nazis ' request to require all jews to register with their local authorities . in the summer of 1942 , when the nazi regime began massively deporting belgians of jewish origin , collaboration started diminishing .
brussels refused to make jews wear yellow stars , which the nazis prescribed in order to identify them more easily .
the police in antwerp , on the other hand , arbitrarily arrested 1,243 jews and handed them over to the germans . after the end of the war , belgian military judicial authorities decided that investigating the deportation of the jewish people was too " delicate " to be allowed to continue . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film on wiesenthal 's legacy opens at berlinale a documentary about the life of famous nazi hunter simon wiesenthal has premiered at the berlin international film festival .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign relations -pipe- 14.02.2007 merkel in the ascendency as blair 's star fades großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power shift : blair needs merkel 's help to get an agreement on climate change tony blair has pursued many issues in search of a lasting positive legacy ; mideast peace , strong eu-us ties and climate change .
but as time runs out , angela merkel is the leader most likely to achieve his goals . when tony blair flew to berlin on tuesday for talks on climate change with german chancellor angela merkel , there was more to the meeting than just two international figures attempting to keep the slowly turning wheels of environmental politics going . while the british prime minister arrived in the german capital intent on capitalizing on the slight recent shift in global thinking towards tackling climate change by discussing plans with the current eu president and leader of the g8 , blair was also seizing what many observers see as his last chance to leave a positive legacy when his premiership comes to an end . blair has embarked on many missions during his 10-year tenure in downing street .
his desire to be remembered for one great success on the global stage has led him to pursue campaigns to resolve the israeli-palestinian conflict and bring peace to the middle east , to rebuild the bridges between the united states and europe , and to bring the world together in a binding international agreement on climate change . the war in iraq put paid to both blair 's influence in the middle east and his credibility as the link between europe and the us .
his visit to berlin shows , that with time running out , he has to work with the woman who has replaced him as the point person on all the major issues he held dear if he wants to go down in history as the leader who attempted to save the world from environmental disaster . merkel getting results in the middle east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel gets access and results seemingly beyond blair merkel 's more pragmatic and candid approach to the volatile situation in the middle east , as seen during her recent peacemaking tour of egypt , saudi arabia and the gulf , has so far achieved more than blair could have ever expected from his own efforts . merkel personally persuaded us president george w. bush to accept the link between iraq and a wider middle east settlement ; encouraged the americans to revive the mideast quartet negotiating forum and rallied a number of arab states behind her vision of peace . in another example where she has seemingly succeeded where blair failed , merkel has kept germany free from washington 's apron strings in pursuing dialogue with iran and syria , and a two-state solution of the arab-israeli conflict while maintaining good relations with the white house . meanwhile blair is left to privately rue his decision to join the us in the war against iraq while germany takes the initiative in pushing for a resolution in the middle east , according to mark halsey , author of the book " blair 's legacy . " " iraq pretty much killed his dream of securing peace in the middle east , " halsey said .
" his attempts to save his tarnished reputation in the region by pressing for movement on the arab-israeli peace process also failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has found bush to be a fickle bed-fellow " he was defeated by washington 's pro-israeli neoconservatives , who believe israel should be free to settle its conflict with the palestinians , syria and hezbollah in lebanon on its own terms , " halsey added .
" that ended any real hope of blair leading the way in any peace process , or the americans letting him take the lead . " while germany 's nazi past will never allow it to put serious pressure on israel , merkel has maintained a level of independence in her dealing in the middle east , which has to some extent met with us acceptance and support . a challenging trans-atlantic relationship after the obvious divisions between the us and much of europe over the iraq war , the bush administration expressed relief after germany 's 2005 election when it found a leader it could be civil with after bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , descended into icy silence after the war began . even as us-german relations are back to normal on the surface after the schröder years , germany and the us do not share all the same interests , strategies and perceptions .
iraq and climate change being the clearest examples .
meanwhile , merkel 's boldest trans-atlantic initiative - an economic zone between europe and the us - has also raised little excitement in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is seen as europe 's point person by washington despite the differences , it is now merkel and not blair that the americans come to talk to on the current hot topics .
us experts say the bush administration views merkel as the " anchor point " for its dealings with the eu .
while blair is seen as a lame duck premier who has served his purpose , merkel is a leader on the rise . " she 's the big player in europe right now , " kurt volker , the bush administration 's principal deputy assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs , was quoted as saying after merkel ’ s visit to washington earlier this year . marginalized blair seeks climate agreement blair is expected to stand down as prime minister this spring .
but before he does , he wants to sign off on a new environmental agreement which would bind all the main players to a set of goals on the stabilization of emissions and the establishment of a global price for carbon trading . ironically , as blair pursues his last remaining legacy option , angela merkel is the person best equipped to take the lead in the global climate debate .
as a physicist and the former environment minister who negotiated the kyoto protocol for germany in 1997 , merkel knows that the basic science of climate change is no longer in dispute .
she also knows that the scale and urgency of the challenge the world faces is worse than previously thought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is forced to watch merkel make all the decisions as well as chairing the eu spring summit in march , where leaders will make major decisions on the future of climate and energy security policies , merkel will put climate change at the top of the agenda for this year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .
she will then lead the negotiations for securing agreement on the principles of a more comprehensive deal ahead of a united nations meeting in bali later in the year . by then , blair may have played his last part on the world stage ; watching from the wings as germany 's first female chancellor makes progress on all the issues that eluded him during his time as prime minister . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , blair push for action to prevent climate change german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday after a meeting with british prime minster tony blair that she hopes to set concrete goals on climate protection at the g8 summit of the world 's richest nations in june .

his visit to berlin shows , that with time running out , he has to work with the woman who has replaced him as the point person on all the major issues he held dear if he wants to go down in history as the leader who attempted to save the world from environmental disaster . merkel getting results in the middle east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel gets access and results seemingly beyond blair merkel 's more pragmatic and candid approach to the volatile situation in the middle east , as seen during her recent peacemaking tour of egypt , saudi arabia and the gulf , has so far achieved more than blair could have ever expected from his own efforts . merkel personally persuaded us president george w. bush to accept the link between iraq and a wider middle east settlement ; encouraged the americans to revive the mideast quartet negotiating forum and rallied a number of arab states behind her vision of peace . in another example where she has seemingly succeeded where blair failed , merkel has kept germany free from washington 's apron strings in pursuing dialogue with iran and syria , and a two-state solution of the arab-israeli conflict while maintaining good relations with the white house . meanwhile blair is left to privately rue his decision to join the us in the war against iraq while germany takes the initiative in pushing for a resolution in the middle east , according to mark halsey , author of the book " blair 's legacy . " " iraq pretty much killed his dream of securing peace in the middle east , " halsey said .
" his attempts to save his tarnished reputation in the region by pressing for movement on the arab-israeli peace process also failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has found bush to be a fickle bed-fellow " he was defeated by washington 's pro-israeli neoconservatives , who believe israel should be free to settle its conflict with the palestinians , syria and hezbollah in lebanon on its own terms , " halsey added .
" that ended any real hope of blair leading the way in any peace process , or the americans letting him take the lead . " while germany 's nazi past will never allow it to put serious pressure on israel , merkel has maintained a level of independence in her dealing in the middle east , which has to some extent met with us acceptance and support . a challenging trans-atlantic relationship after the obvious divisions between the us and much of europe over the iraq war , the bush administration expressed relief after germany 's 2005 election when it found a leader it could be civil with after bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , descended into icy silence after the war began . even as us-german relations are back to normal on the surface after the schröder years , germany and the us do not share all the same interests , strategies and perceptions .
iraq and climate change being the clearest examples .
meanwhile , merkel 's boldest trans-atlantic initiative - an economic zone between europe and the us - has also raised little excitement in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is seen as europe 's point person by washington despite the differences , it is now merkel and not blair that the americans come to talk to on the current hot topics .
us experts say the bush administration views merkel as the " anchor point " for its dealings with the eu .
while blair is seen as a lame duck premier who has served his purpose , merkel is a leader on the rise . " she 's the big player in europe right now , " kurt volker , the bush administration 's principal deputy assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs , was quoted as saying after merkel ’ s visit to washington earlier this year . marginalized blair seeks climate agreement blair is expected to stand down as prime minister this spring .
but before he does , he wants to sign off on a new environmental agreement which would bind all the main players to a set of goals on the stabilization of emissions and the establishment of a global price for carbon trading . ironically , as blair pursues his last remaining legacy option , angela merkel is the person best equipped to take the lead in the global climate debate .
as a physicist and the former environment minister who negotiated the kyoto protocol for germany in 1997 , merkel knows that the basic science of climate change is no longer in dispute .
she also knows that the scale and urgency of the challenge the world faces is worse than previously thought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is forced to watch merkel make all the decisions as well as chairing the eu spring summit in march , where leaders will make major decisions on the future of climate and energy security policies , merkel will put climate change at the top of the agenda for this year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .
she will then lead the negotiations for securing agreement on the principles of a more comprehensive deal ahead of a united nations meeting in bali later in the year . by then , blair may have played his last part on the world stage ; watching from the wings as germany 's first female chancellor makes progress on all the issues that eluded him during his time as prime minister . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , blair push for action to prevent climate change german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday after a meeting with british prime minster tony blair that she hopes to set concrete goals on climate protection at the g8 summit of the world 's richest nations in june .
germany faces daunting agenda for eu , g8 presidencies germany will fight to revive international efforts for middle east peace , relaunch the eu constitution and advocate a gentler form of globalization when it takes over the presidencies of the eu and the g8 monday .
-lrb- 01.01.2007 -rrb- merkel , bush stand united on middle east , iran us president bush and german chancellor merkel on thursday called for restraint in the middle east , un action on iran , and urged russia to stick with democratic reforms .

but in the past , italy and france have also had to decide how to battle left-wing terrorists . the italian marxist-leninist terrorist group brigate rosse or red brigades officially disbanded in the 1980s , but pockets have remained , as arrests on monday showed . italian authorities took 15 people into custody .
the suspects are allegedly linked to the red brigades for planning several attacks , including one on a company owned by former premier silvio berlusconi .
they have been accused of " associating with terrorists and participating in an armed group , " the italian interior ministry said . the group , founded in 1973 , has been mainly inoperative since the end of the cold war .
but in the 1970s and 1980s , it was responsible for thousands of acts of violence .
over 400 deaths are attributed to the red brigades . the climax of red brigades terror occurred in 1978 , when the group kidnapped former prime minister aldo moros and subsequently murdered him .
the period belonged to the most dramatic days that italy experienced since the end of the second world war . today , a small plaque on house number 9 in the via caetani in rome 's city center commemorates the moros murder .

all groups wanted to build up an " anti-imperial european front , " said rolf tophoven , director of the institute for terrorism research and security policy in essen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf tophoven is a leading german terrorism expert germany 's red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , the red brigades and action directe in france had a social revolutionary approach in common . " they were against the state , against exploitation and for the interests of the working class , " tophoven said .
" they were aiming for the revolutionary reorganization of society according to a marxist-leninist ideal . " the instrument they chose to meet this goal was violence , and the targets were mainly leading politicians and top managers from the business world .
but the groups never got further than an ideological linking . cross-border cooperation , such as that practiced by islamic terrorist groups today , never existed . justice collaborators helped break up the red brigades the red brigades had dreamt of a communist order in italy .
the result , though , was a climate of uncertainty and violence caused by numerous assaults and kidnappings .
the break came after the moros murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldo moro spent 55 days in the red brigades ' hands before he was killed " this event shocked all of italy , " tophoven said .
" for the first time , a wide front spanning across all political parties formed against the terror from the left . " the decisive aspect of the fight against terror in italy was the so-called pentiti , or justice collaborators .
it offered leading heads of the movement a milder sentence if they cooperated with the state . " this led to the breakup of the red brigades in 1982 , " tophoven said .
over 200 activists received sentences at the time - 85 of them for life . in the meantime , however , many have been released from prison or were granted day release .
in 1998 , when founder renato curcio was released after 24 years in prison , the discussion in italy was nowhere near as heated as in germany .
a german court ruled on monday that former raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt will be released on parole next month .

the major left-wing liberal newspapers , such as le monde and libération condemned action directe .
the publications criticized the lacking reference to the working class , in whose name the group operated . the french government took a tougher stance after the murders of general rene audran in 1985 and renault director georges besse in 1986 .
one year later , the founders of the group , jean-marc rouillan , nathalie ménigon and georges cipriani were arrested and action directe fell apart . in 2006 , the three prisoners requested release on parole after serving the minimum time of 18 years .

but as time runs out , angela merkel is the leader most likely to achieve his goals . when tony blair flew to berlin on tuesday for talks on climate change with german chancellor angela merkel , there was more to the meeting than just two international figures attempting to keep the slowly turning wheels of environmental politics going . while the british prime minister arrived in the german capital intent on capitalizing on the slight recent shift in global thinking towards tackling climate change by discussing plans with the current eu president and leader of the g8 , blair was also seizing what many observers see as his last chance to leave a positive legacy when his premiership comes to an end . blair has embarked on many missions during his 10-year tenure in downing street .
his desire to be remembered for one great success on the global stage has led him to pursue campaigns to resolve the israeli-palestinian conflict and bring peace to the middle east , to rebuild the bridges between the united states and europe , and to bring the world together in a binding international agreement on climate change . the war in iraq put paid to both blair 's influence in the middle east and his credibility as the link between europe and the us .
his visit to berlin shows , that with time running out , he has to work with the woman who has replaced him as the point person on all the major issues he held dear if he wants to go down in history as the leader who attempted to save the world from environmental disaster . merkel getting results in the middle east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel gets access and results seemingly beyond blair merkel 's more pragmatic and candid approach to the volatile situation in the middle east , as seen during her recent peacemaking tour of egypt , saudi arabia and the gulf , has so far achieved more than blair could have ever expected from his own efforts . merkel personally persuaded us president george w. bush to accept the link between iraq and a wider middle east settlement ; encouraged the americans to revive the mideast quartet negotiating forum and rallied a number of arab states behind her vision of peace . in another example where she has seemingly succeeded where blair failed , merkel has kept germany free from washington 's apron strings in pursuing dialogue with iran and syria , and a two-state solution of the arab-israeli conflict while maintaining good relations with the white house . meanwhile blair is left to privately rue his decision to join the us in the war against iraq while germany takes the initiative in pushing for a resolution in the middle east , according to mark halsey , author of the book " blair 's legacy . " " iraq pretty much killed his dream of securing peace in the middle east , " halsey said .
" his attempts to save his tarnished reputation in the region by pressing for movement on the arab-israeli peace process also failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has found bush to be a fickle bed-fellow " he was defeated by washington 's pro-israeli neoconservatives , who believe israel should be free to settle its conflict with the palestinians , syria and hezbollah in lebanon on its own terms , " halsey added .
" that ended any real hope of blair leading the way in any peace process , or the americans letting him take the lead . " while germany 's nazi past will never allow it to put serious pressure on israel , merkel has maintained a level of independence in her dealing in the middle east , which has to some extent met with us acceptance and support . a challenging trans-atlantic relationship after the obvious divisions between the us and much of europe over the iraq war , the bush administration expressed relief after germany 's 2005 election when it found a leader it could be civil with after bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , descended into icy silence after the war began . even as us-german relations are back to normal on the surface after the schröder years , germany and the us do not share all the same interests , strategies and perceptions .

but in the past , italy and france have also had to decide how to battle left-wing terrorists . the italian marxist-leninist terrorist group brigate rosse or red brigades officially disbanded in the 1980s , but pockets have remained , as arrests on monday showed . italian authorities took 15 people into custody .
the suspects are allegedly linked to the red brigades for planning several attacks , including one on a company owned by former premier silvio berlusconi .
they have been accused of " associating with terrorists and participating in an armed group , " the italian interior ministry said . the group , founded in 1973 , has been mainly inoperative since the end of the cold war .
but in the 1970s and 1980s , it was responsible for thousands of acts of violence .
over 400 deaths are attributed to the red brigades . the climax of red brigades terror occurred in 1978 , when the group kidnapped former prime minister aldo moros and subsequently murdered him .
the period belonged to the most dramatic days that italy experienced since the end of the second world war . today , a small plaque on house number 9 in the via caetani in rome 's city center commemorates the moros murder .
on may 9 , 1978 , his body was found here , in the trunk of a parked car . groups had the same goals , but no cooperation left-wing extremists such as the brigate rosse in italy also existed in germany and france in the 1970s .
all groups wanted to build up an " anti-imperial european front , " said rolf tophoven , director of the institute for terrorism research and security policy in essen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf tophoven is a leading german terrorism expert germany 's red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , the red brigades and action directe in france had a social revolutionary approach in common . " they were against the state , against exploitation and for the interests of the working class , " tophoven said .
" they were aiming for the revolutionary reorganization of society according to a marxist-leninist ideal . " the instrument they chose to meet this goal was violence , and the targets were mainly leading politicians and top managers from the business world .
but the groups never got further than an ideological linking . cross-border cooperation , such as that practiced by islamic terrorist groups today , never existed . justice collaborators helped break up the red brigades the red brigades had dreamt of a communist order in italy .
the result , though , was a climate of uncertainty and violence caused by numerous assaults and kidnappings .
the break came after the moros murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldo moro spent 55 days in the red brigades ' hands before he was killed " this event shocked all of italy , " tophoven said .
" for the first time , a wide front spanning across all political parties formed against the terror from the left . " the decisive aspect of the fight against terror in italy was the so-called pentiti , or justice collaborators .
it offered leading heads of the movement a milder sentence if they cooperated with the state . " this led to the breakup of the red brigades in 1982 , " tophoven said .
over 200 activists received sentences at the time - 85 of them for life . in the meantime , however , many have been released from prison or were granted day release .
in 1998 , when founder renato curcio was released after 24 years in prison , the discussion in italy was nowhere near as heated as in germany .
a german court ruled on monday that former raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt will be released on parole next month .
this has sparked a sharp debate across the country . public opinion in france forced government action in france in the 1980s , the government and president francois mitterrand initially reacted relatively reserved to action directe .
as opposed to germany , they did n't consider the state order directly endangered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joëlle aubron from action directe died of cancer in 2006 but with the action directe commando 's first casualties , public opinion changed .
the major left-wing liberal newspapers , such as le monde and libération condemned action directe .
the publications criticized the lacking reference to the working class , in whose name the group operated . the french government took a tougher stance after the murders of general rene audran in 1985 and renault director georges besse in 1986 .
one year later , the founders of the group , jean-marc rouillan , nathalie ménigon and georges cipriani were arrested and action directe fell apart . in 2006 , the three prisoners requested release on parole after serving the minimum time of 18 years .
but authorities denied the request due to their lack of remorse . raf dissolved itself following the successes in italy , the witness leniency program was introduced in germany , too .
but the raf dissolved itself .
in a letter in 1992 , it declared its fight as useless and the raf experiment as failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack on federal prosecutor siegfried buback left three dead following the decision to release mohnhaupt on parole , three raf members remain in prison : christian klar , eva sybille haule and birgit hogefeld .
their prison sentences could also be changed into a suspended sentence after 2009 . " in all three countries , the social revolutionary experiments drenched in violence and terrorist attacks failed , " tophoven said .
the virtually worldwide collapse of real socialism ultimately contributed , too . " the story of the anti-imperialist european front is a story of failure , " tophoven said . ina rottscheidt -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de release of former militant sparks mixed feelings in germany most german political parties consider the release of the one-time terrorist and red army faction leader brigitte mohnhaupt as a sign of justice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign relations -pipe- 14.02.2007 merkel in the ascendency as blair 's star fades großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power shift : blair needs merkel 's help to get an agreement on climate change tony blair has pursued many issues in search of a lasting positive legacy ; mideast peace , strong eu-us ties and climate change .
but as time runs out , angela merkel is the leader most likely to achieve his goals . when tony blair flew to berlin on tuesday for talks on climate change with german chancellor angela merkel , there was more to the meeting than just two international figures attempting to keep the slowly turning wheels of environmental politics going . while the british prime minister arrived in the german capital intent on capitalizing on the slight recent shift in global thinking towards tackling climate change by discussing plans with the current eu president and leader of the g8 , blair was also seizing what many observers see as his last chance to leave a positive legacy when his premiership comes to an end . blair has embarked on many missions during his 10-year tenure in downing street .
his desire to be remembered for one great success on the global stage has led him to pursue campaigns to resolve the israeli-palestinian conflict and bring peace to the middle east , to rebuild the bridges between the united states and europe , and to bring the world together in a binding international agreement on climate change . the war in iraq put paid to both blair 's influence in the middle east and his credibility as the link between europe and the us .
his visit to berlin shows , that with time running out , he has to work with the woman who has replaced him as the point person on all the major issues he held dear if he wants to go down in history as the leader who attempted to save the world from environmental disaster . merkel getting results in the middle east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel gets access and results seemingly beyond blair merkel 's more pragmatic and candid approach to the volatile situation in the middle east , as seen during her recent peacemaking tour of egypt , saudi arabia and the gulf , has so far achieved more than blair could have ever expected from his own efforts . merkel personally persuaded us president george w. bush to accept the link between iraq and a wider middle east settlement ; encouraged the americans to revive the mideast quartet negotiating forum and rallied a number of arab states behind her vision of peace . in another example where she has seemingly succeeded where blair failed , merkel has kept germany free from washington 's apron strings in pursuing dialogue with iran and syria , and a two-state solution of the arab-israeli conflict while maintaining good relations with the white house . meanwhile blair is left to privately rue his decision to join the us in the war against iraq while germany takes the initiative in pushing for a resolution in the middle east , according to mark halsey , author of the book " blair 's legacy . " " iraq pretty much killed his dream of securing peace in the middle east , " halsey said .
" his attempts to save his tarnished reputation in the region by pressing for movement on the arab-israeli peace process also failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has found bush to be a fickle bed-fellow " he was defeated by washington 's pro-israeli neoconservatives , who believe israel should be free to settle its conflict with the palestinians , syria and hezbollah in lebanon on its own terms , " halsey added .
" that ended any real hope of blair leading the way in any peace process , or the americans letting him take the lead . " while germany 's nazi past will never allow it to put serious pressure on israel , merkel has maintained a level of independence in her dealing in the middle east , which has to some extent met with us acceptance and support . a challenging trans-atlantic relationship after the obvious divisions between the us and much of europe over the iraq war , the bush administration expressed relief after germany 's 2005 election when it found a leader it could be civil with after bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , descended into icy silence after the war began . even as us-german relations are back to normal on the surface after the schröder years , germany and the us do not share all the same interests , strategies and perceptions .
iraq and climate change being the clearest examples .
meanwhile , merkel 's boldest trans-atlantic initiative - an economic zone between europe and the us - has also raised little excitement in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is seen as europe 's point person by washington despite the differences , it is now merkel and not blair that the americans come to talk to on the current hot topics .
us experts say the bush administration views merkel as the " anchor point " for its dealings with the eu .
while blair is seen as a lame duck premier who has served his purpose , merkel is a leader on the rise . " she 's the big player in europe right now , " kurt volker , the bush administration 's principal deputy assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs , was quoted as saying after merkel ’ s visit to washington earlier this year . marginalized blair seeks climate agreement blair is expected to stand down as prime minister this spring .
but before he does , he wants to sign off on a new environmental agreement which would bind all the main players to a set of goals on the stabilization of emissions and the establishment of a global price for carbon trading . ironically , as blair pursues his last remaining legacy option , angela merkel is the person best equipped to take the lead in the global climate debate .
as a physicist and the former environment minister who negotiated the kyoto protocol for germany in 1997 , merkel knows that the basic science of climate change is no longer in dispute .
she also knows that the scale and urgency of the challenge the world faces is worse than previously thought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is forced to watch merkel make all the decisions as well as chairing the eu spring summit in march , where leaders will make major decisions on the future of climate and energy security policies , merkel will put climate change at the top of the agenda for this year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .
she will then lead the negotiations for securing agreement on the principles of a more comprehensive deal ahead of a united nations meeting in bali later in the year . by then , blair may have played his last part on the world stage ; watching from the wings as germany 's first female chancellor makes progress on all the issues that eluded him during his time as prime minister . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , blair push for action to prevent climate change german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday after a meeting with british prime minster tony blair that she hopes to set concrete goals on climate protection at the g8 summit of the world 's richest nations in june .
germany faces daunting agenda for eu , g8 presidencies germany will fight to revive international efforts for middle east peace , relaunch the eu constitution and advocate a gentler form of globalization when it takes over the presidencies of the eu and the g8 monday .
-lrb- 01.01.2007 -rrb- merkel , bush stand united on middle east , iran us president bush and german chancellor merkel on thursday called for restraint in the middle east , un action on iran , and urged russia to stick with democratic reforms .

but in the past , italy and france have also had to decide how to battle left-wing terrorists . the italian marxist-leninist terrorist group brigate rosse or red brigades officially disbanded in the 1980s , but pockets have remained , as arrests on monday showed . italian authorities took 15 people into custody .
the suspects are allegedly linked to the red brigades for planning several attacks , including one on a company owned by former premier silvio berlusconi .
they have been accused of " associating with terrorists and participating in an armed group , " the italian interior ministry said . the group , founded in 1973 , has been mainly inoperative since the end of the cold war .
but in the 1970s and 1980s , it was responsible for thousands of acts of violence .
over 400 deaths are attributed to the red brigades . the climax of red brigades terror occurred in 1978 , when the group kidnapped former prime minister aldo moros and subsequently murdered him .
the period belonged to the most dramatic days that italy experienced since the end of the second world war . today , a small plaque on house number 9 in the via caetani in rome 's city center commemorates the moros murder .
on may 9 , 1978 , his body was found here , in the trunk of a parked car . groups had the same goals , but no cooperation left-wing extremists such as the brigate rosse in italy also existed in germany and france in the 1970s .
all groups wanted to build up an " anti-imperial european front , " said rolf tophoven , director of the institute for terrorism research and security policy in essen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf tophoven is a leading german terrorism expert germany 's red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , the red brigades and action directe in france had a social revolutionary approach in common . " they were against the state , against exploitation and for the interests of the working class , " tophoven said .
" they were aiming for the revolutionary reorganization of society according to a marxist-leninist ideal . " the instrument they chose to meet this goal was violence , and the targets were mainly leading politicians and top managers from the business world .
but the groups never got further than an ideological linking . cross-border cooperation , such as that practiced by islamic terrorist groups today , never existed . justice collaborators helped break up the red brigades the red brigades had dreamt of a communist order in italy .
the result , though , was a climate of uncertainty and violence caused by numerous assaults and kidnappings .
the break came after the moros murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldo moro spent 55 days in the red brigades ' hands before he was killed " this event shocked all of italy , " tophoven said .
" for the first time , a wide front spanning across all political parties formed against the terror from the left . " the decisive aspect of the fight against terror in italy was the so-called pentiti , or justice collaborators .
it offered leading heads of the movement a milder sentence if they cooperated with the state . " this led to the breakup of the red brigades in 1982 , " tophoven said .
over 200 activists received sentences at the time - 85 of them for life . in the meantime , however , many have been released from prison or were granted day release .
in 1998 , when founder renato curcio was released after 24 years in prison , the discussion in italy was nowhere near as heated as in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign relations -pipe- 14.02.2007 merkel in the ascendency as blair 's star fades großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power shift : blair needs merkel 's help to get an agreement on climate change tony blair has pursued many issues in search of a lasting positive legacy ; mideast peace , strong eu-us ties and climate change .
but as time runs out , angela merkel is the leader most likely to achieve his goals . when tony blair flew to berlin on tuesday for talks on climate change with german chancellor angela merkel , there was more to the meeting than just two international figures attempting to keep the slowly turning wheels of environmental politics going . while the british prime minister arrived in the german capital intent on capitalizing on the slight recent shift in global thinking towards tackling climate change by discussing plans with the current eu president and leader of the g8 , blair was also seizing what many observers see as his last chance to leave a positive legacy when his premiership comes to an end . blair has embarked on many missions during his 10-year tenure in downing street .
his desire to be remembered for one great success on the global stage has led him to pursue campaigns to resolve the israeli-palestinian conflict and bring peace to the middle east , to rebuild the bridges between the united states and europe , and to bring the world together in a binding international agreement on climate change . the war in iraq put paid to both blair 's influence in the middle east and his credibility as the link between europe and the us .
his visit to berlin shows , that with time running out , he has to work with the woman who has replaced him as the point person on all the major issues he held dear if he wants to go down in history as the leader who attempted to save the world from environmental disaster . merkel getting results in the middle east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel gets access and results seemingly beyond blair merkel 's more pragmatic and candid approach to the volatile situation in the middle east , as seen during her recent peacemaking tour of egypt , saudi arabia and the gulf , has so far achieved more than blair could have ever expected from his own efforts . merkel personally persuaded us president george w. bush to accept the link between iraq and a wider middle east settlement ; encouraged the americans to revive the mideast quartet negotiating forum and rallied a number of arab states behind her vision of peace . in another example where she has seemingly succeeded where blair failed , merkel has kept germany free from washington 's apron strings in pursuing dialogue with iran and syria , and a two-state solution of the arab-israeli conflict while maintaining good relations with the white house . meanwhile blair is left to privately rue his decision to join the us in the war against iraq while germany takes the initiative in pushing for a resolution in the middle east , according to mark halsey , author of the book " blair 's legacy . " " iraq pretty much killed his dream of securing peace in the middle east , " halsey said .
" his attempts to save his tarnished reputation in the region by pressing for movement on the arab-israeli peace process also failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has found bush to be a fickle bed-fellow " he was defeated by washington 's pro-israeli neoconservatives , who believe israel should be free to settle its conflict with the palestinians , syria and hezbollah in lebanon on its own terms , " halsey added .
" that ended any real hope of blair leading the way in any peace process , or the americans letting him take the lead . " while germany 's nazi past will never allow it to put serious pressure on israel , merkel has maintained a level of independence in her dealing in the middle east , which has to some extent met with us acceptance and support . a challenging trans-atlantic relationship after the obvious divisions between the us and much of europe over the iraq war , the bush administration expressed relief after germany 's 2005 election when it found a leader it could be civil with after bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , descended into icy silence after the war began . even as us-german relations are back to normal on the surface after the schröder years , germany and the us do not share all the same interests , strategies and perceptions .
iraq and climate change being the clearest examples .
meanwhile , merkel 's boldest trans-atlantic initiative - an economic zone between europe and the us - has also raised little excitement in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is seen as europe 's point person by washington despite the differences , it is now merkel and not blair that the americans come to talk to on the current hot topics .
us experts say the bush administration views merkel as the " anchor point " for its dealings with the eu .
while blair is seen as a lame duck premier who has served his purpose , merkel is a leader on the rise . " she 's the big player in europe right now , " kurt volker , the bush administration 's principal deputy assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs , was quoted as saying after merkel ’ s visit to washington earlier this year . marginalized blair seeks climate agreement blair is expected to stand down as prime minister this spring .
but before he does , he wants to sign off on a new environmental agreement which would bind all the main players to a set of goals on the stabilization of emissions and the establishment of a global price for carbon trading . ironically , as blair pursues his last remaining legacy option , angela merkel is the person best equipped to take the lead in the global climate debate .
as a physicist and the former environment minister who negotiated the kyoto protocol for germany in 1997 , merkel knows that the basic science of climate change is no longer in dispute .
she also knows that the scale and urgency of the challenge the world faces is worse than previously thought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is forced to watch merkel make all the decisions as well as chairing the eu spring summit in march , where leaders will make major decisions on the future of climate and energy security policies , merkel will put climate change at the top of the agenda for this year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .
she will then lead the negotiations for securing agreement on the principles of a more comprehensive deal ahead of a united nations meeting in bali later in the year . by then , blair may have played his last part on the world stage ; watching from the wings as germany 's first female chancellor makes progress on all the issues that eluded him during his time as prime minister . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , blair push for action to prevent climate change german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday after a meeting with british prime minster tony blair that she hopes to set concrete goals on climate protection at the g8 summit of the world 's richest nations in june .

german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler confirmed that it is no longer ruling out the sale of its loss-making us subsidiary chrysler .
the company presented a plan for chrysler at its annual earnings conference on wednesday . daimlerchrysler is putting the future of its subsidiary chrysler to the test .
the company said it was considering a sale , but also examining strategic options with partners to restructure its us business . an immediate step presented at the company 's earning conference wednesday was to close one chrysler plant in the us , resulting in some13,000 job cuts from 2007 to 2009 , the company announced wednesday .
when the layoffs are complete , the chrysler group will be nearly half the size it was at its peak when it was purchased by daimler benz in 1999 . the auto giant 's frankfurt office released a statement saying the job cuts were part of a three-year chrysler " recovery and transformation plan that seeks a return to profitability by 2008 .

however , the company 's troubled chrysler division suffered a loss of 1.1 billion euros . " we are not ruling out any option in order to find the best solution for the chrysler group and daimlerchrysler , " the company said in an ad hoc announcement .

but as time runs out , angela merkel is the leader most likely to achieve his goals . when tony blair flew to berlin on tuesday for talks on climate change with german chancellor angela merkel , there was more to the meeting than just two international figures attempting to keep the slowly turning wheels of environmental politics going . while the british prime minister arrived in the german capital intent on capitalizing on the slight recent shift in global thinking towards tackling climate change by discussing plans with the current eu president and leader of the g8 , blair was also seizing what many observers see as his last chance to leave a positive legacy when his premiership comes to an end . blair has embarked on many missions during his 10-year tenure in downing street .
his desire to be remembered for one great success on the global stage has led him to pursue campaigns to resolve the israeli-palestinian conflict and bring peace to the middle east , to rebuild the bridges between the united states and europe , and to bring the world together in a binding international agreement on climate change . the war in iraq put paid to both blair 's influence in the middle east and his credibility as the link between europe and the us .
his visit to berlin shows , that with time running out , he has to work with the woman who has replaced him as the point person on all the major issues he held dear if he wants to go down in history as the leader who attempted to save the world from environmental disaster . merkel getting results in the middle east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel gets access and results seemingly beyond blair merkel 's more pragmatic and candid approach to the volatile situation in the middle east , as seen during her recent peacemaking tour of egypt , saudi arabia and the gulf , has so far achieved more than blair could have ever expected from his own efforts . merkel personally persuaded us president george w. bush to accept the link between iraq and a wider middle east settlement ; encouraged the americans to revive the mideast quartet negotiating forum and rallied a number of arab states behind her vision of peace . in another example where she has seemingly succeeded where blair failed , merkel has kept germany free from washington 's apron strings in pursuing dialogue with iran and syria , and a two-state solution of the arab-israeli conflict while maintaining good relations with the white house . meanwhile blair is left to privately rue his decision to join the us in the war against iraq while germany takes the initiative in pushing for a resolution in the middle east , according to mark halsey , author of the book " blair 's legacy . " " iraq pretty much killed his dream of securing peace in the middle east , " halsey said .
" his attempts to save his tarnished reputation in the region by pressing for movement on the arab-israeli peace process also failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has found bush to be a fickle bed-fellow " he was defeated by washington 's pro-israeli neoconservatives , who believe israel should be free to settle its conflict with the palestinians , syria and hezbollah in lebanon on its own terms , " halsey added .
" that ended any real hope of blair leading the way in any peace process , or the americans letting him take the lead . " while germany 's nazi past will never allow it to put serious pressure on israel , merkel has maintained a level of independence in her dealing in the middle east , which has to some extent met with us acceptance and support . a challenging trans-atlantic relationship after the obvious divisions between the us and much of europe over the iraq war , the bush administration expressed relief after germany 's 2005 election when it found a leader it could be civil with after bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , descended into icy silence after the war began . even as us-german relations are back to normal on the surface after the schröder years , germany and the us do not share all the same interests , strategies and perceptions .
iraq and climate change being the clearest examples .
meanwhile , merkel 's boldest trans-atlantic initiative - an economic zone between europe and the us - has also raised little excitement in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is seen as europe 's point person by washington despite the differences , it is now merkel and not blair that the americans come to talk to on the current hot topics .
us experts say the bush administration views merkel as the " anchor point " for its dealings with the eu .
while blair is seen as a lame duck premier who has served his purpose , merkel is a leader on the rise . " she 's the big player in europe right now , " kurt volker , the bush administration 's principal deputy assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs , was quoted as saying after merkel ’ s visit to washington earlier this year . marginalized blair seeks climate agreement blair is expected to stand down as prime minister this spring .
but before he does , he wants to sign off on a new environmental agreement which would bind all the main players to a set of goals on the stabilization of emissions and the establishment of a global price for carbon trading . ironically , as blair pursues his last remaining legacy option , angela merkel is the person best equipped to take the lead in the global climate debate .
as a physicist and the former environment minister who negotiated the kyoto protocol for germany in 1997 , merkel knows that the basic science of climate change is no longer in dispute .
she also knows that the scale and urgency of the challenge the world faces is worse than previously thought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is forced to watch merkel make all the decisions as well as chairing the eu spring summit in march , where leaders will make major decisions on the future of climate and energy security policies , merkel will put climate change at the top of the agenda for this year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .
she will then lead the negotiations for securing agreement on the principles of a more comprehensive deal ahead of a united nations meeting in bali later in the year . by then , blair may have played his last part on the world stage ; watching from the wings as germany 's first female chancellor makes progress on all the issues that eluded him during his time as prime minister . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , blair push for action to prevent climate change german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday after a meeting with british prime minster tony blair that she hopes to set concrete goals on climate protection at the g8 summit of the world 's richest nations in june .

german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler confirmed that it is no longer ruling out the sale of its loss-making us subsidiary chrysler .
the company presented a plan for chrysler at its annual earnings conference on wednesday . daimlerchrysler is putting the future of its subsidiary chrysler to the test .
the company said it was considering a sale , but also examining strategic options with partners to restructure its us business . an immediate step presented at the company 's earning conference wednesday was to close one chrysler plant in the us , resulting in some13,000 job cuts from 2007 to 2009 , the company announced wednesday .
when the layoffs are complete , the chrysler group will be nearly half the size it was at its peak when it was purchased by daimler benz in 1999 . the auto giant 's frankfurt office released a statement saying the job cuts were part of a three-year chrysler " recovery and transformation plan that seeks a return to profitability by 2008 .

but a change in format has made the uefa cup harder .
it 's a trophy teams want to win . if you believe what you hear , you could be fooled into thinking that there is only one big european fixture on the horizon for germany 's teams in the next week . with their domestic league form mixed at best , bayern munich 's season hinges on their champions league clash against real madrid on feb .
20 .
it is undoubtedly a huge game ; if bayern lose the tie over two legs , they will have to resign themselves to a season without silverware . but the bavarian giants are not the only german team still in the hunt for european honors .
bayer leverkusen and werder bremen take on difficult opposition on wednesday night in the first knock-out round of the uefa cup .
leverkusen take on english premiership side blackburn rovers while werder have a tricky tie against ajax amsterdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uefa cup -lrb- r . -rrb- with its more prestigious relative despite its reputation as the champions league 's poorer relation , the uefa cup is still a hard fought and extremely difficult competition to win .
after format changes in the 2004/05 season that introduced a league round and the inclusion of those third-placed champions league sides that missed out on qualification , the uefa cup now has more games and now features tougher teams . german clubs go for first win in a decade it has been exactly ten years since a german team last won the trophy - schalke 04 beating inter milan on penalties in the 1996/07 final - and the list of winners since shows that the uefa cup is hardly a competition for minnows . leverkusen and bremen both hope to mark the anniversary by bringing the cup back to germany for the first time in a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen entered the uefa cup after losing to barca for werder , the uefa cup may at first seem like an anti-climax .
thrust into undoubtedly the hardest group stage of this season 's champions league , thomas schaaf 's side cruelly missed out on an historic qualification from group a by one point after beating english champions chelsea at the weserstadion and holding the current european champions barcelona to a draw . werder dropped into the uefa cup at the start of the knock-out stages and instantly became one of the favorites to win the trophy on the back of their bundesliga form and improving european credentials .
however , if bremen thought they were in for an easy time , the draw had them thinking again . bremen face dutch masters in sticky knock-out tie ajax amsterdam have four european cups to their name , one uefa cup , 29 dutch championship titles and are currently second in the dutch league .
a club which did much to introduce the concept of total football to the world , a fluid system which allows the outfield players the freedom to swap positions , ajax will prove to be a real test for bremen . while not exactly a team known for a lack of confidence , two successive defeats in the bundesliga have put werder six points behind leaders schalke 04 and have knocked them out of their free-scoring rhythm .
" we 'll have to see whether this latest defeat gives us the spur we need - or not , " bremen 's germany striker miroslav klose said tuesday . bildunterschrift : ajax players prepare for wednesday 's clash in bremen ajax , whose dutch title hopes have been re-ignited by closest rivals psv eindhoven 's poor run , have defensive worries with injuries ruling out defenders urby emanuelson , zdenek grygera and thomas vermaelen . recently re-signed amsterdam legend edgar davids is cup-tied for the remainder of the competition after featuring for former club tottenham hotspur in the group stage . for bayer leverkusen , the uefa cup offers a glamorous respite from the rigors of their mediocre bundesliga campaign .
however , things will have to pick up for michael skibbe 's team if they are to carry on enjoying its distractions . unconvincing leverkusen meet battling blackburn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benni mccarthy -lrb- center -rrb- has blackburn dreaming currently lying seventh in the league , bayer have had a mixed season domestically and have also struggled to maintain any consistency in europe .
leverkusen limped out of group b in third place with just four points and will meet group e winners blackburn , a team that only dropped two points in qualifying . blackburn are also enduring a less than exemplary season in the premiership but have definitely reserved their best performances for the uefa cup , fired by pre-season signing benni mccarthy , a uefa cup winner with fc porto in 2003 . rovers play a robust game as one would expect from a team managed by the combative mark hughes , a former bayern munich player .
leverkusen 's progress is far from assured . injuries plague both sides ahead of clash things have been made worse by injuries to defenders juan and roque junior and coach skibbe may also have to do without captain carsten ramelow .
the influential midfielder made his comeback from a knee operation in saturday 's 2-2 draw against eintracht frankfurt but he is still far from fully match fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten ramelow , left , may not be risked against blackburn " the comeback was way too soon but i needed him , " said skibbe , who will have to think hard before asking ramelow to play a second game in five days . blackburn hope midfielder david dunn will have recovered from a dead leg in time for the leverkusen match after picking up the injury at the weekend .
" it should settle down and it should n't be a problem for him , " hughes told the club 's web site on tuesday . rovers will also be without long-term injury victims robbie savage and andre ooijer , who are both recovering from broken legs . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german clubs learn next uefa cup foes tuesday saw the draw for the group stage of the uefa cup .

thrust into undoubtedly the hardest group stage of this season 's champions league , thomas schaaf 's side cruelly missed out on an historic qualification from group a by one point after beating english champions chelsea at the weserstadion and holding the current european champions barcelona to a draw . werder dropped into the uefa cup at the start of the knock-out stages and instantly became one of the favorites to win the trophy on the back of their bundesliga form and improving european credentials .
however , if bremen thought they were in for an easy time , the draw had them thinking again . bremen face dutch masters in sticky knock-out tie ajax amsterdam have four european cups to their name , one uefa cup , 29 dutch championship titles and are currently second in the dutch league .
a club which did much to introduce the concept of total football to the world , a fluid system which allows the outfield players the freedom to swap positions , ajax will prove to be a real test for bremen . while not exactly a team known for a lack of confidence , two successive defeats in the bundesliga have put werder six points behind leaders schalke 04 and have knocked them out of their free-scoring rhythm .
" we 'll have to see whether this latest defeat gives us the spur we need - or not , " bremen 's germany striker miroslav klose said tuesday . bildunterschrift : ajax players prepare for wednesday 's clash in bremen ajax , whose dutch title hopes have been re-ignited by closest rivals psv eindhoven 's poor run , have defensive worries with injuries ruling out defenders urby emanuelson , zdenek grygera and thomas vermaelen . recently re-signed amsterdam legend edgar davids is cup-tied for the remainder of the competition after featuring for former club tottenham hotspur in the group stage . for bayer leverkusen , the uefa cup offers a glamorous respite from the rigors of their mediocre bundesliga campaign .
however , things will have to pick up for michael skibbe 's team if they are to carry on enjoying its distractions . unconvincing leverkusen meet battling blackburn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benni mccarthy -lrb- center -rrb- has blackburn dreaming currently lying seventh in the league , bayer have had a mixed season domestically and have also struggled to maintain any consistency in europe .
leverkusen limped out of group b in third place with just four points and will meet group e winners blackburn , a team that only dropped two points in qualifying . blackburn are also enduring a less than exemplary season in the premiership but have definitely reserved their best performances for the uefa cup , fired by pre-season signing benni mccarthy , a uefa cup winner with fc porto in 2003 . rovers play a robust game as one would expect from a team managed by the combative mark hughes , a former bayern munich player .
leverkusen 's progress is far from assured . injuries plague both sides ahead of clash things have been made worse by injuries to defenders juan and roque junior and coach skibbe may also have to do without captain carsten ramelow .
the influential midfielder made his comeback from a knee operation in saturday 's 2-2 draw against eintracht frankfurt but he is still far from fully match fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten ramelow , left , may not be risked against blackburn " the comeback was way too soon but i needed him , " said skibbe , who will have to think hard before asking ramelow to play a second game in five days . blackburn hope midfielder david dunn will have recovered from a dead leg in time for the leverkusen match after picking up the injury at the weekend .
" it should settle down and it should n't be a problem for him , " hughes told the club 's web site on tuesday . rovers will also be without long-term injury victims robbie savage and andre ooijer , who are both recovering from broken legs . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german clubs learn next uefa cup foes tuesday saw the draw for the group stage of the uefa cup .

" the report was endorsed , after sifting through 270 proposed amendments , by 382 representatives , another 256 voted against it and there were 74 abstentions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian mp claudio fava : it was a wider practice as well as condemning " the acceptance and concealing " of the clandestine prisoner transfers by the secret services and governments of certain european countries , the report expressed grave doubts over assertions by nations that they were unaware of the practice . the parliament , the eu 's only directly elected body , called for pressure to be put on the concerned governments " to give full and true information " about the operations and " where necessary to start hearings and commission an independent investigation without delay . " the us administration acknowledged last september that the cia was operating a secret detention program outside the united states . ' not a couple of episodes ' the program began in late 2001 , following the sept .
11 terror attacks in the united states , and continued until late 2005 , when questions began to be asked in the press and elsewhere , according to the eu report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for khalid el masri , it was a case of mistaken identity italian mep claudio fava , who headed the parliamentary inquiry , cited 1,245 cia " extraordinary rendition " flights to and from european airports or through european airspace . " if we put all the eye witness accounts together , then we can see that it was not a question of a couple of episodes , but of a wider practice , " fava told german public television station ard . pressure on the vote with almost half the total eu members implicated , there were reports of pressure from national governments on the meps ahead of the vote , as well as splits within the parliamentary groupings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurnaz and his lawyer addressed the eu parliament the report named 13 eu nations - austria , britain , cyprus , denmark , germany , greece , ireland , italy , poland , portugal , romania , spain and sweden - along with non-eu countries bosnia , macedonia and turkey . over six months , the parliamentary commission took evidence from 130 people , including government officials , secret service agents , judges , lawyers , journalists and ngo representatives . call for enquiries eu justice commissioner franco frattini urged member states to hold national inquiries into the matter . " the governments need to reveal the truth , even if the truth is disturbing , " he told the parliament . magistrates and governments should hold administrative enquiries and punish officials found guilty of colluding with illegal cia action , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice minister franco frattini urges national enquiries günter gloser , european affairs minister for germany , which holds the rotating eu presidency , said the eu parliament 's report included conclusions " that go very far . " he deplored that some " assertions are swiftly transformed into facts " and added that " from our point of view , more moderated statements would be preferable . " the parliamentary vote came at a moment when judges in germany , italy and spain are investigating suspected transfers of terrorism suspects . in germany , news has focused on two cases .
in one , a german of lebanese descent , khalid el masri , was taken in late 2003 by the cia from macedonia to a prison in afghanistan , in a case of mistaken identity . murat kurnaz , a german-born turk who lived in bremen , spent four years in the us military prison at guantanamo bay , after having been held in afghanistan .

" google said in paris that it would appeal against the decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google co-founders larry page , left , and sergey brin " google regrets today 's decision and will appeal , " said google news legal counsel for europe yoram elkaim in paris .
" we continue to believe that the google news service conforms with copyright law and benefits publishers as much as internet users , " he said . the president of the copiepresse grouping of belgium 's french-language newspapers , margaret boribon , said the group did not intend to keep up the legal battle " for the fun of it " and preferred to " negotiate " a settlement . long-standing suit a year ago copiepresse lodged a belgian lawsuit against google news to require the internet group to request permission from copiepresse and to pay it to show its articles on the google news site . on september 5 , a belgian court ordered google news to stop reproducing content from french-language and german-language newspapers in belgium on its belgian website and imposed fines as long as it did not respect the decision . in that ruling , the court told the company to pay copiepresse a million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- each day that the forbidden articles , pictures and graphics appeared on its site . in tuesday 's decision , the judge backed google 's claim that the fines were " disproportionate " and reduced them to a more " reasonable " 25,000 euros per day . copiepresse lawyer bernard magrez said that meant google would no longer have to pay a total of 130 million euros but three million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court decision is being hailed as a victory for news providers in a hearing in november , google 's lawyers argued that the papers were seeking to profit from its immense financial success in recent years . google 's main defense was that it is a search engine that helps users find information on other websites and not a so-called portal that hosts its own information . case could have broader implications the case in belgium is being closely watched by other news providers , including agence france-presse , which has been in dispute with google in france as well as in the united states . a spokesman for the paris-based world association of newspapers welcomed the court 's ruling and said that google and other internet companies would now have to be more careful about treading on papers ' copyrights . " it shows that content providers and publishers have to be part of the discussion with search engines , otherwise it 's going to end up in court , " said wan spokesman larry kilman . afp chief executive pierre louette also welcomed the decision . " it 's important that a court recognizes that permission must be given before using content , " he said in paris . after opening news websites for about thirty countries in four years , google launched a belgian version in january 2006 , much to the concern of the country 's french-speaking newspapers . the newspapers had also asked microsoft to stop the unauthorized publishing of articles on its " www.msn.be " site , which the company later did .

after format changes in the 2004/05 season that introduced a league round and the inclusion of those third-placed champions league sides that missed out on qualification , the uefa cup now has more games and now features tougher teams . german clubs go for first win in a decade it has been exactly ten years since a german team last won the trophy - schalke 04 beating inter milan on penalties in the 1996/07 final - and the list of winners since shows that the uefa cup is hardly a competition for minnows . leverkusen and bremen both hope to mark the anniversary by bringing the cup back to germany for the first time in a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen entered the uefa cup after losing to barca for werder , the uefa cup may at first seem like an anti-climax .
thrust into undoubtedly the hardest group stage of this season 's champions league , thomas schaaf 's side cruelly missed out on an historic qualification from group a by one point after beating english champions chelsea at the weserstadion and holding the current european champions barcelona to a draw . werder dropped into the uefa cup at the start of the knock-out stages and instantly became one of the favorites to win the trophy on the back of their bundesliga form and improving european credentials .
however , if bremen thought they were in for an easy time , the draw had them thinking again . bremen face dutch masters in sticky knock-out tie ajax amsterdam have four european cups to their name , one uefa cup , 29 dutch championship titles and are currently second in the dutch league .
a club which did much to introduce the concept of total football to the world , a fluid system which allows the outfield players the freedom to swap positions , ajax will prove to be a real test for bremen . while not exactly a team known for a lack of confidence , two successive defeats in the bundesliga have put werder six points behind leaders schalke 04 and have knocked them out of their free-scoring rhythm .
" we 'll have to see whether this latest defeat gives us the spur we need - or not , " bremen 's germany striker miroslav klose said tuesday . bildunterschrift : ajax players prepare for wednesday 's clash in bremen ajax , whose dutch title hopes have been re-ignited by closest rivals psv eindhoven 's poor run , have defensive worries with injuries ruling out defenders urby emanuelson , zdenek grygera and thomas vermaelen . recently re-signed amsterdam legend edgar davids is cup-tied for the remainder of the competition after featuring for former club tottenham hotspur in the group stage . for bayer leverkusen , the uefa cup offers a glamorous respite from the rigors of their mediocre bundesliga campaign .
however , things will have to pick up for michael skibbe 's team if they are to carry on enjoying its distractions . unconvincing leverkusen meet battling blackburn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benni mccarthy -lrb- center -rrb- has blackburn dreaming currently lying seventh in the league , bayer have had a mixed season domestically and have also struggled to maintain any consistency in europe .
leverkusen limped out of group b in third place with just four points and will meet group e winners blackburn , a team that only dropped two points in qualifying . blackburn are also enduring a less than exemplary season in the premiership but have definitely reserved their best performances for the uefa cup , fired by pre-season signing benni mccarthy , a uefa cup winner with fc porto in 2003 . rovers play a robust game as one would expect from a team managed by the combative mark hughes , a former bayern munich player .
leverkusen 's progress is far from assured . injuries plague both sides ahead of clash things have been made worse by injuries to defenders juan and roque junior and coach skibbe may also have to do without captain carsten ramelow .
the influential midfielder made his comeback from a knee operation in saturday 's 2-2 draw against eintracht frankfurt but he is still far from fully match fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten ramelow , left , may not be risked against blackburn " the comeback was way too soon but i needed him , " said skibbe , who will have to think hard before asking ramelow to play a second game in five days . blackburn hope midfielder david dunn will have recovered from a dead leg in time for the leverkusen match after picking up the injury at the weekend .
" it should settle down and it should n't be a problem for him , " hughes told the club 's web site on tuesday . rovers will also be without long-term injury victims robbie savage and andre ooijer , who are both recovering from broken legs . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german clubs learn next uefa cup foes tuesday saw the draw for the group stage of the uefa cup .

but as time runs out , angela merkel is the leader most likely to achieve his goals . when tony blair flew to berlin on tuesday for talks on climate change with german chancellor angela merkel , there was more to the meeting than just two international figures attempting to keep the slowly turning wheels of environmental politics going . while the british prime minister arrived in the german capital intent on capitalizing on the slight recent shift in global thinking towards tackling climate change by discussing plans with the current eu president and leader of the g8 , blair was also seizing what many observers see as his last chance to leave a positive legacy when his premiership comes to an end . blair has embarked on many missions during his 10-year tenure in downing street .
his desire to be remembered for one great success on the global stage has led him to pursue campaigns to resolve the israeli-palestinian conflict and bring peace to the middle east , to rebuild the bridges between the united states and europe , and to bring the world together in a binding international agreement on climate change . the war in iraq put paid to both blair 's influence in the middle east and his credibility as the link between europe and the us .
his visit to berlin shows , that with time running out , he has to work with the woman who has replaced him as the point person on all the major issues he held dear if he wants to go down in history as the leader who attempted to save the world from environmental disaster . merkel getting results in the middle east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel gets access and results seemingly beyond blair merkel 's more pragmatic and candid approach to the volatile situation in the middle east , as seen during her recent peacemaking tour of egypt , saudi arabia and the gulf , has so far achieved more than blair could have ever expected from his own efforts . merkel personally persuaded us president george w. bush to accept the link between iraq and a wider middle east settlement ; encouraged the americans to revive the mideast quartet negotiating forum and rallied a number of arab states behind her vision of peace . in another example where she has seemingly succeeded where blair failed , merkel has kept germany free from washington 's apron strings in pursuing dialogue with iran and syria , and a two-state solution of the arab-israeli conflict while maintaining good relations with the white house . meanwhile blair is left to privately rue his decision to join the us in the war against iraq while germany takes the initiative in pushing for a resolution in the middle east , according to mark halsey , author of the book " blair 's legacy . " " iraq pretty much killed his dream of securing peace in the middle east , " halsey said .
" his attempts to save his tarnished reputation in the region by pressing for movement on the arab-israeli peace process also failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has found bush to be a fickle bed-fellow " he was defeated by washington 's pro-israeli neoconservatives , who believe israel should be free to settle its conflict with the palestinians , syria and hezbollah in lebanon on its own terms , " halsey added .
" that ended any real hope of blair leading the way in any peace process , or the americans letting him take the lead . " while germany 's nazi past will never allow it to put serious pressure on israel , merkel has maintained a level of independence in her dealing in the middle east , which has to some extent met with us acceptance and support . a challenging trans-atlantic relationship after the obvious divisions between the us and much of europe over the iraq war , the bush administration expressed relief after germany 's 2005 election when it found a leader it could be civil with after bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , descended into icy silence after the war began . even as us-german relations are back to normal on the surface after the schröder years , germany and the us do not share all the same interests , strategies and perceptions .
iraq and climate change being the clearest examples .
meanwhile , merkel 's boldest trans-atlantic initiative - an economic zone between europe and the us - has also raised little excitement in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is seen as europe 's point person by washington despite the differences , it is now merkel and not blair that the americans come to talk to on the current hot topics .
us experts say the bush administration views merkel as the " anchor point " for its dealings with the eu .
while blair is seen as a lame duck premier who has served his purpose , merkel is a leader on the rise . " she 's the big player in europe right now , " kurt volker , the bush administration 's principal deputy assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs , was quoted as saying after merkel ’ s visit to washington earlier this year . marginalized blair seeks climate agreement blair is expected to stand down as prime minister this spring .
but before he does , he wants to sign off on a new environmental agreement which would bind all the main players to a set of goals on the stabilization of emissions and the establishment of a global price for carbon trading . ironically , as blair pursues his last remaining legacy option , angela merkel is the person best equipped to take the lead in the global climate debate .
as a physicist and the former environment minister who negotiated the kyoto protocol for germany in 1997 , merkel knows that the basic science of climate change is no longer in dispute .
she also knows that the scale and urgency of the challenge the world faces is worse than previously thought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is forced to watch merkel make all the decisions as well as chairing the eu spring summit in march , where leaders will make major decisions on the future of climate and energy security policies , merkel will put climate change at the top of the agenda for this year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .
she will then lead the negotiations for securing agreement on the principles of a more comprehensive deal ahead of a united nations meeting in bali later in the year . by then , blair may have played his last part on the world stage ; watching from the wings as germany 's first female chancellor makes progress on all the issues that eluded him during his time as prime minister . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , blair push for action to prevent climate change german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday after a meeting with british prime minster tony blair that she hopes to set concrete goals on climate protection at the g8 summit of the world 's richest nations in june .
germany faces daunting agenda for eu , g8 presidencies germany will fight to revive international efforts for middle east peace , relaunch the eu constitution and advocate a gentler form of globalization when it takes over the presidencies of the eu and the g8 monday .
-lrb- 01.01.2007 -rrb- merkel , bush stand united on middle east , iran us president bush and german chancellor merkel on thursday called for restraint in the middle east , un action on iran , and urged russia to stick with democratic reforms .

" we want more control mechanisms , " she said .
" whenever you are in shop buying a computer or video game it is going to be clear - this is not to be in children 's hands . " fears follow school shootings the move comes in the wake of increasing german concern about the effects of violent media on young people and possible links to extreme acts of violence by young people in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen called for larger warning labels on violent video games and movies in november last year , an 18-year-old student shot and injured 32 people at his former high school , before committing suicide at the scene .
according to his former schoolmates , the young man was a fanatical player of the violent computer game " counter-strike . "
at the time , parents and politicians called for action against such games . von der leyen 's plans include bigger warning labels , similar to those on cigarette packets warning of the dangers of smoking , on computer games .
the amendments also call for violent computer games with age restrictions to produce a beeping sound when scanned at cash registers to alert the cashier .
some games and films would also no longer be available at general shops at all . the second part of her strategy involves greater information for parents , including several online portals that will soon be available to inform parents about the content of computer games on the market problem beyond borders armin laschet , youth minister of the state of north rhine-westphalia , supported the move but also said eu-wide action is needed . " we need a european debate because games are produced in every member state of the european union and abroad from asia or the united states , " laschet said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent games do not necessarily lead to violent actions , an expert said however , not everyone agrees on the alleged link between violent entertainment and violent action .
klaus hurrelmann , a specialist in sociology and child development at the university of bielefeld , said the evidence does n't support the connection made by politicians . " we have to rely on research in this case that says there is no lineal or causal relationship between computer games and violent behavior , " he said .
" we have , first , the vulnerable personality that really triggers violence , and , second , finding a fitting context .
only if these things come together does the vicious circle begin .

german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler confirmed that it is no longer ruling out the sale of its loss-making us subsidiary chrysler .
the company presented a plan for chrysler at its annual earnings conference on wednesday . daimlerchrysler is putting the future of its subsidiary chrysler to the test .
the company said it was considering a sale , but also examining strategic options with partners to restructure its us business . an immediate step presented at the company 's earning conference wednesday was to close one chrysler plant in the us , resulting in some13,000 job cuts from 2007 to 2009 , the company announced wednesday .
when the layoffs are complete , the chrysler group will be nearly half the size it was at its peak when it was purchased by daimler benz in 1999 . the auto giant 's frankfurt office released a statement saying the job cuts were part of a three-year chrysler " recovery and transformation plan that seeks a return to profitability by 2008 .

however , the company 's troubled chrysler division suffered a loss of 1.1 billion euros . " we are not ruling out any option in order to find the best solution for the chrysler group and daimlerchrysler , " the company said in an ad hoc announcement .
" the board of management intends to consider other , more far-reaching strategic options with partners in order to support and facilitate the program .

in fact , the love affair between german group daimler , with its up-brand mercedes-benz market on the one hand , and us car maker chrysler on the other soured fairly early on . already six years ago , daimlerchrysler 's chief executive dieter zetsche , then head of chrysler , prescribed a massive reorganization of the us subsidiary , including the closure of six plants and the loss of 26,000 jobs . the announcement confirms reports in german media that zetsche was considering a whole or partial sale of the troubled chrysler unit .
quoting sources on the supervisory board , the business daily handelsblatt said zetsche had instructed an investment bank to sound out all possibilities . last-ditch restructuring plan expected for chrysler this week 's meeting marked the first time daimlerchrysler held its annual earnings conference at its us headquarters instead of the traditional stuttgart venue in southwest germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zetsche wants to slim down the carmaking giant like the other two of the so-called " big three " us auto makers , ford and general motors , chrysler has been sideswiped by cut-throat competition from asian automobile manufacturers in its home market . chrysler 's product range , tilted heavily towards pick-up trucks and four-wheel drives , has been overtaken by us consumers ' increasing desire for smaller , more fuel-efficient cars . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers move into higher gear in india mesmerized by india 's thundering economy and increasing demand for cars , the german auto industry has notched up investment in the country with key players setting up new plants and expanding existing production .

" we want more control mechanisms , " she said .
" whenever you are in shop buying a computer or video game it is going to be clear - this is not to be in children 's hands . " fears follow school shootings the move comes in the wake of increasing german concern about the effects of violent media on young people and possible links to extreme acts of violence by young people in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen called for larger warning labels on violent video games and movies in november last year , an 18-year-old student shot and injured 32 people at his former high school , before committing suicide at the scene .
according to his former schoolmates , the young man was a fanatical player of the violent computer game " counter-strike . "
at the time , parents and politicians called for action against such games . von der leyen 's plans include bigger warning labels , similar to those on cigarette packets warning of the dangers of smoking , on computer games .
the amendments also call for violent computer games with age restrictions to produce a beeping sound when scanned at cash registers to alert the cashier .
some games and films would also no longer be available at general shops at all . the second part of her strategy involves greater information for parents , including several online portals that will soon be available to inform parents about the content of computer games on the market problem beyond borders armin laschet , youth minister of the state of north rhine-westphalia , supported the move but also said eu-wide action is needed . " we need a european debate because games are produced in every member state of the european union and abroad from asia or the united states , " laschet said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent games do not necessarily lead to violent actions , an expert said however , not everyone agrees on the alleged link between violent entertainment and violent action .
klaus hurrelmann , a specialist in sociology and child development at the university of bielefeld , said the evidence does n't support the connection made by politicians . " we have to rely on research in this case that says there is no lineal or causal relationship between computer games and violent behavior , " he said .
" we have , first , the vulnerable personality that really triggers violence , and , second , finding a fitting context .
only if these things come together does the vicious circle begin .

but in the past , italy and france have also had to decide how to battle left-wing terrorists . the italian marxist-leninist terrorist group brigate rosse or red brigades officially disbanded in the 1980s , but pockets have remained , as arrests on monday showed . italian authorities took 15 people into custody .
the suspects are allegedly linked to the red brigades for planning several attacks , including one on a company owned by former premier silvio berlusconi .
they have been accused of " associating with terrorists and participating in an armed group , " the italian interior ministry said . the group , founded in 1973 , has been mainly inoperative since the end of the cold war .
but in the 1970s and 1980s , it was responsible for thousands of acts of violence .
over 400 deaths are attributed to the red brigades . the climax of red brigades terror occurred in 1978 , when the group kidnapped former prime minister aldo moros and subsequently murdered him .

but in the past , italy and france have also had to decide how to battle left-wing terrorists . the italian marxist-leninist terrorist group brigate rosse or red brigades officially disbanded in the 1980s , but pockets have remained , as arrests on monday showed . italian authorities took 15 people into custody .
the suspects are allegedly linked to the red brigades for planning several attacks , including one on a company owned by former premier silvio berlusconi .
they have been accused of " associating with terrorists and participating in an armed group , " the italian interior ministry said . the group , founded in 1973 , has been mainly inoperative since the end of the cold war .
but in the 1970s and 1980s , it was responsible for thousands of acts of violence .
over 400 deaths are attributed to the red brigades . the climax of red brigades terror occurred in 1978 , when the group kidnapped former prime minister aldo moros and subsequently murdered him .
the period belonged to the most dramatic days that italy experienced since the end of the second world war . today , a small plaque on house number 9 in the via caetani in rome 's city center commemorates the moros murder .
on may 9 , 1978 , his body was found here , in the trunk of a parked car . groups had the same goals , but no cooperation left-wing extremists such as the brigate rosse in italy also existed in germany and france in the 1970s .
all groups wanted to build up an " anti-imperial european front , " said rolf tophoven , director of the institute for terrorism research and security policy in essen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf tophoven is a leading german terrorism expert germany 's red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , the red brigades and action directe in france had a social revolutionary approach in common . " they were against the state , against exploitation and for the interests of the working class , " tophoven said .
" they were aiming for the revolutionary reorganization of society according to a marxist-leninist ideal . " the instrument they chose to meet this goal was violence , and the targets were mainly leading politicians and top managers from the business world .
but the groups never got further than an ideological linking . cross-border cooperation , such as that practiced by islamic terrorist groups today , never existed . justice collaborators helped break up the red brigades the red brigades had dreamt of a communist order in italy .
the result , though , was a climate of uncertainty and violence caused by numerous assaults and kidnappings .
the break came after the moros murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldo moro spent 55 days in the red brigades ' hands before he was killed " this event shocked all of italy , " tophoven said .
" for the first time , a wide front spanning across all political parties formed against the terror from the left . " the decisive aspect of the fight against terror in italy was the so-called pentiti , or justice collaborators .
it offered leading heads of the movement a milder sentence if they cooperated with the state . " this led to the breakup of the red brigades in 1982 , " tophoven said .
over 200 activists received sentences at the time - 85 of them for life . in the meantime , however , many have been released from prison or were granted day release .
in 1998 , when founder renato curcio was released after 24 years in prison , the discussion in italy was nowhere near as heated as in germany .
a german court ruled on monday that former raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt will be released on parole next month .
this has sparked a sharp debate across the country . public opinion in france forced government action in france in the 1980s , the government and president francois mitterrand initially reacted relatively reserved to action directe .
as opposed to germany , they did n't consider the state order directly endangered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joëlle aubron from action directe died of cancer in 2006 but with the action directe commando 's first casualties , public opinion changed .
the major left-wing liberal newspapers , such as le monde and libération condemned action directe .
the publications criticized the lacking reference to the working class , in whose name the group operated . the french government took a tougher stance after the murders of general rene audran in 1985 and renault director georges besse in 1986 .
one year later , the founders of the group , jean-marc rouillan , nathalie ménigon and georges cipriani were arrested and action directe fell apart . in 2006 , the three prisoners requested release on parole after serving the minimum time of 18 years .
but authorities denied the request due to their lack of remorse . raf dissolved itself following the successes in italy , the witness leniency program was introduced in germany , too .
but the raf dissolved itself .
in a letter in 1992 , it declared its fight as useless and the raf experiment as failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack on federal prosecutor siegfried buback left three dead following the decision to release mohnhaupt on parole , three raf members remain in prison : christian klar , eva sybille haule and birgit hogefeld .
their prison sentences could also be changed into a suspended sentence after 2009 . " in all three countries , the social revolutionary experiments drenched in violence and terrorist attacks failed , " tophoven said .
the virtually worldwide collapse of real socialism ultimately contributed , too . " the story of the anti-imperialist european front is a story of failure , " tophoven said . ina rottscheidt -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de release of former militant sparks mixed feelings in germany most german political parties consider the release of the one-time terrorist and red army faction leader brigitte mohnhaupt as a sign of justice .

all groups wanted to build up an " anti-imperial european front , " said rolf tophoven , director of the institute for terrorism research and security policy in essen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf tophoven is a leading german terrorism expert germany 's red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , the red brigades and action directe in france had a social revolutionary approach in common . " they were against the state , against exploitation and for the interests of the working class , " tophoven said .
" they were aiming for the revolutionary reorganization of society according to a marxist-leninist ideal . " the instrument they chose to meet this goal was violence , and the targets were mainly leading politicians and top managers from the business world .
but the groups never got further than an ideological linking . cross-border cooperation , such as that practiced by islamic terrorist groups today , never existed . justice collaborators helped break up the red brigades the red brigades had dreamt of a communist order in italy .
the result , though , was a climate of uncertainty and violence caused by numerous assaults and kidnappings .
the break came after the moros murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldo moro spent 55 days in the red brigades ' hands before he was killed " this event shocked all of italy , " tophoven said .
" for the first time , a wide front spanning across all political parties formed against the terror from the left . " the decisive aspect of the fight against terror in italy was the so-called pentiti , or justice collaborators .
it offered leading heads of the movement a milder sentence if they cooperated with the state . " this led to the breakup of the red brigades in 1982 , " tophoven said .
over 200 activists received sentences at the time - 85 of them for life . in the meantime , however , many have been released from prison or were granted day release .
in 1998 , when founder renato curcio was released after 24 years in prison , the discussion in italy was nowhere near as heated as in germany .
a german court ruled on monday that former raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt will be released on parole next month .
this has sparked a sharp debate across the country . public opinion in france forced government action in france in the 1980s , the government and president francois mitterrand initially reacted relatively reserved to action directe .
as opposed to germany , they did n't consider the state order directly endangered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joëlle aubron from action directe died of cancer in 2006 but with the action directe commando 's first casualties , public opinion changed .
the major left-wing liberal newspapers , such as le monde and libération condemned action directe .
the publications criticized the lacking reference to the working class , in whose name the group operated . the french government took a tougher stance after the murders of general rene audran in 1985 and renault director georges besse in 1986 .
one year later , the founders of the group , jean-marc rouillan , nathalie ménigon and georges cipriani were arrested and action directe fell apart . in 2006 , the three prisoners requested release on parole after serving the minimum time of 18 years .
but authorities denied the request due to their lack of remorse . raf dissolved itself following the successes in italy , the witness leniency program was introduced in germany , too .
but the raf dissolved itself .
in a letter in 1992 , it declared its fight as useless and the raf experiment as failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack on federal prosecutor siegfried buback left three dead following the decision to release mohnhaupt on parole , three raf members remain in prison : christian klar , eva sybille haule and birgit hogefeld .
their prison sentences could also be changed into a suspended sentence after 2009 . " in all three countries , the social revolutionary experiments drenched in violence and terrorist attacks failed , " tophoven said .
the virtually worldwide collapse of real socialism ultimately contributed , too . " the story of the anti-imperialist european front is a story of failure , " tophoven said . ina rottscheidt -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de release of former militant sparks mixed feelings in germany most german political parties consider the release of the one-time terrorist and red army faction leader brigitte mohnhaupt as a sign of justice .

but as time runs out , angela merkel is the leader most likely to achieve his goals . when tony blair flew to berlin on tuesday for talks on climate change with german chancellor angela merkel , there was more to the meeting than just two international figures attempting to keep the slowly turning wheels of environmental politics going . while the british prime minister arrived in the german capital intent on capitalizing on the slight recent shift in global thinking towards tackling climate change by discussing plans with the current eu president and leader of the g8 , blair was also seizing what many observers see as his last chance to leave a positive legacy when his premiership comes to an end . blair has embarked on many missions during his 10-year tenure in downing street .
his desire to be remembered for one great success on the global stage has led him to pursue campaigns to resolve the israeli-palestinian conflict and bring peace to the middle east , to rebuild the bridges between the united states and europe , and to bring the world together in a binding international agreement on climate change . the war in iraq put paid to both blair 's influence in the middle east and his credibility as the link between europe and the us .
his visit to berlin shows , that with time running out , he has to work with the woman who has replaced him as the point person on all the major issues he held dear if he wants to go down in history as the leader who attempted to save the world from environmental disaster . merkel getting results in the middle east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel gets access and results seemingly beyond blair merkel 's more pragmatic and candid approach to the volatile situation in the middle east , as seen during her recent peacemaking tour of egypt , saudi arabia and the gulf , has so far achieved more than blair could have ever expected from his own efforts . merkel personally persuaded us president george w. bush to accept the link between iraq and a wider middle east settlement ; encouraged the americans to revive the mideast quartet negotiating forum and rallied a number of arab states behind her vision of peace . in another example where she has seemingly succeeded where blair failed , merkel has kept germany free from washington 's apron strings in pursuing dialogue with iran and syria , and a two-state solution of the arab-israeli conflict while maintaining good relations with the white house . meanwhile blair is left to privately rue his decision to join the us in the war against iraq while germany takes the initiative in pushing for a resolution in the middle east , according to mark halsey , author of the book " blair 's legacy . " " iraq pretty much killed his dream of securing peace in the middle east , " halsey said .
" his attempts to save his tarnished reputation in the region by pressing for movement on the arab-israeli peace process also failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has found bush to be a fickle bed-fellow " he was defeated by washington 's pro-israeli neoconservatives , who believe israel should be free to settle its conflict with the palestinians , syria and hezbollah in lebanon on its own terms , " halsey added .
" that ended any real hope of blair leading the way in any peace process , or the americans letting him take the lead . " while germany 's nazi past will never allow it to put serious pressure on israel , merkel has maintained a level of independence in her dealing in the middle east , which has to some extent met with us acceptance and support . a challenging trans-atlantic relationship after the obvious divisions between the us and much of europe over the iraq war , the bush administration expressed relief after germany 's 2005 election when it found a leader it could be civil with after bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , descended into icy silence after the war began . even as us-german relations are back to normal on the surface after the schröder years , germany and the us do not share all the same interests , strategies and perceptions .
iraq and climate change being the clearest examples .
meanwhile , merkel 's boldest trans-atlantic initiative - an economic zone between europe and the us - has also raised little excitement in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is seen as europe 's point person by washington despite the differences , it is now merkel and not blair that the americans come to talk to on the current hot topics .

while blair is seen as a lame duck premier who has served his purpose , merkel is a leader on the rise . " she 's the big player in europe right now , " kurt volker , the bush administration 's principal deputy assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs , was quoted as saying after merkel ’ s visit to washington earlier this year . marginalized blair seeks climate agreement blair is expected to stand down as prime minister this spring .
but before he does , he wants to sign off on a new environmental agreement which would bind all the main players to a set of goals on the stabilization of emissions and the establishment of a global price for carbon trading . ironically , as blair pursues his last remaining legacy option , angela merkel is the person best equipped to take the lead in the global climate debate .
as a physicist and the former environment minister who negotiated the kyoto protocol for germany in 1997 , merkel knows that the basic science of climate change is no longer in dispute .
she also knows that the scale and urgency of the challenge the world faces is worse than previously thought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is forced to watch merkel make all the decisions as well as chairing the eu spring summit in march , where leaders will make major decisions on the future of climate and energy security policies , merkel will put climate change at the top of the agenda for this year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .

but in the past , italy and france have also had to decide how to battle left-wing terrorists . the italian marxist-leninist terrorist group brigate rosse or red brigades officially disbanded in the 1980s , but pockets have remained , as arrests on monday showed . italian authorities took 15 people into custody .
the suspects are allegedly linked to the red brigades for planning several attacks , including one on a company owned by former premier silvio berlusconi .
they have been accused of " associating with terrorists and participating in an armed group , " the italian interior ministry said . the group , founded in 1973 , has been mainly inoperative since the end of the cold war .
but in the 1970s and 1980s , it was responsible for thousands of acts of violence .
over 400 deaths are attributed to the red brigades . the climax of red brigades terror occurred in 1978 , when the group kidnapped former prime minister aldo moros and subsequently murdered him .
the period belonged to the most dramatic days that italy experienced since the end of the second world war . today , a small plaque on house number 9 in the via caetani in rome 's city center commemorates the moros murder .
on may 9 , 1978 , his body was found here , in the trunk of a parked car . groups had the same goals , but no cooperation left-wing extremists such as the brigate rosse in italy also existed in germany and france in the 1970s .
all groups wanted to build up an " anti-imperial european front , " said rolf tophoven , director of the institute for terrorism research and security policy in essen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf tophoven is a leading german terrorism expert germany 's red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , the red brigades and action directe in france had a social revolutionary approach in common .

over 200 activists received sentences at the time - 85 of them for life . in the meantime , however , many have been released from prison or were granted day release .
in 1998 , when founder renato curcio was released after 24 years in prison , the discussion in italy was nowhere near as heated as in germany .
a german court ruled on monday that former raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt will be released on parole next month .
this has sparked a sharp debate across the country . public opinion in france forced government action in france in the 1980s , the government and president francois mitterrand initially reacted relatively reserved to action directe .
as opposed to germany , they did n't consider the state order directly endangered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joëlle aubron from action directe died of cancer in 2006 but with the action directe commando 's first casualties , public opinion changed .
the major left-wing liberal newspapers , such as le monde and libération condemned action directe .
the publications criticized the lacking reference to the working class , in whose name the group operated . the french government took a tougher stance after the murders of general rene audran in 1985 and renault director georges besse in 1986 .
one year later , the founders of the group , jean-marc rouillan , nathalie ménigon and georges cipriani were arrested and action directe fell apart . in 2006 , the three prisoners requested release on parole after serving the minimum time of 18 years .
but authorities denied the request due to their lack of remorse . raf dissolved itself following the successes in italy , the witness leniency program was introduced in germany , too .
but the raf dissolved itself .
in a letter in 1992 , it declared its fight as useless and the raf experiment as failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack on federal prosecutor siegfried buback left three dead following the decision to release mohnhaupt on parole , three raf members remain in prison : christian klar , eva sybille haule and birgit hogefeld .

but in the past , italy and france have also had to decide how to battle left-wing terrorists . the italian marxist-leninist terrorist group brigate rosse or red brigades officially disbanded in the 1980s , but pockets have remained , as arrests on monday showed . italian authorities took 15 people into custody .
the suspects are allegedly linked to the red brigades for planning several attacks , including one on a company owned by former premier silvio berlusconi .
they have been accused of " associating with terrorists and participating in an armed group , " the italian interior ministry said . the group , founded in 1973 , has been mainly inoperative since the end of the cold war .
but in the 1970s and 1980s , it was responsible for thousands of acts of violence .
over 400 deaths are attributed to the red brigades . the climax of red brigades terror occurred in 1978 , when the group kidnapped former prime minister aldo moros and subsequently murdered him .
the period belonged to the most dramatic days that italy experienced since the end of the second world war . today , a small plaque on house number 9 in the via caetani in rome 's city center commemorates the moros murder .
on may 9 , 1978 , his body was found here , in the trunk of a parked car . groups had the same goals , but no cooperation left-wing extremists such as the brigate rosse in italy also existed in germany and france in the 1970s .
all groups wanted to build up an " anti-imperial european front , " said rolf tophoven , director of the institute for terrorism research and security policy in essen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf tophoven is a leading german terrorism expert germany 's red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , the red brigades and action directe in france had a social revolutionary approach in common . " they were against the state , against exploitation and for the interests of the working class , " tophoven said .
" they were aiming for the revolutionary reorganization of society according to a marxist-leninist ideal . " the instrument they chose to meet this goal was violence , and the targets were mainly leading politicians and top managers from the business world .
but the groups never got further than an ideological linking . cross-border cooperation , such as that practiced by islamic terrorist groups today , never existed . justice collaborators helped break up the red brigades the red brigades had dreamt of a communist order in italy .
the result , though , was a climate of uncertainty and violence caused by numerous assaults and kidnappings .
the break came after the moros murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldo moro spent 55 days in the red brigades ' hands before he was killed " this event shocked all of italy , " tophoven said .
" for the first time , a wide front spanning across all political parties formed against the terror from the left . " the decisive aspect of the fight against terror in italy was the so-called pentiti , or justice collaborators .
it offered leading heads of the movement a milder sentence if they cooperated with the state . " this led to the breakup of the red brigades in 1982 , " tophoven said .
over 200 activists received sentences at the time - 85 of them for life . in the meantime , however , many have been released from prison or were granted day release .
in 1998 , when founder renato curcio was released after 24 years in prison , the discussion in italy was nowhere near as heated as in germany .
a german court ruled on monday that former raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt will be released on parole next month .
this has sparked a sharp debate across the country . public opinion in france forced government action in france in the 1980s , the government and president francois mitterrand initially reacted relatively reserved to action directe .
as opposed to germany , they did n't consider the state order directly endangered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joëlle aubron from action directe died of cancer in 2006 but with the action directe commando 's first casualties , public opinion changed .
the major left-wing liberal newspapers , such as le monde and libération condemned action directe .
the publications criticized the lacking reference to the working class , in whose name the group operated . the french government took a tougher stance after the murders of general rene audran in 1985 and renault director georges besse in 1986 .
one year later , the founders of the group , jean-marc rouillan , nathalie ménigon and georges cipriani were arrested and action directe fell apart . in 2006 , the three prisoners requested release on parole after serving the minimum time of 18 years .
but authorities denied the request due to their lack of remorse . raf dissolved itself following the successes in italy , the witness leniency program was introduced in germany , too .
but the raf dissolved itself .
in a letter in 1992 , it declared its fight as useless and the raf experiment as failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack on federal prosecutor siegfried buback left three dead following the decision to release mohnhaupt on parole , three raf members remain in prison : christian klar , eva sybille haule and birgit hogefeld .
their prison sentences could also be changed into a suspended sentence after 2009 . " in all three countries , the social revolutionary experiments drenched in violence and terrorist attacks failed , " tophoven said .
the virtually worldwide collapse of real socialism ultimately contributed , too .

but in the past , italy and france have also had to decide how to battle left-wing terrorists . the italian marxist-leninist terrorist group brigate rosse or red brigades officially disbanded in the 1980s , but pockets have remained , as arrests on monday showed . italian authorities took 15 people into custody .
the suspects are allegedly linked to the red brigades for planning several attacks , including one on a company owned by former premier silvio berlusconi .
they have been accused of " associating with terrorists and participating in an armed group , " the italian interior ministry said . the group , founded in 1973 , has been mainly inoperative since the end of the cold war .
but in the 1970s and 1980s , it was responsible for thousands of acts of violence .
over 400 deaths are attributed to the red brigades . the climax of red brigades terror occurred in 1978 , when the group kidnapped former prime minister aldo moros and subsequently murdered him .
the period belonged to the most dramatic days that italy experienced since the end of the second world war . today , a small plaque on house number 9 in the via caetani in rome 's city center commemorates the moros murder .
on may 9 , 1978 , his body was found here , in the trunk of a parked car . groups had the same goals , but no cooperation left-wing extremists such as the brigate rosse in italy also existed in germany and france in the 1970s .
all groups wanted to build up an " anti-imperial european front , " said rolf tophoven , director of the institute for terrorism research and security policy in essen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf tophoven is a leading german terrorism expert germany 's red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , the red brigades and action directe in france had a social revolutionary approach in common . " they were against the state , against exploitation and for the interests of the working class , " tophoven said .
" they were aiming for the revolutionary reorganization of society according to a marxist-leninist ideal . " the instrument they chose to meet this goal was violence , and the targets were mainly leading politicians and top managers from the business world .
but the groups never got further than an ideological linking . cross-border cooperation , such as that practiced by islamic terrorist groups today , never existed . justice collaborators helped break up the red brigades the red brigades had dreamt of a communist order in italy .
the result , though , was a climate of uncertainty and violence caused by numerous assaults and kidnappings .
the break came after the moros murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldo moro spent 55 days in the red brigades ' hands before he was killed " this event shocked all of italy , " tophoven said .
" for the first time , a wide front spanning across all political parties formed against the terror from the left . " the decisive aspect of the fight against terror in italy was the so-called pentiti , or justice collaborators .
it offered leading heads of the movement a milder sentence if they cooperated with the state . " this led to the breakup of the red brigades in 1982 , " tophoven said .
over 200 activists received sentences at the time - 85 of them for life . in the meantime , however , many have been released from prison or were granted day release .
in 1998 , when founder renato curcio was released after 24 years in prison , the discussion in italy was nowhere near as heated as in germany .
a german court ruled on monday that former raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt will be released on parole next month .
this has sparked a sharp debate across the country . public opinion in france forced government action in france in the 1980s , the government and president francois mitterrand initially reacted relatively reserved to action directe .
as opposed to germany , they did n't consider the state order directly endangered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joëlle aubron from action directe died of cancer in 2006 but with the action directe commando 's first casualties , public opinion changed .
the major left-wing liberal newspapers , such as le monde and libération condemned action directe .
the publications criticized the lacking reference to the working class , in whose name the group operated . the french government took a tougher stance after the murders of general rene audran in 1985 and renault director georges besse in 1986 .
one year later , the founders of the group , jean-marc rouillan , nathalie ménigon and georges cipriani were arrested and action directe fell apart . in 2006 , the three prisoners requested release on parole after serving the minimum time of 18 years .
but authorities denied the request due to their lack of remorse . raf dissolved itself following the successes in italy , the witness leniency program was introduced in germany , too .
but the raf dissolved itself .
in a letter in 1992 , it declared its fight as useless and the raf experiment as failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack on federal prosecutor siegfried buback left three dead following the decision to release mohnhaupt on parole , three raf members remain in prison : christian klar , eva sybille haule and birgit hogefeld .
their prison sentences could also be changed into a suspended sentence after 2009 . " in all three countries , the social revolutionary experiments drenched in violence and terrorist attacks failed , " tophoven said .
the virtually worldwide collapse of real socialism ultimately contributed , too . " the story of the anti-imperialist european front is a story of failure , " tophoven said . ina rottscheidt -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de release of former militant sparks mixed feelings in germany most german political parties consider the release of the one-time terrorist and red army faction leader brigitte mohnhaupt as a sign of justice .
but conservative leaders and the victims ' families are more critical .

britain got a failing grade , coming in dead last while northern europe came out on top . a unicef study that compared the situation of children in 21 industrialized nations put german children squarely in the middle of the list , at 11th place . the report by the united nations children 's advocacy agency compared six markers , including material wealth , health , education , relationship to parents and peers , behaviors and risks , as well as the children 's own assessment of their situation , to determine the rankings . typical of poor scoring nations were children who did not trust their friends , rarely spent time with parents , and overate .
poverty among minorities and a lack of books in homes also dragged down scores . northern europe scores high bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kinder beim essen top marks went mostly to northern european countries .
the netherlands garnered first place , followed by sweden , denmark , finland , spain and switzerland .
france took 16th place , while the uk landed a miserable 21st slot . the honorary chairwoman of german unicef , heide simonis , called germany 's middle-of-the-pack showing " unsatisfying . "
she told bavarian state radio the country needs more full-day schools and more childcare for very young children .
in addition , she said , politicians have to take the problems of youth more seriously . german family minster ursula von der leyen this week proposed spending 3 million -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- euros more on expanding childcare in germany , a plan that has received approval from political leaders though the proposal still lacks a funding plan . germany scored poorly on its schools , which mostly operate in the morning only , and its lack of success helping immigrant children . regional disparities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians have called for more childcare centers simonis noted that the german education system suffers under severe regional disparities as some states offer a better education than others . simonis also noted that germany scored poorly when it came to cigarette and alcohol use .

" the german government has kept a tight lid on information regarding the missing citizens . but foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on monday did not exclude the possibility of a " violent kidnapping . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has a tough job on his hands meanwhile , anonymous intelligence sources have confirmed to the web site of germany 's der spiegel news magazine that the wife of a baghdad-based iraqi man and her son , a technician at the iraqi foreign ministry , were kidnapped by iraqi gunmen last week . it is unclear whether the kidnappers are politically motivated or simply interested in a ransom payment .
according to initial media reports , the kidnappers contacted the young man 's sister in berlin , who then alerted german authorities .
but officials have since interrogated the woman , and subsequent reports could not confirm that the kidnappers had contacted her . key iraqi mediator also kidnapped this is germany 's third hostage crisis since the start of the iraq war in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was kidnapped in iraq in 2005 at the end of 2005 , bavarian archaeologist susanne osthoff and her driver were taken hostage .
the german government eventually secured their release , allegedly after paying a hefty ransom .
in january 2006 , iraqi gunmen abducted two technicians , rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke .
the pair was also freed unharmed . in all three cases , the head of the baghdad-based german-iraqi club , dr. abdulhalim al-hijjaj helped the german government mediate their release .
al-hijjaj speaks fluent german and is connected with local tribal leaders in the so-called sunni triangle just north of baghdad . the german foreign ministry rewarded the man for his assistance with two tickets to a soccer world cup game in stuttgart .
but the iraqi mediator never saw germany beat portugal 3-1 .
seven days prior to the game , al-hijjaj himself was snatched up off the street by two gunmen . the kidnappers had allegedly learned of his mediation efforts for the german government , and assumed he had been richly rewarded .
the german government could not help al-hijjaj , and he was only freed on july 7 after his wife had emptied the family bank account and paid a ransom of 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 197,115 -rrb- .
the couple then fled to jordan , where they now live an impoverished life , according to media reports . no help for the helper al-hijjaj 's plight has prompted calls from some in germany to help the man who played a valuable role in securing the release of former german nationals taken hostage in iraq . peter bienert , the head of the leipzig-based firm cryotec , where former hostages bräunlich and nitzschke are employed , told german news agency dpa " the man -lrb- al-hijjaj -rrb- has been abandoned . "
bienert has reportedly collected several thousand euros in donations for al-hijjaj . meanwhile , opposition leaders in the german parliament have called on the government to offer him some assistance .
the foreign ministry and the chancellery claim there is no room in the budget for this . but werner hoyer , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp said financing was not a problem . " of course something can be done there , " he said .
" to simply pretend there is no leeway in the budget is nonsense . " indeed , german foreign ministers have discretionary funds at their disposal for emergencies .
but cdu parliamentarian siegfried kauder said the foreign ministry is reluctant to tap into these funds .
that sort of " non-bureaucratic assistance would create a precedent " for future kidnappers , he said . kauder recommended hijjaj contact the white ring , a relief organization for victims of violence . " he has to be the victim of a violent crime , and he has to be in financial need , " said kauder , who is a member of the organization 's board of directors .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has a tough job on his hands meanwhile , anonymous intelligence sources have confirmed to the web site of germany 's der spiegel news magazine that the wife of a baghdad-based iraqi man and her son , a technician at the iraqi foreign ministry , were kidnapped by iraqi gunmen last week . it is unclear whether the kidnappers are politically motivated or simply interested in a ransom payment .
according to initial media reports , the kidnappers contacted the young man 's sister in berlin , who then alerted german authorities .
but officials have since interrogated the woman , and subsequent reports could not confirm that the kidnappers had contacted her . key iraqi mediator also kidnapped this is germany 's third hostage crisis since the start of the iraq war in march 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : susanne osthoff was kidnapped in iraq in 2005 at the end of 2005 , bavarian archaeologist susanne osthoff and her driver were taken hostage .
the german government eventually secured their release , allegedly after paying a hefty ransom .
in january 2006 , iraqi gunmen abducted two technicians , rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke .
the pair was also freed unharmed . in all three cases , the head of the baghdad-based german-iraqi club , dr. abdulhalim al-hijjaj helped the german government mediate their release .
al-hijjaj speaks fluent german and is connected with local tribal leaders in the so-called sunni triangle just north of baghdad . the german foreign ministry rewarded the man for his assistance with two tickets to a soccer world cup game in stuttgart .
but the iraqi mediator never saw germany beat portugal 3-1 .
seven days prior to the game , al-hijjaj himself was snatched up off the street by two gunmen . the kidnappers had allegedly learned of his mediation efforts for the german government , and assumed he had been richly rewarded .
the german government could not help al-hijjaj , and he was only freed on july 7 after his wife had emptied the family bank account and paid a ransom of 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 197,115 -rrb- .
the couple then fled to jordan , where they now live an impoverished life , according to media reports . no help for the helper al-hijjaj 's plight has prompted calls from some in germany to help the man who played a valuable role in securing the release of former german nationals taken hostage in iraq . peter bienert , the head of the leipzig-based firm cryotec , where former hostages bräunlich and nitzschke are employed , told german news agency dpa " the man -lrb- al-hijjaj -rrb- has been abandoned . "
bienert has reportedly collected several thousand euros in donations for al-hijjaj . meanwhile , opposition leaders in the german parliament have called on the government to offer him some assistance .
the foreign ministry and the chancellery claim there is no room in the budget for this . but werner hoyer , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp said financing was not a problem . " of course something can be done there , " he said .
" to simply pretend there is no leeway in the budget is nonsense . " indeed , german foreign ministers have discretionary funds at their disposal for emergencies .
but cdu parliamentarian siegfried kauder said the foreign ministry is reluctant to tap into these funds .
that sort of " non-bureaucratic assistance would create a precedent " for future kidnappers , he said . kauder recommended hijjaj contact the white ring , a relief organization for victims of violence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 14.02.2007 happiness is … love and vacation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for most germans , it does n't get any better than this valentine 's day is the day of love .
if a new study is right , germans should be their happiest then on wednesday - in addition to during their holidays . there is no shortage of stereotypes about europeans .
the romantic french immediately pop to mind , as do the witty english and their dry sense of humor .
italians and spaniards share the top place for being most fiery , and the germans ?
these teutonic people are best known for their seriousness and hard work , not though for their happy disposition . but a new study presented this week showed that more than two-thirds of germans tend to be happy .
there is a hitch , though .
of those surveyed , 84 percent said they especially experienced happy moments when they were in love or on vacation .

but a change in format has made the uefa cup harder .
it 's a trophy teams want to win . if you believe what you hear , you could be fooled into thinking that there is only one big european fixture on the horizon for germany 's teams in the next week . with their domestic league form mixed at best , bayern munich 's season hinges on their champions league clash against real madrid on feb .
20 .
it is undoubtedly a huge game ; if bayern lose the tie over two legs , they will have to resign themselves to a season without silverware . but the bavarian giants are not the only german team still in the hunt for european honors .
bayer leverkusen and werder bremen take on difficult opposition on wednesday night in the first knock-out round of the uefa cup .
leverkusen take on english premiership side blackburn rovers while werder have a tricky tie against ajax amsterdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uefa cup -lrb- r . -rrb- with its more prestigious relative despite its reputation as the champions league 's poorer relation , the uefa cup is still a hard fought and extremely difficult competition to win .
after format changes in the 2004/05 season that introduced a league round and the inclusion of those third-placed champions league sides that missed out on qualification , the uefa cup now has more games and now features tougher teams . german clubs go for first win in a decade it has been exactly ten years since a german team last won the trophy - schalke 04 beating inter milan on penalties in the 1996/07 final - and the list of winners since shows that the uefa cup is hardly a competition for minnows . leverkusen and bremen both hope to mark the anniversary by bringing the cup back to germany for the first time in a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen entered the uefa cup after losing to barca for werder , the uefa cup may at first seem like an anti-climax .
thrust into undoubtedly the hardest group stage of this season 's champions league , thomas schaaf 's side cruelly missed out on an historic qualification from group a by one point after beating english champions chelsea at the weserstadion and holding the current european champions barcelona to a draw . werder dropped into the uefa cup at the start of the knock-out stages and instantly became one of the favorites to win the trophy on the back of their bundesliga form and improving european credentials .
however , if bremen thought they were in for an easy time , the draw had them thinking again . bremen face dutch masters in sticky knock-out tie ajax amsterdam have four european cups to their name , one uefa cup , 29 dutch championship titles and are currently second in the dutch league .
a club which did much to introduce the concept of total football to the world , a fluid system which allows the outfield players the freedom to swap positions , ajax will prove to be a real test for bremen . while not exactly a team known for a lack of confidence , two successive defeats in the bundesliga have put werder six points behind leaders schalke 04 and have knocked them out of their free-scoring rhythm .
" we 'll have to see whether this latest defeat gives us the spur we need - or not , " bremen 's germany striker miroslav klose said tuesday . bildunterschrift : ajax players prepare for wednesday 's clash in bremen ajax , whose dutch title hopes have been re-ignited by closest rivals psv eindhoven 's poor run , have defensive worries with injuries ruling out defenders urby emanuelson , zdenek grygera and thomas vermaelen . recently re-signed amsterdam legend edgar davids is cup-tied for the remainder of the competition after featuring for former club tottenham hotspur in the group stage . for bayer leverkusen , the uefa cup offers a glamorous respite from the rigors of their mediocre bundesliga campaign .
however , things will have to pick up for michael skibbe 's team if they are to carry on enjoying its distractions . unconvincing leverkusen meet battling blackburn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benni mccarthy -lrb- center -rrb- has blackburn dreaming currently lying seventh in the league , bayer have had a mixed season domestically and have also struggled to maintain any consistency in europe .
leverkusen limped out of group b in third place with just four points and will meet group e winners blackburn , a team that only dropped two points in qualifying . blackburn are also enduring a less than exemplary season in the premiership but have definitely reserved their best performances for the uefa cup , fired by pre-season signing benni mccarthy , a uefa cup winner with fc porto in 2003 . rovers play a robust game as one would expect from a team managed by the combative mark hughes , a former bayern munich player .
leverkusen 's progress is far from assured . injuries plague both sides ahead of clash things have been made worse by injuries to defenders juan and roque junior and coach skibbe may also have to do without captain carsten ramelow .
the influential midfielder made his comeback from a knee operation in saturday 's 2-2 draw against eintracht frankfurt but he is still far from fully match fit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carsten ramelow , left , may not be risked against blackburn " the comeback was way too soon but i needed him , " said skibbe , who will have to think hard before asking ramelow to play a second game in five days . blackburn hope midfielder david dunn will have recovered from a dead leg in time for the leverkusen match after picking up the injury at the weekend .
" it should settle down and it should n't be a problem for him , " hughes told the club 's web site on tuesday . rovers will also be without long-term injury victims robbie savage and andre ooijer , who are both recovering from broken legs . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german clubs learn next uefa cup foes tuesday saw the draw for the group stage of the uefa cup .

the company said it was considering a sale , but also examining strategic options with partners to restructure its us business . an immediate step presented at the company 's earning conference wednesday was to close one chrysler plant in the us , resulting in some13,000 job cuts from 2007 to 2009 , the company announced wednesday .
when the layoffs are complete , the chrysler group will be nearly half the size it was at its peak when it was purchased by daimler benz in 1999 . the auto giant 's frankfurt office released a statement saying the job cuts were part of a three-year chrysler " recovery and transformation plan that seeks a return to profitability by 2008 . " daimlerchrysler up , chrysler down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least one us chrysler plant is slated for closure daimlerchrysler 's operating profit in 2006 rose to 5.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.2 billion -rrb- from 5.2 billion euros the previous year .
however , the company 's troubled chrysler division suffered a loss of 1.1 billion euros . " we are not ruling out any option in order to find the best solution for the chrysler group and daimlerchrysler , " the company said in an ad hoc announcement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign relations -pipe- 14.02.2007 merkel in the ascendency as blair 's star fades großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : power shift : blair needs merkel 's help to get an agreement on climate change tony blair has pursued many issues in search of a lasting positive legacy ; mideast peace , strong eu-us ties and climate change .
but as time runs out , angela merkel is the leader most likely to achieve his goals . when tony blair flew to berlin on tuesday for talks on climate change with german chancellor angela merkel , there was more to the meeting than just two international figures attempting to keep the slowly turning wheels of environmental politics going . while the british prime minister arrived in the german capital intent on capitalizing on the slight recent shift in global thinking towards tackling climate change by discussing plans with the current eu president and leader of the g8 , blair was also seizing what many observers see as his last chance to leave a positive legacy when his premiership comes to an end . blair has embarked on many missions during his 10-year tenure in downing street .
his desire to be remembered for one great success on the global stage has led him to pursue campaigns to resolve the israeli-palestinian conflict and bring peace to the middle east , to rebuild the bridges between the united states and europe , and to bring the world together in a binding international agreement on climate change . the war in iraq put paid to both blair 's influence in the middle east and his credibility as the link between europe and the us .
his visit to berlin shows , that with time running out , he has to work with the woman who has replaced him as the point person on all the major issues he held dear if he wants to go down in history as the leader who attempted to save the world from environmental disaster . merkel getting results in the middle east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel gets access and results seemingly beyond blair merkel 's more pragmatic and candid approach to the volatile situation in the middle east , as seen during her recent peacemaking tour of egypt , saudi arabia and the gulf , has so far achieved more than blair could have ever expected from his own efforts . merkel personally persuaded us president george w. bush to accept the link between iraq and a wider middle east settlement ; encouraged the americans to revive the mideast quartet negotiating forum and rallied a number of arab states behind her vision of peace . in another example where she has seemingly succeeded where blair failed , merkel has kept germany free from washington 's apron strings in pursuing dialogue with iran and syria , and a two-state solution of the arab-israeli conflict while maintaining good relations with the white house . meanwhile blair is left to privately rue his decision to join the us in the war against iraq while germany takes the initiative in pushing for a resolution in the middle east , according to mark halsey , author of the book " blair 's legacy . " " iraq pretty much killed his dream of securing peace in the middle east , " halsey said .
" his attempts to save his tarnished reputation in the region by pressing for movement on the arab-israeli peace process also failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has found bush to be a fickle bed-fellow " he was defeated by washington 's pro-israeli neoconservatives , who believe israel should be free to settle its conflict with the palestinians , syria and hezbollah in lebanon on its own terms , " halsey added .
" that ended any real hope of blair leading the way in any peace process , or the americans letting him take the lead . " while germany 's nazi past will never allow it to put serious pressure on israel , merkel has maintained a level of independence in her dealing in the middle east , which has to some extent met with us acceptance and support . a challenging trans-atlantic relationship after the obvious divisions between the us and much of europe over the iraq war , the bush administration expressed relief after germany 's 2005 election when it found a leader it could be civil with after bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , descended into icy silence after the war began . even as us-german relations are back to normal on the surface after the schröder years , germany and the us do not share all the same interests , strategies and perceptions .
iraq and climate change being the clearest examples .
meanwhile , merkel 's boldest trans-atlantic initiative - an economic zone between europe and the us - has also raised little excitement in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is seen as europe 's point person by washington despite the differences , it is now merkel and not blair that the americans come to talk to on the current hot topics .
us experts say the bush administration views merkel as the " anchor point " for its dealings with the eu .
while blair is seen as a lame duck premier who has served his purpose , merkel is a leader on the rise . " she 's the big player in europe right now , " kurt volker , the bush administration 's principal deputy assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs , was quoted as saying after merkel ’ s visit to washington earlier this year . marginalized blair seeks climate agreement blair is expected to stand down as prime minister this spring .
but before he does , he wants to sign off on a new environmental agreement which would bind all the main players to a set of goals on the stabilization of emissions and the establishment of a global price for carbon trading . ironically , as blair pursues his last remaining legacy option , angela merkel is the person best equipped to take the lead in the global climate debate .
as a physicist and the former environment minister who negotiated the kyoto protocol for germany in 1997 , merkel knows that the basic science of climate change is no longer in dispute .
she also knows that the scale and urgency of the challenge the world faces is worse than previously thought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair is forced to watch merkel make all the decisions as well as chairing the eu spring summit in march , where leaders will make major decisions on the future of climate and energy security policies , merkel will put climate change at the top of the agenda for this year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .
she will then lead the negotiations for securing agreement on the principles of a more comprehensive deal ahead of a united nations meeting in bali later in the year . by then , blair may have played his last part on the world stage ; watching from the wings as germany 's first female chancellor makes progress on all the issues that eluded him during his time as prime minister . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , blair push for action to prevent climate change german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday after a meeting with british prime minster tony blair that she hopes to set concrete goals on climate protection at the g8 summit of the world 's richest nations in june .

but as time runs out , angela merkel is the leader most likely to achieve his goals . when tony blair flew to berlin on tuesday for talks on climate change with german chancellor angela merkel , there was more to the meeting than just two international figures attempting to keep the slowly turning wheels of environmental politics going . while the british prime minister arrived in the german capital intent on capitalizing on the slight recent shift in global thinking towards tackling climate change by discussing plans with the current eu president and leader of the g8 , blair was also seizing what many observers see as his last chance to leave a positive legacy when his premiership comes to an end . blair has embarked on many missions during his 10-year tenure in downing street .
his desire to be remembered for one great success on the global stage has led him to pursue campaigns to resolve the israeli-palestinian conflict and bring peace to the middle east , to rebuild the bridges between the united states and europe , and to bring the world together in a binding international agreement on climate change . the war in iraq put paid to both blair 's influence in the middle east and his credibility as the link between europe and the us .
his visit to berlin shows , that with time running out , he has to work with the woman who has replaced him as the point person on all the major issues he held dear if he wants to go down in history as the leader who attempted to save the world from environmental disaster . merkel getting results in the middle east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel gets access and results seemingly beyond blair merkel 's more pragmatic and candid approach to the volatile situation in the middle east , as seen during her recent peacemaking tour of egypt , saudi arabia and the gulf , has so far achieved more than blair could have ever expected from his own efforts . merkel personally persuaded us president george w. bush to accept the link between iraq and a wider middle east settlement ; encouraged the americans to revive the mideast quartet negotiating forum and rallied a number of arab states behind her vision of peace . in another example where she has seemingly succeeded where blair failed , merkel has kept germany free from washington 's apron strings in pursuing dialogue with iran and syria , and a two-state solution of the arab-israeli conflict while maintaining good relations with the white house . meanwhile blair is left to privately rue his decision to join the us in the war against iraq while germany takes the initiative in pushing for a resolution in the middle east , according to mark halsey , author of the book " blair 's legacy . " " iraq pretty much killed his dream of securing peace in the middle east , " halsey said .
" his attempts to save his tarnished reputation in the region by pressing for movement on the arab-israeli peace process also failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair has found bush to be a fickle bed-fellow " he was defeated by washington 's pro-israeli neoconservatives , who believe israel should be free to settle its conflict with the palestinians , syria and hezbollah in lebanon on its own terms , " halsey added .
" that ended any real hope of blair leading the way in any peace process , or the americans letting him take the lead . " while germany 's nazi past will never allow it to put serious pressure on israel , merkel has maintained a level of independence in her dealing in the middle east , which has to some extent met with us acceptance and support . a challenging trans-atlantic relationship after the obvious divisions between the us and much of europe over the iraq war , the bush administration expressed relief after germany 's 2005 election when it found a leader it could be civil with after bush 's relationship with merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schröder , descended into icy silence after the war began . even as us-german relations are back to normal on the surface after the schröder years , germany and the us do not share all the same interests , strategies and perceptions .
iraq and climate change being the clearest examples .
meanwhile , merkel 's boldest trans-atlantic initiative - an economic zone between europe and the us - has also raised little excitement in washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is seen as europe 's point person by washington despite the differences , it is now merkel and not blair that the americans come to talk to on the current hot topics .
us experts say the bush administration views merkel as the " anchor point " for its dealings with the eu .
while blair is seen as a lame duck premier who has served his purpose , merkel is a leader on the rise . " she 's the big player in europe right now , " kurt volker , the bush administration 's principal deputy assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs , was quoted as saying after merkel ’ s visit to washington earlier this year . marginalized blair seeks climate agreement blair is expected to stand down as prime minister this spring .

" we want more control mechanisms , " she said .
" whenever you are in shop buying a computer or video game it is going to be clear - this is not to be in children 's hands . " fears follow school shootings the move comes in the wake of increasing german concern about the effects of violent media on young people and possible links to extreme acts of violence by young people in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen called for larger warning labels on violent video games and movies in november last year , an 18-year-old student shot and injured 32 people at his former high school , before committing suicide at the scene .
according to his former schoolmates , the young man was a fanatical player of the violent computer game " counter-strike . "
at the time , parents and politicians called for action against such games . von der leyen 's plans include bigger warning labels , similar to those on cigarette packets warning of the dangers of smoking , on computer games .
the amendments also call for violent computer games with age restrictions to produce a beeping sound when scanned at cash registers to alert the cashier .
some games and films would also no longer be available at general shops at all . the second part of her strategy involves greater information for parents , including several online portals that will soon be available to inform parents about the content of computer games on the market problem beyond borders armin laschet , youth minister of the state of north rhine-westphalia , supported the move but also said eu-wide action is needed . " we need a european debate because games are produced in every member state of the european union and abroad from asia or the united states , " laschet said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent games do not necessarily lead to violent actions , an expert said however , not everyone agrees on the alleged link between violent entertainment and violent action .
klaus hurrelmann , a specialist in sociology and child development at the university of bielefeld , said the evidence does n't support the connection made by politicians . " we have to rely on research in this case that says there is no lineal or causal relationship between computer games and violent behavior , " he said .
" we have , first , the vulnerable personality that really triggers violence , and , second , finding a fitting context .
only if these things come together does the vicious circle begin . " hardy graupner -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu justice chiefs tackle violent video games european justice ministers have agreed to compare notes on the control of violent video games , while stopping short of suggesting eu-wide legislation .
-lrb- 16.01.2007 -rrb- no causal relationship between video games and violence exists politicians have raised the issue of whether violent video games contributed to a school shooting in germany this week .
dw.world.de spoke to sociology professor klaus hurrelmann about how influential video games can be .
-lrb- 21.11.2006 -rrb- scientists debate violent influence at gaming conference according to some , violent computer games are the scourge of society , the corrupters of the young and should be banned .
but scientists are less than convinced and want more research done before passing judgement .

" google said in paris that it would appeal against the decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google co-founders larry page , left , and sergey brin " google regrets today 's decision and will appeal , " said google news legal counsel for europe yoram elkaim in paris .

but in the past , italy and france have also had to decide how to battle left-wing terrorists . the italian marxist-leninist terrorist group brigate rosse or red brigades officially disbanded in the 1980s , but pockets have remained , as arrests on monday showed . italian authorities took 15 people into custody .
the suspects are allegedly linked to the red brigades for planning several attacks , including one on a company owned by former premier silvio berlusconi .
they have been accused of " associating with terrorists and participating in an armed group , " the italian interior ministry said . the group , founded in 1973 , has been mainly inoperative since the end of the cold war .
but in the 1970s and 1980s , it was responsible for thousands of acts of violence .
over 400 deaths are attributed to the red brigades . the climax of red brigades terror occurred in 1978 , when the group kidnapped former prime minister aldo moros and subsequently murdered him .
the period belonged to the most dramatic days that italy experienced since the end of the second world war . today , a small plaque on house number 9 in the via caetani in rome 's city center commemorates the moros murder .
on may 9 , 1978 , his body was found here , in the trunk of a parked car . groups had the same goals , but no cooperation left-wing extremists such as the brigate rosse in italy also existed in germany and france in the 1970s .
all groups wanted to build up an " anti-imperial european front , " said rolf tophoven , director of the institute for terrorism research and security policy in essen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf tophoven is a leading german terrorism expert germany 's red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , the red brigades and action directe in france had a social revolutionary approach in common . " they were against the state , against exploitation and for the interests of the working class , " tophoven said .
" they were aiming for the revolutionary reorganization of society according to a marxist-leninist ideal . " the instrument they chose to meet this goal was violence , and the targets were mainly leading politicians and top managers from the business world .
but the groups never got further than an ideological linking . cross-border cooperation , such as that practiced by islamic terrorist groups today , never existed . justice collaborators helped break up the red brigades the red brigades had dreamt of a communist order in italy .
the result , though , was a climate of uncertainty and violence caused by numerous assaults and kidnappings .
the break came after the moros murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldo moro spent 55 days in the red brigades ' hands before he was killed " this event shocked all of italy , " tophoven said .
" for the first time , a wide front spanning across all political parties formed against the terror from the left . " the decisive aspect of the fight against terror in italy was the so-called pentiti , or justice collaborators .
it offered leading heads of the movement a milder sentence if they cooperated with the state . " this led to the breakup of the red brigades in 1982 , " tophoven said .
over 200 activists received sentences at the time - 85 of them for life . in the meantime , however , many have been released from prison or were granted day release .
in 1998 , when founder renato curcio was released after 24 years in prison , the discussion in italy was nowhere near as heated as in germany .
a german court ruled on monday that former raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt will be released on parole next month .
this has sparked a sharp debate across the country . public opinion in france forced government action in france in the 1980s , the government and president francois mitterrand initially reacted relatively reserved to action directe .
as opposed to germany , they did n't consider the state order directly endangered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joëlle aubron from action directe died of cancer in 2006 but with the action directe commando 's first casualties , public opinion changed .
the major left-wing liberal newspapers , such as le monde and libération condemned action directe .
the publications criticized the lacking reference to the working class , in whose name the group operated . the french government took a tougher stance after the murders of general rene audran in 1985 and renault director georges besse in 1986 .
one year later , the founders of the group , jean-marc rouillan , nathalie ménigon and georges cipriani were arrested and action directe fell apart . in 2006 , the three prisoners requested release on parole after serving the minimum time of 18 years .
but authorities denied the request due to their lack of remorse . raf dissolved itself following the successes in italy , the witness leniency program was introduced in germany , too .
but the raf dissolved itself .
in a letter in 1992 , it declared its fight as useless and the raf experiment as failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack on federal prosecutor siegfried buback left three dead following the decision to release mohnhaupt on parole , three raf members remain in prison : christian klar , eva sybille haule and birgit hogefeld .
their prison sentences could also be changed into a suspended sentence after 2009 . " in all three countries , the social revolutionary experiments drenched in violence and terrorist attacks failed , " tophoven said .
the virtually worldwide collapse of real socialism ultimately contributed , too .

but in the past , italy and france have also had to decide how to battle left-wing terrorists . the italian marxist-leninist terrorist group brigate rosse or red brigades officially disbanded in the 1980s , but pockets have remained , as arrests on monday showed . italian authorities took 15 people into custody .
the suspects are allegedly linked to the red brigades for planning several attacks , including one on a company owned by former premier silvio berlusconi .
they have been accused of " associating with terrorists and participating in an armed group , " the italian interior ministry said . the group , founded in 1973 , has been mainly inoperative since the end of the cold war .
but in the 1970s and 1980s , it was responsible for thousands of acts of violence .
over 400 deaths are attributed to the red brigades . the climax of red brigades terror occurred in 1978 , when the group kidnapped former prime minister aldo moros and subsequently murdered him .
the period belonged to the most dramatic days that italy experienced since the end of the second world war . today , a small plaque on house number 9 in the via caetani in rome 's city center commemorates the moros murder .
on may 9 , 1978 , his body was found here , in the trunk of a parked car . groups had the same goals , but no cooperation left-wing extremists such as the brigate rosse in italy also existed in germany and france in the 1970s .
all groups wanted to build up an " anti-imperial european front , " said rolf tophoven , director of the institute for terrorism research and security policy in essen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf tophoven is a leading german terrorism expert germany 's red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , the red brigades and action directe in france had a social revolutionary approach in common . " they were against the state , against exploitation and for the interests of the working class , " tophoven said .
" they were aiming for the revolutionary reorganization of society according to a marxist-leninist ideal . " the instrument they chose to meet this goal was violence , and the targets were mainly leading politicians and top managers from the business world .
but the groups never got further than an ideological linking . cross-border cooperation , such as that practiced by islamic terrorist groups today , never existed . justice collaborators helped break up the red brigades the red brigades had dreamt of a communist order in italy .
the result , though , was a climate of uncertainty and violence caused by numerous assaults and kidnappings .
the break came after the moros murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldo moro spent 55 days in the red brigades ' hands before he was killed " this event shocked all of italy , " tophoven said .
" for the first time , a wide front spanning across all political parties formed against the terror from the left . " the decisive aspect of the fight against terror in italy was the so-called pentiti , or justice collaborators .
it offered leading heads of the movement a milder sentence if they cooperated with the state . " this led to the breakup of the red brigades in 1982 , " tophoven said .
over 200 activists received sentences at the time - 85 of them for life . in the meantime , however , many have been released from prison or were granted day release .
in 1998 , when founder renato curcio was released after 24 years in prison , the discussion in italy was nowhere near as heated as in germany .
a german court ruled on monday that former raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt will be released on parole next month .
this has sparked a sharp debate across the country . public opinion in france forced government action in france in the 1980s , the government and president francois mitterrand initially reacted relatively reserved to action directe .
as opposed to germany , they did n't consider the state order directly endangered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joëlle aubron from action directe died of cancer in 2006 but with the action directe commando 's first casualties , public opinion changed .
the major left-wing liberal newspapers , such as le monde and libération condemned action directe .
the publications criticized the lacking reference to the working class , in whose name the group operated . the french government took a tougher stance after the murders of general rene audran in 1985 and renault director georges besse in 1986 .
one year later , the founders of the group , jean-marc rouillan , nathalie ménigon and georges cipriani were arrested and action directe fell apart . in 2006 , the three prisoners requested release on parole after serving the minimum time of 18 years .
but authorities denied the request due to their lack of remorse . raf dissolved itself following the successes in italy , the witness leniency program was introduced in germany , too .
but the raf dissolved itself .
in a letter in 1992 , it declared its fight as useless and the raf experiment as failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack on federal prosecutor siegfried buback left three dead following the decision to release mohnhaupt on parole , three raf members remain in prison : christian klar , eva sybille haule and birgit hogefeld .
their prison sentences could also be changed into a suspended sentence after 2009 . " in all three countries , the social revolutionary experiments drenched in violence and terrorist attacks failed , " tophoven said .

but in the past , italy and france have also had to decide how to battle left-wing terrorists . the italian marxist-leninist terrorist group brigate rosse or red brigades officially disbanded in the 1980s , but pockets have remained , as arrests on monday showed . italian authorities took 15 people into custody .
the suspects are allegedly linked to the red brigades for planning several attacks , including one on a company owned by former premier silvio berlusconi .
they have been accused of " associating with terrorists and participating in an armed group , " the italian interior ministry said . the group , founded in 1973 , has been mainly inoperative since the end of the cold war .
but in the 1970s and 1980s , it was responsible for thousands of acts of violence .
over 400 deaths are attributed to the red brigades . the climax of red brigades terror occurred in 1978 , when the group kidnapped former prime minister aldo moros and subsequently murdered him .
the period belonged to the most dramatic days that italy experienced since the end of the second world war . today , a small plaque on house number 9 in the via caetani in rome 's city center commemorates the moros murder .
on may 9 , 1978 , his body was found here , in the trunk of a parked car . groups had the same goals , but no cooperation left-wing extremists such as the brigate rosse in italy also existed in germany and france in the 1970s .
all groups wanted to build up an " anti-imperial european front , " said rolf tophoven , director of the institute for terrorism research and security policy in essen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf tophoven is a leading german terrorism expert germany 's red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- , the red brigades and action directe in france had a social revolutionary approach in common . " they were against the state , against exploitation and for the interests of the working class , " tophoven said .
" they were aiming for the revolutionary reorganization of society according to a marxist-leninist ideal . " the instrument they chose to meet this goal was violence , and the targets were mainly leading politicians and top managers from the business world .
but the groups never got further than an ideological linking . cross-border cooperation , such as that practiced by islamic terrorist groups today , never existed . justice collaborators helped break up the red brigades the red brigades had dreamt of a communist order in italy .
the result , though , was a climate of uncertainty and violence caused by numerous assaults and kidnappings .
the break came after the moros murder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldo moro spent 55 days in the red brigades ' hands before he was killed " this event shocked all of italy , " tophoven said .
" for the first time , a wide front spanning across all political parties formed against the terror from the left . " the decisive aspect of the fight against terror in italy was the so-called pentiti , or justice collaborators .
it offered leading heads of the movement a milder sentence if they cooperated with the state . " this led to the breakup of the red brigades in 1982 , " tophoven said .
over 200 activists received sentences at the time - 85 of them for life . in the meantime , however , many have been released from prison or were granted day release .
in 1998 , when founder renato curcio was released after 24 years in prison , the discussion in italy was nowhere near as heated as in germany .
a german court ruled on monday that former raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt will be released on parole next month .
this has sparked a sharp debate across the country . public opinion in france forced government action in france in the 1980s , the government and president francois mitterrand initially reacted relatively reserved to action directe .
as opposed to germany , they did n't consider the state order directly endangered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joëlle aubron from action directe died of cancer in 2006 but with the action directe commando 's first casualties , public opinion changed .
the major left-wing liberal newspapers , such as le monde and libération condemned action directe .
the publications criticized the lacking reference to the working class , in whose name the group operated . the french government took a tougher stance after the murders of general rene audran in 1985 and renault director georges besse in 1986 .
one year later , the founders of the group , jean-marc rouillan , nathalie ménigon and georges cipriani were arrested and action directe fell apart . in 2006 , the three prisoners requested release on parole after serving the minimum time of 18 years .
but authorities denied the request due to their lack of remorse . raf dissolved itself following the successes in italy , the witness leniency program was introduced in germany , too .
but the raf dissolved itself .
in a letter in 1992 , it declared its fight as useless and the raf experiment as failed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attack on federal prosecutor siegfried buback left three dead following the decision to release mohnhaupt on parole , three raf members remain in prison : christian klar , eva sybille haule and birgit hogefeld .
their prison sentences could also be changed into a suspended sentence after 2009 . " in all three countries , the social revolutionary experiments drenched in violence and terrorist attacks failed , " tophoven said .
the virtually worldwide collapse of real socialism ultimately contributed , too . " the story of the anti-imperialist european front is a story of failure , " tophoven said . ina rottscheidt -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de release of former militant sparks mixed feelings in germany most german political parties consider the release of the one-time terrorist and red army faction leader brigitte mohnhaupt as a sign of justice .

the state even went beyond german demands at the time . belgium actively helped the occupying german forces round up and deport the country 's jewish population during the second world war , according to historians from the center for historical research and documentation on war and contemporary society -lrb- ceges -rrb- in brussels . " the belgian state adopted a docile and cooperative attitude in some very diverse , but crucial domains providing collaboration unworthy of a democracy , with a policy that was disastrous for belgian and foreign jews , " the historians said . the report " docile belgium , " commissioned by the belgian parliament , said the state collaborated with the nazis for " economic , as well as ideological and legal-administrative " reasons .
it is the first time belgium 's cooperation with the nazis has been presented in such detail . project leader rudi van doorslaer said " a xenophobic and sometimes anti-semitic culture of the ruling elite " in the 1930s had prepared belgium psychologically for the persecution of the jews .

it is the first time belgium 's cooperation with the nazis has been presented in such detail . project leader rudi van doorslaer said " a xenophobic and sometimes anti-semitic culture of the ruling elite " in the 1930s had prepared belgium psychologically for the persecution of the jews .
the " democratic deficit " in the years from 1930 to 1940 had also played a role , doorslaer said . " the step from passive to active collaboration was quickly taken , " doorslaer said as he read the report 's conclusions to the parliament on tuesday . government in exile authorized cooperation with the nazis doorslaer said the country had closed its doors to jews fleeing germany after hitler came to power in 1933 .
according to the ceges study , the deportations began shortly after may 10 , 1940 , when german annexed predominantly german-speaking cantons in eastern belgium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of belgian jews were killed in the auschwitz concentration camp following the nazi invasion in 1940 , the belgian government fled to britain .
but the report found that the government in exile in london during the war " never let it be known that policies had to be adapted and that the behavior of leading civil servants and magistrates was unconstitutional and democratically reprehensible . " however , belgian authorities were not aware in summer 1942 that jews deported to poland were being exterminated , the report said . some 50,000 jews lived in belgium in the 1930s .
about half were killed during the holocaust . many belgians tried to save jewish people belgian jewish groups reacted positively to the study . " this report is fundamental and it is a victory for enlightened democracy , " said philippe markiewicz , head of the coordination committee of belgian jewish organizations . markiewicz said despite the negative impact of the report , there were many belgians who risked their lives to save jews . findings should go into the history books the ceges historians spent three years researching and writing the 1,114-page study and were able to view documents previously unused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis forced the jewish population to wear the yellow star of david prime minister guy verhofstadt apologized already to the jewish community in 2002 for belgium 's role in the holocaust .
his spokesman said that verhofstadt felt the ceges findings should be incorporated into history textbooks . the historians worked out the details of three major phases relating to the persecution of belgian jews .
in october and november 1940 , the central government followed the nazis ' request to require all jews to register with their local authorities . in the summer of 1942 , when the nazi regime began massively deporting belgians of jewish origin , collaboration started diminishing .
brussels refused to make jews wear yellow stars , which the nazis prescribed in order to identify them more easily .
the police in antwerp , on the other hand , arbitrarily arrested 1,243 jews and handed them over to the germans . after the end of the war , belgian military judicial authorities decided that investigating the deportation of the jewish people was too " delicate " to be allowed to continue . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film on wiesenthal 's legacy opens at berlinale a documentary about the life of famous nazi hunter simon wiesenthal has premiered at the berlin international film festival .

" we want more control mechanisms , " she said .
" whenever you are in shop buying a computer or video game it is going to be clear - this is not to be in children 's hands . " fears follow school shootings the move comes in the wake of increasing german concern about the effects of violent media on young people and possible links to extreme acts of violence by young people in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen called for larger warning labels on violent video games and movies in november last year , an 18-year-old student shot and injured 32 people at his former high school , before committing suicide at the scene .
according to his former schoolmates , the young man was a fanatical player of the violent computer game " counter-strike . "
at the time , parents and politicians called for action against such games . von der leyen 's plans include bigger warning labels , similar to those on cigarette packets warning of the dangers of smoking , on computer games .
the amendments also call for violent computer games with age restrictions to produce a beeping sound when scanned at cash registers to alert the cashier .
some games and films would also no longer be available at general shops at all . the second part of her strategy involves greater information for parents , including several online portals that will soon be available to inform parents about the content of computer games on the market problem beyond borders armin laschet , youth minister of the state of north rhine-westphalia , supported the move but also said eu-wide action is needed . " we need a european debate because games are produced in every member state of the european union and abroad from asia or the united states , " laschet said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent games do not necessarily lead to violent actions , an expert said however , not everyone agrees on the alleged link between violent entertainment and violent action .
klaus hurrelmann , a specialist in sociology and child development at the university of bielefeld , said the evidence does n't support the connection made by politicians . " we have to rely on research in this case that says there is no lineal or causal relationship between computer games and violent behavior , " he said .
" we have , first , the vulnerable personality that really triggers violence , and , second , finding a fitting context .
only if these things come together does the vicious circle begin . " hardy graupner -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu justice chiefs tackle violent video games european justice ministers have agreed to compare notes on the control of violent video games , while stopping short of suggesting eu-wide legislation .
-lrb- 16.01.2007 -rrb- no causal relationship between video games and violence exists politicians have raised the issue of whether violent video games contributed to a school shooting in germany this week .
dw.world.de spoke to sociology professor klaus hurrelmann about how influential video games can be .
-lrb- 21.11.2006 -rrb- scientists debate violent influence at gaming conference according to some , violent computer games are the scourge of society , the corrupters of the young and should be banned .
but scientists are less than convinced and want more research done before passing judgement .

the state even went beyond german demands at the time . belgium actively helped the occupying german forces round up and deport the country 's jewish population during the second world war , according to historians from the center for historical research and documentation on war and contemporary society -lrb- ceges -rrb- in brussels . " the belgian state adopted a docile and cooperative attitude in some very diverse , but crucial domains providing collaboration unworthy of a democracy , with a policy that was disastrous for belgian and foreign jews , " the historians said . the report " docile belgium , " commissioned by the belgian parliament , said the state collaborated with the nazis for " economic , as well as ideological and legal-administrative " reasons .
it is the first time belgium 's cooperation with the nazis has been presented in such detail . project leader rudi van doorslaer said " a xenophobic and sometimes anti-semitic culture of the ruling elite " in the 1930s had prepared belgium psychologically for the persecution of the jews .
the " democratic deficit " in the years from 1930 to 1940 had also played a role , doorslaer said . " the step from passive to active collaboration was quickly taken , " doorslaer said as he read the report 's conclusions to the parliament on tuesday . government in exile authorized cooperation with the nazis doorslaer said the country had closed its doors to jews fleeing germany after hitler came to power in 1933 .
according to the ceges study , the deportations began shortly after may 10 , 1940 , when german annexed predominantly german-speaking cantons in eastern belgium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of belgian jews were killed in the auschwitz concentration camp following the nazi invasion in 1940 , the belgian government fled to britain .
but the report found that the government in exile in london during the war " never let it be known that policies had to be adapted and that the behavior of leading civil servants and magistrates was unconstitutional and democratically reprehensible . " however , belgian authorities were not aware in summer 1942 that jews deported to poland were being exterminated , the report said . some 50,000 jews lived in belgium in the 1930s .
about half were killed during the holocaust . many belgians tried to save jewish people belgian jewish groups reacted positively to the study . " this report is fundamental and it is a victory for enlightened democracy , " said philippe markiewicz , head of the coordination committee of belgian jewish organizations . markiewicz said despite the negative impact of the report , there were many belgians who risked their lives to save jews . findings should go into the history books the ceges historians spent three years researching and writing the 1,114-page study and were able to view documents previously unused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis forced the jewish population to wear the yellow star of david prime minister guy verhofstadt apologized already to the jewish community in 2002 for belgium 's role in the holocaust .
his spokesman said that verhofstadt felt the ceges findings should be incorporated into history textbooks . the historians worked out the details of three major phases relating to the persecution of belgian jews .
in october and november 1940 , the central government followed the nazis ' request to require all jews to register with their local authorities . in the summer of 1942 , when the nazi regime began massively deporting belgians of jewish origin , collaboration started diminishing .
brussels refused to make jews wear yellow stars , which the nazis prescribed in order to identify them more easily .
the police in antwerp , on the other hand , arbitrarily arrested 1,243 jews and handed them over to the germans . after the end of the war , belgian military judicial authorities decided that investigating the deportation of the jewish people was too " delicate " to be allowed to continue . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de film on wiesenthal 's legacy opens at berlinale a documentary about the life of famous nazi hunter simon wiesenthal has premiered at the berlin international film festival .

some 39 officers were injured and six hooligans temporarily detained . the german soccer community , politicians and police were outraged over saturday 's soccer violence , which was a stark contrast to last summer 's festive world cup matches played in leipzig , the only tournament venue in the former east germany . germans are asking how flares and fireworks that were used as ammunition at the riot could have been brought into the stadium .
they blame lax security at fourth division club lokomotiv leipzig , whose fans were responsible for the violent clashes with the police . dfb : no games without security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no security assurances , no games , says the dfb 's zwanziger " if we are n't able to offer secure stadiums , or prevent such incidents , then we ca n't allow soccer matches to take place there , " theo zwanziger , head of the germany soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- , when announcing that all lower-league matches in saxony for this weekend would be cancelled . zwanziger made it clear that the cancellation of some 60 lower league matches is a symbolic act , a message of solidarity to the police that is meant to show that violence is not tolerated in and around football stadiums in saxony . but some soccer clubs said they feel a sweeping cancellation is not fair .
fc sachsen leipzig had a match planned for saturday , which is now going to be held the following week . " it 's a signal in the wrong direction , " said fc sachsen 's goalkeeper steffen süssner .
" the situation should have been solved differently ; now , we 're just punishing the clubs and the fans , i do n't think that 's right . " politicians must make the decisions , says coach fc sachsen leipzig coach eduard geier said the politicians were taking the easy way out . " politicians need to act here , we all do , we have to be role models and make sure that there are orderly games and fair play on the field , " he said .
" politicians have to deal with the rest .
we ca n't do it without them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leipzig fans were blamed for the violence last weekend politicians have meanwhile come up with a handful of possible solutions .
saxony 's interior minister albrecht buttolo has vowed tougher measures for the future , with sports prosecutors on hand at high-risk games to issue arrest warrants on the spot if violent scenes occur .
buttolo also threatened games behind closed doors , as were recently played in italy after the death of a police officer there , in the case of further incidents . geier was skeptical of such plans . " as along as the perpetrators are let go every time , and as long as they 're never punished , the chaotic situation wo n't change , " the fc sachsen leipzig coach said . dagmar breitenbach -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : scores injured as hooligans battle police in leipzig riot forty-two people , including 36 policemen , were injured in crowd trouble after a german regional soccer cup match between two amateur teams in the eastern city of leipzig , police said sunday .

figures from the university admissions service , ucas , are expected to show a rise in applications of more than 5 % .
the rise is the first sign that higher fees are not deterring students .
since september 2006 , students in england have had to pay up to £ 3,000 a year towards tuition , although not until after graduation .
when these so-called " top-up fees " were introduced last year , applications fell 3 % .
government ministers and universities will be relieved that this trend has not continued .
the initial slump in applications may have been a one-off effect , similar to the one-year decline in 1998 when tuition fees were first introduced -lrb- then about £ 1,000 a year , but paid upfront -rrb- .
the figures could show an overall increase in applications of 7 % , although there are big variations between individual universities and across the different parts of the uk .
full details will be published by ucas later .
in a separate report , the umbrella group universities uk found there was no correlation between the level of fees charged by universities , or the bursaries offered , and the level of applications .

already european isps and phone companies are in the process of implementing an eu directive which forces them to retain a variety of communication data for up to two years .
now , a republican congressman , lamar smith , has put forward a bill for discussion in the us congress that could see a similar regime operating stateside .
experts think it is unlikely that the us will introduce draconian data retention laws any time soon , not because they do not want to but because similar european legislation is currently in varying degrees of disarray .
" it would be a case of a european disease moving to the us .
there are so many silly aspects to the eu legislation , not least that implementation is practically impossible , " said gus hosein from advocacy group privacy international clear as mud ? "
the legislation has been written by people who did n't understand the internet " richard clayton , computer expert the controversial measures that european government are currently trying to interpret require internet service providers and phone companies to keep a record of internet usage , e-mail logs and phone call records .
there is no requirement to keep the content of messages .
most experts agree that the legislation has been poorly drafted and is therefore open to a wide range of interpretations .
" nobody knows what they mean .
the legislation has been written by people who did n't understand the internet , " said richard clayton , a researcher at cambridge university who specialises in web traceability .
even if the legislation was clearer , there would still be big issues with it .
firstly , the cost of storing the data , which will , said mr clayton , be filtered back to customers in the form of rising access costs .
secondly there is a question of how to make sense of and sift through the huge amount of data being stored .
there are also concerns that the data retention requirements will stifle creativity .
" bringing out new services , such as web-based mail , could be affected as it would also require a data retention system , " said tj mcintyre , chairman of civil rights organisation digital rights ireland .
it has launched a legal challenge to the directive .
data preservation timetable for data retention the eu directive came into force in april 2006 member states have until september 2007 to implement the directive uk isps have won an extension until march 2008 data must be kept for a minimum of six months and maximum of two years while some countries wait to see the result of this challenge before kick-starting their data retention regimes , the uk government has instigated a voluntary system and has offered to pay for some of the data storage costs , as well as looking at the best way to extrapolate information from the data once it is collected .
it all adds up to a way of dealing with data retention that others would do well to mimic , thinks mr clayton .
" the uk system has a lot going for it .
there is a strong tradition of listening to isps , " he said .
currently in the united states there is no requirement for internet service providers to keep data .
in practice though most do keep it for a short period of time -lrb- up to 10 days -rrb- as it is useful for their own purposes , such as dealing with spam .
the authorities also operate a system of data preservation , in which isps are asking to keep data for longer on a case by case basis it was revealed last year that the national security agency was already utilising data retention .
it was reported by usa today that the nsa has routinely been collecting the phone call records of millions of americans , using data provided by at & t , verizon and bellsouth in an effort to form a picture of terrorist activity .
the latest attempt to push through the legislation in the us is being billed as a way of protecting both children from online paedophiles and as part of the ongoing war against terrorists but privacy advocates are concerned that there is no evidence such retention helps with any sort of crime investigation .
pub talk " when we mounted our legal challenge we have never once been given an example of where data retention has been necessary to solve a crime , " said mr mcintyre .
the vagueness of existing legislation could also open up so-called data snooping to a variety of purposes that it was not really intended for , such as data being used in divorce cases or employees ' data trails being followed by suspicious bosses .
even as a tool for law enforcers alone , it could have limited usefulness , argue some .
" it might help capture the naïve and unthinking but is unlikely to deter serious criminals .
they could just as easily have their conversations in a pub but no-one is considering putting microphones in all pubs , " said mr clayton .
it is clear that the debate about data retention is far from over and the balance between privacy and access for law enforcers is a tricky one to maintain .
for mr clayton and many other critics of the current plans there is more at stake than just how to open up the web to surveillance .
" it is a matter for society to decide what kind of world they want to live in , " he said .

already european isps and phone companies are in the process of implementing an eu directive which forces them to retain a variety of communication data for up to two years .
now , a republican congressman , lamar smith , has put forward a bill for discussion in the us congress that could see a similar regime operating stateside .
experts think it is unlikely that the us will introduce draconian data retention laws any time soon , not because they do not want to but because similar european legislation is currently in varying degrees of disarray .
" it would be a case of a european disease moving to the us .

data preservation timetable for data retention the eu directive came into force in april 2006 member states have until september 2007 to implement the directive uk isps have won an extension until march 2008 data must be kept for a minimum of six months and maximum of two years while some countries wait to see the result of this challenge before kick-starting their data retention regimes , the uk government has instigated a voluntary system and has offered to pay for some of the data storage costs , as well as looking at the best way to extrapolate information from the data once it is collected .

data preservation timetable for data retention the eu directive came into force in april 2006 member states have until september 2007 to implement the directive uk isps have won an extension until march 2008 data must be kept for a minimum of six months and maximum of two years while some countries wait to see the result of this challenge before kick-starting their data retention regimes , the uk government has instigated a voluntary system and has offered to pay for some of the data storage costs , as well as looking at the best way to extrapolate information from the data once it is collected .
it all adds up to a way of dealing with data retention that others would do well to mimic , thinks mr clayton .
" the uk system has a lot going for it .
there is a strong tradition of listening to isps , " he said .
currently in the united states there is no requirement for internet service providers to keep data .
in practice though most do keep it for a short period of time -lrb- up to 10 days -rrb- as it is useful for their own purposes , such as dealing with spam .
the authorities also operate a system of data preservation , in which isps are asking to keep data for longer on a case by case basis it was revealed last year that the national security agency was already utilising data retention .
it was reported by usa today that the nsa has routinely been collecting the phone call records of millions of americans , using data provided by at & t , verizon and bellsouth in an effort to form a picture of terrorist activity .
the latest attempt to push through the legislation in the us is being billed as a way of protecting both children from online paedophiles and as part of the ongoing war against terrorists but privacy advocates are concerned that there is no evidence such retention helps with any sort of crime investigation .
pub talk " when we mounted our legal challenge we have never once been given an example of where data retention has been necessary to solve a crime , " said mr mcintyre .
the vagueness of existing legislation could also open up so-called data snooping to a variety of purposes that it was not really intended for , such as data being used in divorce cases or employees ' data trails being followed by suspicious bosses .
even as a tool for law enforcers alone , it could have limited usefulness , argue some .
" it might help capture the naïve and unthinking but is unlikely to deter serious criminals .
they could just as easily have their conversations in a pub but no-one is considering putting microphones in all pubs , " said mr clayton .
it is clear that the debate about data retention is far from over and the balance between privacy and access for law enforcers is a tricky one to maintain .
for mr clayton and many other critics of the current plans there is more at stake than just how to open up the web to surveillance .
" it is a matter for society to decide what kind of world they want to live in , " he said .

the initiative , which ran until midnight , gave owners of illegal dog breeds the opportunity to hand over their animals without being prosecuted .
nine of the 86 animals will be subject to a court decision on their future .
the amnesty covered pit bull terriers , japanese tosa , dogo argentino and fila brazileiro breeds , which are banned under the 1991 dangerous dogs act .
in all police received 644 inquiries during the week-long initiative which was sparked by the death of five-year-old ellie lawrenson , who was fatally mauled by a dog on new year 's day .
ellie was killed by her uncle 's pit bull terrier at her grandmother 's house in st helens .
he was questioned over the attack but not arrested .
owners who chose not to hand their pets over voluntarily by the time the amnesty finished will have their animals seized and could also face a £ 5,000 fine and six months imprisonment .

about 5,000 people are still without gas after an underground pipe was fractured by a digger at middlestone moor , near spennymoor , county durham .
many of those affected were given electric heaters and hot plates .
but the strain on electricity substations caused fuses to blow , blacking out more than 300 homes .
at one point more than 10,000 homes in surrounding towns and villages were without gas after monday 's leak .
the main has now been repaired , but residents now face a long wait as engineers must visit each property to carry out safety checks .
customers can help the situation if they can stagger their peak use of electricity , for example for cooking , to outside of peak times ce electric the situation has been compounded by problems with electricity supplies to some homes in the crook area because of the massive demand for power .
a spokesman for distributor ce electric said : " the gas leak is placing an unprecedented demand on the electricity network as customers seek to use electricity for cooking and heating .
" this is causing interruptions to electricity supply in some locations as fuses blow in substations .
" about 300 customers were affected at peak on tuesday evening and we are aiming to restore power to all of them soon .
" customers can help the situation if they can stagger their peak use of electricity , for example for cooking , to outside of peak times . "
a spokeswoman for northern gas networks , said the supply problem could take some time to resolve .
he said : " it 's not as simple as throwing a switch .
we have to make sure that the gas pipeline network is completely full of gas before we can begin to reconnect people .
" we hope that the majority will be back on in the next few days , but realistically it could take a week to get all those reconnected . "

1989 - fox 's faux pas defining moments : former page three model samantha fox and fleetwood mac 's mick fleetwood went down in history for turning the live 1989 award ceremony into a shambles .
they continually missed cues and fluffed their lines , and fox mistakenly introduced boy george as the four tops .
government minister kenneth baker was booed by the audience .
a pre-recorded message by michael jackson was never broadcast , despite the show ending several minutes early .
the winners : acoustic folk-pop band fairground attraction were the surprise victors , scooping awards for best album and best single .
cliff richard collected the outstanding contribution award after 30 years in the music business .
1992 - klf machine-guns audience defining moments : the band klf made headlines after performing a metal version of their dance hit 3am eternal with extreme noise terror .
the performance was so extreme it prompted conductor sir georg solti to walk out .
during their set , frontman bill drummond fired blanks from a vintage machine gun into the audience .
remarking on their performance , the venue 's announcer , scott piering said : " ladies and gentleman , the klf have now left the music business . "
they scooped the title for best band , but sent a motorcycle courier to pick up their award .
later , guests arriving for an aftershow party claim they saw the band dump a dead sheep outside the venue .
three months later , the klf disbanded .
the winners : queen won best single , 15 years after bohemian rhapsody won them the same title .
lead singer freddie mercury was given the outstanding contribution award , a year after his death .
1996 - jarvis jostles jackson defining moments : it was jarvis cocker who made michael jackson 's 1996 performance of the earth song memorable .
the pulp frontman invaded the stage , whilst jackson performed alongside a group of children .
he ran around the singer , lifted his shirt and pretended to break wind .
cocker was subsequently questioned by the police over claims he had assaulted jackson 's child dancers .
he was later released without charge .
oasis also sparked controversy the same night .
on picking up a prize from inxs frontman michael hutchence , noel gallagher commented that " has-beens should n't be presenting awards to gonna-bes " .
the winners : prince won his sixth international male artist award and jackson was given the title " artist of a generation " .
oasis took a hat-trick of awards home .
1998 - prescott 's political shower defining moments : in 1998 , chumbawamba 's guitarist danbert nobacon - real name nigel hunter - threw a bucket of iced water over deputy prime minister john prescott .
the anarchist band , who performed on the night , changed the words to their hit single tubthumping in a bid to cajole the mp .
despite apologies on behalf of the band from emi europe , chumbawamba were unrepentant , issuing a press statement the day after the incident : " if john prescott has the nerve to turn up at events like the brit awards in a vain attempt to make labour seem cool and trendy , then he deserves all we can throw at him . "
the winners : fleetwood mac 's mick fleetwood made a return to the brits after his disastrous co-hosting of the event in 1989 to collect the outstanding contribution award with the rest of the band .
the verve scored a hat-trick of awards and girl group all saints scooped two .
2000 - block versus wood defining moments : dance dj brandon block caused controversy in 2000 after appearing uninvited on stage , expecting an award .
friends had managed to convince block , who had consumed rather a lot of alcohol , that he had been called up to accept a gong .
rolling stones guitarist ronnie wood who was about to present the award with actress thora birch , aimed an insult at block whilst on stage .
the dj retaliated and wood threw a drink over him .
also in 2000 , robbie williams fuelled his public spat with oasis ' gallagher brothers by demanding to have a punch-up with the group 's singer liam .
the winners : robbie williams added to his collection of awards , picking up his fifth gong in two years .
the best british pop act award was introduced and went to boy band five .
a special award for best selling british live act in 1999 was collected by steps , who were unexpectedly beaten to the best newcomer prize at the previous ceremony .
