the bribes were meant to secure gas-turbine contracts valued at 450 million euros .
a former head of the siemens power plant unit received a two-year suspended sentence , and a consultant engineer who admitted being guilty of the charges was given a nine-month suspended sentence .
the court also ordered the embattled siemens concern to pay 38 million euros into state coffers .
the verdicts follow similar sentences handed down by a court in milan to two enel employees and two other siemens managers charged in italy in connection with the bribery case . the german engineering giant said in a statement that it would appeal the fine . " we maintain that the court 's order to forfeit the profits from two orders placed by enel with siemens ' power generation division for the supply of power plant equipment in 2000 and 2001 is illegal , " the statement said .

" an affiliate of private equity firm cerberus capital management will make a capital contribution of 5.5 billion euros in return for an 80.1-percent equity interest in chrysler , " daimlerchrysler said in a statement .
daimlerchrysler , which will be known as daimler ag , will hold a 19.9-percent equity interest chrysler .

the daimlerchrysler 's supervisory board is due to meet tuesday when the company is set to unveil its first-quarter results .
report : deal will free daimler from liabilities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loss-making chrysler will cost cerberus 5.5 billion euros the wall street journal said the proposed deal would allow the german auto giant to shed chrysler 's $ 18 billion in retirement and healthcare liabilities and could open the door to further restructuring of the nation 's unionized auto makers .
under the proposed deal , chrysler chief executive tom lasorda would continue to run the company , the journal reported , citing people familiar with the talks .
cerberus adviser wolfgang bernhard , a former chrysler chief operating officer , would not have an executive role at the automaker , but could have a board seat under the proposed deal , according to the journal report .
cerberus has a record of slashing costs at operations it acquires , and some analysts say a cerberus-owned chrysler could move much more aggressively to cut labor costs , prune chrysler 's overpopulated network of us dealers and shift investment to developing markets overseas , the us paper said .
but any final deal for chrysler also hinges on what happens this summer , when the united auto workers kicks off negotiations for new master contracts with all three detroit auto giants , the journal said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler : " a failed experiment " professor ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research at gelsenkirchen technical college , told dw-world.de that daimlerchrysler has a bright future without its loss-making chrysler arm .

a two-day informal meeting of european drug commissioners begins in berlin monday , two days after the interior ministers of the eu 's six largest countries agreed on closer cooperation with africa in the fight against drug smuggling from south america at a meeting in venice .
the venice meeting followed the three-day international drug enforcement conference in madrid last week which was hosted by the spanish government and the us drug enforcement agency -lrb- dea -rrb- , washington ’ s top anti-narcotics agency .
the talks on saturday were attended by eu justice commissioner franco frattini , the interior ministers of germany , britain , poland , france , spain and italy , and united states secretary of homeland security michael chertoff .
all supported the idea of sending european investigators to west africa as part of a new drive against the smugglers .
" we have agreed to cooperate with african countries in the effort to block the new routes of colombian cocaine to europe , " said spanish interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba .
the initiative to open a new front against the traffickers coming through africa comes hot on the heels of an agreement to set up a new european body that will share intelligence and coordinate police seizures of cocaine and cannabis on the high seas .
coordinated by britain , france , ireland , italy , portugal , spain and the netherlands , the body will be officially established in lisbon later this year .
europe offering high profit margins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of latin america 's output lands on european mirrors roughly 80 percent of cocaine from latin america that was destined for markets outside of the united states in 2005 was bound for europe , according to dea estimates .
international drug trafficking rings have been drawn to the european market because of the higher prices paid for cocaine on the continent .
last year wholesale prices for cocaine in the european union ranged between 28,000 and 56,600 euros -lrb- $ 38,000 and $ 77,000 -rrb- per kilogram compared to between $ 9,000 and $ 40,000 in the united states where the supply is higher , according to the dea .
" the potential for this high profit margin has increasingly lured colombian traffickers to european markets , " dea director of operations michael braun said during his testimony before the us congress last year .
africa is increasingly being used by criminal gangs as a hub for shipping latin american cocaine and asian heroin into europe .
consumption of cocaine and hashish is also on the rise in africa , spanish secretary of state for security antonio camacho said at the international drug enforcement conference on thursday .
" this is an issue which is very worrying because of its regional and global implications , " he said .
spain the coke gateway to the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coke ending up in the eu invariably comes through spain trafficking groups are taking advantage of weak governments in african nations as well as their historical ties to europe to smuggle drugs into the continent .
spain has become the main gateway for latin american cocaine and north african hashish into europe and has set up its own robust fight against drug smuggling .
spanish officials seized over 40 tons of cocaine last year , a record amount and more than any other nation in the world except for colombia , the united states and venezuela , camacho said .
" spain has a serious problem regarding rising drug consumption and i think it is in the interest of us all to cooperate more to fight drug trafficking , which in the case of colombia is totally linked to guerrilla groups and violence , " colombian defense minister juan manuel santos told reporters in madrid .
" cocaine is surging in europe at levels similar to what america experienced in the 1980s , " the head of the us drug enforcement administration , karen tandy , said at the three-day event in madrid .
low costs drive high consumption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european coke consumption is at a historical high around 10 million europeans , or over three percent of all adults , have used cocaine at least once in their lives , a historically high figure , according to the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- .
britain and spain posted the highest rates of use , with over four percent of adults reporting having consumed the drug over the past year compared to an average of around one percent of adults in all of europe .
use is concentrated among young adults , especially men , in urban areas .
a substantial drop in price has contributed to the increase in usage .
the price of cocaine on europe 's streets fell by 22 percent between 1999 and 2004 , according to emcdda .
the supply of cocaine in europe has increased since the late 1990s leading to lower prices and this , combined with its association to a supposedly glamorous lifestyle , is fueling its growing use , drug experts say .
" cocaine is very much associated with success , urban lifestyles , a party atmosphere , " emcdda analyst julian vicente told afp , before adding cocaine was now the second most used illegal drug in europe after cannabis . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report paints mixed picture of german drug and alcohol use germany 's annual report on drugs and addiction was released this week showing a overall decrease in drug-related deaths , but alarming data on prescription drug addiction and youth drinking .

but in the lead up to the 2007 g8 summit in germany , some economists are again raising the question of whether the right members are in the g8 club . just thinking about the current g8 members - germany , france , italy , great britain , russia , japan , the united states and canada - puts renowned economist jim o 'neill in a bad mood . " i have no idea why a country like italy is allowed to continue to be in the club , " said o 'neill , who is head of global economic research at investment bank goldman sachs . o 'neill is author of an influential report which argues that brazil , russia , india and china - the so-called brics - could become the four dominant economies by 2050 .
italy is noticeably absent in o 'neill 's report . " italy 's contribution to the world economy has been continually shrinking for a while now , but at g8 summits , italy is still a participatory to the official agreements about how the world functions today , " he said . lack of binding decisions like o 'neill , many others see the g8 as irrelevant and some would even love to see it dismantled immediately .
according to its critics , the g8 's lack of administrative structure and binding rules mean that although leaders broach issues such as debt relief and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , there are few concrete achievements . for o 'neill , the g8 members represent the world as it was more than 60 years ago and do n't reflect the current situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is predicted to overtake germany as the world 's third largest economy by 2008 " the worst thing is that the wrong participants are sitting at the g8 table , " said o 'neill .
" it is a somewhat simplistic idea to want to rule the world according to some post-war schematic , " he said . according to him , by the middle of the century , the brics are likely to have more economic weight that the current g7 countries -lrb- g8 without russia -rrb- put together .
the economy of china alone in 2050 is likely to be 20 times bigger than it is today and will have overtaken the usa as the world 's biggest , o 'neill predicted . changing world economy russia was admitted to the group of eight in 1997 , becoming the first new member since canada came on board in 1976 .
critics like o 'neill say the g8 ca n't continue to ignore the dramatic changes to the global economy . after all , it was n't until the gleneagles summit in 2005 that the heads of states agreed to hold a separate set of meetings with ministers from emerging economies of china , india , brazil , south africa and mexico , now known as the g8 + 5 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , five developing countries attended the g8 environment ministers meeting for the first time peter hajnal , an academic with the g8 research group at canada 's toronto university thinks this was an intelligent decision .
the alternative would have been to hold a meeting of the 20 leading heads of states based on the model of the g20 industrial nations forum formed in 1999 . according to hajnal , such a structure would make it more difficult to achieve real results , however , and is n't being considered as a real possibility . even economist o 'neill does n't want to see an increase in the number of g8 members .
he would prefer the introduction of rules regulating who has the right to sit at the table . " we should learn from soccer , and have a permanent league in which only the current world economic powers are allowed to play , " o 'neill said .
" you would be able to advance into and dropped from the league . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the g8 look to soccer for inspiration ?
o 'neill has even thought of an umpire - the international monetary fund , which could use economic data to determine the lucky eight . is g8 membership desirable ? this suggestion is n't an option for hajnal , who pointed out that not all bric countries were angling for g8 membership . china has " continually emphasized that it does n't want to belong for the moment " because it was " profiting economically " by being a developing country , hajnal said . however , according to hajnal , the g8 's very informality could well come in useful in the future by making it easier for the g8 to adapt to changes in the world 's power balance . " this means there is a lot of flexibility to quickly take on new members , " hajnal said . richard a. fuchs -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thousands of g8 opponents protest in german cities over 6,000 protestors across germany took to the streets wednesday night to demonstrate against a series of raids on anti-globalization organizations ahead of the upcoming g8 summit on the baltic coast .

but in the lead up to the 2007 g8 summit in germany , some economists are again raising the question of whether the right members are in the g8 club . just thinking about the current g8 members - germany , france , italy , great britain , russia , japan , the united states and canada - puts renowned economist jim o 'neill in a bad mood . " i have no idea why a country like italy is allowed to continue to be in the club , " said o 'neill , who is head of global economic research at investment bank goldman sachs . o 'neill is author of an influential report which argues that brazil , russia , india and china - the so-called brics - could become the four dominant economies by 2050 .
italy is noticeably absent in o 'neill 's report . " italy 's contribution to the world economy has been continually shrinking for a while now , but at g8 summits , italy is still a participatory to the official agreements about how the world functions today , " he said . lack of binding decisions like o 'neill , many others see the g8 as irrelevant and some would even love to see it dismantled immediately .
according to its critics , the g8 's lack of administrative structure and binding rules mean that although leaders broach issues such as debt relief and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , there are few concrete achievements . for o 'neill , the g8 members represent the world as it was more than 60 years ago and do n't reflect the current situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is predicted to overtake germany as the world 's third largest economy by 2008 " the worst thing is that the wrong participants are sitting at the g8 table , " said o 'neill .
" it is a somewhat simplistic idea to want to rule the world according to some post-war schematic , " he said . according to him , by the middle of the century , the brics are likely to have more economic weight that the current g7 countries -lrb- g8 without russia -rrb- put together .
the economy of china alone in 2050 is likely to be 20 times bigger than it is today and will have overtaken the usa as the world 's biggest , o 'neill predicted . changing world economy russia was admitted to the group of eight in 1997 , becoming the first new member since canada came on board in 1976 .
critics like o 'neill say the g8 ca n't continue to ignore the dramatic changes to the global economy . after all , it was n't until the gleneagles summit in 2005 that the heads of states agreed to hold a separate set of meetings with ministers from emerging economies of china , india , brazil , south africa and mexico , now known as the g8 + 5 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , five developing countries attended the g8 environment ministers meeting for the first time peter hajnal , an academic with the g8 research group at canada 's toronto university thinks this was an intelligent decision .
the alternative would have been to hold a meeting of the 20 leading heads of states based on the model of the g20 industrial nations forum formed in 1999 . according to hajnal , such a structure would make it more difficult to achieve real results , however , and is n't being considered as a real possibility . even economist o 'neill does n't want to see an increase in the number of g8 members .
he would prefer the introduction of rules regulating who has the right to sit at the table . " we should learn from soccer , and have a permanent league in which only the current world economic powers are allowed to play , " o 'neill said .
" you would be able to advance into and dropped from the league . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the g8 look to soccer for inspiration ?
o 'neill has even thought of an umpire - the international monetary fund , which could use economic data to determine the lucky eight . is g8 membership desirable ? this suggestion is n't an option for hajnal , who pointed out that not all bric countries were angling for g8 membership . china has " continually emphasized that it does n't want to belong for the moment " because it was " profiting economically " by being a developing country , hajnal said . however , according to hajnal , the g8 's very informality could well come in useful in the future by making it easier for the g8 to adapt to changes in the world 's power balance . " this means there is a lot of flexibility to quickly take on new members , " hajnal said . richard a. fuchs -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thousands of g8 opponents protest in german cities over 6,000 protestors across germany took to the streets wednesday night to demonstrate against a series of raids on anti-globalization organizations ahead of the upcoming g8 summit on the baltic coast .

" we know that the russians are getting hot and bothered as well . " german foreign minster frank-walter steinmeier , however , said it would be impossible to predetermine exactly what the eu-russia summit results would be . " the situation is complicated but particularly in time of difficulties is important to talk , " he said before the preparatory meeting of eu ministers .
" we are going to try right up to the summit to resolve the conflict concerning polish meat .
i ca n't say whether we 'll be successful . " steinmeier added that neither the eu nor russia could afford to stop working together . " i am convinced the eu needs russia to solve international conflicts and russia is going to continue to be dependent on europe , so i am absolutely sure that on both sides reason must prevail , " he said . analysts however are skeptical that things will calm down . " neither the rice talks nor the samara meeting will bring any concrete steps to overcoming disagreements , " said yevgeny volk , an analyst for the heritage foundation .
" it was only in the cold war that relations were like this .
it 's like 20 years ago . " plenty of irritants topping rice 's agenda on tuesday will be fierce russian opposition to a us plan for deploying a limited missile defense system in poland and the czech republic . she has little chance of making progress .
washington says the system is aimed at averting attacks from countries like iran or north korea , but moscow sees the system as a direct threat that could trigger a new arms race and has announced a freeze on a landmark soviet-era arms limitation treaty . last month eu trade commissioner peter mandelson warned that mistrust and a lack of respect in the relations between the european union and russia are at their worst levels since the cold war . " neither thinks they enjoy the respect and goodwill from the other they are entitled to expect , " he said , in comments which his eu colleagues have since been at pains to play down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world ii statue that is the source of much friction between moscow and tallin tension will also be high at the russia-eu summit following a row over a soviet war memorial between moscow and estonia , a former soviet republic that is now a member of the eu and nato military alliance . the foreign ministers meeting in brussels on monday will also hail serbia 's creation on friday of a pro-european government . the 27 eu nations hope the serbs ' move will help push forward plans for supervised independence in the breakaway serbian province of kosovo , a measure which russia has threatened to block at the un security council . russia on saturday dismissed as " unacceptable " a draft un security council resolution , introduced by western powers , endorsing the kosovo independence plan of un envoy martti ahtisaari . political freedoms and human rights hanging over both the us and eu meetings will be growing western criticism of russian president vladimir putin 's handling of political freedoms and human rights - a sensitive issue thrown into relief by plans for an opposition rally in samara on the day of the eu summit . police have violently broken up several earlier protest marches by the other russia coalition , bringing condemnation from western governments . on friday , a spokesman for german chancellor angela merkel , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency , urged russia to authorize the samara protest , saying : " we start from the principle that critical voices should be able to be expressed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crackdown on protestors in st petersburg last month sparked western criticism ahead of her visit , rice attacked what she called the " turning back " of freedoms in russia under putin and said " everybody around the world " was concerned . other bones of contention include constant delays in russia 's bid for membership of the world trade organization , russian opposition to independence for serbia 's kosovo province , and a meat trade dispute with eu member poland . " worst summit in history " the russia-eu meeting " will be the worst summit in history because there 's actually nothing that can be achieved in samara , " said fyodr lukyanov , editor of the journal russia in global affairs .
prospects for rice were " not much better , " he added . analysts said that much of the bad feeling is based on political maneuvering rather than concrete problems . " i think that russia and the european union tripped up on a step that should have led to better relations , " said mark entin , professor at moscow 's european studies institute .
" the step is russia becoming richer , faster , more confident .
at the same time , the european union is becoming bigger .
this is not seen as an opportunity , but as a challenge .
it 's a problem of mentality . "
lukyanov also pointed to a " psychological " divide exacerbated by the run-up to presidential elections in the united states and russia next year . " the russian leadership is completely preoccupied with power and they use foreign policy to strengthen their position , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " russia wants pragmatic , business-like cooperation " as relations between brussels and moscow remain tense , the russia of today is not the russia of the 90s , one expert told deutsche welle .

but in the lead up to the 2007 g8 summit in germany , some economists are again raising the question of whether the right members are in the g8 club . just thinking about the current g8 members - germany , france , italy , great britain , russia , japan , the united states and canada - puts renowned economist jim o 'neill in a bad mood . " i have no idea why a country like italy is allowed to continue to be in the club , " said o 'neill , who is head of global economic research at investment bank goldman sachs . o 'neill is author of an influential report which argues that brazil , russia , india and china - the so-called brics - could become the four dominant economies by 2050 .
italy is noticeably absent in o 'neill 's report . " italy 's contribution to the world economy has been continually shrinking for a while now , but at g8 summits , italy is still a participatory to the official agreements about how the world functions today , " he said . lack of binding decisions like o 'neill , many others see the g8 as irrelevant and some would even love to see it dismantled immediately .
according to its critics , the g8 's lack of administrative structure and binding rules mean that although leaders broach issues such as debt relief and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , there are few concrete achievements . for o 'neill , the g8 members represent the world as it was more than 60 years ago and do n't reflect the current situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is predicted to overtake germany as the world 's third largest economy by 2008 " the worst thing is that the wrong participants are sitting at the g8 table , " said o 'neill .
" it is a somewhat simplistic idea to want to rule the world according to some post-war schematic , " he said . according to him , by the middle of the century , the brics are likely to have more economic weight that the current g7 countries -lrb- g8 without russia -rrb- put together .

critics like o 'neill say the g8 ca n't continue to ignore the dramatic changes to the global economy . after all , it was n't until the gleneagles summit in 2005 that the heads of states agreed to hold a separate set of meetings with ministers from emerging economies of china , india , brazil , south africa and mexico , now known as the g8 + 5 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , five developing countries attended the g8 environment ministers meeting for the first time peter hajnal , an academic with the g8 research group at canada 's toronto university thinks this was an intelligent decision .
the alternative would have been to hold a meeting of the 20 leading heads of states based on the model of the g20 industrial nations forum formed in 1999 . according to hajnal , such a structure would make it more difficult to achieve real results , however , and is n't being considered as a real possibility . even economist o 'neill does n't want to see an increase in the number of g8 members .
he would prefer the introduction of rules regulating who has the right to sit at the table . " we should learn from soccer , and have a permanent league in which only the current world economic powers are allowed to play , " o 'neill said .

o 'neill has even thought of an umpire - the international monetary fund , which could use economic data to determine the lucky eight . is g8 membership desirable ? this suggestion is n't an option for hajnal , who pointed out that not all bric countries were angling for g8 membership . china has " continually emphasized that it does n't want to belong for the moment " because it was " profiting economically " by being a developing country , hajnal said . however , according to hajnal , the g8 's very informality could well come in useful in the future by making it easier for the g8 to adapt to changes in the world 's power balance .

after all , the former capital has learned to make the most of its connection to its famous son . they come from all over the world and have one thing in common - they 've come to follow in the footsteps of ludwig van beethoven .
in bonn , where the composer lived from his birth in 1770 until the age of 22 , that 's not hard to do .
beethoven is practically everywhere - visitors are bound to come across his serious-looking profile on everything from suspenders and umbrellas to ball-point pens and chocolate truffles .
the larger-than-life statue of beethoven on bonn 's central münster square , across from the main post office , has long since become an important landmark in the city .
in fact , the monument 's consecration in 1845 , timed to coincide with the composer 's 75th birthday , was celebrated with a three-day music festival organized by none other than franz liszt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this monument was erected for beethoven 's 75th birthday " it definitely belongs in my germany photo album , " said tourist xianguo zhong from shanghai while posing for the camera together with the colossal composer .

in addition to her picture in front of the statue , xianguo zhong went home with a t-shirt with a picture of the composer on it .

particularly enthusiastic beethoven fans can even take home a bit of the composer himself - at least from the shoulders up .

do n't leave bonn without him großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven was born in bonn in 1770 , but lived most of his life in vienna visitors to bonn are certain to go home with a beethoven souvenir .
after all , the former capital has learned to make the most of its connection to its famous son . they come from all over the world and have one thing in common - they 've come to follow in the footsteps of ludwig van beethoven .
in bonn , where the composer lived from his birth in 1770 until the age of 22 , that 's not hard to do .
beethoven is practically everywhere - visitors are bound to come across his serious-looking profile on everything from suspenders and umbrellas to ball-point pens and chocolate truffles .
the larger-than-life statue of beethoven on bonn 's central münster square , across from the main post office , has long since become an important landmark in the city .
in fact , the monument 's consecration in 1845 , timed to coincide with the composer 's 75th birthday , was celebrated with a three-day music festival organized by none other than franz liszt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this monument was erected for beethoven 's 75th birthday " it definitely belongs in my germany photo album , " said tourist xianguo zhong from shanghai while posing for the camera together with the colossal composer .
beethoven sells every year , some 500,000 tourists and business travellers , many of them from asia , stop in bonn .
along with bonn 's many museums , beethoven is one of the former capital 's most significant attractions .
the annual beethoven festival , in particular , draws the crowds .
it has its roots in franz liszt 's 1845 festival and is a special highlight for music lovers from all over the world .
bonn tourism officials have quickly learned that , quite simply , beethoven sells .
in addition to her picture in front of the statue , xianguo zhong went home with a t-shirt with a picture of the composer on it .
" in china , every kid knows who beethoven is , " she said .
" we read stories about him in elementary school . "
souvenirs galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house attracts around 100,000 visitors per year the museum gift shop in the composer 's birth house has over 800 beethoven souvenirs on offer , including beer glasses , thimbles , playing cards , stationary and ties all printed with a variety of beethoven motives .
each year , around 100,000 pilgrims visit the house on bonngasse , where they can view some of the composer 's instruments , hand-written correspondence and original manuscripts - and take home reproductions of the " moonlight sonata " or " für elise " manuscripts printed on silk scarves and porcelain plates .
particularly enthusiastic beethoven fans can even take home a bit of the composer himself - at least from the shoulders up .
visitors can choose from 20 different types of beethoven busts measuring between five and 55 centimeters -lrb- two to 22 inches -rrb- tall and costing up to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,350 -rrb- .
the gift shop 's best-sellers , however , are the cds of the composer 's music .
they even offer a recording that simulates beethoven 's hearing loss with changes to the volume and sound of the music .
the birth house also holds a substantial beethoven archive and library .

" we know that the russians are getting hot and bothered as well . " german foreign minster frank-walter steinmeier , however , said it would be impossible to predetermine exactly what the eu-russia summit results would be . " the situation is complicated but particularly in time of difficulties is important to talk , " he said before the preparatory meeting of eu ministers .
" we are going to try right up to the summit to resolve the conflict concerning polish meat .
i ca n't say whether we 'll be successful . " steinmeier added that neither the eu nor russia could afford to stop working together . " i am convinced the eu needs russia to solve international conflicts and russia is going to continue to be dependent on europe , so i am absolutely sure that on both sides reason must prevail , " he said . analysts however are skeptical that things will calm down . " neither the rice talks nor the samara meeting will bring any concrete steps to overcoming disagreements , " said yevgeny volk , an analyst for the heritage foundation .
" it was only in the cold war that relations were like this .
it 's like 20 years ago . " plenty of irritants topping rice 's agenda on tuesday will be fierce russian opposition to a us plan for deploying a limited missile defense system in poland and the czech republic . she has little chance of making progress .
washington says the system is aimed at averting attacks from countries like iran or north korea , but moscow sees the system as a direct threat that could trigger a new arms race and has announced a freeze on a landmark soviet-era arms limitation treaty . last month eu trade commissioner peter mandelson warned that mistrust and a lack of respect in the relations between the european union and russia are at their worst levels since the cold war . " neither thinks they enjoy the respect and goodwill from the other they are entitled to expect , " he said , in comments which his eu colleagues have since been at pains to play down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world ii statue that is the source of much friction between moscow and tallin tension will also be high at the russia-eu summit following a row over a soviet war memorial between moscow and estonia , a former soviet republic that is now a member of the eu and nato military alliance . the foreign ministers meeting in brussels on monday will also hail serbia 's creation on friday of a pro-european government . the 27 eu nations hope the serbs ' move will help push forward plans for supervised independence in the breakaway serbian province of kosovo , a measure which russia has threatened to block at the un security council . russia on saturday dismissed as " unacceptable " a draft un security council resolution , introduced by western powers , endorsing the kosovo independence plan of un envoy martti ahtisaari . political freedoms and human rights hanging over both the us and eu meetings will be growing western criticism of russian president vladimir putin 's handling of political freedoms and human rights - a sensitive issue thrown into relief by plans for an opposition rally in samara on the day of the eu summit . police have violently broken up several earlier protest marches by the other russia coalition , bringing condemnation from western governments . on friday , a spokesman for german chancellor angela merkel , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency , urged russia to authorize the samara protest , saying : " we start from the principle that critical voices should be able to be expressed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crackdown on protestors in st petersburg last month sparked western criticism ahead of her visit , rice attacked what she called the " turning back " of freedoms in russia under putin and said " everybody around the world " was concerned . other bones of contention include constant delays in russia 's bid for membership of the world trade organization , russian opposition to independence for serbia 's kosovo province , and a meat trade dispute with eu member poland . " worst summit in history " the russia-eu meeting " will be the worst summit in history because there 's actually nothing that can be achieved in samara , " said fyodr lukyanov , editor of the journal russia in global affairs .
prospects for rice were " not much better , " he added . analysts said that much of the bad feeling is based on political maneuvering rather than concrete problems . " i think that russia and the european union tripped up on a step that should have led to better relations , " said mark entin , professor at moscow 's european studies institute .
" the step is russia becoming richer , faster , more confident .
at the same time , the european union is becoming bigger .
this is not seen as an opportunity , but as a challenge .
it 's a problem of mentality . "

russia of today is not the russia of the 90s , said expert alexander rahr . alexander rahr is a russia expert from the german society for foreign affairs , a berlin-based research group .
dw-radio : do the ongoing disputes between russia and the eu make you pessimistic about the prospects for any breakthroughs at the upcoming summit ?
alexander rahr : in the short run , i 'm very skeptical and pessimistic about the possibility of improving relations between russia and the european union , but of course one has to be more optimistic for the long run .
but presently , there is talk of a new cold war between the eu and russia .
one of the main disputes is about the power that moscow wields because of its massive reserves of oil and gas and its control over the transport of energy supplies from central asia .
how do you think this issue will be addressed at the summit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander rahr i think that this is a temporary situation .
the situation in general will stabilize and improve because russia needs its european partners and the european market in order to sell its goods .
it can not sit on its oil and get the sources alone .
it has to sell it .
on the other hand , the west also has to understand that the russia of today is not the russia of the 90s .
russia also has some new powers which we have to take into account .
what do you think russia 's expectations for the upcoming summit are ?
what does it hope to achieve ?
russia itself has a wait-and-see attitude .
it wants to have good cooperation with the european union , but it does not want to tolerate criticism of its interior policies .
russia says it wants a different kind of cooperation with the european union - not the kind of cooperation on mutual values , which the european union demands .
russia wants a purely pragmatic , business-like cooperation .
one of the main issues is the current state of human rights in russia .
some have complained that the eu has not protested enough against some of the human rights abuses in russia .
do you think this issue will be raised at the summit ?
this issue has been raised at every summit for many years .
but the fact that the problems are being raised will not lead to any solution .
russia will listen , but it will say , " the west does not understand us .
we have completely different problems and you , the west , should choose whether you want us as a pragmatic partner or whether you want to teach us democracy . "

' a living cinema legend ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now back in europe , paul verhoeven began his hollywood career in the mid-1980s actually , sebastian koch had n't wanted to play any more nazis .
" but them comes paul verhoeven , who is like a living cinema legend for me , " said koch .
" he always made films that changed the way films are made .
he 's a person who always has to explore new territory , and that 's something we have in common . " verhoeven depicts the conflicting human aspects of all the characters in " black book , " whether nazis , jews or dutch .
for the viewer , the lines between good and evil are intentionally blurred . he portrays the dutch resistance movement , for example , as being a sometimes volatile mix of nationalists , communists and christian pacifists , which is gnawed at by latent anti-semitism . a critical view of war-time society surprisingly , this critical view of the dutch resistance did not provoke as much criticism in the netherlands as might have been expected . " not everything was as heroic and wonderful as we thought after the war , " said the filmmaker .
" statistics show how the dutch behaved during the war .
eighty to 90 percent of the population remained neutral .
some hid or protected themselves , but most people were not actively involved in resistance . " verhoeven showed long ago with films like " turkish delight " and " basic instinct " that he knew how to master all of the hollywood tricks .
and with a budget 18 million euros -lrb- $ 24 million -rrb- for " black book , " he had access to anything he could have wanted in this bag of tricks . black book opens in germany but what makes the film impressive - and polarizing - is the way verhoeven plays with stereotypes , presenting human beings with strengths and weaknesses on both sides of the fence .
starting this week , german audiences will form their opinions on the film that has already provoked over a million viewers in the netherlands . " black book " is already available in english in the us , the uk and canada .

a two-day informal meeting of european drug commissioners begins in berlin monday , two days after the interior ministers of the eu 's six largest countries agreed on closer cooperation with africa in the fight against drug smuggling from south america at a meeting in venice .
the venice meeting followed the three-day international drug enforcement conference in madrid last week which was hosted by the spanish government and the us drug enforcement agency -lrb- dea -rrb- , washington ’ s top anti-narcotics agency .
the talks on saturday were attended by eu justice commissioner franco frattini , the interior ministers of germany , britain , poland , france , spain and italy , and united states secretary of homeland security michael chertoff .
all supported the idea of sending european investigators to west africa as part of a new drive against the smugglers .
" we have agreed to cooperate with african countries in the effort to block the new routes of colombian cocaine to europe , " said spanish interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba .
the initiative to open a new front against the traffickers coming through africa comes hot on the heels of an agreement to set up a new european body that will share intelligence and coordinate police seizures of cocaine and cannabis on the high seas .
coordinated by britain , france , ireland , italy , portugal , spain and the netherlands , the body will be officially established in lisbon later this year .
europe offering high profit margins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of latin america 's output lands on european mirrors roughly 80 percent of cocaine from latin america that was destined for markets outside of the united states in 2005 was bound for europe , according to dea estimates .
international drug trafficking rings have been drawn to the european market because of the higher prices paid for cocaine on the continent .
last year wholesale prices for cocaine in the european union ranged between 28,000 and 56,600 euros -lrb- $ 38,000 and $ 77,000 -rrb- per kilogram compared to between $ 9,000 and $ 40,000 in the united states where the supply is higher , according to the dea .
" the potential for this high profit margin has increasingly lured colombian traffickers to european markets , " dea director of operations michael braun said during his testimony before the us congress last year .
africa is increasingly being used by criminal gangs as a hub for shipping latin american cocaine and asian heroin into europe .
consumption of cocaine and hashish is also on the rise in africa , spanish secretary of state for security antonio camacho said at the international drug enforcement conference on thursday .
" this is an issue which is very worrying because of its regional and global implications , " he said .
spain the coke gateway to the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coke ending up in the eu invariably comes through spain trafficking groups are taking advantage of weak governments in african nations as well as their historical ties to europe to smuggle drugs into the continent .
spain has become the main gateway for latin american cocaine and north african hashish into europe and has set up its own robust fight against drug smuggling .
spanish officials seized over 40 tons of cocaine last year , a record amount and more than any other nation in the world except for colombia , the united states and venezuela , camacho said .
" spain has a serious problem regarding rising drug consumption and i think it is in the interest of us all to cooperate more to fight drug trafficking , which in the case of colombia is totally linked to guerrilla groups and violence , " colombian defense minister juan manuel santos told reporters in madrid .
" cocaine is surging in europe at levels similar to what america experienced in the 1980s , " the head of the us drug enforcement administration , karen tandy , said at the three-day event in madrid .
low costs drive high consumption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european coke consumption is at a historical high around 10 million europeans , or over three percent of all adults , have used cocaine at least once in their lives , a historically high figure , according to the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- .
britain and spain posted the highest rates of use , with over four percent of adults reporting having consumed the drug over the past year compared to an average of around one percent of adults in all of europe .
use is concentrated among young adults , especially men , in urban areas .
a substantial drop in price has contributed to the increase in usage .
the price of cocaine on europe 's streets fell by 22 percent between 1999 and 2004 , according to emcdda .
the supply of cocaine in europe has increased since the late 1990s leading to lower prices and this , combined with its association to a supposedly glamorous lifestyle , is fueling its growing use , drug experts say .
" cocaine is very much associated with success , urban lifestyles , a party atmosphere , " emcdda analyst julian vicente told afp , before adding cocaine was now the second most used illegal drug in europe after cannabis . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report paints mixed picture of german drug and alcohol use germany 's annual report on drugs and addiction was released this week showing a overall decrease in drug-related deaths , but alarming data on prescription drug addiction and youth drinking .

the bribes were meant to secure gas-turbine contracts valued at 450 million euros .
a former head of the siemens power plant unit received a two-year suspended sentence , and a consultant engineer who admitted being guilty of the charges was given a nine-month suspended sentence .
the court also ordered the embattled siemens concern to pay 38 million euros into state coffers .
the verdicts follow similar sentences handed down by a court in milan to two enel employees and two other siemens managers charged in italy in connection with the bribery case . the german engineering giant said in a statement that it would appeal the fine . " we maintain that the court 's order to forfeit the profits from two orders placed by enel with siemens ' power generation division for the supply of power plant equipment in 2000 and 2001 is illegal , " the statement said .
" the court 's decision has no basis in law or in fact . " only the beginning ?

there have also been allegations of a slush fund used to keep labor leaders docile .
one of europe 's biggest industrial groups , siemens said it is cooperating fully with authorities .
prosecutors searched siemens offices in mid-november when allegations first surfaced that senior employees had siphoned off 200 million euros to pay bribes .
several managers in the firm 's telecommunications division were arrested , questioned and released on bail .

" germany had a lack of manpower because many men were in the wehrmacht -lrb- nazi military -rrb- , " said jakub deka , a warsaw-based planning coordinator commissioned by the polish-german reconciliation foundation to plan the new exhibition , in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandradio . lingering cause of tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some victims of forced labor have received financial compensation " they simply looked for labor in the conquered areas - not just in poland , but all over europe - and took it back to germany , " he said .
an estimated 3 million poles were subjected to forced labor under the nazi regime in germany following the invasion of poland in 1939 , which makes it a particularly sore topic in german-polish relations .
those capable of working were sent to munitions factories and coal mines to support the war effort , while children underwent a process of " germanization " in special schools .
treatment in the camps was harsh , and prisoners were often beaten and even shot for not working up to standard or trying to escape . promoting reconciliation the exhibit 's opening in germany was attended by survivors from wartime labor camps in flensburg , frankfurt , wolfsburg and berlin .
polish-born josef kuzba , a prisoner at the sachsenhausen concentration camp from 1940 to 1945 , has been discussing his experiences with children from the city 's archenhold gymnasium and sophie scholl oberschule . " the youngsters seemed well briefed about world war ii , " he said .
" it was a pleasure talking to them . " asked if he was apprehensive about visiting germany nowadays , he replied : " no , not at all .
i 'm a frequent visitor and have good relations with friends here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuzba talks about his experiences in sachsenhausen with school children kuzba , who was born in pomerania , and now lives in warsaw , said he had been active in promoting polish-german reconciliation for years . " remembrance is one thing , reconciliation another , " kuzba said .
" both are important for our nations . " mariusz muszynski , chairman of the foundation for polish-german reconciliation , wrote in the 205-page exhibit catalog that no other event in german-polish history had ever proved so burdensome to relations as the nazi-led invasion of poland . " material payments can never make up for the sorrow and suffering caused victims - but they were seen as a symbolic gesture of fairness and respect and a contributory step towards a better understanding between the two nations , " said muszynski . millions have been paid worldwide to german slave and forced labor victims following the enactment of a law by the german parliament and the creation of a " remembrance , responsibility , future " foundation . berlin first stop on german tour original nazi documents , photographs , biographies and a documentary film make up the exhibit , which will remain in berlin until mid-october before it continues on to other german cities .
it has already been viewed by 80,000 visitors during its tour in poland .
the camp where the exhibit is currently housed was built in 1943 by albert speer , nazi minister of infrastructure and munitions , for over 2,000 workers .
it is one of 3,000 such nazi camps built in the berlin area and one of only few nazi labor camps remaining . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament condemns chinese labor camps , irks beijing amid protests from beijing , the german parliament thursday condemned chinese labor camps and called for special labels on goods produced in labor camps .

" we know that the russians are getting hot and bothered as well . " german foreign minster frank-walter steinmeier , however , said it would be impossible to predetermine exactly what the eu-russia summit results would be . " the situation is complicated but particularly in time of difficulties is important to talk , " he said before the preparatory meeting of eu ministers .
" we are going to try right up to the summit to resolve the conflict concerning polish meat .
i ca n't say whether we 'll be successful . " steinmeier added that neither the eu nor russia could afford to stop working together . " i am convinced the eu needs russia to solve international conflicts and russia is going to continue to be dependent on europe , so i am absolutely sure that on both sides reason must prevail , " he said . analysts however are skeptical that things will calm down . " neither the rice talks nor the samara meeting will bring any concrete steps to overcoming disagreements , " said yevgeny volk , an analyst for the heritage foundation .
" it was only in the cold war that relations were like this .
it 's like 20 years ago . " plenty of irritants topping rice 's agenda on tuesday will be fierce russian opposition to a us plan for deploying a limited missile defense system in poland and the czech republic . she has little chance of making progress .
washington says the system is aimed at averting attacks from countries like iran or north korea , but moscow sees the system as a direct threat that could trigger a new arms race and has announced a freeze on a landmark soviet-era arms limitation treaty . last month eu trade commissioner peter mandelson warned that mistrust and a lack of respect in the relations between the european union and russia are at their worst levels since the cold war . " neither thinks they enjoy the respect and goodwill from the other they are entitled to expect , " he said , in comments which his eu colleagues have since been at pains to play down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world ii statue that is the source of much friction between moscow and tallin tension will also be high at the russia-eu summit following a row over a soviet war memorial between moscow and estonia , a former soviet republic that is now a member of the eu and nato military alliance . the foreign ministers meeting in brussels on monday will also hail serbia 's creation on friday of a pro-european government . the 27 eu nations hope the serbs ' move will help push forward plans for supervised independence in the breakaway serbian province of kosovo , a measure which russia has threatened to block at the un security council . russia on saturday dismissed as " unacceptable " a draft un security council resolution , introduced by western powers , endorsing the kosovo independence plan of un envoy martti ahtisaari . political freedoms and human rights hanging over both the us and eu meetings will be growing western criticism of russian president vladimir putin 's handling of political freedoms and human rights - a sensitive issue thrown into relief by plans for an opposition rally in samara on the day of the eu summit . police have violently broken up several earlier protest marches by the other russia coalition , bringing condemnation from western governments . on friday , a spokesman for german chancellor angela merkel , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency , urged russia to authorize the samara protest , saying : " we start from the principle that critical voices should be able to be expressed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crackdown on protestors in st petersburg last month sparked western criticism ahead of her visit , rice attacked what she called the " turning back " of freedoms in russia under putin and said " everybody around the world " was concerned . other bones of contention include constant delays in russia 's bid for membership of the world trade organization , russian opposition to independence for serbia 's kosovo province , and a meat trade dispute with eu member poland . " worst summit in history " the russia-eu meeting " will be the worst summit in history because there 's actually nothing that can be achieved in samara , " said fyodr lukyanov , editor of the journal russia in global affairs .
prospects for rice were " not much better , " he added . analysts said that much of the bad feeling is based on political maneuvering rather than concrete problems . " i think that russia and the european union tripped up on a step that should have led to better relations , " said mark entin , professor at moscow 's european studies institute .
" the step is russia becoming richer , faster , more confident .
at the same time , the european union is becoming bigger .
this is not seen as an opportunity , but as a challenge .
it 's a problem of mentality . "
lukyanov also pointed to a " psychological " divide exacerbated by the run-up to presidential elections in the united states and russia next year . " the russian leadership is completely preoccupied with power and they use foreign policy to strengthen their position , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " russia wants pragmatic , business-like cooperation " as relations between brussels and moscow remain tense , the russia of today is not the russia of the 90s , one expert told deutsche welle .

" germany had a lack of manpower because many men were in the wehrmacht -lrb- nazi military -rrb- , " said jakub deka , a warsaw-based planning coordinator commissioned by the polish-german reconciliation foundation to plan the new exhibition , in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandradio . lingering cause of tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some victims of forced labor have received financial compensation " they simply looked for labor in the conquered areas - not just in poland , but all over europe - and took it back to germany , " he said .
an estimated 3 million poles were subjected to forced labor under the nazi regime in germany following the invasion of poland in 1939 , which makes it a particularly sore topic in german-polish relations .
those capable of working were sent to munitions factories and coal mines to support the war effort , while children underwent a process of " germanization " in special schools .
treatment in the camps was harsh , and prisoners were often beaten and even shot for not working up to standard or trying to escape . promoting reconciliation the exhibit 's opening in germany was attended by survivors from wartime labor camps in flensburg , frankfurt , wolfsburg and berlin .
polish-born josef kuzba , a prisoner at the sachsenhausen concentration camp from 1940 to 1945 , has been discussing his experiences with children from the city 's archenhold gymnasium and sophie scholl oberschule . " the youngsters seemed well briefed about world war ii , " he said .
" it was a pleasure talking to them . " asked if he was apprehensive about visiting germany nowadays , he replied : " no , not at all .
i 'm a frequent visitor and have good relations with friends here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuzba talks about his experiences in sachsenhausen with school children kuzba , who was born in pomerania , and now lives in warsaw , said he had been active in promoting polish-german reconciliation for years . " remembrance is one thing , reconciliation another , " kuzba said .
" both are important for our nations . " mariusz muszynski , chairman of the foundation for polish-german reconciliation , wrote in the 205-page exhibit catalog that no other event in german-polish history had ever proved so burdensome to relations as the nazi-led invasion of poland . " material payments can never make up for the sorrow and suffering caused victims - but they were seen as a symbolic gesture of fairness and respect and a contributory step towards a better understanding between the two nations , " said muszynski . millions have been paid worldwide to german slave and forced labor victims following the enactment of a law by the german parliament and the creation of a " remembrance , responsibility , future " foundation . berlin first stop on german tour original nazi documents , photographs , biographies and a documentary film make up the exhibit , which will remain in berlin until mid-october before it continues on to other german cities .
it has already been viewed by 80,000 visitors during its tour in poland .
the camp where the exhibit is currently housed was built in 1943 by albert speer , nazi minister of infrastructure and munitions , for over 2,000 workers .
it is one of 3,000 such nazi camps built in the berlin area and one of only few nazi labor camps remaining . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament condemns chinese labor camps , irks beijing amid protests from beijing , the german parliament thursday condemned chinese labor camps and called for special labels on goods produced in labor camps .

" germany had a lack of manpower because many men were in the wehrmacht -lrb- nazi military -rrb- , " said jakub deka , a warsaw-based planning coordinator commissioned by the polish-german reconciliation foundation to plan the new exhibition , in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandradio . lingering cause of tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some victims of forced labor have received financial compensation " they simply looked for labor in the conquered areas - not just in poland , but all over europe - and took it back to germany , " he said .
an estimated 3 million poles were subjected to forced labor under the nazi regime in germany following the invasion of poland in 1939 , which makes it a particularly sore topic in german-polish relations .
those capable of working were sent to munitions factories and coal mines to support the war effort , while children underwent a process of " germanization " in special schools .
treatment in the camps was harsh , and prisoners were often beaten and even shot for not working up to standard or trying to escape . promoting reconciliation the exhibit 's opening in germany was attended by survivors from wartime labor camps in flensburg , frankfurt , wolfsburg and berlin .
polish-born josef kuzba , a prisoner at the sachsenhausen concentration camp from 1940 to 1945 , has been discussing his experiences with children from the city 's archenhold gymnasium and sophie scholl oberschule . " the youngsters seemed well briefed about world war ii , " he said .
" it was a pleasure talking to them . " asked if he was apprehensive about visiting germany nowadays , he replied : " no , not at all .
i 'm a frequent visitor and have good relations with friends here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuzba talks about his experiences in sachsenhausen with school children kuzba , who was born in pomerania , and now lives in warsaw , said he had been active in promoting polish-german reconciliation for years . " remembrance is one thing , reconciliation another , " kuzba said .
" both are important for our nations . " mariusz muszynski , chairman of the foundation for polish-german reconciliation , wrote in the 205-page exhibit catalog that no other event in german-polish history had ever proved so burdensome to relations as the nazi-led invasion of poland . " material payments can never make up for the sorrow and suffering caused victims - but they were seen as a symbolic gesture of fairness and respect and a contributory step towards a better understanding between the two nations , " said muszynski . millions have been paid worldwide to german slave and forced labor victims following the enactment of a law by the german parliament and the creation of a " remembrance , responsibility , future " foundation . berlin first stop on german tour original nazi documents , photographs , biographies and a documentary film make up the exhibit , which will remain in berlin until mid-october before it continues on to other german cities .
it has already been viewed by 80,000 visitors during its tour in poland .
the camp where the exhibit is currently housed was built in 1943 by albert speer , nazi minister of infrastructure and munitions , for over 2,000 workers .
it is one of 3,000 such nazi camps built in the berlin area and one of only few nazi labor camps remaining . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament condemns chinese labor camps , irks beijing amid protests from beijing , the german parliament thursday condemned chinese labor camps and called for special labels on goods produced in labor camps .

russia of today is not the russia of the 90s , said expert alexander rahr . alexander rahr is a russia expert from the german society for foreign affairs , a berlin-based research group .
dw-radio : do the ongoing disputes between russia and the eu make you pessimistic about the prospects for any breakthroughs at the upcoming summit ?
alexander rahr : in the short run , i 'm very skeptical and pessimistic about the possibility of improving relations between russia and the european union , but of course one has to be more optimistic for the long run .
but presently , there is talk of a new cold war between the eu and russia .
one of the main disputes is about the power that moscow wields because of its massive reserves of oil and gas and its control over the transport of energy supplies from central asia .
how do you think this issue will be addressed at the summit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander rahr i think that this is a temporary situation .
the situation in general will stabilize and improve because russia needs its european partners and the european market in order to sell its goods .
it can not sit on its oil and get the sources alone .
it has to sell it .
on the other hand , the west also has to understand that the russia of today is not the russia of the 90s .
russia also has some new powers which we have to take into account .
what do you think russia 's expectations for the upcoming summit are ?
what does it hope to achieve ?
russia itself has a wait-and-see attitude .
it wants to have good cooperation with the european union , but it does not want to tolerate criticism of its interior policies .
russia says it wants a different kind of cooperation with the european union - not the kind of cooperation on mutual values , which the european union demands .
russia wants a purely pragmatic , business-like cooperation .
one of the main issues is the current state of human rights in russia .
some have complained that the eu has not protested enough against some of the human rights abuses in russia .
do you think this issue will be raised at the summit ?
this issue has been raised at every summit for many years .
but the fact that the problems are being raised will not lead to any solution .
russia will listen , but it will say , " the west does not understand us .
we have completely different problems and you , the west , should choose whether you want us as a pragmatic partner or whether you want to teach us democracy . "

" germany had a lack of manpower because many men were in the wehrmacht -lrb- nazi military -rrb- , " said jakub deka , a warsaw-based planning coordinator commissioned by the polish-german reconciliation foundation to plan the new exhibition , in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandradio . lingering cause of tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some victims of forced labor have received financial compensation " they simply looked for labor in the conquered areas - not just in poland , but all over europe - and took it back to germany , " he said .
an estimated 3 million poles were subjected to forced labor under the nazi regime in germany following the invasion of poland in 1939 , which makes it a particularly sore topic in german-polish relations .
those capable of working were sent to munitions factories and coal mines to support the war effort , while children underwent a process of " germanization " in special schools .
treatment in the camps was harsh , and prisoners were often beaten and even shot for not working up to standard or trying to escape . promoting reconciliation the exhibit 's opening in germany was attended by survivors from wartime labor camps in flensburg , frankfurt , wolfsburg and berlin .
polish-born josef kuzba , a prisoner at the sachsenhausen concentration camp from 1940 to 1945 , has been discussing his experiences with children from the city 's archenhold gymnasium and sophie scholl oberschule . " the youngsters seemed well briefed about world war ii , " he said .

i 'm a frequent visitor and have good relations with friends here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuzba talks about his experiences in sachsenhausen with school children kuzba , who was born in pomerania , and now lives in warsaw , said he had been active in promoting polish-german reconciliation for years . " remembrance is one thing , reconciliation another , " kuzba said .
" both are important for our nations . " mariusz muszynski , chairman of the foundation for polish-german reconciliation , wrote in the 205-page exhibit catalog that no other event in german-polish history had ever proved so burdensome to relations as the nazi-led invasion of poland . " material payments can never make up for the sorrow and suffering caused victims - but they were seen as a symbolic gesture of fairness and respect and a contributory step towards a better understanding between the two nations , " said muszynski . millions have been paid worldwide to german slave and forced labor victims following the enactment of a law by the german parliament and the creation of a " remembrance , responsibility , future " foundation . berlin first stop on german tour original nazi documents , photographs , biographies and a documentary film make up the exhibit , which will remain in berlin until mid-october before it continues on to other german cities .
it has already been viewed by 80,000 visitors during its tour in poland .
the camp where the exhibit is currently housed was built in 1943 by albert speer , nazi minister of infrastructure and munitions , for over 2,000 workers .

the bribes were meant to secure gas-turbine contracts valued at 450 million euros .
a former head of the siemens power plant unit received a two-year suspended sentence , and a consultant engineer who admitted being guilty of the charges was given a nine-month suspended sentence .
the court also ordered the embattled siemens concern to pay 38 million euros into state coffers .
the verdicts follow similar sentences handed down by a court in milan to two enel employees and two other siemens managers charged in italy in connection with the bribery case . the german engineering giant said in a statement that it would appeal the fine . " we maintain that the court 's order to forfeit the profits from two orders placed by enel with siemens ' power generation division for the supply of power plant equipment in 2000 and 2001 is illegal , " the statement said .

a two-day informal meeting of european drug commissioners begins in berlin monday , two days after the interior ministers of the eu 's six largest countries agreed on closer cooperation with africa in the fight against drug smuggling from south america at a meeting in venice .
the venice meeting followed the three-day international drug enforcement conference in madrid last week which was hosted by the spanish government and the us drug enforcement agency -lrb- dea -rrb- , washington ’ s top anti-narcotics agency .
the talks on saturday were attended by eu justice commissioner franco frattini , the interior ministers of germany , britain , poland , france , spain and italy , and united states secretary of homeland security michael chertoff .
all supported the idea of sending european investigators to west africa as part of a new drive against the smugglers .
" we have agreed to cooperate with african countries in the effort to block the new routes of colombian cocaine to europe , " said spanish interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba .
the initiative to open a new front against the traffickers coming through africa comes hot on the heels of an agreement to set up a new european body that will share intelligence and coordinate police seizures of cocaine and cannabis on the high seas .
coordinated by britain , france , ireland , italy , portugal , spain and the netherlands , the body will be officially established in lisbon later this year .
europe offering high profit margins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of latin america 's output lands on european mirrors roughly 80 percent of cocaine from latin america that was destined for markets outside of the united states in 2005 was bound for europe , according to dea estimates .
international drug trafficking rings have been drawn to the european market because of the higher prices paid for cocaine on the continent .
last year wholesale prices for cocaine in the european union ranged between 28,000 and 56,600 euros -lrb- $ 38,000 and $ 77,000 -rrb- per kilogram compared to between $ 9,000 and $ 40,000 in the united states where the supply is higher , according to the dea .
" the potential for this high profit margin has increasingly lured colombian traffickers to european markets , " dea director of operations michael braun said during his testimony before the us congress last year .
africa is increasingly being used by criminal gangs as a hub for shipping latin american cocaine and asian heroin into europe .
consumption of cocaine and hashish is also on the rise in africa , spanish secretary of state for security antonio camacho said at the international drug enforcement conference on thursday .
" this is an issue which is very worrying because of its regional and global implications , " he said .
spain the coke gateway to the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coke ending up in the eu invariably comes through spain trafficking groups are taking advantage of weak governments in african nations as well as their historical ties to europe to smuggle drugs into the continent .
spain has become the main gateway for latin american cocaine and north african hashish into europe and has set up its own robust fight against drug smuggling .
spanish officials seized over 40 tons of cocaine last year , a record amount and more than any other nation in the world except for colombia , the united states and venezuela , camacho said .
" spain has a serious problem regarding rising drug consumption and i think it is in the interest of us all to cooperate more to fight drug trafficking , which in the case of colombia is totally linked to guerrilla groups and violence , " colombian defense minister juan manuel santos told reporters in madrid .
" cocaine is surging in europe at levels similar to what america experienced in the 1980s , " the head of the us drug enforcement administration , karen tandy , said at the three-day event in madrid .
low costs drive high consumption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european coke consumption is at a historical high around 10 million europeans , or over three percent of all adults , have used cocaine at least once in their lives , a historically high figure , according to the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- .
britain and spain posted the highest rates of use , with over four percent of adults reporting having consumed the drug over the past year compared to an average of around one percent of adults in all of europe .
use is concentrated among young adults , especially men , in urban areas .
a substantial drop in price has contributed to the increase in usage .
the price of cocaine on europe 's streets fell by 22 percent between 1999 and 2004 , according to emcdda .
the supply of cocaine in europe has increased since the late 1990s leading to lower prices and this , combined with its association to a supposedly glamorous lifestyle , is fueling its growing use , drug experts say .
" cocaine is very much associated with success , urban lifestyles , a party atmosphere , " emcdda analyst julian vicente told afp , before adding cocaine was now the second most used illegal drug in europe after cannabis . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report paints mixed picture of german drug and alcohol use germany 's annual report on drugs and addiction was released this week showing a overall decrease in drug-related deaths , but alarming data on prescription drug addiction and youth drinking .

but in the lead up to the 2007 g8 summit in germany , some economists are again raising the question of whether the right members are in the g8 club . just thinking about the current g8 members - germany , france , italy , great britain , russia , japan , the united states and canada - puts renowned economist jim o 'neill in a bad mood . " i have no idea why a country like italy is allowed to continue to be in the club , " said o 'neill , who is head of global economic research at investment bank goldman sachs . o 'neill is author of an influential report which argues that brazil , russia , india and china - the so-called brics - could become the four dominant economies by 2050 .
italy is noticeably absent in o 'neill 's report . " italy 's contribution to the world economy has been continually shrinking for a while now , but at g8 summits , italy is still a participatory to the official agreements about how the world functions today , " he said . lack of binding decisions like o 'neill , many others see the g8 as irrelevant and some would even love to see it dismantled immediately .
according to its critics , the g8 's lack of administrative structure and binding rules mean that although leaders broach issues such as debt relief and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , there are few concrete achievements . for o 'neill , the g8 members represent the world as it was more than 60 years ago and do n't reflect the current situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is predicted to overtake germany as the world 's third largest economy by 2008 " the worst thing is that the wrong participants are sitting at the g8 table , " said o 'neill .
" it is a somewhat simplistic idea to want to rule the world according to some post-war schematic , " he said . according to him , by the middle of the century , the brics are likely to have more economic weight that the current g7 countries -lrb- g8 without russia -rrb- put together .
the economy of china alone in 2050 is likely to be 20 times bigger than it is today and will have overtaken the usa as the world 's biggest , o 'neill predicted . changing world economy russia was admitted to the group of eight in 1997 , becoming the first new member since canada came on board in 1976 .
critics like o 'neill say the g8 ca n't continue to ignore the dramatic changes to the global economy . after all , it was n't until the gleneagles summit in 2005 that the heads of states agreed to hold a separate set of meetings with ministers from emerging economies of china , india , brazil , south africa and mexico , now known as the g8 + 5 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , five developing countries attended the g8 environment ministers meeting for the first time peter hajnal , an academic with the g8 research group at canada 's toronto university thinks this was an intelligent decision .
the alternative would have been to hold a meeting of the 20 leading heads of states based on the model of the g20 industrial nations forum formed in 1999 . according to hajnal , such a structure would make it more difficult to achieve real results , however , and is n't being considered as a real possibility . even economist o 'neill does n't want to see an increase in the number of g8 members .
he would prefer the introduction of rules regulating who has the right to sit at the table . " we should learn from soccer , and have a permanent league in which only the current world economic powers are allowed to play , " o 'neill said .
" you would be able to advance into and dropped from the league . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the g8 look to soccer for inspiration ?
o 'neill has even thought of an umpire - the international monetary fund , which could use economic data to determine the lucky eight . is g8 membership desirable ? this suggestion is n't an option for hajnal , who pointed out that not all bric countries were angling for g8 membership . china has " continually emphasized that it does n't want to belong for the moment " because it was " profiting economically " by being a developing country , hajnal said . however , according to hajnal , the g8 's very informality could well come in useful in the future by making it easier for the g8 to adapt to changes in the world 's power balance .

do n't leave bonn without him großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven was born in bonn in 1770 , but lived most of his life in vienna visitors to bonn are certain to go home with a beethoven souvenir .
after all , the former capital has learned to make the most of its connection to its famous son . they come from all over the world and have one thing in common - they 've come to follow in the footsteps of ludwig van beethoven .
in bonn , where the composer lived from his birth in 1770 until the age of 22 , that 's not hard to do .
beethoven is practically everywhere - visitors are bound to come across his serious-looking profile on everything from suspenders and umbrellas to ball-point pens and chocolate truffles .
the larger-than-life statue of beethoven on bonn 's central münster square , across from the main post office , has long since become an important landmark in the city .
in fact , the monument 's consecration in 1845 , timed to coincide with the composer 's 75th birthday , was celebrated with a three-day music festival organized by none other than franz liszt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this monument was erected for beethoven 's 75th birthday " it definitely belongs in my germany photo album , " said tourist xianguo zhong from shanghai while posing for the camera together with the colossal composer .
beethoven sells every year , some 500,000 tourists and business travellers , many of them from asia , stop in bonn .
along with bonn 's many museums , beethoven is one of the former capital 's most significant attractions .
the annual beethoven festival , in particular , draws the crowds .

but not two of germany 's leading soccer stars , who sued germany 's leading sex shop chain for doing just that .
now the sex shop has to pay up . as soccer mania started building to fever pitch in the run-up to last year 's world cup in germany , sex shop chain beate uhse thought it would take advantage of the near deification of some of the country 's national team soccer players .
it marketed two vibrators under the names " michael b. " and " olli k , " which appear to be clear references to michael ballack , now a midfielder at chelsea , and oliver kahn , bayern munich 's goalkeeper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack , sex symbol ?
maybe ...
while probably many women , and more than a few men , instantly felt an erotic frisson at the thought of taking one of the two athletes to bed , the soccer stars themselves were not amused .
they took beate uhse to court , charging them with unauthorized use of their names .
the two men are not averse to making product endorsements ; they just did n't want to do it for free , or maybe for a sex toy .
just a coincidence , really for its part , beate uhse has always insisted the company was innocent .
the vibrators , 17 cm -lrb- 6.7 inches -rrb- long and advertised as " cuddly " and " cheeky , " were not modelled on the stars ' own , er , equipment .
according to beate uhse , the company did not mean to convince buyers they were going to be getting to know the men , at least vicariously , up close and very personally .
" we never had any intention to make a connection between the vibrators on sale in our shops with the names of ' olli k. ' and ' michael b. ' and the footballers , " company spokesperson assia tsernookoff insisted at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn , sex symbol ?
maybe not still , beate uhse pulled the two models off the shelves after the men fired up their lawyers .
now a court says the shop has to pay up .
beate uhse will be sending both of the millionaires 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 67,380 -rrb- for their trouble .
the incident begs the question if the sex shop chain lost a bit of its business sense by refusing to ask the men permission ahead of time , or if they 've lost a sense of what 's sexy : does anyone really want to take oliver kahn to bed ? dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beate uhse loses its world cup buzz bad news for german soccer fans : olli k. and michael b. will not be bringing pleasure to supporters during the world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 14.05.2007 verhoeven 's nazi thriller " black book " opens in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " black book " plays with stereotypes after 20 years in hollywood paul verhoeven , the maker of " robocop , " " basic instinct " and " show girls " returned to europe to make " black book , " a war thriller that has just opened in german theaters . before the war , rachel stein had enjoyed success on the stages of berlin .
when the dutch-jewish singer tried to flee with her family into liberated belgium in 1944 , the escapees are betrayed and shot by the nazis . rachel , played by dutch actress carice van houten , is the only survivor .
she changes her name to ellis de vries , dyes her hair blond and joins the dutch resistance movement .
in one decisive scene , rachel - fleeing from the gestapo - boards a train with two suitcases full of weapons and finds herself in the same car as the head of the ss in the hague , ludwig müntze . " beautiful women should n't carry heavy suitcases , " says müntze , played by german actor sebastian koch , who also had a leading role in this year 's oscar winner , " the lives of others . " when rachel is assigned to spy on the nazi , who has long since broken with the regime 's ideology , he uses the contact with her to try and make an arrangement with the resistance .
the war is drawing to an end and the collapse of the nazi regime is imminent . ' a living cinema legend ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now back in europe , paul verhoeven began his hollywood career in the mid-1980s actually , sebastian koch had n't wanted to play any more nazis .
" but them comes paul verhoeven , who is like a living cinema legend for me , " said koch .
" he always made films that changed the way films are made .
he 's a person who always has to explore new territory , and that 's something we have in common . " verhoeven depicts the conflicting human aspects of all the characters in " black book , " whether nazis , jews or dutch .
for the viewer , the lines between good and evil are intentionally blurred . he portrays the dutch resistance movement , for example , as being a sometimes volatile mix of nationalists , communists and christian pacifists , which is gnawed at by latent anti-semitism . a critical view of war-time society surprisingly , this critical view of the dutch resistance did not provoke as much criticism in the netherlands as might have been expected . " not everything was as heroic and wonderful as we thought after the war , " said the filmmaker .
" statistics show how the dutch behaved during the war .
eighty to 90 percent of the population remained neutral .
some hid or protected themselves , but most people were not actively involved in resistance . " verhoeven showed long ago with films like " turkish delight " and " basic instinct " that he knew how to master all of the hollywood tricks .

on monday , 14,000 employees were expected to strike germany 's telecoms giant . the strike continued at 6:00 a.m.
monday in the states of bavaria , berlin and brandenburg .
in bavaria alone , 2,500 employees at 18 locations were expected to join the industrial action , a ver.di spokesman told the dpa news service .
in north rhine-westphalia , 2,000 union members were called on to strike .
" all areas will be effected like the call centers and the technical customer service , " strike leader ado wilhelm said .
private customers would notice the disruption and could expect long waits , the union said . ver.di called for the first strike in deutsche telekom 's history in response to ceo rene obermann 's plans to outsource 50,000 jobs in the service divisions .

" we know that the russians are getting hot and bothered as well . " german foreign minster frank-walter steinmeier , however , said it would be impossible to predetermine exactly what the eu-russia summit results would be . " the situation is complicated but particularly in time of difficulties is important to talk , " he said before the preparatory meeting of eu ministers .
" we are going to try right up to the summit to resolve the conflict concerning polish meat .
i ca n't say whether we 'll be successful . " steinmeier added that neither the eu nor russia could afford to stop working together . " i am convinced the eu needs russia to solve international conflicts and russia is going to continue to be dependent on europe , so i am absolutely sure that on both sides reason must prevail , " he said . analysts however are skeptical that things will calm down . " neither the rice talks nor the samara meeting will bring any concrete steps to overcoming disagreements , " said yevgeny volk , an analyst for the heritage foundation .
" it was only in the cold war that relations were like this .
it 's like 20 years ago . " plenty of irritants topping rice 's agenda on tuesday will be fierce russian opposition to a us plan for deploying a limited missile defense system in poland and the czech republic . she has little chance of making progress .
washington says the system is aimed at averting attacks from countries like iran or north korea , but moscow sees the system as a direct threat that could trigger a new arms race and has announced a freeze on a landmark soviet-era arms limitation treaty . last month eu trade commissioner peter mandelson warned that mistrust and a lack of respect in the relations between the european union and russia are at their worst levels since the cold war . " neither thinks they enjoy the respect and goodwill from the other they are entitled to expect , " he said , in comments which his eu colleagues have since been at pains to play down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world ii statue that is the source of much friction between moscow and tallin tension will also be high at the russia-eu summit following a row over a soviet war memorial between moscow and estonia , a former soviet republic that is now a member of the eu and nato military alliance . the foreign ministers meeting in brussels on monday will also hail serbia 's creation on friday of a pro-european government . the 27 eu nations hope the serbs ' move will help push forward plans for supervised independence in the breakaway serbian province of kosovo , a measure which russia has threatened to block at the un security council . russia on saturday dismissed as " unacceptable " a draft un security council resolution , introduced by western powers , endorsing the kosovo independence plan of un envoy martti ahtisaari . political freedoms and human rights hanging over both the us and eu meetings will be growing western criticism of russian president vladimir putin 's handling of political freedoms and human rights - a sensitive issue thrown into relief by plans for an opposition rally in samara on the day of the eu summit . police have violently broken up several earlier protest marches by the other russia coalition , bringing condemnation from western governments . on friday , a spokesman for german chancellor angela merkel , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency , urged russia to authorize the samara protest , saying : " we start from the principle that critical voices should be able to be expressed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crackdown on protestors in st petersburg last month sparked western criticism ahead of her visit , rice attacked what she called the " turning back " of freedoms in russia under putin and said " everybody around the world " was concerned . other bones of contention include constant delays in russia 's bid for membership of the world trade organization , russian opposition to independence for serbia 's kosovo province , and a meat trade dispute with eu member poland . " worst summit in history " the russia-eu meeting " will be the worst summit in history because there 's actually nothing that can be achieved in samara , " said fyodr lukyanov , editor of the journal russia in global affairs .
prospects for rice were " not much better , " he added . analysts said that much of the bad feeling is based on political maneuvering rather than concrete problems . " i think that russia and the european union tripped up on a step that should have led to better relations , " said mark entin , professor at moscow 's european studies institute .
" the step is russia becoming richer , faster , more confident .
at the same time , the european union is becoming bigger .
this is not seen as an opportunity , but as a challenge .
it 's a problem of mentality . "
lukyanov also pointed to a " psychological " divide exacerbated by the run-up to presidential elections in the united states and russia next year .

" germany had a lack of manpower because many men were in the wehrmacht -lrb- nazi military -rrb- , " said jakub deka , a warsaw-based planning coordinator commissioned by the polish-german reconciliation foundation to plan the new exhibition , in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandradio . lingering cause of tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some victims of forced labor have received financial compensation " they simply looked for labor in the conquered areas - not just in poland , but all over europe - and took it back to germany , " he said .
an estimated 3 million poles were subjected to forced labor under the nazi regime in germany following the invasion of poland in 1939 , which makes it a particularly sore topic in german-polish relations .
those capable of working were sent to munitions factories and coal mines to support the war effort , while children underwent a process of " germanization " in special schools .
treatment in the camps was harsh , and prisoners were often beaten and even shot for not working up to standard or trying to escape . promoting reconciliation the exhibit 's opening in germany was attended by survivors from wartime labor camps in flensburg , frankfurt , wolfsburg and berlin .
polish-born josef kuzba , a prisoner at the sachsenhausen concentration camp from 1940 to 1945 , has been discussing his experiences with children from the city 's archenhold gymnasium and sophie scholl oberschule . " the youngsters seemed well briefed about world war ii , " he said .
" it was a pleasure talking to them . " asked if he was apprehensive about visiting germany nowadays , he replied : " no , not at all .
i 'm a frequent visitor and have good relations with friends here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuzba talks about his experiences in sachsenhausen with school children kuzba , who was born in pomerania , and now lives in warsaw , said he had been active in promoting polish-german reconciliation for years . " remembrance is one thing , reconciliation another , " kuzba said .

under the proposed deal , chrysler chief executive tom lasorda would continue to run the company , the journal reported , citing people familiar with the talks .
cerberus adviser wolfgang bernhard , a former chrysler chief operating officer , would not have an executive role at the automaker , but could have a board seat under the proposed deal , according to the journal report .
cerberus has a record of slashing costs at operations it acquires , and some analysts say a cerberus-owned chrysler could move much more aggressively to cut labor costs , prune chrysler 's overpopulated network of us dealers and shift investment to developing markets overseas , the us paper said .
but any final deal for chrysler also hinges on what happens this summer , when the united auto workers kicks off negotiations for new master contracts with all three detroit auto giants , the journal said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de daimlerchrysler : " a failed experiment " professor ferdinand dudenhöffer , director of the center of automotive research at gelsenkirchen technical college , told dw-world.de that daimlerchrysler has a bright future without its loss-making chrysler arm .

" germany had a lack of manpower because many men were in the wehrmacht -lrb- nazi military -rrb- , " said jakub deka , a warsaw-based planning coordinator commissioned by the polish-german reconciliation foundation to plan the new exhibition , in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandradio . lingering cause of tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some victims of forced labor have received financial compensation " they simply looked for labor in the conquered areas - not just in poland , but all over europe - and took it back to germany , " he said .

" the situation is complicated , " conceded steinmeier , as he arrived to chair talks in brussels with his eu counterparts .
" in this situation we need to present proposals and not -lrb- trade -rrb- accusations , " he said . steinmeier took pains to quash rumors that the summit would be cancelled . " it will take place , " he told reporters .
" we have to bring an end to these discussions about whether or not the summit will take place , " he added . " the eu needs russia to resolve international conflicts , but similarly russia continues to depend on europe , so i am absolutely sure that on both sides reason will prevail , " he said . merkel admits to problems earlier in the day , german chancellor angela merkel stressed the eu 's interests in maintaining strong ties with russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia removed this soviet memorial from central tallinn last month addressing european parliamentarians in berlin , merkel acknowledged that there were a " series of problems to overcome " but said she hoped the summit would " make clear that we are interested in a close strategic partnership with russia . " eu-russia relations have been tense for more than a year , especially since many felt russia had begun using its heft as a major energy supplier to promote its foreign policy goals . also casting a pall over the summit is the recent dispute between russia and eu member estonia over the removal of a soviet memorial in tallinn dedicated to red army soldiers who died in world war two . steinmeier said the german presidency had been " successful with our involvement " in calming tensions between russia and estonia , and that it " will of course continue to work to bring progress . " meat row but steinmeier was unsure whether the dispute over moscow 's ban of polish meat and farm produce would be resolved before the summit began on friday near the russian city of samara , on the banks of the volga .
russia says the ban is a food-safety issue , while poland accuses moscow of using it as a political tool . " we will try right up to the summit to resolve the conflict concerning polish meat , " steinmeier said , but added : " i could n't say whether we will be successful . " because of the ban , poland has veto talks on a new eu-russia partnership agreement meant to replace an existing accord which expires late this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo serbs might want russia 's help to oppose kosovo 's independence but russia 's stance on kosovo - a potential political powder keg in europe - is potentially more difficult to overcome . on saturday , the russian government threatened to use its un security council veto to stop " supervised independence " being granted to the majority ethnic albanian province in serbia , so as not to set an example to separatists elsewhere . " the most important issue the eu has to solve with russia is kosovo , " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn said . the eu has planned an important mission in kosovo to help supervise the transfer of powers from the united nations to the provincial authorities , once a decision on its status is finalized . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia set for stormy eu , us talks amid heightened tensions eu foreign ministers will meet to prepare for an eu-russia summit they hope will ease tensions heightened in recent months by issues as diverse as independence for kosovo , us missile defense plans and human rights .

" we know that the russians are getting hot and bothered as well . " german foreign minster frank-walter steinmeier , however , said it would be impossible to predetermine exactly what the eu-russia summit results would be . " the situation is complicated but particularly in time of difficulties is important to talk , " he said before the preparatory meeting of eu ministers .
" we are going to try right up to the summit to resolve the conflict concerning polish meat .
i ca n't say whether we 'll be successful . " steinmeier added that neither the eu nor russia could afford to stop working together . " i am convinced the eu needs russia to solve international conflicts and russia is going to continue to be dependent on europe , so i am absolutely sure that on both sides reason must prevail , " he said . analysts however are skeptical that things will calm down . " neither the rice talks nor the samara meeting will bring any concrete steps to overcoming disagreements , " said yevgeny volk , an analyst for the heritage foundation .
" it was only in the cold war that relations were like this .
it 's like 20 years ago . " plenty of irritants topping rice 's agenda on tuesday will be fierce russian opposition to a us plan for deploying a limited missile defense system in poland and the czech republic . she has little chance of making progress .
washington says the system is aimed at averting attacks from countries like iran or north korea , but moscow sees the system as a direct threat that could trigger a new arms race and has announced a freeze on a landmark soviet-era arms limitation treaty . last month eu trade commissioner peter mandelson warned that mistrust and a lack of respect in the relations between the european union and russia are at their worst levels since the cold war . " neither thinks they enjoy the respect and goodwill from the other they are entitled to expect , " he said , in comments which his eu colleagues have since been at pains to play down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world ii statue that is the source of much friction between moscow and tallin tension will also be high at the russia-eu summit following a row over a soviet war memorial between moscow and estonia , a former soviet republic that is now a member of the eu and nato military alliance . the foreign ministers meeting in brussels on monday will also hail serbia 's creation on friday of a pro-european government . the 27 eu nations hope the serbs ' move will help push forward plans for supervised independence in the breakaway serbian province of kosovo , a measure which russia has threatened to block at the un security council . russia on saturday dismissed as " unacceptable " a draft un security council resolution , introduced by western powers , endorsing the kosovo independence plan of un envoy martti ahtisaari . political freedoms and human rights hanging over both the us and eu meetings will be growing western criticism of russian president vladimir putin 's handling of political freedoms and human rights - a sensitive issue thrown into relief by plans for an opposition rally in samara on the day of the eu summit . police have violently broken up several earlier protest marches by the other russia coalition , bringing condemnation from western governments . on friday , a spokesman for german chancellor angela merkel , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency , urged russia to authorize the samara protest , saying : " we start from the principle that critical voices should be able to be expressed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crackdown on protestors in st petersburg last month sparked western criticism ahead of her visit , rice attacked what she called the " turning back " of freedoms in russia under putin and said " everybody around the world " was concerned . other bones of contention include constant delays in russia 's bid for membership of the world trade organization , russian opposition to independence for serbia 's kosovo province , and a meat trade dispute with eu member poland . " worst summit in history " the russia-eu meeting " will be the worst summit in history because there 's actually nothing that can be achieved in samara , " said fyodr lukyanov , editor of the journal russia in global affairs .
prospects for rice were " not much better , " he added . analysts said that much of the bad feeling is based on political maneuvering rather than concrete problems . " i think that russia and the european union tripped up on a step that should have led to better relations , " said mark entin , professor at moscow 's european studies institute .
" the step is russia becoming richer , faster , more confident .
at the same time , the european union is becoming bigger .
this is not seen as an opportunity , but as a challenge .
it 's a problem of mentality . "
lukyanov also pointed to a " psychological " divide exacerbated by the run-up to presidential elections in the united states and russia next year . " the russian leadership is completely preoccupied with power and they use foreign policy to strengthen their position , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " russia wants pragmatic , business-like cooperation " as relations between brussels and moscow remain tense , the russia of today is not the russia of the 90s , one expert told deutsche welle .

" we know that the russians are getting hot and bothered as well . " german foreign minster frank-walter steinmeier , however , said it would be impossible to predetermine exactly what the eu-russia summit results would be . " the situation is complicated but particularly in time of difficulties is important to talk , " he said before the preparatory meeting of eu ministers .
" we are going to try right up to the summit to resolve the conflict concerning polish meat .
i ca n't say whether we 'll be successful . " steinmeier added that neither the eu nor russia could afford to stop working together . " i am convinced the eu needs russia to solve international conflicts and russia is going to continue to be dependent on europe , so i am absolutely sure that on both sides reason must prevail , " he said . analysts however are skeptical that things will calm down . " neither the rice talks nor the samara meeting will bring any concrete steps to overcoming disagreements , " said yevgeny volk , an analyst for the heritage foundation .
" it was only in the cold war that relations were like this .
it 's like 20 years ago . " plenty of irritants topping rice 's agenda on tuesday will be fierce russian opposition to a us plan for deploying a limited missile defense system in poland and the czech republic . she has little chance of making progress .
washington says the system is aimed at averting attacks from countries like iran or north korea , but moscow sees the system as a direct threat that could trigger a new arms race and has announced a freeze on a landmark soviet-era arms limitation treaty . last month eu trade commissioner peter mandelson warned that mistrust and a lack of respect in the relations between the european union and russia are at their worst levels since the cold war . " neither thinks they enjoy the respect and goodwill from the other they are entitled to expect , " he said , in comments which his eu colleagues have since been at pains to play down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world ii statue that is the source of much friction between moscow and tallin tension will also be high at the russia-eu summit following a row over a soviet war memorial between moscow and estonia , a former soviet republic that is now a member of the eu and nato military alliance . the foreign ministers meeting in brussels on monday will also hail serbia 's creation on friday of a pro-european government . the 27 eu nations hope the serbs ' move will help push forward plans for supervised independence in the breakaway serbian province of kosovo , a measure which russia has threatened to block at the un security council . russia on saturday dismissed as " unacceptable " a draft un security council resolution , introduced by western powers , endorsing the kosovo independence plan of un envoy martti ahtisaari . political freedoms and human rights hanging over both the us and eu meetings will be growing western criticism of russian president vladimir putin 's handling of political freedoms and human rights - a sensitive issue thrown into relief by plans for an opposition rally in samara on the day of the eu summit . police have violently broken up several earlier protest marches by the other russia coalition , bringing condemnation from western governments . on friday , a spokesman for german chancellor angela merkel , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency , urged russia to authorize the samara protest , saying : " we start from the principle that critical voices should be able to be expressed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crackdown on protestors in st petersburg last month sparked western criticism ahead of her visit , rice attacked what she called the " turning back " of freedoms in russia under putin and said " everybody around the world " was concerned . other bones of contention include constant delays in russia 's bid for membership of the world trade organization , russian opposition to independence for serbia 's kosovo province , and a meat trade dispute with eu member poland . " worst summit in history " the russia-eu meeting " will be the worst summit in history because there 's actually nothing that can be achieved in samara , " said fyodr lukyanov , editor of the journal russia in global affairs .
prospects for rice were " not much better , " he added . analysts said that much of the bad feeling is based on political maneuvering rather than concrete problems . " i think that russia and the european union tripped up on a step that should have led to better relations , " said mark entin , professor at moscow 's european studies institute .
" the step is russia becoming richer , faster , more confident .
at the same time , the european union is becoming bigger .
this is not seen as an opportunity , but as a challenge .
it 's a problem of mentality . "
lukyanov also pointed to a " psychological " divide exacerbated by the run-up to presidential elections in the united states and russia next year .

" we need to make sure that in future operations do n't take place in this way , " jung told reporters on monday in brussels where he was meeting with his eu counterparts . " we do n't want the population against us , " he said .
" we have to prevent that . " jung said the killing of civilians antagonized the local population and jeopardized international efforts to win the " hearts and minds " of ordinary afghans . " it is precisely the wrong tactic , " the defense minister said .
jung added that he had raised the issue with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung , pictured here with his us counterpart robert gates , used an unusually sharp tone in his criticism jung emphasized he was referring to the us anti-terrorist operation , enduring freedom , not action by the nato-led mission in afghanistan . nato is leading a force of some 36,000 troops from 37 nations in afghanistan which is trying to extend the political reach of president hamid karzai 's central government to more lawless outlying regions . the us-led coalition is a separate force around 10,000-strong which , while it does coordinate with the nato-led contingent , is mainly involved in " anti-terror " operations . us-led coalition air strikes in southern afghanistan recently killed at least 21 afghan civilians in a bombing campaign against taliban militants hiding in the sangin district of helmand province . this comes on top of reports that nearly 60 people were killed in us airstrikes late last month . eu police mission meanwhile , eu defense ministers agreed on monday to plans for the deployment of 160 police and law enforcement officers to afghanistan .
the operation , which marks an expansion in the bloc 's global security role , will be launched in mid-june and will focus on providing training to the afghan police force .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de third reich -pipe- 14.05.2007 berlin exhibit focuses on victims of nazi labor camps großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazis subjected millions of people to forced labor after having toured 30 cities in poland , an exhibition on forced labor under the nazi regime opened in one of berlin 's few preserved labor camp barracks . when the nazi began their attempt conquering europe in the late 1930s , they deported millions of people in the conquered countries back to germany to serve as slave laborers . the exhibit " remembrance preserved : third reich slave and forced labor from poland 1939-1945 , " which opened last week , is housed in the barracks of a former nazi labor camp in berlin-niederschöneweide . " germany had a lack of manpower because many men were in the wehrmacht -lrb- nazi military -rrb- , " said jakub deka , a warsaw-based planning coordinator commissioned by the polish-german reconciliation foundation to plan the new exhibition , in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandradio . lingering cause of tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some victims of forced labor have received financial compensation " they simply looked for labor in the conquered areas - not just in poland , but all over europe - and took it back to germany , " he said .
an estimated 3 million poles were subjected to forced labor under the nazi regime in germany following the invasion of poland in 1939 , which makes it a particularly sore topic in german-polish relations .
those capable of working were sent to munitions factories and coal mines to support the war effort , while children underwent a process of " germanization " in special schools .
treatment in the camps was harsh , and prisoners were often beaten and even shot for not working up to standard or trying to escape . promoting reconciliation the exhibit 's opening in germany was attended by survivors from wartime labor camps in flensburg , frankfurt , wolfsburg and berlin .
polish-born josef kuzba , a prisoner at the sachsenhausen concentration camp from 1940 to 1945 , has been discussing his experiences with children from the city 's archenhold gymnasium and sophie scholl oberschule . " the youngsters seemed well briefed about world war ii , " he said .
" it was a pleasure talking to them . " asked if he was apprehensive about visiting germany nowadays , he replied : " no , not at all .
i 'm a frequent visitor and have good relations with friends here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuzba talks about his experiences in sachsenhausen with school children kuzba , who was born in pomerania , and now lives in warsaw , said he had been active in promoting polish-german reconciliation for years . " remembrance is one thing , reconciliation another , " kuzba said .
" both are important for our nations . " mariusz muszynski , chairman of the foundation for polish-german reconciliation , wrote in the 205-page exhibit catalog that no other event in german-polish history had ever proved so burdensome to relations as the nazi-led invasion of poland . " material payments can never make up for the sorrow and suffering caused victims - but they were seen as a symbolic gesture of fairness and respect and a contributory step towards a better understanding between the two nations , " said muszynski . millions have been paid worldwide to german slave and forced labor victims following the enactment of a law by the german parliament and the creation of a " remembrance , responsibility , future " foundation . berlin first stop on german tour original nazi documents , photographs , biographies and a documentary film make up the exhibit , which will remain in berlin until mid-october before it continues on to other german cities .
it has already been viewed by 80,000 visitors during its tour in poland .
the camp where the exhibit is currently housed was built in 1943 by albert speer , nazi minister of infrastructure and munitions , for over 2,000 workers .
it is one of 3,000 such nazi camps built in the berlin area and one of only few nazi labor camps remaining . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament condemns chinese labor camps , irks beijing amid protests from beijing , the german parliament thursday condemned chinese labor camps and called for special labels on goods produced in labor camps .

" germany had a lack of manpower because many men were in the wehrmacht -lrb- nazi military -rrb- , " said jakub deka , a warsaw-based planning coordinator commissioned by the polish-german reconciliation foundation to plan the new exhibition , in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandradio . lingering cause of tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some victims of forced labor have received financial compensation " they simply looked for labor in the conquered areas - not just in poland , but all over europe - and took it back to germany , " he said .
an estimated 3 million poles were subjected to forced labor under the nazi regime in germany following the invasion of poland in 1939 , which makes it a particularly sore topic in german-polish relations .
those capable of working were sent to munitions factories and coal mines to support the war effort , while children underwent a process of " germanization " in special schools .
treatment in the camps was harsh , and prisoners were often beaten and even shot for not working up to standard or trying to escape . promoting reconciliation the exhibit 's opening in germany was attended by survivors from wartime labor camps in flensburg , frankfurt , wolfsburg and berlin .

" remembrance is one thing , reconciliation another , " kuzba said .
" both are important for our nations . " mariusz muszynski , chairman of the foundation for polish-german reconciliation , wrote in the 205-page exhibit catalog that no other event in german-polish history had ever proved so burdensome to relations as the nazi-led invasion of poland . " material payments can never make up for the sorrow and suffering caused victims - but they were seen as a symbolic gesture of fairness and respect and a contributory step towards a better understanding between the two nations , " said muszynski . millions have been paid worldwide to german slave and forced labor victims following the enactment of a law by the german parliament and the creation of a " remembrance , responsibility , future " foundation . berlin first stop on german tour original nazi documents , photographs , biographies and a documentary film make up the exhibit , which will remain in berlin until mid-october before it continues on to other german cities .

" we know that the russians are getting hot and bothered as well . " german foreign minster frank-walter steinmeier , however , said it would be impossible to predetermine exactly what the eu-russia summit results would be . " the situation is complicated but particularly in time of difficulties is important to talk , " he said before the preparatory meeting of eu ministers .
" we are going to try right up to the summit to resolve the conflict concerning polish meat .
i ca n't say whether we 'll be successful . " steinmeier added that neither the eu nor russia could afford to stop working together . " i am convinced the eu needs russia to solve international conflicts and russia is going to continue to be dependent on europe , so i am absolutely sure that on both sides reason must prevail , " he said . analysts however are skeptical that things will calm down . " neither the rice talks nor the samara meeting will bring any concrete steps to overcoming disagreements , " said yevgeny volk , an analyst for the heritage foundation .
" it was only in the cold war that relations were like this .
it 's like 20 years ago . " plenty of irritants topping rice 's agenda on tuesday will be fierce russian opposition to a us plan for deploying a limited missile defense system in poland and the czech republic . she has little chance of making progress .
washington says the system is aimed at averting attacks from countries like iran or north korea , but moscow sees the system as a direct threat that could trigger a new arms race and has announced a freeze on a landmark soviet-era arms limitation treaty . last month eu trade commissioner peter mandelson warned that mistrust and a lack of respect in the relations between the european union and russia are at their worst levels since the cold war . " neither thinks they enjoy the respect and goodwill from the other they are entitled to expect , " he said , in comments which his eu colleagues have since been at pains to play down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world ii statue that is the source of much friction between moscow and tallin tension will also be high at the russia-eu summit following a row over a soviet war memorial between moscow and estonia , a former soviet republic that is now a member of the eu and nato military alliance . the foreign ministers meeting in brussels on monday will also hail serbia 's creation on friday of a pro-european government . the 27 eu nations hope the serbs ' move will help push forward plans for supervised independence in the breakaway serbian province of kosovo , a measure which russia has threatened to block at the un security council . russia on saturday dismissed as " unacceptable " a draft un security council resolution , introduced by western powers , endorsing the kosovo independence plan of un envoy martti ahtisaari . political freedoms and human rights hanging over both the us and eu meetings will be growing western criticism of russian president vladimir putin 's handling of political freedoms and human rights - a sensitive issue thrown into relief by plans for an opposition rally in samara on the day of the eu summit . police have violently broken up several earlier protest marches by the other russia coalition , bringing condemnation from western governments . on friday , a spokesman for german chancellor angela merkel , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency , urged russia to authorize the samara protest , saying : " we start from the principle that critical voices should be able to be expressed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crackdown on protestors in st petersburg last month sparked western criticism ahead of her visit , rice attacked what she called the " turning back " of freedoms in russia under putin and said " everybody around the world " was concerned . other bones of contention include constant delays in russia 's bid for membership of the world trade organization , russian opposition to independence for serbia 's kosovo province , and a meat trade dispute with eu member poland . " worst summit in history " the russia-eu meeting " will be the worst summit in history because there 's actually nothing that can be achieved in samara , " said fyodr lukyanov , editor of the journal russia in global affairs .
prospects for rice were " not much better , " he added . analysts said that much of the bad feeling is based on political maneuvering rather than concrete problems . " i think that russia and the european union tripped up on a step that should have led to better relations , " said mark entin , professor at moscow 's european studies institute .
" the step is russia becoming richer , faster , more confident .
at the same time , the european union is becoming bigger .
this is not seen as an opportunity , but as a challenge .
it 's a problem of mentality . "
lukyanov also pointed to a " psychological " divide exacerbated by the run-up to presidential elections in the united states and russia next year . " the russian leadership is completely preoccupied with power and they use foreign policy to strengthen their position , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " russia wants pragmatic , business-like cooperation " as relations between brussels and moscow remain tense , the russia of today is not the russia of the 90s , one expert told deutsche welle .

dw-radio : do the ongoing disputes between russia and the eu make you pessimistic about the prospects for any breakthroughs at the upcoming summit ?
alexander rahr : in the short run , i 'm very skeptical and pessimistic about the possibility of improving relations between russia and the european union , but of course one has to be more optimistic for the long run .
but presently , there is talk of a new cold war between the eu and russia .
one of the main disputes is about the power that moscow wields because of its massive reserves of oil and gas and its control over the transport of energy supplies from central asia .
how do you think this issue will be addressed at the summit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander rahr i think that this is a temporary situation .
the situation in general will stabilize and improve because russia needs its european partners and the european market in order to sell its goods .

russia itself has a wait-and-see attitude .
it wants to have good cooperation with the european union , but it does not want to tolerate criticism of its interior policies .

do you think this issue will be raised at the summit ?
this issue has been raised at every summit for many years .
but the fact that the problems are being raised will not lead to any solution .
russia will listen , but it will say , " the west does not understand us .

but in the lead up to the 2007 g8 summit in germany , some economists are again raising the question of whether the right members are in the g8 club . just thinking about the current g8 members - germany , france , italy , great britain , russia , japan , the united states and canada - puts renowned economist jim o 'neill in a bad mood . " i have no idea why a country like italy is allowed to continue to be in the club , " said o 'neill , who is head of global economic research at investment bank goldman sachs . o 'neill is author of an influential report which argues that brazil , russia , india and china - the so-called brics - could become the four dominant economies by 2050 .
italy is noticeably absent in o 'neill 's report . " italy 's contribution to the world economy has been continually shrinking for a while now , but at g8 summits , italy is still a participatory to the official agreements about how the world functions today , " he said . lack of binding decisions like o 'neill , many others see the g8 as irrelevant and some would even love to see it dismantled immediately .
according to its critics , the g8 's lack of administrative structure and binding rules mean that although leaders broach issues such as debt relief and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , there are few concrete achievements . for o 'neill , the g8 members represent the world as it was more than 60 years ago and do n't reflect the current situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is predicted to overtake germany as the world 's third largest economy by 2008 " the worst thing is that the wrong participants are sitting at the g8 table , " said o 'neill .
" it is a somewhat simplistic idea to want to rule the world according to some post-war schematic , " he said . according to him , by the middle of the century , the brics are likely to have more economic weight that the current g7 countries -lrb- g8 without russia -rrb- put together .
the economy of china alone in 2050 is likely to be 20 times bigger than it is today and will have overtaken the usa as the world 's biggest , o 'neill predicted . changing world economy russia was admitted to the group of eight in 1997 , becoming the first new member since canada came on board in 1976 .
critics like o 'neill say the g8 ca n't continue to ignore the dramatic changes to the global economy . after all , it was n't until the gleneagles summit in 2005 that the heads of states agreed to hold a separate set of meetings with ministers from emerging economies of china , india , brazil , south africa and mexico , now known as the g8 + 5 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , five developing countries attended the g8 environment ministers meeting for the first time peter hajnal , an academic with the g8 research group at canada 's toronto university thinks this was an intelligent decision .
the alternative would have been to hold a meeting of the 20 leading heads of states based on the model of the g20 industrial nations forum formed in 1999 . according to hajnal , such a structure would make it more difficult to achieve real results , however , and is n't being considered as a real possibility . even economist o 'neill does n't want to see an increase in the number of g8 members .
he would prefer the introduction of rules regulating who has the right to sit at the table . " we should learn from soccer , and have a permanent league in which only the current world economic powers are allowed to play , " o 'neill said .
" you would be able to advance into and dropped from the league . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the g8 look to soccer for inspiration ?
o 'neill has even thought of an umpire - the international monetary fund , which could use economic data to determine the lucky eight . is g8 membership desirable ? this suggestion is n't an option for hajnal , who pointed out that not all bric countries were angling for g8 membership . china has " continually emphasized that it does n't want to belong for the moment " because it was " profiting economically " by being a developing country , hajnal said . however , according to hajnal , the g8 's very informality could well come in useful in the future by making it easier for the g8 to adapt to changes in the world 's power balance .

according to its critics , the g8 's lack of administrative structure and binding rules mean that although leaders broach issues such as debt relief and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , there are few concrete achievements . for o 'neill , the g8 members represent the world as it was more than 60 years ago and do n't reflect the current situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is predicted to overtake germany as the world 's third largest economy by 2008 " the worst thing is that the wrong participants are sitting at the g8 table , " said o 'neill .

a two-day informal meeting of european drug commissioners begins in berlin monday , two days after the interior ministers of the eu 's six largest countries agreed on closer cooperation with africa in the fight against drug smuggling from south america at a meeting in venice .
the venice meeting followed the three-day international drug enforcement conference in madrid last week which was hosted by the spanish government and the us drug enforcement agency -lrb- dea -rrb- , washington ’ s top anti-narcotics agency .
the talks on saturday were attended by eu justice commissioner franco frattini , the interior ministers of germany , britain , poland , france , spain and italy , and united states secretary of homeland security michael chertoff .

spanish officials seized over 40 tons of cocaine last year , a record amount and more than any other nation in the world except for colombia , the united states and venezuela , camacho said .

" we know that the russians are getting hot and bothered as well . " german foreign minster frank-walter steinmeier , however , said it would be impossible to predetermine exactly what the eu-russia summit results would be . " the situation is complicated but particularly in time of difficulties is important to talk , " he said before the preparatory meeting of eu ministers .
" we are going to try right up to the summit to resolve the conflict concerning polish meat .
i ca n't say whether we 'll be successful . " steinmeier added that neither the eu nor russia could afford to stop working together . " i am convinced the eu needs russia to solve international conflicts and russia is going to continue to be dependent on europe , so i am absolutely sure that on both sides reason must prevail , " he said . analysts however are skeptical that things will calm down . " neither the rice talks nor the samara meeting will bring any concrete steps to overcoming disagreements , " said yevgeny volk , an analyst for the heritage foundation .
" it was only in the cold war that relations were like this .
it 's like 20 years ago . " plenty of irritants topping rice 's agenda on tuesday will be fierce russian opposition to a us plan for deploying a limited missile defense system in poland and the czech republic . she has little chance of making progress .
washington says the system is aimed at averting attacks from countries like iran or north korea , but moscow sees the system as a direct threat that could trigger a new arms race and has announced a freeze on a landmark soviet-era arms limitation treaty . last month eu trade commissioner peter mandelson warned that mistrust and a lack of respect in the relations between the european union and russia are at their worst levels since the cold war . " neither thinks they enjoy the respect and goodwill from the other they are entitled to expect , " he said , in comments which his eu colleagues have since been at pains to play down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world ii statue that is the source of much friction between moscow and tallin tension will also be high at the russia-eu summit following a row over a soviet war memorial between moscow and estonia , a former soviet republic that is now a member of the eu and nato military alliance . the foreign ministers meeting in brussels on monday will also hail serbia 's creation on friday of a pro-european government . the 27 eu nations hope the serbs ' move will help push forward plans for supervised independence in the breakaway serbian province of kosovo , a measure which russia has threatened to block at the un security council . russia on saturday dismissed as " unacceptable " a draft un security council resolution , introduced by western powers , endorsing the kosovo independence plan of un envoy martti ahtisaari . political freedoms and human rights hanging over both the us and eu meetings will be growing western criticism of russian president vladimir putin 's handling of political freedoms and human rights - a sensitive issue thrown into relief by plans for an opposition rally in samara on the day of the eu summit . police have violently broken up several earlier protest marches by the other russia coalition , bringing condemnation from western governments . on friday , a spokesman for german chancellor angela merkel , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency , urged russia to authorize the samara protest , saying : " we start from the principle that critical voices should be able to be expressed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crackdown on protestors in st petersburg last month sparked western criticism ahead of her visit , rice attacked what she called the " turning back " of freedoms in russia under putin and said " everybody around the world " was concerned . other bones of contention include constant delays in russia 's bid for membership of the world trade organization , russian opposition to independence for serbia 's kosovo province , and a meat trade dispute with eu member poland . " worst summit in history " the russia-eu meeting " will be the worst summit in history because there 's actually nothing that can be achieved in samara , " said fyodr lukyanov , editor of the journal russia in global affairs .
prospects for rice were " not much better , " he added . analysts said that much of the bad feeling is based on political maneuvering rather than concrete problems . " i think that russia and the european union tripped up on a step that should have led to better relations , " said mark entin , professor at moscow 's european studies institute .
" the step is russia becoming richer , faster , more confident .
at the same time , the european union is becoming bigger .
this is not seen as an opportunity , but as a challenge .
it 's a problem of mentality . "
lukyanov also pointed to a " psychological " divide exacerbated by the run-up to presidential elections in the united states and russia next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 14.05.2007 rubbish managers say germans are number one in recycling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : separating packaging from trash is no easy matter some people say no one likes to separate their trash as much as germans - even troops stationed in afghanistan are reported to separate their rubbish .
it 's a chacteristic that trash pleases trash management companies . separating trash for recycling is no easy matter .
for one thing , it 's sometimes difficult discerning whether the trash in your hand is actually packaging , glass , paper , hazardous or organic waste .
what bin do you use when packaging includes both cardboard and plastic ? but after you 've gone through the trouble of washing your hands of your many types of rubbish , you can at least know it 's worth it - economically , as well as for the planet . dealing in trash makes good business sense .
waste management has become a major industry in germany - with 250,000 employees in the sector , and the rubbish people throw away also generates turnover of 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 67.7 billion -rrb- . so what 's the point ? " i do try to recycle , " said one woman .
" i put paper in the blue recycling bin , yoghurt containers and tin foil in the yellow bins for packaging , and we also recycle bottles . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yellow bags hopefully carrying " green dot " packaging another woman said she 's made a conscious choice not to throw plastic in the packaging recycling bin . " you 're supposed to clean out yoghurt containers , but that uses a lot of water , and i do n't think it 's a good idea to waste so much , " she said .
" besides , people say anyway that everything is thrown back together again and then burned at the incineration plant . " in the western german city of cologne , for example , the packaging thrown into recycling bins lands in the hands of remondis , a collection company , then taken to a facility , where the so-called " dsd " trash is sorted .
visiting the remondis plant , you 'll find a mound of trash consisting of yoghurts cups , plastic wrapping and aluminum cans . dsd stands for duales system deutschland -lrb- dual system germany -rrb- , a company established in 1990 . in 1991 , a special german packaging ordinance came into force and required product manufacturers and vendors to take back packaging once the products have been used and arranged for their recycling .
dsd organizes this system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how to sort your rubbish in the berlin subway ?
packaging marked what is called the grüner punkt or green dot is part of this system .
only packaging with the green dot is supposed to be placed either in special yellow plastic bags placed outside for pickup , or placed in yellow recycling containers . refuse companies say that in international comparisons , germans are number one in recycling their packaging .
but the figures are disputed . according to dsd , largely a monopoly in the recycling sector , each consumer in germany recycles around 76 kilograms -lrb- 167 pounds -rrb- of packaging a year . critics say that translates into about 30 items of packaging per day , which they claim is unrealistic .
they estimate that on the average , each person recycles around 26 kilograms of dsd trash annually . what 's a recyclable wrapping ? but does everyone separate properly ?
do they put only " green dot " product wrappings in the yellow bags and boxes ? jürgen lennertz , director of the remondis plant in cologne , said that " people throw from 30 to 50 percent of packaging without the green dot into the yellow containers . " what is thrown in there is everything from plastic pots for plants to garden hoses .
udo koch , remondis operations manager , hit the point home with the rhetorical question : " now is that packaging ? " koch also said people also throw frying pans , cameras and even dirty diapers into the yellow recycling bins . the good news is that modern sorting machines can recognize and categorize about 90 percent of rubbish , leaving about 5 percent to be sorted by hand . the bigger picture so machines do help germans be international leaders in divvying up their trash .
koch said there is a reason for it all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ha schult has made art out of trash " i think a lot of people are thinking about the climate right now , " he said .
" the amount of energy necessary to recycle product wrappings is much less than what you need to produce the packaging in the first place . " critics , however , disagree .
they say more energy is needed to recycle smaller wrapping items than to generate them . either way , around 50 percent to 70 percent of the " yellow bin content " can be recycled . the rest , which can not is incinerated , also generates energy .
the cologne-based avg , a waste management and incineration company , said it could pass along 400,000 megawatts of power and 230,000 tons of steam to the energy industry in 2006 resulting from waste incineration . tuba tuncak -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a recycled bottle story : from drink container to winter sweater ever wonder what happens to all those plastic bottles the germans seem to be perpetually recycling ?

it 's a chacteristic that trash pleases trash management companies . separating trash for recycling is no easy matter .
for one thing , it 's sometimes difficult discerning whether the trash in your hand is actually packaging , glass , paper , hazardous or organic waste .
what bin do you use when packaging includes both cardboard and plastic ? but after you 've gone through the trouble of washing your hands of your many types of rubbish , you can at least know it 's worth it - economically , as well as for the planet . dealing in trash makes good business sense .
waste management has become a major industry in germany - with 250,000 employees in the sector , and the rubbish people throw away also generates turnover of 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 67.7 billion -rrb- . so what 's the point ? " i do try to recycle , " said one woman .
" i put paper in the blue recycling bin , yoghurt containers and tin foil in the yellow bins for packaging , and we also recycle bottles . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yellow bags hopefully carrying " green dot " packaging another woman said she 's made a conscious choice not to throw plastic in the packaging recycling bin . " you 're supposed to clean out yoghurt containers , but that uses a lot of water , and i do n't think it 's a good idea to waste so much , " she said .
" besides , people say anyway that everything is thrown back together again and then burned at the incineration plant . " in the western german city of cologne , for example , the packaging thrown into recycling bins lands in the hands of remondis , a collection company , then taken to a facility , where the so-called " dsd " trash is sorted .
visiting the remondis plant , you 'll find a mound of trash consisting of yoghurts cups , plastic wrapping and aluminum cans . dsd stands for duales system deutschland -lrb- dual system germany -rrb- , a company established in 1990 . in 1991 , a special german packaging ordinance came into force and required product manufacturers and vendors to take back packaging once the products have been used and arranged for their recycling .
dsd organizes this system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how to sort your rubbish in the berlin subway ?
packaging marked what is called the grüner punkt or green dot is part of this system .
only packaging with the green dot is supposed to be placed either in special yellow plastic bags placed outside for pickup , or placed in yellow recycling containers . refuse companies say that in international comparisons , germans are number one in recycling their packaging .
but the figures are disputed . according to dsd , largely a monopoly in the recycling sector , each consumer in germany recycles around 76 kilograms -lrb- 167 pounds -rrb- of packaging a year . critics say that translates into about 30 items of packaging per day , which they claim is unrealistic .
they estimate that on the average , each person recycles around 26 kilograms of dsd trash annually . what 's a recyclable wrapping ? but does everyone separate properly ?
do they put only " green dot " product wrappings in the yellow bags and boxes ? jürgen lennertz , director of the remondis plant in cologne , said that " people throw from 30 to 50 percent of packaging without the green dot into the yellow containers . " what is thrown in there is everything from plastic pots for plants to garden hoses .
udo koch , remondis operations manager , hit the point home with the rhetorical question : " now is that packaging ? " koch also said people also throw frying pans , cameras and even dirty diapers into the yellow recycling bins . the good news is that modern sorting machines can recognize and categorize about 90 percent of rubbish , leaving about 5 percent to be sorted by hand . the bigger picture so machines do help germans be international leaders in divvying up their trash .
koch said there is a reason for it all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ha schult has made art out of trash " i think a lot of people are thinking about the climate right now , " he said .
" the amount of energy necessary to recycle product wrappings is much less than what you need to produce the packaging in the first place . " critics , however , disagree .
they say more energy is needed to recycle smaller wrapping items than to generate them . either way , around 50 percent to 70 percent of the " yellow bin content " can be recycled . the rest , which can not is incinerated , also generates energy .
the cologne-based avg , a waste management and incineration company , said it could pass along 400,000 megawatts of power and 230,000 tons of steam to the energy industry in 2006 resulting from waste incineration . tuba tuncak -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a recycled bottle story : from drink container to winter sweater ever wonder what happens to all those plastic bottles the germans seem to be perpetually recycling ?

" we have to bring an end to these discussions about whether or not the summit will take place , " he added . " the eu needs russia to resolve international conflicts , but similarly russia continues to depend on europe , so i am absolutely sure that on both sides reason will prevail , " he said . merkel admits to problems earlier in the day , german chancellor angela merkel stressed the eu 's interests in maintaining strong ties with russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia removed this soviet memorial from central tallinn last month addressing european parliamentarians in berlin , merkel acknowledged that there were a " series of problems to overcome " but said she hoped the summit would " make clear that we are interested in a close strategic partnership with russia . " eu-russia relations have been tense for more than a year , especially since many felt russia had begun using its heft as a major energy supplier to promote its foreign policy goals . also casting a pall over the summit is the recent dispute between russia and eu member estonia over the removal of a soviet memorial in tallinn dedicated to red army soldiers who died in world war two . steinmeier said the german presidency had been " successful with our involvement " in calming tensions between russia and estonia , and that it " will of course continue to work to bring progress .

russia says the ban is a food-safety issue , while poland accuses moscow of using it as a political tool . " we will try right up to the summit to resolve the conflict concerning polish meat , " steinmeier said , but added : " i could n't say whether we will be successful .

" the most important issue the eu has to solve with russia is kosovo , " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn said . the eu has planned an important mission in kosovo to help supervise the transfer of powers from the united nations to the provincial authorities , once a decision on its status is finalized . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia set for stormy eu , us talks amid heightened tensions eu foreign ministers will meet to prepare for an eu-russia summit they hope will ease tensions heightened in recent months by issues as diverse as independence for kosovo , us missile defense plans and human rights .

but not two of germany 's leading soccer stars , who sued germany 's leading sex shop chain for doing just that .
now the sex shop has to pay up . as soccer mania started building to fever pitch in the run-up to last year 's world cup in germany , sex shop chain beate uhse thought it would take advantage of the near deification of some of the country 's national team soccer players .
it marketed two vibrators under the names " michael b. " and " olli k , " which appear to be clear references to michael ballack , now a midfielder at chelsea , and oliver kahn , bayern munich 's goalkeeper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack , sex symbol ?
maybe ...
while probably many women , and more than a few men , instantly felt an erotic frisson at the thought of taking one of the two athletes to bed , the soccer stars themselves were not amused .
they took beate uhse to court , charging them with unauthorized use of their names .
the two men are not averse to making product endorsements ; they just did n't want to do it for free , or maybe for a sex toy .
just a coincidence , really for its part , beate uhse has always insisted the company was innocent .
the vibrators , 17 cm -lrb- 6.7 inches -rrb- long and advertised as " cuddly " and " cheeky , " were not modelled on the stars ' own , er , equipment .
according to beate uhse , the company did not mean to convince buyers they were going to be getting to know the men , at least vicariously , up close and very personally .
" we never had any intention to make a connection between the vibrators on sale in our shops with the names of ' olli k. ' and ' michael b. ' and the footballers , " company spokesperson assia tsernookoff insisted at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn , sex symbol ?
maybe not still , beate uhse pulled the two models off the shelves after the men fired up their lawyers .
now a court says the shop has to pay up .
beate uhse will be sending both of the millionaires 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 67,380 -rrb- for their trouble .
the incident begs the question if the sex shop chain lost a bit of its business sense by refusing to ask the men permission ahead of time , or if they 've lost a sense of what 's sexy : does anyone really want to take oliver kahn to bed ? dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beate uhse loses its world cup buzz bad news for german soccer fans : olli k. and michael b. will not be bringing pleasure to supporters during the world cup .

do n't leave bonn without him großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven was born in bonn in 1770 , but lived most of his life in vienna visitors to bonn are certain to go home with a beethoven souvenir .
after all , the former capital has learned to make the most of its connection to its famous son . they come from all over the world and have one thing in common - they 've come to follow in the footsteps of ludwig van beethoven .
in bonn , where the composer lived from his birth in 1770 until the age of 22 , that 's not hard to do .
beethoven is practically everywhere - visitors are bound to come across his serious-looking profile on everything from suspenders and umbrellas to ball-point pens and chocolate truffles .
the larger-than-life statue of beethoven on bonn 's central münster square , across from the main post office , has long since become an important landmark in the city .
in fact , the monument 's consecration in 1845 , timed to coincide with the composer 's 75th birthday , was celebrated with a three-day music festival organized by none other than franz liszt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this monument was erected for beethoven 's 75th birthday " it definitely belongs in my germany photo album , " said tourist xianguo zhong from shanghai while posing for the camera together with the colossal composer .
beethoven sells every year , some 500,000 tourists and business travellers , many of them from asia , stop in bonn .
along with bonn 's many museums , beethoven is one of the former capital 's most significant attractions .
the annual beethoven festival , in particular , draws the crowds .
it has its roots in franz liszt 's 1845 festival and is a special highlight for music lovers from all over the world .
bonn tourism officials have quickly learned that , quite simply , beethoven sells .
in addition to her picture in front of the statue , xianguo zhong went home with a t-shirt with a picture of the composer on it .
" in china , every kid knows who beethoven is , " she said .
" we read stories about him in elementary school . "
souvenirs galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house attracts around 100,000 visitors per year the museum gift shop in the composer 's birth house has over 800 beethoven souvenirs on offer , including beer glasses , thimbles , playing cards , stationary and ties all printed with a variety of beethoven motives .
each year , around 100,000 pilgrims visit the house on bonngasse , where they can view some of the composer 's instruments , hand-written correspondence and original manuscripts - and take home reproductions of the " moonlight sonata " or " für elise " manuscripts printed on silk scarves and porcelain plates .
particularly enthusiastic beethoven fans can even take home a bit of the composer himself - at least from the shoulders up .
visitors can choose from 20 different types of beethoven busts measuring between five and 55 centimeters -lrb- two to 22 inches -rrb- tall and costing up to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,350 -rrb- .
the gift shop 's best-sellers , however , are the cds of the composer 's music .
they even offer a recording that simulates beethoven 's hearing loss with changes to the volume and sound of the music .
the birth house also holds a substantial beethoven archive and library .

but in the lead up to the 2007 g8 summit in germany , some economists are again raising the question of whether the right members are in the g8 club . just thinking about the current g8 members - germany , france , italy , great britain , russia , japan , the united states and canada - puts renowned economist jim o 'neill in a bad mood . " i have no idea why a country like italy is allowed to continue to be in the club , " said o 'neill , who is head of global economic research at investment bank goldman sachs . o 'neill is author of an influential report which argues that brazil , russia , india and china - the so-called brics - could become the four dominant economies by 2050 .
italy is noticeably absent in o 'neill 's report . " italy 's contribution to the world economy has been continually shrinking for a while now , but at g8 summits , italy is still a participatory to the official agreements about how the world functions today , " he said . lack of binding decisions like o 'neill , many others see the g8 as irrelevant and some would even love to see it dismantled immediately .
according to its critics , the g8 's lack of administrative structure and binding rules mean that although leaders broach issues such as debt relief and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , there are few concrete achievements . for o 'neill , the g8 members represent the world as it was more than 60 years ago and do n't reflect the current situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is predicted to overtake germany as the world 's third largest economy by 2008 " the worst thing is that the wrong participants are sitting at the g8 table , " said o 'neill .

the alternative would have been to hold a meeting of the 20 leading heads of states based on the model of the g20 industrial nations forum formed in 1999 . according to hajnal , such a structure would make it more difficult to achieve real results , however , and is n't being considered as a real possibility . even economist o 'neill does n't want to see an increase in the number of g8 members .
he would prefer the introduction of rules regulating who has the right to sit at the table . " we should learn from soccer , and have a permanent league in which only the current world economic powers are allowed to play , " o 'neill said .

but in the lead up to the 2007 g8 summit in germany , some economists are again raising the question of whether the right members are in the g8 club . just thinking about the current g8 members - germany , france , italy , great britain , russia , japan , the united states and canada - puts renowned economist jim o 'neill in a bad mood . " i have no idea why a country like italy is allowed to continue to be in the club , " said o 'neill , who is head of global economic research at investment bank goldman sachs . o 'neill is author of an influential report which argues that brazil , russia , india and china - the so-called brics - could become the four dominant economies by 2050 .
italy is noticeably absent in o 'neill 's report . " italy 's contribution to the world economy has been continually shrinking for a while now , but at g8 summits , italy is still a participatory to the official agreements about how the world functions today , " he said . lack of binding decisions like o 'neill , many others see the g8 as irrelevant and some would even love to see it dismantled immediately .
according to its critics , the g8 's lack of administrative structure and binding rules mean that although leaders broach issues such as debt relief and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , there are few concrete achievements . for o 'neill , the g8 members represent the world as it was more than 60 years ago and do n't reflect the current situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is predicted to overtake germany as the world 's third largest economy by 2008 " the worst thing is that the wrong participants are sitting at the g8 table , " said o 'neill .
" it is a somewhat simplistic idea to want to rule the world according to some post-war schematic , " he said . according to him , by the middle of the century , the brics are likely to have more economic weight that the current g7 countries -lrb- g8 without russia -rrb- put together .
the economy of china alone in 2050 is likely to be 20 times bigger than it is today and will have overtaken the usa as the world 's biggest , o 'neill predicted . changing world economy russia was admitted to the group of eight in 1997 , becoming the first new member since canada came on board in 1976 .
critics like o 'neill say the g8 ca n't continue to ignore the dramatic changes to the global economy . after all , it was n't until the gleneagles summit in 2005 that the heads of states agreed to hold a separate set of meetings with ministers from emerging economies of china , india , brazil , south africa and mexico , now known as the g8 + 5 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , five developing countries attended the g8 environment ministers meeting for the first time peter hajnal , an academic with the g8 research group at canada 's toronto university thinks this was an intelligent decision .
the alternative would have been to hold a meeting of the 20 leading heads of states based on the model of the g20 industrial nations forum formed in 1999 . according to hajnal , such a structure would make it more difficult to achieve real results , however , and is n't being considered as a real possibility . even economist o 'neill does n't want to see an increase in the number of g8 members .
he would prefer the introduction of rules regulating who has the right to sit at the table . " we should learn from soccer , and have a permanent league in which only the current world economic powers are allowed to play , " o 'neill said .
" you would be able to advance into and dropped from the league . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the g8 look to soccer for inspiration ?
o 'neill has even thought of an umpire - the international monetary fund , which could use economic data to determine the lucky eight . is g8 membership desirable ? this suggestion is n't an option for hajnal , who pointed out that not all bric countries were angling for g8 membership . china has " continually emphasized that it does n't want to belong for the moment " because it was " profiting economically " by being a developing country , hajnal said . however , according to hajnal , the g8 's very informality could well come in useful in the future by making it easier for the g8 to adapt to changes in the world 's power balance . " this means there is a lot of flexibility to quickly take on new members , " hajnal said . richard a. fuchs -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thousands of g8 opponents protest in german cities over 6,000 protestors across germany took to the streets wednesday night to demonstrate against a series of raids on anti-globalization organizations ahead of the upcoming g8 summit on the baltic coast .

it 's a chacteristic that trash pleases trash management companies . separating trash for recycling is no easy matter .
for one thing , it 's sometimes difficult discerning whether the trash in your hand is actually packaging , glass , paper , hazardous or organic waste .
what bin do you use when packaging includes both cardboard and plastic ? but after you 've gone through the trouble of washing your hands of your many types of rubbish , you can at least know it 's worth it - economically , as well as for the planet . dealing in trash makes good business sense .
waste management has become a major industry in germany - with 250,000 employees in the sector , and the rubbish people throw away also generates turnover of 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 67.7 billion -rrb- . so what 's the point ? " i do try to recycle , " said one woman .
" i put paper in the blue recycling bin , yoghurt containers and tin foil in the yellow bins for packaging , and we also recycle bottles . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yellow bags hopefully carrying " green dot " packaging another woman said she 's made a conscious choice not to throw plastic in the packaging recycling bin . " you 're supposed to clean out yoghurt containers , but that uses a lot of water , and i do n't think it 's a good idea to waste so much , " she said .
" besides , people say anyway that everything is thrown back together again and then burned at the incineration plant . " in the western german city of cologne , for example , the packaging thrown into recycling bins lands in the hands of remondis , a collection company , then taken to a facility , where the so-called " dsd " trash is sorted .
visiting the remondis plant , you 'll find a mound of trash consisting of yoghurts cups , plastic wrapping and aluminum cans . dsd stands for duales system deutschland -lrb- dual system germany -rrb- , a company established in 1990 . in 1991 , a special german packaging ordinance came into force and required product manufacturers and vendors to take back packaging once the products have been used and arranged for their recycling .
dsd organizes this system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how to sort your rubbish in the berlin subway ?
packaging marked what is called the grüner punkt or green dot is part of this system .
only packaging with the green dot is supposed to be placed either in special yellow plastic bags placed outside for pickup , or placed in yellow recycling containers . refuse companies say that in international comparisons , germans are number one in recycling their packaging .
but the figures are disputed . according to dsd , largely a monopoly in the recycling sector , each consumer in germany recycles around 76 kilograms -lrb- 167 pounds -rrb- of packaging a year . critics say that translates into about 30 items of packaging per day , which they claim is unrealistic .
they estimate that on the average , each person recycles around 26 kilograms of dsd trash annually . what 's a recyclable wrapping ? but does everyone separate properly ?
do they put only " green dot " product wrappings in the yellow bags and boxes ? jürgen lennertz , director of the remondis plant in cologne , said that " people throw from 30 to 50 percent of packaging without the green dot into the yellow containers . " what is thrown in there is everything from plastic pots for plants to garden hoses .
udo koch , remondis operations manager , hit the point home with the rhetorical question : " now is that packaging ? " koch also said people also throw frying pans , cameras and even dirty diapers into the yellow recycling bins . the good news is that modern sorting machines can recognize and categorize about 90 percent of rubbish , leaving about 5 percent to be sorted by hand . the bigger picture so machines do help germans be international leaders in divvying up their trash .
koch said there is a reason for it all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ha schult has made art out of trash " i think a lot of people are thinking about the climate right now , " he said .
" the amount of energy necessary to recycle product wrappings is much less than what you need to produce the packaging in the first place . " critics , however , disagree .
they say more energy is needed to recycle smaller wrapping items than to generate them . either way , around 50 percent to 70 percent of the " yellow bin content " can be recycled . the rest , which can not is incinerated , also generates energy .
the cologne-based avg , a waste management and incineration company , said it could pass along 400,000 megawatts of power and 230,000 tons of steam to the energy industry in 2006 resulting from waste incineration . tuba tuncak -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a recycled bottle story : from drink container to winter sweater ever wonder what happens to all those plastic bottles the germans seem to be perpetually recycling ?

" germany had a lack of manpower because many men were in the wehrmacht -lrb- nazi military -rrb- , " said jakub deka , a warsaw-based planning coordinator commissioned by the polish-german reconciliation foundation to plan the new exhibition , in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandradio . lingering cause of tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some victims of forced labor have received financial compensation " they simply looked for labor in the conquered areas - not just in poland , but all over europe - and took it back to germany , " he said .
an estimated 3 million poles were subjected to forced labor under the nazi regime in germany following the invasion of poland in 1939 , which makes it a particularly sore topic in german-polish relations .
those capable of working were sent to munitions factories and coal mines to support the war effort , while children underwent a process of " germanization " in special schools .
treatment in the camps was harsh , and prisoners were often beaten and even shot for not working up to standard or trying to escape . promoting reconciliation the exhibit 's opening in germany was attended by survivors from wartime labor camps in flensburg , frankfurt , wolfsburg and berlin .
polish-born josef kuzba , a prisoner at the sachsenhausen concentration camp from 1940 to 1945 , has been discussing his experiences with children from the city 's archenhold gymnasium and sophie scholl oberschule . " the youngsters seemed well briefed about world war ii , " he said .
" it was a pleasure talking to them . " asked if he was apprehensive about visiting germany nowadays , he replied : " no , not at all .
i 'm a frequent visitor and have good relations with friends here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuzba talks about his experiences in sachsenhausen with school children kuzba , who was born in pomerania , and now lives in warsaw , said he had been active in promoting polish-german reconciliation for years . " remembrance is one thing , reconciliation another , " kuzba said .
" both are important for our nations . " mariusz muszynski , chairman of the foundation for polish-german reconciliation , wrote in the 205-page exhibit catalog that no other event in german-polish history had ever proved so burdensome to relations as the nazi-led invasion of poland . " material payments can never make up for the sorrow and suffering caused victims - but they were seen as a symbolic gesture of fairness and respect and a contributory step towards a better understanding between the two nations , " said muszynski . millions have been paid worldwide to german slave and forced labor victims following the enactment of a law by the german parliament and the creation of a " remembrance , responsibility , future " foundation . berlin first stop on german tour original nazi documents , photographs , biographies and a documentary film make up the exhibit , which will remain in berlin until mid-october before it continues on to other german cities .
it has already been viewed by 80,000 visitors during its tour in poland .
the camp where the exhibit is currently housed was built in 1943 by albert speer , nazi minister of infrastructure and munitions , for over 2,000 workers .
it is one of 3,000 such nazi camps built in the berlin area and one of only few nazi labor camps remaining . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament condemns chinese labor camps , irks beijing amid protests from beijing , the german parliament thursday condemned chinese labor camps and called for special labels on goods produced in labor camps .

she changes her name to ellis de vries , dyes her hair blond and joins the dutch resistance movement .

the bribes were meant to secure gas-turbine contracts valued at 450 million euros .

russia of today is not the russia of the 90s , said expert alexander rahr . alexander rahr is a russia expert from the german society for foreign affairs , a berlin-based research group .
dw-radio : do the ongoing disputes between russia and the eu make you pessimistic about the prospects for any breakthroughs at the upcoming summit ?
alexander rahr : in the short run , i 'm very skeptical and pessimistic about the possibility of improving relations between russia and the european union , but of course one has to be more optimistic for the long run .
but presently , there is talk of a new cold war between the eu and russia .
one of the main disputes is about the power that moscow wields because of its massive reserves of oil and gas and its control over the transport of energy supplies from central asia .
how do you think this issue will be addressed at the summit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander rahr i think that this is a temporary situation .
the situation in general will stabilize and improve because russia needs its european partners and the european market in order to sell its goods .
it can not sit on its oil and get the sources alone .
it has to sell it .
on the other hand , the west also has to understand that the russia of today is not the russia of the 90s .
russia also has some new powers which we have to take into account .
what do you think russia 's expectations for the upcoming summit are ?
what does it hope to achieve ?
russia itself has a wait-and-see attitude .
it wants to have good cooperation with the european union , but it does not want to tolerate criticism of its interior policies .
russia says it wants a different kind of cooperation with the european union - not the kind of cooperation on mutual values , which the european union demands .
russia wants a purely pragmatic , business-like cooperation .
one of the main issues is the current state of human rights in russia .
some have complained that the eu has not protested enough against some of the human rights abuses in russia .
do you think this issue will be raised at the summit ?
this issue has been raised at every summit for many years .
but the fact that the problems are being raised will not lead to any solution .
russia will listen , but it will say , " the west does not understand us .
we have completely different problems and you , the west , should choose whether you want us as a pragmatic partner or whether you want to teach us democracy . "

when the dutch-jewish singer tried to flee with her family into liberated belgium in 1944 , the escapees are betrayed and shot by the nazis . rachel , played by dutch actress carice van houten , is the only survivor .
she changes her name to ellis de vries , dyes her hair blond and joins the dutch resistance movement .
in one decisive scene , rachel - fleeing from the gestapo - boards a train with two suitcases full of weapons and finds herself in the same car as the head of the ss in the hague , ludwig müntze . " beautiful women should n't carry heavy suitcases , " says müntze , played by german actor sebastian koch , who also had a leading role in this year 's oscar winner , " the lives of others . " when rachel is assigned to spy on the nazi , who has long since broken with the regime 's ideology , he uses the contact with her to try and make an arrangement with the resistance .
the war is drawing to an end and the collapse of the nazi regime is imminent . ' a living cinema legend ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now back in europe , paul verhoeven began his hollywood career in the mid-1980s actually , sebastian koch had n't wanted to play any more nazis .
" but them comes paul verhoeven , who is like a living cinema legend for me , " said koch .
" he always made films that changed the way films are made .
he 's a person who always has to explore new territory , and that 's something we have in common . " verhoeven depicts the conflicting human aspects of all the characters in " black book , " whether nazis , jews or dutch .
for the viewer , the lines between good and evil are intentionally blurred . he portrays the dutch resistance movement , for example , as being a sometimes volatile mix of nationalists , communists and christian pacifists , which is gnawed at by latent anti-semitism . a critical view of war-time society surprisingly , this critical view of the dutch resistance did not provoke as much criticism in the netherlands as might have been expected . " not everything was as heroic and wonderful as we thought after the war , " said the filmmaker .
" statistics show how the dutch behaved during the war .
eighty to 90 percent of the population remained neutral .
some hid or protected themselves , but most people were not actively involved in resistance . " verhoeven showed long ago with films like " turkish delight " and " basic instinct " that he knew how to master all of the hollywood tricks .
and with a budget 18 million euros -lrb- $ 24 million -rrb- for " black book , " he had access to anything he could have wanted in this bag of tricks . black book opens in germany but what makes the film impressive - and polarizing - is the way verhoeven plays with stereotypes , presenting human beings with strengths and weaknesses on both sides of the fence .
starting this week , german audiences will form their opinions on the film that has already provoked over a million viewers in the netherlands . " black book " is already available in english in the us , the uk and canada .

a two-day informal meeting of european drug commissioners begins in berlin monday , two days after the interior ministers of the eu 's six largest countries agreed on closer cooperation with africa in the fight against drug smuggling from south america at a meeting in venice .
the venice meeting followed the three-day international drug enforcement conference in madrid last week which was hosted by the spanish government and the us drug enforcement agency -lrb- dea -rrb- , washington ’ s top anti-narcotics agency .
the talks on saturday were attended by eu justice commissioner franco frattini , the interior ministers of germany , britain , poland , france , spain and italy , and united states secretary of homeland security michael chertoff .
all supported the idea of sending european investigators to west africa as part of a new drive against the smugglers .
" we have agreed to cooperate with african countries in the effort to block the new routes of colombian cocaine to europe , " said spanish interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba .
the initiative to open a new front against the traffickers coming through africa comes hot on the heels of an agreement to set up a new european body that will share intelligence and coordinate police seizures of cocaine and cannabis on the high seas .
coordinated by britain , france , ireland , italy , portugal , spain and the netherlands , the body will be officially established in lisbon later this year .

when the dutch-jewish singer tried to flee with her family into liberated belgium in 1944 , the escapees are betrayed and shot by the nazis . rachel , played by dutch actress carice van houten , is the only survivor .
she changes her name to ellis de vries , dyes her hair blond and joins the dutch resistance movement .
in one decisive scene , rachel - fleeing from the gestapo - boards a train with two suitcases full of weapons and finds herself in the same car as the head of the ss in the hague , ludwig müntze . " beautiful women should n't carry heavy suitcases , " says müntze , played by german actor sebastian koch , who also had a leading role in this year 's oscar winner , " the lives of others . " when rachel is assigned to spy on the nazi , who has long since broken with the regime 's ideology , he uses the contact with her to try and make an arrangement with the resistance .
the war is drawing to an end and the collapse of the nazi regime is imminent . ' a living cinema legend ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now back in europe , paul verhoeven began his hollywood career in the mid-1980s actually , sebastian koch had n't wanted to play any more nazis .
" but them comes paul verhoeven , who is like a living cinema legend for me , " said koch .
" he always made films that changed the way films are made .
he 's a person who always has to explore new territory , and that 's something we have in common . " verhoeven depicts the conflicting human aspects of all the characters in " black book , " whether nazis , jews or dutch .
for the viewer , the lines between good and evil are intentionally blurred . he portrays the dutch resistance movement , for example , as being a sometimes volatile mix of nationalists , communists and christian pacifists , which is gnawed at by latent anti-semitism . a critical view of war-time society surprisingly , this critical view of the dutch resistance did not provoke as much criticism in the netherlands as might have been expected . " not everything was as heroic and wonderful as we thought after the war , " said the filmmaker .
" statistics show how the dutch behaved during the war .
eighty to 90 percent of the population remained neutral .
some hid or protected themselves , but most people were not actively involved in resistance . " verhoeven showed long ago with films like " turkish delight " and " basic instinct " that he knew how to master all of the hollywood tricks .
and with a budget 18 million euros -lrb- $ 24 million -rrb- for " black book , " he had access to anything he could have wanted in this bag of tricks . black book opens in germany but what makes the film impressive - and polarizing - is the way verhoeven plays with stereotypes , presenting human beings with strengths and weaknesses on both sides of the fence .
starting this week , german audiences will form their opinions on the film that has already provoked over a million viewers in the netherlands . " black book " is already available in english in the us , the uk and canada .

" we know that the russians are getting hot and bothered as well . " german foreign minster frank-walter steinmeier , however , said it would be impossible to predetermine exactly what the eu-russia summit results would be . " the situation is complicated but particularly in time of difficulties is important to talk , " he said before the preparatory meeting of eu ministers .
" we are going to try right up to the summit to resolve the conflict concerning polish meat .
i ca n't say whether we 'll be successful . " steinmeier added that neither the eu nor russia could afford to stop working together . " i am convinced the eu needs russia to solve international conflicts and russia is going to continue to be dependent on europe , so i am absolutely sure that on both sides reason must prevail , " he said . analysts however are skeptical that things will calm down . " neither the rice talks nor the samara meeting will bring any concrete steps to overcoming disagreements , " said yevgeny volk , an analyst for the heritage foundation .

" we know that the russians are getting hot and bothered as well . " german foreign minster frank-walter steinmeier , however , said it would be impossible to predetermine exactly what the eu-russia summit results would be . " the situation is complicated but particularly in time of difficulties is important to talk , " he said before the preparatory meeting of eu ministers .
" we are going to try right up to the summit to resolve the conflict concerning polish meat .
i ca n't say whether we 'll be successful . " steinmeier added that neither the eu nor russia could afford to stop working together . " i am convinced the eu needs russia to solve international conflicts and russia is going to continue to be dependent on europe , so i am absolutely sure that on both sides reason must prevail , " he said . analysts however are skeptical that things will calm down .

" germany had a lack of manpower because many men were in the wehrmacht -lrb- nazi military -rrb- , " said jakub deka , a warsaw-based planning coordinator commissioned by the polish-german reconciliation foundation to plan the new exhibition , in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandradio . lingering cause of tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some victims of forced labor have received financial compensation " they simply looked for labor in the conquered areas - not just in poland , but all over europe - and took it back to germany , " he said .

" material payments can never make up for the sorrow and suffering caused victims - but they were seen as a symbolic gesture of fairness and respect and a contributory step towards a better understanding between the two nations , " said muszynski . millions have been paid worldwide to german slave and forced labor victims following the enactment of a law by the german parliament and the creation of a " remembrance , responsibility , future " foundation . berlin first stop on german tour original nazi documents , photographs , biographies and a documentary film make up the exhibit , which will remain in berlin until mid-october before it continues on to other german cities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.05.2007 " russia wants pragmatic , business-like cooperation " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia needs eu partnership , but does n't want criticism on domestic affairs , said rahr russian and eu delegates meet this week as relations remain taught on issues like independence for kosovo , human rights and the us missile shield .
russia of today is not the russia of the 90s , said expert alexander rahr . alexander rahr is a russia expert from the german society for foreign affairs , a berlin-based research group .
dw-radio : do the ongoing disputes between russia and the eu make you pessimistic about the prospects for any breakthroughs at the upcoming summit ?
alexander rahr : in the short run , i 'm very skeptical and pessimistic about the possibility of improving relations between russia and the european union , but of course one has to be more optimistic for the long run .
but presently , there is talk of a new cold war between the eu and russia .
one of the main disputes is about the power that moscow wields because of its massive reserves of oil and gas and its control over the transport of energy supplies from central asia .
how do you think this issue will be addressed at the summit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander rahr i think that this is a temporary situation .
the situation in general will stabilize and improve because russia needs its european partners and the european market in order to sell its goods .
it can not sit on its oil and get the sources alone .
it has to sell it .
on the other hand , the west also has to understand that the russia of today is not the russia of the 90s .
russia also has some new powers which we have to take into account .
what do you think russia 's expectations for the upcoming summit are ?
what does it hope to achieve ?
russia itself has a wait-and-see attitude .
it wants to have good cooperation with the european union , but it does not want to tolerate criticism of its interior policies .
russia says it wants a different kind of cooperation with the european union - not the kind of cooperation on mutual values , which the european union demands .
russia wants a purely pragmatic , business-like cooperation .
one of the main issues is the current state of human rights in russia .
some have complained that the eu has not protested enough against some of the human rights abuses in russia .
do you think this issue will be raised at the summit ?
this issue has been raised at every summit for many years .
but the fact that the problems are being raised will not lead to any solution .

russia of today is not the russia of the 90s , said expert alexander rahr . alexander rahr is a russia expert from the german society for foreign affairs , a berlin-based research group .
dw-radio : do the ongoing disputes between russia and the eu make you pessimistic about the prospects for any breakthroughs at the upcoming summit ?
alexander rahr : in the short run , i 'm very skeptical and pessimistic about the possibility of improving relations between russia and the european union , but of course one has to be more optimistic for the long run .
but presently , there is talk of a new cold war between the eu and russia .
one of the main disputes is about the power that moscow wields because of its massive reserves of oil and gas and its control over the transport of energy supplies from central asia .
how do you think this issue will be addressed at the summit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander rahr i think that this is a temporary situation .
the situation in general will stabilize and improve because russia needs its european partners and the european market in order to sell its goods .
it can not sit on its oil and get the sources alone .
it has to sell it .
on the other hand , the west also has to understand that the russia of today is not the russia of the 90s .
russia also has some new powers which we have to take into account .
what do you think russia 's expectations for the upcoming summit are ?
what does it hope to achieve ?
russia itself has a wait-and-see attitude .
it wants to have good cooperation with the european union , but it does not want to tolerate criticism of its interior policies .
russia says it wants a different kind of cooperation with the european union - not the kind of cooperation on mutual values , which the european union demands .
russia wants a purely pragmatic , business-like cooperation .
one of the main issues is the current state of human rights in russia .
some have complained that the eu has not protested enough against some of the human rights abuses in russia .
do you think this issue will be raised at the summit ?
this issue has been raised at every summit for many years .
but the fact that the problems are being raised will not lead to any solution .
russia will listen , but it will say , " the west does not understand us .
we have completely different problems and you , the west , should choose whether you want us as a pragmatic partner or whether you want to teach us democracy . "

a two-day informal meeting of european drug commissioners begins in berlin monday , two days after the interior ministers of the eu 's six largest countries agreed on closer cooperation with africa in the fight against drug smuggling from south america at a meeting in venice .
the venice meeting followed the three-day international drug enforcement conference in madrid last week which was hosted by the spanish government and the us drug enforcement agency -lrb- dea -rrb- , washington ’ s top anti-narcotics agency .
the talks on saturday were attended by eu justice commissioner franco frattini , the interior ministers of germany , britain , poland , france , spain and italy , and united states secretary of homeland security michael chertoff .
all supported the idea of sending european investigators to west africa as part of a new drive against the smugglers .
" we have agreed to cooperate with african countries in the effort to block the new routes of colombian cocaine to europe , " said spanish interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba .
the initiative to open a new front against the traffickers coming through africa comes hot on the heels of an agreement to set up a new european body that will share intelligence and coordinate police seizures of cocaine and cannabis on the high seas .
coordinated by britain , france , ireland , italy , portugal , spain and the netherlands , the body will be officially established in lisbon later this year .
europe offering high profit margins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of latin america 's output lands on european mirrors roughly 80 percent of cocaine from latin america that was destined for markets outside of the united states in 2005 was bound for europe , according to dea estimates .
international drug trafficking rings have been drawn to the european market because of the higher prices paid for cocaine on the continent .
last year wholesale prices for cocaine in the european union ranged between 28,000 and 56,600 euros -lrb- $ 38,000 and $ 77,000 -rrb- per kilogram compared to between $ 9,000 and $ 40,000 in the united states where the supply is higher , according to the dea .
" the potential for this high profit margin has increasingly lured colombian traffickers to european markets , " dea director of operations michael braun said during his testimony before the us congress last year .
africa is increasingly being used by criminal gangs as a hub for shipping latin american cocaine and asian heroin into europe .
consumption of cocaine and hashish is also on the rise in africa , spanish secretary of state for security antonio camacho said at the international drug enforcement conference on thursday .
" this is an issue which is very worrying because of its regional and global implications , " he said .
spain the coke gateway to the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coke ending up in the eu invariably comes through spain trafficking groups are taking advantage of weak governments in african nations as well as their historical ties to europe to smuggle drugs into the continent .
spain has become the main gateway for latin american cocaine and north african hashish into europe and has set up its own robust fight against drug smuggling .
spanish officials seized over 40 tons of cocaine last year , a record amount and more than any other nation in the world except for colombia , the united states and venezuela , camacho said .
" spain has a serious problem regarding rising drug consumption and i think it is in the interest of us all to cooperate more to fight drug trafficking , which in the case of colombia is totally linked to guerrilla groups and violence , " colombian defense minister juan manuel santos told reporters in madrid .
" cocaine is surging in europe at levels similar to what america experienced in the 1980s , " the head of the us drug enforcement administration , karen tandy , said at the three-day event in madrid .
low costs drive high consumption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european coke consumption is at a historical high around 10 million europeans , or over three percent of all adults , have used cocaine at least once in their lives , a historically high figure , according to the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- .
britain and spain posted the highest rates of use , with over four percent of adults reporting having consumed the drug over the past year compared to an average of around one percent of adults in all of europe .
use is concentrated among young adults , especially men , in urban areas .
a substantial drop in price has contributed to the increase in usage .
the price of cocaine on europe 's streets fell by 22 percent between 1999 and 2004 , according to emcdda .
the supply of cocaine in europe has increased since the late 1990s leading to lower prices and this , combined with its association to a supposedly glamorous lifestyle , is fueling its growing use , drug experts say .
" cocaine is very much associated with success , urban lifestyles , a party atmosphere , " emcdda analyst julian vicente told afp , before adding cocaine was now the second most used illegal drug in europe after cannabis . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report paints mixed picture of german drug and alcohol use germany 's annual report on drugs and addiction was released this week showing a overall decrease in drug-related deaths , but alarming data on prescription drug addiction and youth drinking .

but in the lead up to the 2007 g8 summit in germany , some economists are again raising the question of whether the right members are in the g8 club . just thinking about the current g8 members - germany , france , italy , great britain , russia , japan , the united states and canada - puts renowned economist jim o 'neill in a bad mood . " i have no idea why a country like italy is allowed to continue to be in the club , " said o 'neill , who is head of global economic research at investment bank goldman sachs . o 'neill is author of an influential report which argues that brazil , russia , india and china - the so-called brics - could become the four dominant economies by 2050 .
italy is noticeably absent in o 'neill 's report . " italy 's contribution to the world economy has been continually shrinking for a while now , but at g8 summits , italy is still a participatory to the official agreements about how the world functions today , " he said . lack of binding decisions like o 'neill , many others see the g8 as irrelevant and some would even love to see it dismantled immediately .
according to its critics , the g8 's lack of administrative structure and binding rules mean that although leaders broach issues such as debt relief and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , there are few concrete achievements . for o 'neill , the g8 members represent the world as it was more than 60 years ago and do n't reflect the current situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is predicted to overtake germany as the world 's third largest economy by 2008 " the worst thing is that the wrong participants are sitting at the g8 table , " said o 'neill .
" it is a somewhat simplistic idea to want to rule the world according to some post-war schematic , " he said . according to him , by the middle of the century , the brics are likely to have more economic weight that the current g7 countries -lrb- g8 without russia -rrb- put together .

critics like o 'neill say the g8 ca n't continue to ignore the dramatic changes to the global economy . after all , it was n't until the gleneagles summit in 2005 that the heads of states agreed to hold a separate set of meetings with ministers from emerging economies of china , india , brazil , south africa and mexico , now known as the g8 + 5 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , five developing countries attended the g8 environment ministers meeting for the first time peter hajnal , an academic with the g8 research group at canada 's toronto university thinks this was an intelligent decision .
the alternative would have been to hold a meeting of the 20 leading heads of states based on the model of the g20 industrial nations forum formed in 1999 . according to hajnal , such a structure would make it more difficult to achieve real results , however , and is n't being considered as a real possibility . even economist o 'neill does n't want to see an increase in the number of g8 members .
he would prefer the introduction of rules regulating who has the right to sit at the table . " we should learn from soccer , and have a permanent league in which only the current world economic powers are allowed to play , " o 'neill said .
" you would be able to advance into and dropped from the league . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the g8 look to soccer for inspiration ?
o 'neill has even thought of an umpire - the international monetary fund , which could use economic data to determine the lucky eight . is g8 membership desirable ? this suggestion is n't an option for hajnal , who pointed out that not all bric countries were angling for g8 membership . china has " continually emphasized that it does n't want to belong for the moment " because it was " profiting economically " by being a developing country , hajnal said . however , according to hajnal , the g8 's very informality could well come in useful in the future by making it easier for the g8 to adapt to changes in the world 's power balance .

do n't leave bonn without him großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven was born in bonn in 1770 , but lived most of his life in vienna visitors to bonn are certain to go home with a beethoven souvenir .
after all , the former capital has learned to make the most of its connection to its famous son . they come from all over the world and have one thing in common - they 've come to follow in the footsteps of ludwig van beethoven .
in bonn , where the composer lived from his birth in 1770 until the age of 22 , that 's not hard to do .
beethoven is practically everywhere - visitors are bound to come across his serious-looking profile on everything from suspenders and umbrellas to ball-point pens and chocolate truffles .
the larger-than-life statue of beethoven on bonn 's central münster square , across from the main post office , has long since become an important landmark in the city .
in fact , the monument 's consecration in 1845 , timed to coincide with the composer 's 75th birthday , was celebrated with a three-day music festival organized by none other than franz liszt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this monument was erected for beethoven 's 75th birthday " it definitely belongs in my germany photo album , " said tourist xianguo zhong from shanghai while posing for the camera together with the colossal composer .
beethoven sells every year , some 500,000 tourists and business travellers , many of them from asia , stop in bonn .
along with bonn 's many museums , beethoven is one of the former capital 's most significant attractions .

each year , around 100,000 pilgrims visit the house on bonngasse , where they can view some of the composer 's instruments , hand-written correspondence and original manuscripts - and take home reproductions of the " moonlight sonata " or " für elise " manuscripts printed on silk scarves and porcelain plates .
particularly enthusiastic beethoven fans can even take home a bit of the composer himself - at least from the shoulders up .
visitors can choose from 20 different types of beethoven busts measuring between five and 55 centimeters -lrb- two to 22 inches -rrb- tall and costing up to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,350 -rrb- .
the gift shop 's best-sellers , however , are the cds of the composer 's music .
they even offer a recording that simulates beethoven 's hearing loss with changes to the volume and sound of the music .

beethoven is practically everywhere - visitors are bound to come across his serious-looking profile on everything from suspenders and umbrellas to ball-point pens and chocolate truffles .
the larger-than-life statue of beethoven on bonn 's central münster square , across from the main post office , has long since become an important landmark in the city .
in fact , the monument 's consecration in 1845 , timed to coincide with the composer 's 75th birthday , was celebrated with a three-day music festival organized by none other than franz liszt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this monument was erected for beethoven 's 75th birthday " it definitely belongs in my germany photo album , " said tourist xianguo zhong from shanghai while posing for the camera together with the colossal composer .

the annual beethoven festival , in particular , draws the crowds .
it has its roots in franz liszt 's 1845 festival and is a special highlight for music lovers from all over the world .
bonn tourism officials have quickly learned that , quite simply , beethoven sells .
in addition to her picture in front of the statue , xianguo zhong went home with a t-shirt with a picture of the composer on it .
" in china , every kid knows who beethoven is , " she said .
" we read stories about him in elementary school . "
souvenirs galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house attracts around 100,000 visitors per year the museum gift shop in the composer 's birth house has over 800 beethoven souvenirs on offer , including beer glasses , thimbles , playing cards , stationary and ties all printed with a variety of beethoven motives .
each year , around 100,000 pilgrims visit the house on bonngasse , where they can view some of the composer 's instruments , hand-written correspondence and original manuscripts - and take home reproductions of the " moonlight sonata " or " für elise " manuscripts printed on silk scarves and porcelain plates .
particularly enthusiastic beethoven fans can even take home a bit of the composer himself - at least from the shoulders up .
visitors can choose from 20 different types of beethoven busts measuring between five and 55 centimeters -lrb- two to 22 inches -rrb- tall and costing up to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,350 -rrb- .
the gift shop 's best-sellers , however , are the cds of the composer 's music .
they even offer a recording that simulates beethoven 's hearing loss with changes to the volume and sound of the music .
the birth house also holds a substantial beethoven archive and library .

but not two of germany 's leading soccer stars , who sued germany 's leading sex shop chain for doing just that .
now the sex shop has to pay up . as soccer mania started building to fever pitch in the run-up to last year 's world cup in germany , sex shop chain beate uhse thought it would take advantage of the near deification of some of the country 's national team soccer players .
it marketed two vibrators under the names " michael b. " and " olli k , " which appear to be clear references to michael ballack , now a midfielder at chelsea , and oliver kahn , bayern munich 's goalkeeper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack , sex symbol ?
maybe ...
while probably many women , and more than a few men , instantly felt an erotic frisson at the thought of taking one of the two athletes to bed , the soccer stars themselves were not amused .
they took beate uhse to court , charging them with unauthorized use of their names .
the two men are not averse to making product endorsements ; they just did n't want to do it for free , or maybe for a sex toy .
just a coincidence , really for its part , beate uhse has always insisted the company was innocent .
the vibrators , 17 cm -lrb- 6.7 inches -rrb- long and advertised as " cuddly " and " cheeky , " were not modelled on the stars ' own , er , equipment .

a two-day informal meeting of european drug commissioners begins in berlin monday , two days after the interior ministers of the eu 's six largest countries agreed on closer cooperation with africa in the fight against drug smuggling from south america at a meeting in venice .
the venice meeting followed the three-day international drug enforcement conference in madrid last week which was hosted by the spanish government and the us drug enforcement agency -lrb- dea -rrb- , washington ’ s top anti-narcotics agency .
the talks on saturday were attended by eu justice commissioner franco frattini , the interior ministers of germany , britain , poland , france , spain and italy , and united states secretary of homeland security michael chertoff .
all supported the idea of sending european investigators to west africa as part of a new drive against the smugglers .
" we have agreed to cooperate with african countries in the effort to block the new routes of colombian cocaine to europe , " said spanish interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba .
the initiative to open a new front against the traffickers coming through africa comes hot on the heels of an agreement to set up a new european body that will share intelligence and coordinate police seizures of cocaine and cannabis on the high seas .
coordinated by britain , france , ireland , italy , portugal , spain and the netherlands , the body will be officially established in lisbon later this year .
europe offering high profit margins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of latin america 's output lands on european mirrors roughly 80 percent of cocaine from latin america that was destined for markets outside of the united states in 2005 was bound for europe , according to dea estimates .
international drug trafficking rings have been drawn to the european market because of the higher prices paid for cocaine on the continent .
last year wholesale prices for cocaine in the european union ranged between 28,000 and 56,600 euros -lrb- $ 38,000 and $ 77,000 -rrb- per kilogram compared to between $ 9,000 and $ 40,000 in the united states where the supply is higher , according to the dea .
" the potential for this high profit margin has increasingly lured colombian traffickers to european markets , " dea director of operations michael braun said during his testimony before the us congress last year .
africa is increasingly being used by criminal gangs as a hub for shipping latin american cocaine and asian heroin into europe .
consumption of cocaine and hashish is also on the rise in africa , spanish secretary of state for security antonio camacho said at the international drug enforcement conference on thursday .
" this is an issue which is very worrying because of its regional and global implications , " he said .
spain the coke gateway to the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coke ending up in the eu invariably comes through spain trafficking groups are taking advantage of weak governments in african nations as well as their historical ties to europe to smuggle drugs into the continent .
spain has become the main gateway for latin american cocaine and north african hashish into europe and has set up its own robust fight against drug smuggling .
spanish officials seized over 40 tons of cocaine last year , a record amount and more than any other nation in the world except for colombia , the united states and venezuela , camacho said .
" spain has a serious problem regarding rising drug consumption and i think it is in the interest of us all to cooperate more to fight drug trafficking , which in the case of colombia is totally linked to guerrilla groups and violence , " colombian defense minister juan manuel santos told reporters in madrid .
" cocaine is surging in europe at levels similar to what america experienced in the 1980s , " the head of the us drug enforcement administration , karen tandy , said at the three-day event in madrid .
low costs drive high consumption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european coke consumption is at a historical high around 10 million europeans , or over three percent of all adults , have used cocaine at least once in their lives , a historically high figure , according to the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- .
britain and spain posted the highest rates of use , with over four percent of adults reporting having consumed the drug over the past year compared to an average of around one percent of adults in all of europe .
use is concentrated among young adults , especially men , in urban areas .
a substantial drop in price has contributed to the increase in usage .
the price of cocaine on europe 's streets fell by 22 percent between 1999 and 2004 , according to emcdda .
the supply of cocaine in europe has increased since the late 1990s leading to lower prices and this , combined with its association to a supposedly glamorous lifestyle , is fueling its growing use , drug experts say .
" cocaine is very much associated with success , urban lifestyles , a party atmosphere , " emcdda analyst julian vicente told afp , before adding cocaine was now the second most used illegal drug in europe after cannabis . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report paints mixed picture of german drug and alcohol use germany 's annual report on drugs and addiction was released this week showing a overall decrease in drug-related deaths , but alarming data on prescription drug addiction and youth drinking .

" we know that the russians are getting hot and bothered as well . " german foreign minster frank-walter steinmeier , however , said it would be impossible to predetermine exactly what the eu-russia summit results would be . " the situation is complicated but particularly in time of difficulties is important to talk , " he said before the preparatory meeting of eu ministers .
" we are going to try right up to the summit to resolve the conflict concerning polish meat .
i ca n't say whether we 'll be successful . " steinmeier added that neither the eu nor russia could afford to stop working together . " i am convinced the eu needs russia to solve international conflicts and russia is going to continue to be dependent on europe , so i am absolutely sure that on both sides reason must prevail , " he said . analysts however are skeptical that things will calm down . " neither the rice talks nor the samara meeting will bring any concrete steps to overcoming disagreements , " said yevgeny volk , an analyst for the heritage foundation .
" it was only in the cold war that relations were like this .
it 's like 20 years ago . " plenty of irritants topping rice 's agenda on tuesday will be fierce russian opposition to a us plan for deploying a limited missile defense system in poland and the czech republic . she has little chance of making progress .
washington says the system is aimed at averting attacks from countries like iran or north korea , but moscow sees the system as a direct threat that could trigger a new arms race and has announced a freeze on a landmark soviet-era arms limitation treaty . last month eu trade commissioner peter mandelson warned that mistrust and a lack of respect in the relations between the european union and russia are at their worst levels since the cold war . " neither thinks they enjoy the respect and goodwill from the other they are entitled to expect , " he said , in comments which his eu colleagues have since been at pains to play down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world ii statue that is the source of much friction between moscow and tallin tension will also be high at the russia-eu summit following a row over a soviet war memorial between moscow and estonia , a former soviet republic that is now a member of the eu and nato military alliance . the foreign ministers meeting in brussels on monday will also hail serbia 's creation on friday of a pro-european government . the 27 eu nations hope the serbs ' move will help push forward plans for supervised independence in the breakaway serbian province of kosovo , a measure which russia has threatened to block at the un security council . russia on saturday dismissed as " unacceptable " a draft un security council resolution , introduced by western powers , endorsing the kosovo independence plan of un envoy martti ahtisaari . political freedoms and human rights hanging over both the us and eu meetings will be growing western criticism of russian president vladimir putin 's handling of political freedoms and human rights - a sensitive issue thrown into relief by plans for an opposition rally in samara on the day of the eu summit . police have violently broken up several earlier protest marches by the other russia coalition , bringing condemnation from western governments . on friday , a spokesman for german chancellor angela merkel , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency , urged russia to authorize the samara protest , saying : " we start from the principle that critical voices should be able to be expressed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crackdown on protestors in st petersburg last month sparked western criticism ahead of her visit , rice attacked what she called the " turning back " of freedoms in russia under putin and said " everybody around the world " was concerned . other bones of contention include constant delays in russia 's bid for membership of the world trade organization , russian opposition to independence for serbia 's kosovo province , and a meat trade dispute with eu member poland . " worst summit in history " the russia-eu meeting " will be the worst summit in history because there 's actually nothing that can be achieved in samara , " said fyodr lukyanov , editor of the journal russia in global affairs .
prospects for rice were " not much better , " he added . analysts said that much of the bad feeling is based on political maneuvering rather than concrete problems . " i think that russia and the european union tripped up on a step that should have led to better relations , " said mark entin , professor at moscow 's european studies institute .
" the step is russia becoming richer , faster , more confident .
at the same time , the european union is becoming bigger .
this is not seen as an opportunity , but as a challenge .
it 's a problem of mentality . "

" we know that the russians are getting hot and bothered as well . " german foreign minster frank-walter steinmeier , however , said it would be impossible to predetermine exactly what the eu-russia summit results would be . " the situation is complicated but particularly in time of difficulties is important to talk , " he said before the preparatory meeting of eu ministers .
" we are going to try right up to the summit to resolve the conflict concerning polish meat .
i ca n't say whether we 'll be successful . " steinmeier added that neither the eu nor russia could afford to stop working together . " i am convinced the eu needs russia to solve international conflicts and russia is going to continue to be dependent on europe , so i am absolutely sure that on both sides reason must prevail , " he said . analysts however are skeptical that things will calm down . " neither the rice talks nor the samara meeting will bring any concrete steps to overcoming disagreements , " said yevgeny volk , an analyst for the heritage foundation .
" it was only in the cold war that relations were like this .
it 's like 20 years ago . " plenty of irritants topping rice 's agenda on tuesday will be fierce russian opposition to a us plan for deploying a limited missile defense system in poland and the czech republic . she has little chance of making progress .

" germany had a lack of manpower because many men were in the wehrmacht -lrb- nazi military -rrb- , " said jakub deka , a warsaw-based planning coordinator commissioned by the polish-german reconciliation foundation to plan the new exhibition , in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandradio . lingering cause of tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some victims of forced labor have received financial compensation " they simply looked for labor in the conquered areas - not just in poland , but all over europe - and took it back to germany , " he said .
an estimated 3 million poles were subjected to forced labor under the nazi regime in germany following the invasion of poland in 1939 , which makes it a particularly sore topic in german-polish relations .
those capable of working were sent to munitions factories and coal mines to support the war effort , while children underwent a process of " germanization " in special schools .
treatment in the camps was harsh , and prisoners were often beaten and even shot for not working up to standard or trying to escape . promoting reconciliation the exhibit 's opening in germany was attended by survivors from wartime labor camps in flensburg , frankfurt , wolfsburg and berlin .
polish-born josef kuzba , a prisoner at the sachsenhausen concentration camp from 1940 to 1945 , has been discussing his experiences with children from the city 's archenhold gymnasium and sophie scholl oberschule . " the youngsters seemed well briefed about world war ii , " he said .
" it was a pleasure talking to them . " asked if he was apprehensive about visiting germany nowadays , he replied : " no , not at all .
i 'm a frequent visitor and have good relations with friends here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuzba talks about his experiences in sachsenhausen with school children kuzba , who was born in pomerania , and now lives in warsaw , said he had been active in promoting polish-german reconciliation for years . " remembrance is one thing , reconciliation another , " kuzba said .
" both are important for our nations . " mariusz muszynski , chairman of the foundation for polish-german reconciliation , wrote in the 205-page exhibit catalog that no other event in german-polish history had ever proved so burdensome to relations as the nazi-led invasion of poland . " material payments can never make up for the sorrow and suffering caused victims - but they were seen as a symbolic gesture of fairness and respect and a contributory step towards a better understanding between the two nations , " said muszynski . millions have been paid worldwide to german slave and forced labor victims following the enactment of a law by the german parliament and the creation of a " remembrance , responsibility , future " foundation . berlin first stop on german tour original nazi documents , photographs , biographies and a documentary film make up the exhibit , which will remain in berlin until mid-october before it continues on to other german cities .
it has already been viewed by 80,000 visitors during its tour in poland .
the camp where the exhibit is currently housed was built in 1943 by albert speer , nazi minister of infrastructure and munitions , for over 2,000 workers .
it is one of 3,000 such nazi camps built in the berlin area and one of only few nazi labor camps remaining . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament condemns chinese labor camps , irks beijing amid protests from beijing , the german parliament thursday condemned chinese labor camps and called for special labels on goods produced in labor camps .

the bribes were meant to secure gas-turbine contracts valued at 450 million euros .
a former head of the siemens power plant unit received a two-year suspended sentence , and a consultant engineer who admitted being guilty of the charges was given a nine-month suspended sentence .
the court also ordered the embattled siemens concern to pay 38 million euros into state coffers .
the verdicts follow similar sentences handed down by a court in milan to two enel employees and two other siemens managers charged in italy in connection with the bribery case . the german engineering giant said in a statement that it would appeal the fine .

russia of today is not the russia of the 90s , said expert alexander rahr . alexander rahr is a russia expert from the german society for foreign affairs , a berlin-based research group .
dw-radio : do the ongoing disputes between russia and the eu make you pessimistic about the prospects for any breakthroughs at the upcoming summit ?
alexander rahr : in the short run , i 'm very skeptical and pessimistic about the possibility of improving relations between russia and the european union , but of course one has to be more optimistic for the long run .
but presently , there is talk of a new cold war between the eu and russia .
one of the main disputes is about the power that moscow wields because of its massive reserves of oil and gas and its control over the transport of energy supplies from central asia .
how do you think this issue will be addressed at the summit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander rahr i think that this is a temporary situation .
the situation in general will stabilize and improve because russia needs its european partners and the european market in order to sell its goods .
it can not sit on its oil and get the sources alone .
it has to sell it .
on the other hand , the west also has to understand that the russia of today is not the russia of the 90s .
russia also has some new powers which we have to take into account .
what do you think russia 's expectations for the upcoming summit are ?
what does it hope to achieve ?
russia itself has a wait-and-see attitude .
it wants to have good cooperation with the european union , but it does not want to tolerate criticism of its interior policies .
russia says it wants a different kind of cooperation with the european union - not the kind of cooperation on mutual values , which the european union demands .
russia wants a purely pragmatic , business-like cooperation .
one of the main issues is the current state of human rights in russia .
some have complained that the eu has not protested enough against some of the human rights abuses in russia .
do you think this issue will be raised at the summit ?
this issue has been raised at every summit for many years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 14.05.2007 rubbish managers say germans are number one in recycling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : separating packaging from trash is no easy matter some people say no one likes to separate their trash as much as germans - even troops stationed in afghanistan are reported to separate their rubbish .
it 's a chacteristic that trash pleases trash management companies . separating trash for recycling is no easy matter .
for one thing , it 's sometimes difficult discerning whether the trash in your hand is actually packaging , glass , paper , hazardous or organic waste .
what bin do you use when packaging includes both cardboard and plastic ? but after you 've gone through the trouble of washing your hands of your many types of rubbish , you can at least know it 's worth it - economically , as well as for the planet . dealing in trash makes good business sense .
waste management has become a major industry in germany - with 250,000 employees in the sector , and the rubbish people throw away also generates turnover of 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 67.7 billion -rrb- . so what 's the point ? " i do try to recycle , " said one woman .
" i put paper in the blue recycling bin , yoghurt containers and tin foil in the yellow bins for packaging , and we also recycle bottles . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yellow bags hopefully carrying " green dot " packaging another woman said she 's made a conscious choice not to throw plastic in the packaging recycling bin . " you 're supposed to clean out yoghurt containers , but that uses a lot of water , and i do n't think it 's a good idea to waste so much , " she said .
" besides , people say anyway that everything is thrown back together again and then burned at the incineration plant . " in the western german city of cologne , for example , the packaging thrown into recycling bins lands in the hands of remondis , a collection company , then taken to a facility , where the so-called " dsd " trash is sorted .
visiting the remondis plant , you 'll find a mound of trash consisting of yoghurts cups , plastic wrapping and aluminum cans . dsd stands for duales system deutschland -lrb- dual system germany -rrb- , a company established in 1990 . in 1991 , a special german packaging ordinance came into force and required product manufacturers and vendors to take back packaging once the products have been used and arranged for their recycling .
dsd organizes this system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how to sort your rubbish in the berlin subway ?
packaging marked what is called the grüner punkt or green dot is part of this system .
only packaging with the green dot is supposed to be placed either in special yellow plastic bags placed outside for pickup , or placed in yellow recycling containers . refuse companies say that in international comparisons , germans are number one in recycling their packaging .
but the figures are disputed . according to dsd , largely a monopoly in the recycling sector , each consumer in germany recycles around 76 kilograms -lrb- 167 pounds -rrb- of packaging a year . critics say that translates into about 30 items of packaging per day , which they claim is unrealistic .
they estimate that on the average , each person recycles around 26 kilograms of dsd trash annually . what 's a recyclable wrapping ? but does everyone separate properly ?
do they put only " green dot " product wrappings in the yellow bags and boxes ? jürgen lennertz , director of the remondis plant in cologne , said that " people throw from 30 to 50 percent of packaging without the green dot into the yellow containers . " what is thrown in there is everything from plastic pots for plants to garden hoses .
udo koch , remondis operations manager , hit the point home with the rhetorical question : " now is that packaging ? " koch also said people also throw frying pans , cameras and even dirty diapers into the yellow recycling bins . the good news is that modern sorting machines can recognize and categorize about 90 percent of rubbish , leaving about 5 percent to be sorted by hand . the bigger picture so machines do help germans be international leaders in divvying up their trash .
koch said there is a reason for it all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ha schult has made art out of trash " i think a lot of people are thinking about the climate right now , " he said .
" the amount of energy necessary to recycle product wrappings is much less than what you need to produce the packaging in the first place . " critics , however , disagree .
they say more energy is needed to recycle smaller wrapping items than to generate them . either way , around 50 percent to 70 percent of the " yellow bin content " can be recycled . the rest , which can not is incinerated , also generates energy .
the cologne-based avg , a waste management and incineration company , said it could pass along 400,000 megawatts of power and 230,000 tons of steam to the energy industry in 2006 resulting from waste incineration . tuba tuncak -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a recycled bottle story : from drink container to winter sweater ever wonder what happens to all those plastic bottles the germans seem to be perpetually recycling ?

it 's a chacteristic that trash pleases trash management companies . separating trash for recycling is no easy matter .
for one thing , it 's sometimes difficult discerning whether the trash in your hand is actually packaging , glass , paper , hazardous or organic waste .
what bin do you use when packaging includes both cardboard and plastic ? but after you 've gone through the trouble of washing your hands of your many types of rubbish , you can at least know it 's worth it - economically , as well as for the planet . dealing in trash makes good business sense .
waste management has become a major industry in germany - with 250,000 employees in the sector , and the rubbish people throw away also generates turnover of 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 67.7 billion -rrb- . so what 's the point ? " i do try to recycle , " said one woman .
" i put paper in the blue recycling bin , yoghurt containers and tin foil in the yellow bins for packaging , and we also recycle bottles . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yellow bags hopefully carrying " green dot " packaging another woman said she 's made a conscious choice not to throw plastic in the packaging recycling bin . " you 're supposed to clean out yoghurt containers , but that uses a lot of water , and i do n't think it 's a good idea to waste so much , " she said .
" besides , people say anyway that everything is thrown back together again and then burned at the incineration plant . " in the western german city of cologne , for example , the packaging thrown into recycling bins lands in the hands of remondis , a collection company , then taken to a facility , where the so-called " dsd " trash is sorted .
visiting the remondis plant , you 'll find a mound of trash consisting of yoghurts cups , plastic wrapping and aluminum cans . dsd stands for duales system deutschland -lrb- dual system germany -rrb- , a company established in 1990 . in 1991 , a special german packaging ordinance came into force and required product manufacturers and vendors to take back packaging once the products have been used and arranged for their recycling .
dsd organizes this system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how to sort your rubbish in the berlin subway ?
packaging marked what is called the grüner punkt or green dot is part of this system .
only packaging with the green dot is supposed to be placed either in special yellow plastic bags placed outside for pickup , or placed in yellow recycling containers . refuse companies say that in international comparisons , germans are number one in recycling their packaging .
but the figures are disputed . according to dsd , largely a monopoly in the recycling sector , each consumer in germany recycles around 76 kilograms -lrb- 167 pounds -rrb- of packaging a year . critics say that translates into about 30 items of packaging per day , which they claim is unrealistic .
they estimate that on the average , each person recycles around 26 kilograms of dsd trash annually . what 's a recyclable wrapping ? but does everyone separate properly ?
do they put only " green dot " product wrappings in the yellow bags and boxes ? jürgen lennertz , director of the remondis plant in cologne , said that " people throw from 30 to 50 percent of packaging without the green dot into the yellow containers . " what is thrown in there is everything from plastic pots for plants to garden hoses .
udo koch , remondis operations manager , hit the point home with the rhetorical question : " now is that packaging ? " koch also said people also throw frying pans , cameras and even dirty diapers into the yellow recycling bins . the good news is that modern sorting machines can recognize and categorize about 90 percent of rubbish , leaving about 5 percent to be sorted by hand . the bigger picture so machines do help germans be international leaders in divvying up their trash .
koch said there is a reason for it all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ha schult has made art out of trash " i think a lot of people are thinking about the climate right now , " he said .
" the amount of energy necessary to recycle product wrappings is much less than what you need to produce the packaging in the first place . " critics , however , disagree .
they say more energy is needed to recycle smaller wrapping items than to generate them . either way , around 50 percent to 70 percent of the " yellow bin content " can be recycled . the rest , which can not is incinerated , also generates energy .

waste management has become a major industry in germany - with 250,000 employees in the sector , and the rubbish people throw away also generates turnover of 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 67.7 billion -rrb- . so what 's the point ? " i do try to recycle , " said one woman .
" i put paper in the blue recycling bin , yoghurt containers and tin foil in the yellow bins for packaging , and we also recycle bottles . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yellow bags hopefully carrying " green dot " packaging another woman said she 's made a conscious choice not to throw plastic in the packaging recycling bin . " you 're supposed to clean out yoghurt containers , but that uses a lot of water , and i do n't think it 's a good idea to waste so much , " she said .
" besides , people say anyway that everything is thrown back together again and then burned at the incineration plant . " in the western german city of cologne , for example , the packaging thrown into recycling bins lands in the hands of remondis , a collection company , then taken to a facility , where the so-called " dsd " trash is sorted .
visiting the remondis plant , you 'll find a mound of trash consisting of yoghurts cups , plastic wrapping and aluminum cans . dsd stands for duales system deutschland -lrb- dual system germany -rrb- , a company established in 1990 . in 1991 , a special german packaging ordinance came into force and required product manufacturers and vendors to take back packaging once the products have been used and arranged for their recycling .
dsd organizes this system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how to sort your rubbish in the berlin subway ?
packaging marked what is called the grüner punkt or green dot is part of this system .
only packaging with the green dot is supposed to be placed either in special yellow plastic bags placed outside for pickup , or placed in yellow recycling containers . refuse companies say that in international comparisons , germans are number one in recycling their packaging .
but the figures are disputed . according to dsd , largely a monopoly in the recycling sector , each consumer in germany recycles around 76 kilograms -lrb- 167 pounds -rrb- of packaging a year . critics say that translates into about 30 items of packaging per day , which they claim is unrealistic .
they estimate that on the average , each person recycles around 26 kilograms of dsd trash annually . what 's a recyclable wrapping ? but does everyone separate properly ?
do they put only " green dot " product wrappings in the yellow bags and boxes ? jürgen lennertz , director of the remondis plant in cologne , said that " people throw from 30 to 50 percent of packaging without the green dot into the yellow containers . " what is thrown in there is everything from plastic pots for plants to garden hoses .
udo koch , remondis operations manager , hit the point home with the rhetorical question : " now is that packaging ? " koch also said people also throw frying pans , cameras and even dirty diapers into the yellow recycling bins . the good news is that modern sorting machines can recognize and categorize about 90 percent of rubbish , leaving about 5 percent to be sorted by hand . the bigger picture so machines do help germans be international leaders in divvying up their trash .
koch said there is a reason for it all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ha schult has made art out of trash " i think a lot of people are thinking about the climate right now , " he said .
" the amount of energy necessary to recycle product wrappings is much less than what you need to produce the packaging in the first place . " critics , however , disagree .
they say more energy is needed to recycle smaller wrapping items than to generate them . either way , around 50 percent to 70 percent of the " yellow bin content " can be recycled . the rest , which can not is incinerated , also generates energy .
the cologne-based avg , a waste management and incineration company , said it could pass along 400,000 megawatts of power and 230,000 tons of steam to the energy industry in 2006 resulting from waste incineration . tuba tuncak -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a recycled bottle story : from drink container to winter sweater ever wonder what happens to all those plastic bottles the germans seem to be perpetually recycling ?

" germany had a lack of manpower because many men were in the wehrmacht -lrb- nazi military -rrb- , " said jakub deka , a warsaw-based planning coordinator commissioned by the polish-german reconciliation foundation to plan the new exhibition , in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandradio . lingering cause of tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some victims of forced labor have received financial compensation " they simply looked for labor in the conquered areas - not just in poland , but all over europe - and took it back to germany , " he said .
an estimated 3 million poles were subjected to forced labor under the nazi regime in germany following the invasion of poland in 1939 , which makes it a particularly sore topic in german-polish relations .
those capable of working were sent to munitions factories and coal mines to support the war effort , while children underwent a process of " germanization " in special schools .
treatment in the camps was harsh , and prisoners were often beaten and even shot for not working up to standard or trying to escape . promoting reconciliation the exhibit 's opening in germany was attended by survivors from wartime labor camps in flensburg , frankfurt , wolfsburg and berlin .
polish-born josef kuzba , a prisoner at the sachsenhausen concentration camp from 1940 to 1945 , has been discussing his experiences with children from the city 's archenhold gymnasium and sophie scholl oberschule . " the youngsters seemed well briefed about world war ii , " he said .
" it was a pleasure talking to them . " asked if he was apprehensive about visiting germany nowadays , he replied : " no , not at all .
i 'm a frequent visitor and have good relations with friends here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuzba talks about his experiences in sachsenhausen with school children kuzba , who was born in pomerania , and now lives in warsaw , said he had been active in promoting polish-german reconciliation for years . " remembrance is one thing , reconciliation another , " kuzba said .
" both are important for our nations . " mariusz muszynski , chairman of the foundation for polish-german reconciliation , wrote in the 205-page exhibit catalog that no other event in german-polish history had ever proved so burdensome to relations as the nazi-led invasion of poland . " material payments can never make up for the sorrow and suffering caused victims - but they were seen as a symbolic gesture of fairness and respect and a contributory step towards a better understanding between the two nations , " said muszynski . millions have been paid worldwide to german slave and forced labor victims following the enactment of a law by the german parliament and the creation of a " remembrance , responsibility , future " foundation . berlin first stop on german tour original nazi documents , photographs , biographies and a documentary film make up the exhibit , which will remain in berlin until mid-october before it continues on to other german cities .
it has already been viewed by 80,000 visitors during its tour in poland .
the camp where the exhibit is currently housed was built in 1943 by albert speer , nazi minister of infrastructure and munitions , for over 2,000 workers .

do n't leave bonn without him großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven was born in bonn in 1770 , but lived most of his life in vienna visitors to bonn are certain to go home with a beethoven souvenir .
after all , the former capital has learned to make the most of its connection to its famous son . they come from all over the world and have one thing in common - they 've come to follow in the footsteps of ludwig van beethoven .
in bonn , where the composer lived from his birth in 1770 until the age of 22 , that 's not hard to do .
beethoven is practically everywhere - visitors are bound to come across his serious-looking profile on everything from suspenders and umbrellas to ball-point pens and chocolate truffles .
the larger-than-life statue of beethoven on bonn 's central münster square , across from the main post office , has long since become an important landmark in the city .
in fact , the monument 's consecration in 1845 , timed to coincide with the composer 's 75th birthday , was celebrated with a three-day music festival organized by none other than franz liszt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this monument was erected for beethoven 's 75th birthday " it definitely belongs in my germany photo album , " said tourist xianguo zhong from shanghai while posing for the camera together with the colossal composer .
beethoven sells every year , some 500,000 tourists and business travellers , many of them from asia , stop in bonn .
along with bonn 's many museums , beethoven is one of the former capital 's most significant attractions .
the annual beethoven festival , in particular , draws the crowds .
it has its roots in franz liszt 's 1845 festival and is a special highlight for music lovers from all over the world .
bonn tourism officials have quickly learned that , quite simply , beethoven sells .
in addition to her picture in front of the statue , xianguo zhong went home with a t-shirt with a picture of the composer on it .
" in china , every kid knows who beethoven is , " she said .
" we read stories about him in elementary school . "
souvenirs galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house attracts around 100,000 visitors per year the museum gift shop in the composer 's birth house has over 800 beethoven souvenirs on offer , including beer glasses , thimbles , playing cards , stationary and ties all printed with a variety of beethoven motives .
each year , around 100,000 pilgrims visit the house on bonngasse , where they can view some of the composer 's instruments , hand-written correspondence and original manuscripts - and take home reproductions of the " moonlight sonata " or " für elise " manuscripts printed on silk scarves and porcelain plates .
particularly enthusiastic beethoven fans can even take home a bit of the composer himself - at least from the shoulders up .
visitors can choose from 20 different types of beethoven busts measuring between five and 55 centimeters -lrb- two to 22 inches -rrb- tall and costing up to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,350 -rrb- .
the gift shop 's best-sellers , however , are the cds of the composer 's music .
they even offer a recording that simulates beethoven 's hearing loss with changes to the volume and sound of the music .
the birth house also holds a substantial beethoven archive and library .

a two-day informal meeting of european drug commissioners begins in berlin monday , two days after the interior ministers of the eu 's six largest countries agreed on closer cooperation with africa in the fight against drug smuggling from south america at a meeting in venice .
the venice meeting followed the three-day international drug enforcement conference in madrid last week which was hosted by the spanish government and the us drug enforcement agency -lrb- dea -rrb- , washington ’ s top anti-narcotics agency .
the talks on saturday were attended by eu justice commissioner franco frattini , the interior ministers of germany , britain , poland , france , spain and italy , and united states secretary of homeland security michael chertoff .
all supported the idea of sending european investigators to west africa as part of a new drive against the smugglers .
" we have agreed to cooperate with african countries in the effort to block the new routes of colombian cocaine to europe , " said spanish interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba .
the initiative to open a new front against the traffickers coming through africa comes hot on the heels of an agreement to set up a new european body that will share intelligence and coordinate police seizures of cocaine and cannabis on the high seas .
coordinated by britain , france , ireland , italy , portugal , spain and the netherlands , the body will be officially established in lisbon later this year .
europe offering high profit margins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of latin america 's output lands on european mirrors roughly 80 percent of cocaine from latin america that was destined for markets outside of the united states in 2005 was bound for europe , according to dea estimates .
international drug trafficking rings have been drawn to the european market because of the higher prices paid for cocaine on the continent .
last year wholesale prices for cocaine in the european union ranged between 28,000 and 56,600 euros -lrb- $ 38,000 and $ 77,000 -rrb- per kilogram compared to between $ 9,000 and $ 40,000 in the united states where the supply is higher , according to the dea .
" the potential for this high profit margin has increasingly lured colombian traffickers to european markets , " dea director of operations michael braun said during his testimony before the us congress last year .
africa is increasingly being used by criminal gangs as a hub for shipping latin american cocaine and asian heroin into europe .
consumption of cocaine and hashish is also on the rise in africa , spanish secretary of state for security antonio camacho said at the international drug enforcement conference on thursday .
" this is an issue which is very worrying because of its regional and global implications , " he said .
spain the coke gateway to the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coke ending up in the eu invariably comes through spain trafficking groups are taking advantage of weak governments in african nations as well as their historical ties to europe to smuggle drugs into the continent .
spain has become the main gateway for latin american cocaine and north african hashish into europe and has set up its own robust fight against drug smuggling .
spanish officials seized over 40 tons of cocaine last year , a record amount and more than any other nation in the world except for colombia , the united states and venezuela , camacho said .
" spain has a serious problem regarding rising drug consumption and i think it is in the interest of us all to cooperate more to fight drug trafficking , which in the case of colombia is totally linked to guerrilla groups and violence , " colombian defense minister juan manuel santos told reporters in madrid .
" cocaine is surging in europe at levels similar to what america experienced in the 1980s , " the head of the us drug enforcement administration , karen tandy , said at the three-day event in madrid .
low costs drive high consumption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european coke consumption is at a historical high around 10 million europeans , or over three percent of all adults , have used cocaine at least once in their lives , a historically high figure , according to the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- .
britain and spain posted the highest rates of use , with over four percent of adults reporting having consumed the drug over the past year compared to an average of around one percent of adults in all of europe .
use is concentrated among young adults , especially men , in urban areas .
a substantial drop in price has contributed to the increase in usage .
the price of cocaine on europe 's streets fell by 22 percent between 1999 and 2004 , according to emcdda .
the supply of cocaine in europe has increased since the late 1990s leading to lower prices and this , combined with its association to a supposedly glamorous lifestyle , is fueling its growing use , drug experts say .

last year wholesale prices for cocaine in the european union ranged between 28,000 and 56,600 euros -lrb- $ 38,000 and $ 77,000 -rrb- per kilogram compared to between $ 9,000 and $ 40,000 in the united states where the supply is higher , according to the dea .
" the potential for this high profit margin has increasingly lured colombian traffickers to european markets , " dea director of operations michael braun said during his testimony before the us congress last year .
africa is increasingly being used by criminal gangs as a hub for shipping latin american cocaine and asian heroin into europe .
consumption of cocaine and hashish is also on the rise in africa , spanish secretary of state for security antonio camacho said at the international drug enforcement conference on thursday .
" this is an issue which is very worrying because of its regional and global implications , " he said .
spain the coke gateway to the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coke ending up in the eu invariably comes through spain trafficking groups are taking advantage of weak governments in african nations as well as their historical ties to europe to smuggle drugs into the continent .
spain has become the main gateway for latin american cocaine and north african hashish into europe and has set up its own robust fight against drug smuggling .
spanish officials seized over 40 tons of cocaine last year , a record amount and more than any other nation in the world except for colombia , the united states and venezuela , camacho said .
" spain has a serious problem regarding rising drug consumption and i think it is in the interest of us all to cooperate more to fight drug trafficking , which in the case of colombia is totally linked to guerrilla groups and violence , " colombian defense minister juan manuel santos told reporters in madrid .
" cocaine is surging in europe at levels similar to what america experienced in the 1980s , " the head of the us drug enforcement administration , karen tandy , said at the three-day event in madrid .
low costs drive high consumption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european coke consumption is at a historical high around 10 million europeans , or over three percent of all adults , have used cocaine at least once in their lives , a historically high figure , according to the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- .
britain and spain posted the highest rates of use , with over four percent of adults reporting having consumed the drug over the past year compared to an average of around one percent of adults in all of europe .
use is concentrated among young adults , especially men , in urban areas .
a substantial drop in price has contributed to the increase in usage .
the price of cocaine on europe 's streets fell by 22 percent between 1999 and 2004 , according to emcdda .
the supply of cocaine in europe has increased since the late 1990s leading to lower prices and this , combined with its association to a supposedly glamorous lifestyle , is fueling its growing use , drug experts say .
" cocaine is very much associated with success , urban lifestyles , a party atmosphere , " emcdda analyst julian vicente told afp , before adding cocaine was now the second most used illegal drug in europe after cannabis . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report paints mixed picture of german drug and alcohol use germany 's annual report on drugs and addiction was released this week showing a overall decrease in drug-related deaths , but alarming data on prescription drug addiction and youth drinking .

after all , the former capital has learned to make the most of its connection to its famous son . they come from all over the world and have one thing in common - they 've come to follow in the footsteps of ludwig van beethoven .
in bonn , where the composer lived from his birth in 1770 until the age of 22 , that 's not hard to do .
beethoven is practically everywhere - visitors are bound to come across his serious-looking profile on everything from suspenders and umbrellas to ball-point pens and chocolate truffles .
the larger-than-life statue of beethoven on bonn 's central münster square , across from the main post office , has long since become an important landmark in the city .
in fact , the monument 's consecration in 1845 , timed to coincide with the composer 's 75th birthday , was celebrated with a three-day music festival organized by none other than franz liszt .

it has its roots in franz liszt 's 1845 festival and is a special highlight for music lovers from all over the world .

particularly enthusiastic beethoven fans can even take home a bit of the composer himself - at least from the shoulders up .
visitors can choose from 20 different types of beethoven busts measuring between five and 55 centimeters -lrb- two to 22 inches -rrb- tall and costing up to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,350 -rrb- .

do n't leave bonn without him großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven was born in bonn in 1770 , but lived most of his life in vienna visitors to bonn are certain to go home with a beethoven souvenir .
after all , the former capital has learned to make the most of its connection to its famous son . they come from all over the world and have one thing in common - they 've come to follow in the footsteps of ludwig van beethoven .
in bonn , where the composer lived from his birth in 1770 until the age of 22 , that 's not hard to do .
beethoven is practically everywhere - visitors are bound to come across his serious-looking profile on everything from suspenders and umbrellas to ball-point pens and chocolate truffles .
the larger-than-life statue of beethoven on bonn 's central münster square , across from the main post office , has long since become an important landmark in the city .
in fact , the monument 's consecration in 1845 , timed to coincide with the composer 's 75th birthday , was celebrated with a three-day music festival organized by none other than franz liszt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this monument was erected for beethoven 's 75th birthday " it definitely belongs in my germany photo album , " said tourist xianguo zhong from shanghai while posing for the camera together with the colossal composer .
beethoven sells every year , some 500,000 tourists and business travellers , many of them from asia , stop in bonn .
along with bonn 's many museums , beethoven is one of the former capital 's most significant attractions .
the annual beethoven festival , in particular , draws the crowds .
it has its roots in franz liszt 's 1845 festival and is a special highlight for music lovers from all over the world .
bonn tourism officials have quickly learned that , quite simply , beethoven sells .
in addition to her picture in front of the statue , xianguo zhong went home with a t-shirt with a picture of the composer on it .
" in china , every kid knows who beethoven is , " she said .
" we read stories about him in elementary school . "
souvenirs galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house attracts around 100,000 visitors per year the museum gift shop in the composer 's birth house has over 800 beethoven souvenirs on offer , including beer glasses , thimbles , playing cards , stationary and ties all printed with a variety of beethoven motives .
each year , around 100,000 pilgrims visit the house on bonngasse , where they can view some of the composer 's instruments , hand-written correspondence and original manuscripts - and take home reproductions of the " moonlight sonata " or " für elise " manuscripts printed on silk scarves and porcelain plates .
particularly enthusiastic beethoven fans can even take home a bit of the composer himself - at least from the shoulders up .
visitors can choose from 20 different types of beethoven busts measuring between five and 55 centimeters -lrb- two to 22 inches -rrb- tall and costing up to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,350 -rrb- .
the gift shop 's best-sellers , however , are the cds of the composer 's music .
they even offer a recording that simulates beethoven 's hearing loss with changes to the volume and sound of the music .
the birth house also holds a substantial beethoven archive and library .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 14.05.2007 are the right countries sitting at the g8 table ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the annual g8 heads of state summit was held in russia in 2006 g8 stands for the world 's leading eight industrial nations .
but in the lead up to the 2007 g8 summit in germany , some economists are again raising the question of whether the right members are in the g8 club . just thinking about the current g8 members - germany , france , italy , great britain , russia , japan , the united states and canada - puts renowned economist jim o 'neill in a bad mood . " i have no idea why a country like italy is allowed to continue to be in the club , " said o 'neill , who is head of global economic research at investment bank goldman sachs . o 'neill is author of an influential report which argues that brazil , russia , india and china - the so-called brics - could become the four dominant economies by 2050 .
italy is noticeably absent in o 'neill 's report . " italy 's contribution to the world economy has been continually shrinking for a while now , but at g8 summits , italy is still a participatory to the official agreements about how the world functions today , " he said . lack of binding decisions like o 'neill , many others see the g8 as irrelevant and some would even love to see it dismantled immediately .
according to its critics , the g8 's lack of administrative structure and binding rules mean that although leaders broach issues such as debt relief and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , there are few concrete achievements . for o 'neill , the g8 members represent the world as it was more than 60 years ago and do n't reflect the current situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is predicted to overtake germany as the world 's third largest economy by 2008 " the worst thing is that the wrong participants are sitting at the g8 table , " said o 'neill .
" it is a somewhat simplistic idea to want to rule the world according to some post-war schematic , " he said . according to him , by the middle of the century , the brics are likely to have more economic weight that the current g7 countries -lrb- g8 without russia -rrb- put together .
the economy of china alone in 2050 is likely to be 20 times bigger than it is today and will have overtaken the usa as the world 's biggest , o 'neill predicted . changing world economy russia was admitted to the group of eight in 1997 , becoming the first new member since canada came on board in 1976 .
critics like o 'neill say the g8 ca n't continue to ignore the dramatic changes to the global economy . after all , it was n't until the gleneagles summit in 2005 that the heads of states agreed to hold a separate set of meetings with ministers from emerging economies of china , india , brazil , south africa and mexico , now known as the g8 + 5 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , five developing countries attended the g8 environment ministers meeting for the first time peter hajnal , an academic with the g8 research group at canada 's toronto university thinks this was an intelligent decision .
the alternative would have been to hold a meeting of the 20 leading heads of states based on the model of the g20 industrial nations forum formed in 1999 . according to hajnal , such a structure would make it more difficult to achieve real results , however , and is n't being considered as a real possibility . even economist o 'neill does n't want to see an increase in the number of g8 members .
he would prefer the introduction of rules regulating who has the right to sit at the table . " we should learn from soccer , and have a permanent league in which only the current world economic powers are allowed to play , " o 'neill said .
" you would be able to advance into and dropped from the league . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the g8 look to soccer for inspiration ?
o 'neill has even thought of an umpire - the international monetary fund , which could use economic data to determine the lucky eight . is g8 membership desirable ? this suggestion is n't an option for hajnal , who pointed out that not all bric countries were angling for g8 membership . china has " continually emphasized that it does n't want to belong for the moment " because it was " profiting economically " by being a developing country , hajnal said . however , according to hajnal , the g8 's very informality could well come in useful in the future by making it easier for the g8 to adapt to changes in the world 's power balance .

but in the lead up to the 2007 g8 summit in germany , some economists are again raising the question of whether the right members are in the g8 club . just thinking about the current g8 members - germany , france , italy , great britain , russia , japan , the united states and canada - puts renowned economist jim o 'neill in a bad mood . " i have no idea why a country like italy is allowed to continue to be in the club , " said o 'neill , who is head of global economic research at investment bank goldman sachs . o 'neill is author of an influential report which argues that brazil , russia , india and china - the so-called brics - could become the four dominant economies by 2050 .
italy is noticeably absent in o 'neill 's report .

according to its critics , the g8 's lack of administrative structure and binding rules mean that although leaders broach issues such as debt relief and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , there are few concrete achievements . for o 'neill , the g8 members represent the world as it was more than 60 years ago and do n't reflect the current situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is predicted to overtake germany as the world 's third largest economy by 2008 " the worst thing is that the wrong participants are sitting at the g8 table , " said o 'neill .

he would prefer the introduction of rules regulating who has the right to sit at the table . " we should learn from soccer , and have a permanent league in which only the current world economic powers are allowed to play , " o 'neill said .

it 's a chacteristic that trash pleases trash management companies . separating trash for recycling is no easy matter .
for one thing , it 's sometimes difficult discerning whether the trash in your hand is actually packaging , glass , paper , hazardous or organic waste .
what bin do you use when packaging includes both cardboard and plastic ? but after you 've gone through the trouble of washing your hands of your many types of rubbish , you can at least know it 's worth it - economically , as well as for the planet . dealing in trash makes good business sense .
waste management has become a major industry in germany - with 250,000 employees in the sector , and the rubbish people throw away also generates turnover of 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 67.7 billion -rrb- . so what 's the point ? " i do try to recycle , " said one woman .
" i put paper in the blue recycling bin , yoghurt containers and tin foil in the yellow bins for packaging , and we also recycle bottles . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yellow bags hopefully carrying " green dot " packaging another woman said she 's made a conscious choice not to throw plastic in the packaging recycling bin . " you 're supposed to clean out yoghurt containers , but that uses a lot of water , and i do n't think it 's a good idea to waste so much , " she said .
" besides , people say anyway that everything is thrown back together again and then burned at the incineration plant . " in the western german city of cologne , for example , the packaging thrown into recycling bins lands in the hands of remondis , a collection company , then taken to a facility , where the so-called " dsd " trash is sorted .
visiting the remondis plant , you 'll find a mound of trash consisting of yoghurts cups , plastic wrapping and aluminum cans . dsd stands for duales system deutschland -lrb- dual system germany -rrb- , a company established in 1990 . in 1991 , a special german packaging ordinance came into force and required product manufacturers and vendors to take back packaging once the products have been used and arranged for their recycling .
dsd organizes this system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how to sort your rubbish in the berlin subway ?
packaging marked what is called the grüner punkt or green dot is part of this system .
only packaging with the green dot is supposed to be placed either in special yellow plastic bags placed outside for pickup , or placed in yellow recycling containers . refuse companies say that in international comparisons , germans are number one in recycling their packaging .
but the figures are disputed . according to dsd , largely a monopoly in the recycling sector , each consumer in germany recycles around 76 kilograms -lrb- 167 pounds -rrb- of packaging a year . critics say that translates into about 30 items of packaging per day , which they claim is unrealistic .
they estimate that on the average , each person recycles around 26 kilograms of dsd trash annually . what 's a recyclable wrapping ? but does everyone separate properly ?
do they put only " green dot " product wrappings in the yellow bags and boxes ? jürgen lennertz , director of the remondis plant in cologne , said that " people throw from 30 to 50 percent of packaging without the green dot into the yellow containers . " what is thrown in there is everything from plastic pots for plants to garden hoses .
udo koch , remondis operations manager , hit the point home with the rhetorical question : " now is that packaging ? " koch also said people also throw frying pans , cameras and even dirty diapers into the yellow recycling bins . the good news is that modern sorting machines can recognize and categorize about 90 percent of rubbish , leaving about 5 percent to be sorted by hand . the bigger picture so machines do help germans be international leaders in divvying up their trash .
koch said there is a reason for it all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ha schult has made art out of trash " i think a lot of people are thinking about the climate right now , " he said .
" the amount of energy necessary to recycle product wrappings is much less than what you need to produce the packaging in the first place . " critics , however , disagree .
they say more energy is needed to recycle smaller wrapping items than to generate them . either way , around 50 percent to 70 percent of the " yellow bin content " can be recycled . the rest , which can not is incinerated , also generates energy .
the cologne-based avg , a waste management and incineration company , said it could pass along 400,000 megawatts of power and 230,000 tons of steam to the energy industry in 2006 resulting from waste incineration . tuba tuncak -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a recycled bottle story : from drink container to winter sweater ever wonder what happens to all those plastic bottles the germans seem to be perpetually recycling ?

it 's a chacteristic that trash pleases trash management companies . separating trash for recycling is no easy matter .
for one thing , it 's sometimes difficult discerning whether the trash in your hand is actually packaging , glass , paper , hazardous or organic waste .
what bin do you use when packaging includes both cardboard and plastic ? but after you 've gone through the trouble of washing your hands of your many types of rubbish , you can at least know it 's worth it - economically , as well as for the planet . dealing in trash makes good business sense .
waste management has become a major industry in germany - with 250,000 employees in the sector , and the rubbish people throw away also generates turnover of 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 67.7 billion -rrb- . so what 's the point ? " i do try to recycle , " said one woman .
" i put paper in the blue recycling bin , yoghurt containers and tin foil in the yellow bins for packaging , and we also recycle bottles . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yellow bags hopefully carrying " green dot " packaging another woman said she 's made a conscious choice not to throw plastic in the packaging recycling bin . " you 're supposed to clean out yoghurt containers , but that uses a lot of water , and i do n't think it 's a good idea to waste so much , " she said .
" besides , people say anyway that everything is thrown back together again and then burned at the incineration plant . " in the western german city of cologne , for example , the packaging thrown into recycling bins lands in the hands of remondis , a collection company , then taken to a facility , where the so-called " dsd " trash is sorted .
visiting the remondis plant , you 'll find a mound of trash consisting of yoghurts cups , plastic wrapping and aluminum cans . dsd stands for duales system deutschland -lrb- dual system germany -rrb- , a company established in 1990 . in 1991 , a special german packaging ordinance came into force and required product manufacturers and vendors to take back packaging once the products have been used and arranged for their recycling .
dsd organizes this system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how to sort your rubbish in the berlin subway ?
packaging marked what is called the grüner punkt or green dot is part of this system .
only packaging with the green dot is supposed to be placed either in special yellow plastic bags placed outside for pickup , or placed in yellow recycling containers . refuse companies say that in international comparisons , germans are number one in recycling their packaging .
but the figures are disputed . according to dsd , largely a monopoly in the recycling sector , each consumer in germany recycles around 76 kilograms -lrb- 167 pounds -rrb- of packaging a year . critics say that translates into about 30 items of packaging per day , which they claim is unrealistic .
they estimate that on the average , each person recycles around 26 kilograms of dsd trash annually . what 's a recyclable wrapping ? but does everyone separate properly ?
do they put only " green dot " product wrappings in the yellow bags and boxes ? jürgen lennertz , director of the remondis plant in cologne , said that " people throw from 30 to 50 percent of packaging without the green dot into the yellow containers . " what is thrown in there is everything from plastic pots for plants to garden hoses .
udo koch , remondis operations manager , hit the point home with the rhetorical question : " now is that packaging ? " koch also said people also throw frying pans , cameras and even dirty diapers into the yellow recycling bins . the good news is that modern sorting machines can recognize and categorize about 90 percent of rubbish , leaving about 5 percent to be sorted by hand . the bigger picture so machines do help germans be international leaders in divvying up their trash .
koch said there is a reason for it all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ha schult has made art out of trash " i think a lot of people are thinking about the climate right now , " he said .
" the amount of energy necessary to recycle product wrappings is much less than what you need to produce the packaging in the first place . " critics , however , disagree .
they say more energy is needed to recycle smaller wrapping items than to generate them . either way , around 50 percent to 70 percent of the " yellow bin content " can be recycled . the rest , which can not is incinerated , also generates energy .
the cologne-based avg , a waste management and incineration company , said it could pass along 400,000 megawatts of power and 230,000 tons of steam to the energy industry in 2006 resulting from waste incineration . tuba tuncak -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a recycled bottle story : from drink container to winter sweater ever wonder what happens to all those plastic bottles the germans seem to be perpetually recycling ?

" germany had a lack of manpower because many men were in the wehrmacht -lrb- nazi military -rrb- , " said jakub deka , a warsaw-based planning coordinator commissioned by the polish-german reconciliation foundation to plan the new exhibition , in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandradio . lingering cause of tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some victims of forced labor have received financial compensation " they simply looked for labor in the conquered areas - not just in poland , but all over europe - and took it back to germany , " he said .
an estimated 3 million poles were subjected to forced labor under the nazi regime in germany following the invasion of poland in 1939 , which makes it a particularly sore topic in german-polish relations .
those capable of working were sent to munitions factories and coal mines to support the war effort , while children underwent a process of " germanization " in special schools .
treatment in the camps was harsh , and prisoners were often beaten and even shot for not working up to standard or trying to escape . promoting reconciliation the exhibit 's opening in germany was attended by survivors from wartime labor camps in flensburg , frankfurt , wolfsburg and berlin .
polish-born josef kuzba , a prisoner at the sachsenhausen concentration camp from 1940 to 1945 , has been discussing his experiences with children from the city 's archenhold gymnasium and sophie scholl oberschule . " the youngsters seemed well briefed about world war ii , " he said .
" it was a pleasure talking to them . " asked if he was apprehensive about visiting germany nowadays , he replied : " no , not at all .
i 'm a frequent visitor and have good relations with friends here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuzba talks about his experiences in sachsenhausen with school children kuzba , who was born in pomerania , and now lives in warsaw , said he had been active in promoting polish-german reconciliation for years . " remembrance is one thing , reconciliation another , " kuzba said .
" both are important for our nations . " mariusz muszynski , chairman of the foundation for polish-german reconciliation , wrote in the 205-page exhibit catalog that no other event in german-polish history had ever proved so burdensome to relations as the nazi-led invasion of poland . " material payments can never make up for the sorrow and suffering caused victims - but they were seen as a symbolic gesture of fairness and respect and a contributory step towards a better understanding between the two nations , " said muszynski . millions have been paid worldwide to german slave and forced labor victims following the enactment of a law by the german parliament and the creation of a " remembrance , responsibility , future " foundation . berlin first stop on german tour original nazi documents , photographs , biographies and a documentary film make up the exhibit , which will remain in berlin until mid-october before it continues on to other german cities .
it has already been viewed by 80,000 visitors during its tour in poland .
the camp where the exhibit is currently housed was built in 1943 by albert speer , nazi minister of infrastructure and munitions , for over 2,000 workers .
it is one of 3,000 such nazi camps built in the berlin area and one of only few nazi labor camps remaining . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament condemns chinese labor camps , irks beijing amid protests from beijing , the german parliament thursday condemned chinese labor camps and called for special labels on goods produced in labor camps .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.05.2007 russia set for stormy eu , us talks amid heightened tensions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ugly row between estonia and russia over a statue has strained moscow 's ties with the eu eu foreign ministers will meet to prepare for an eu-russia summit they hope will ease tensions heightened in recent months by issues as diverse as independence for kosovo , us missile defense plans and human rights . it was hoped that the two-day eu-russia summit in samara near the volga river starting on may 18 would mark the launch of talks on a new wide-ranging partnership agreement , which the europeans see as key to securing reliable oil and supplies from their giant neighbor . us secretary of state condoleezza rice also meets russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in moscow on tuesday . in both cases , western leaders are likely to encounter energy-rich russia 's increasingly combative stance - and return home with little to show . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin has struck an increasingly belligerent tone in recent months " it is important that we try to calm things down and get back to a factual level for our discussions , " one eu diplomatic source said ahead of the brussels talks on monday .
" we know that the russians are getting hot and bothered as well . " german foreign minster frank-walter steinmeier , however , said it would be impossible to predetermine exactly what the eu-russia summit results would be . " the situation is complicated but particularly in time of difficulties is important to talk , " he said before the preparatory meeting of eu ministers .
" we are going to try right up to the summit to resolve the conflict concerning polish meat .
i ca n't say whether we 'll be successful . " steinmeier added that neither the eu nor russia could afford to stop working together . " i am convinced the eu needs russia to solve international conflicts and russia is going to continue to be dependent on europe , so i am absolutely sure that on both sides reason must prevail , " he said . analysts however are skeptical that things will calm down . " neither the rice talks nor the samara meeting will bring any concrete steps to overcoming disagreements , " said yevgeny volk , an analyst for the heritage foundation .
" it was only in the cold war that relations were like this .

" we know that the russians are getting hot and bothered as well . " german foreign minster frank-walter steinmeier , however , said it would be impossible to predetermine exactly what the eu-russia summit results would be . " the situation is complicated but particularly in time of difficulties is important to talk , " he said before the preparatory meeting of eu ministers .
" we are going to try right up to the summit to resolve the conflict concerning polish meat .
i ca n't say whether we 'll be successful . " steinmeier added that neither the eu nor russia could afford to stop working together . " i am convinced the eu needs russia to solve international conflicts and russia is going to continue to be dependent on europe , so i am absolutely sure that on both sides reason must prevail , " he said . analysts however are skeptical that things will calm down . " neither the rice talks nor the samara meeting will bring any concrete steps to overcoming disagreements , " said yevgeny volk , an analyst for the heritage foundation .
" it was only in the cold war that relations were like this .
it 's like 20 years ago . " plenty of irritants topping rice 's agenda on tuesday will be fierce russian opposition to a us plan for deploying a limited missile defense system in poland and the czech republic . she has little chance of making progress .
washington says the system is aimed at averting attacks from countries like iran or north korea , but moscow sees the system as a direct threat that could trigger a new arms race and has announced a freeze on a landmark soviet-era arms limitation treaty . last month eu trade commissioner peter mandelson warned that mistrust and a lack of respect in the relations between the european union and russia are at their worst levels since the cold war . " neither thinks they enjoy the respect and goodwill from the other they are entitled to expect , " he said , in comments which his eu colleagues have since been at pains to play down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world ii statue that is the source of much friction between moscow and tallin tension will also be high at the russia-eu summit following a row over a soviet war memorial between moscow and estonia , a former soviet republic that is now a member of the eu and nato military alliance . the foreign ministers meeting in brussels on monday will also hail serbia 's creation on friday of a pro-european government . the 27 eu nations hope the serbs ' move will help push forward plans for supervised independence in the breakaway serbian province of kosovo , a measure which russia has threatened to block at the un security council . russia on saturday dismissed as " unacceptable " a draft un security council resolution , introduced by western powers , endorsing the kosovo independence plan of un envoy martti ahtisaari . political freedoms and human rights hanging over both the us and eu meetings will be growing western criticism of russian president vladimir putin 's handling of political freedoms and human rights - a sensitive issue thrown into relief by plans for an opposition rally in samara on the day of the eu summit . police have violently broken up several earlier protest marches by the other russia coalition , bringing condemnation from western governments . on friday , a spokesman for german chancellor angela merkel , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency , urged russia to authorize the samara protest , saying : " we start from the principle that critical voices should be able to be expressed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crackdown on protestors in st petersburg last month sparked western criticism ahead of her visit , rice attacked what she called the " turning back " of freedoms in russia under putin and said " everybody around the world " was concerned . other bones of contention include constant delays in russia 's bid for membership of the world trade organization , russian opposition to independence for serbia 's kosovo province , and a meat trade dispute with eu member poland . " worst summit in history " the russia-eu meeting " will be the worst summit in history because there 's actually nothing that can be achieved in samara , " said fyodr lukyanov , editor of the journal russia in global affairs .
prospects for rice were " not much better , " he added . analysts said that much of the bad feeling is based on political maneuvering rather than concrete problems . " i think that russia and the european union tripped up on a step that should have led to better relations , " said mark entin , professor at moscow 's european studies institute .
" the step is russia becoming richer , faster , more confident .
at the same time , the european union is becoming bigger .
this is not seen as an opportunity , but as a challenge .
it 's a problem of mentality . "
lukyanov also pointed to a " psychological " divide exacerbated by the run-up to presidential elections in the united states and russia next year . " the russian leadership is completely preoccupied with power and they use foreign policy to strengthen their position , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " russia wants pragmatic , business-like cooperation " as relations between brussels and moscow remain tense , the russia of today is not the russia of the 90s , one expert told deutsche welle .

russia of today is not the russia of the 90s , said expert alexander rahr . alexander rahr is a russia expert from the german society for foreign affairs , a berlin-based research group .
dw-radio : do the ongoing disputes between russia and the eu make you pessimistic about the prospects for any breakthroughs at the upcoming summit ?
alexander rahr : in the short run , i 'm very skeptical and pessimistic about the possibility of improving relations between russia and the european union , but of course one has to be more optimistic for the long run .
but presently , there is talk of a new cold war between the eu and russia .
one of the main disputes is about the power that moscow wields because of its massive reserves of oil and gas and its control over the transport of energy supplies from central asia .
how do you think this issue will be addressed at the summit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander rahr i think that this is a temporary situation .
the situation in general will stabilize and improve because russia needs its european partners and the european market in order to sell its goods .
it can not sit on its oil and get the sources alone .
it has to sell it .
on the other hand , the west also has to understand that the russia of today is not the russia of the 90s .
russia also has some new powers which we have to take into account .
what do you think russia 's expectations for the upcoming summit are ?
what does it hope to achieve ?
russia itself has a wait-and-see attitude .
it wants to have good cooperation with the european union , but it does not want to tolerate criticism of its interior policies .
russia says it wants a different kind of cooperation with the european union - not the kind of cooperation on mutual values , which the european union demands .
russia wants a purely pragmatic , business-like cooperation .
one of the main issues is the current state of human rights in russia .
some have complained that the eu has not protested enough against some of the human rights abuses in russia .
do you think this issue will be raised at the summit ?
this issue has been raised at every summit for many years .
but the fact that the problems are being raised will not lead to any solution .
russia will listen , but it will say , " the west does not understand us .
we have completely different problems and you , the west , should choose whether you want us as a pragmatic partner or whether you want to teach us democracy . "

a two-day informal meeting of european drug commissioners begins in berlin monday , two days after the interior ministers of the eu 's six largest countries agreed on closer cooperation with africa in the fight against drug smuggling from south america at a meeting in venice .
the venice meeting followed the three-day international drug enforcement conference in madrid last week which was hosted by the spanish government and the us drug enforcement agency -lrb- dea -rrb- , washington ’ s top anti-narcotics agency .
the talks on saturday were attended by eu justice commissioner franco frattini , the interior ministers of germany , britain , poland , france , spain and italy , and united states secretary of homeland security michael chertoff .
all supported the idea of sending european investigators to west africa as part of a new drive against the smugglers .
" we have agreed to cooperate with african countries in the effort to block the new routes of colombian cocaine to europe , " said spanish interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba .
the initiative to open a new front against the traffickers coming through africa comes hot on the heels of an agreement to set up a new european body that will share intelligence and coordinate police seizures of cocaine and cannabis on the high seas .
coordinated by britain , france , ireland , italy , portugal , spain and the netherlands , the body will be officially established in lisbon later this year .
europe offering high profit margins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of latin america 's output lands on european mirrors roughly 80 percent of cocaine from latin america that was destined for markets outside of the united states in 2005 was bound for europe , according to dea estimates .
international drug trafficking rings have been drawn to the european market because of the higher prices paid for cocaine on the continent .
last year wholesale prices for cocaine in the european union ranged between 28,000 and 56,600 euros -lrb- $ 38,000 and $ 77,000 -rrb- per kilogram compared to between $ 9,000 and $ 40,000 in the united states where the supply is higher , according to the dea .
" the potential for this high profit margin has increasingly lured colombian traffickers to european markets , " dea director of operations michael braun said during his testimony before the us congress last year .
africa is increasingly being used by criminal gangs as a hub for shipping latin american cocaine and asian heroin into europe .
consumption of cocaine and hashish is also on the rise in africa , spanish secretary of state for security antonio camacho said at the international drug enforcement conference on thursday .
" this is an issue which is very worrying because of its regional and global implications , " he said .
spain the coke gateway to the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coke ending up in the eu invariably comes through spain trafficking groups are taking advantage of weak governments in african nations as well as their historical ties to europe to smuggle drugs into the continent .
spain has become the main gateway for latin american cocaine and north african hashish into europe and has set up its own robust fight against drug smuggling .
spanish officials seized over 40 tons of cocaine last year , a record amount and more than any other nation in the world except for colombia , the united states and venezuela , camacho said .
" spain has a serious problem regarding rising drug consumption and i think it is in the interest of us all to cooperate more to fight drug trafficking , which in the case of colombia is totally linked to guerrilla groups and violence , " colombian defense minister juan manuel santos told reporters in madrid .
" cocaine is surging in europe at levels similar to what america experienced in the 1980s , " the head of the us drug enforcement administration , karen tandy , said at the three-day event in madrid .
low costs drive high consumption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european coke consumption is at a historical high around 10 million europeans , or over three percent of all adults , have used cocaine at least once in their lives , a historically high figure , according to the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- .
britain and spain posted the highest rates of use , with over four percent of adults reporting having consumed the drug over the past year compared to an average of around one percent of adults in all of europe .
use is concentrated among young adults , especially men , in urban areas .
a substantial drop in price has contributed to the increase in usage .
the price of cocaine on europe 's streets fell by 22 percent between 1999 and 2004 , according to emcdda .
the supply of cocaine in europe has increased since the late 1990s leading to lower prices and this , combined with its association to a supposedly glamorous lifestyle , is fueling its growing use , drug experts say .
" cocaine is very much associated with success , urban lifestyles , a party atmosphere , " emcdda analyst julian vicente told afp , before adding cocaine was now the second most used illegal drug in europe after cannabis . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report paints mixed picture of german drug and alcohol use germany 's annual report on drugs and addiction was released this week showing a overall decrease in drug-related deaths , but alarming data on prescription drug addiction and youth drinking .

but in the lead up to the 2007 g8 summit in germany , some economists are again raising the question of whether the right members are in the g8 club . just thinking about the current g8 members - germany , france , italy , great britain , russia , japan , the united states and canada - puts renowned economist jim o 'neill in a bad mood . " i have no idea why a country like italy is allowed to continue to be in the club , " said o 'neill , who is head of global economic research at investment bank goldman sachs . o 'neill is author of an influential report which argues that brazil , russia , india and china - the so-called brics - could become the four dominant economies by 2050 .
italy is noticeably absent in o 'neill 's report . " italy 's contribution to the world economy has been continually shrinking for a while now , but at g8 summits , italy is still a participatory to the official agreements about how the world functions today , " he said . lack of binding decisions like o 'neill , many others see the g8 as irrelevant and some would even love to see it dismantled immediately .
according to its critics , the g8 's lack of administrative structure and binding rules mean that although leaders broach issues such as debt relief and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , there are few concrete achievements . for o 'neill , the g8 members represent the world as it was more than 60 years ago and do n't reflect the current situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is predicted to overtake germany as the world 's third largest economy by 2008 " the worst thing is that the wrong participants are sitting at the g8 table , " said o 'neill .
" it is a somewhat simplistic idea to want to rule the world according to some post-war schematic , " he said . according to him , by the middle of the century , the brics are likely to have more economic weight that the current g7 countries -lrb- g8 without russia -rrb- put together .

he would prefer the introduction of rules regulating who has the right to sit at the table . " we should learn from soccer , and have a permanent league in which only the current world economic powers are allowed to play , " o 'neill said .

" we have to prevent that . " jung said the killing of civilians antagonized the local population and jeopardized international efforts to win the " hearts and minds " of ordinary afghans . " it is precisely the wrong tactic , " the defense minister said .

russia of today is not the russia of the 90s , said expert alexander rahr . alexander rahr is a russia expert from the german society for foreign affairs , a berlin-based research group .
dw-radio : do the ongoing disputes between russia and the eu make you pessimistic about the prospects for any breakthroughs at the upcoming summit ?
alexander rahr : in the short run , i 'm very skeptical and pessimistic about the possibility of improving relations between russia and the european union , but of course one has to be more optimistic for the long run .
but presently , there is talk of a new cold war between the eu and russia .
one of the main disputes is about the power that moscow wields because of its massive reserves of oil and gas and its control over the transport of energy supplies from central asia .
how do you think this issue will be addressed at the summit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander rahr i think that this is a temporary situation .
the situation in general will stabilize and improve because russia needs its european partners and the european market in order to sell its goods .
it can not sit on its oil and get the sources alone .
it has to sell it .
on the other hand , the west also has to understand that the russia of today is not the russia of the 90s .
russia also has some new powers which we have to take into account .
what do you think russia 's expectations for the upcoming summit are ?
what does it hope to achieve ?
russia itself has a wait-and-see attitude .
it wants to have good cooperation with the european union , but it does not want to tolerate criticism of its interior policies .
russia says it wants a different kind of cooperation with the european union - not the kind of cooperation on mutual values , which the european union demands .
russia wants a purely pragmatic , business-like cooperation .
one of the main issues is the current state of human rights in russia .
some have complained that the eu has not protested enough against some of the human rights abuses in russia .
do you think this issue will be raised at the summit ?
this issue has been raised at every summit for many years .
but the fact that the problems are being raised will not lead to any solution .
russia will listen , but it will say , " the west does not understand us .
we have completely different problems and you , the west , should choose whether you want us as a pragmatic partner or whether you want to teach us democracy . "

" we do n't want the population against us , " he said .
" we have to prevent that . " jung said the killing of civilians antagonized the local population and jeopardized international efforts to win the " hearts and minds " of ordinary afghans . " it is precisely the wrong tactic , " the defense minister said .

the operation , which marks an expansion in the bloc 's global security role , will be launched in mid-june and will focus on providing training to the afghan police force . " this mission represents a major contribution to establishing a professional police sector in afghanistan , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in a statement . the eu mission will take over from a german police training scheme already operational in afghanistan .

" we know that the russians are getting hot and bothered as well . " german foreign minster frank-walter steinmeier , however , said it would be impossible to predetermine exactly what the eu-russia summit results would be . " the situation is complicated but particularly in time of difficulties is important to talk , " he said before the preparatory meeting of eu ministers .
" we are going to try right up to the summit to resolve the conflict concerning polish meat .
i ca n't say whether we 'll be successful . " steinmeier added that neither the eu nor russia could afford to stop working together . " i am convinced the eu needs russia to solve international conflicts and russia is going to continue to be dependent on europe , so i am absolutely sure that on both sides reason must prevail , " he said . analysts however are skeptical that things will calm down .

washington says the system is aimed at averting attacks from countries like iran or north korea , but moscow sees the system as a direct threat that could trigger a new arms race and has announced a freeze on a landmark soviet-era arms limitation treaty . last month eu trade commissioner peter mandelson warned that mistrust and a lack of respect in the relations between the european union and russia are at their worst levels since the cold war .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crackdown on protestors in st petersburg last month sparked western criticism ahead of her visit , rice attacked what she called the " turning back " of freedoms in russia under putin and said " everybody around the world " was concerned . other bones of contention include constant delays in russia 's bid for membership of the world trade organization , russian opposition to independence for serbia 's kosovo province , and a meat trade dispute with eu member poland . " worst summit in history " the russia-eu meeting " will be the worst summit in history because there 's actually nothing that can be achieved in samara , " said fyodr lukyanov , editor of the journal russia in global affairs .
prospects for rice were " not much better , " he added . analysts said that much of the bad feeling is based on political maneuvering rather than concrete problems . " i think that russia and the european union tripped up on a step that should have led to better relations , " said mark entin , professor at moscow 's european studies institute .
" the step is russia becoming richer , faster , more confident .
at the same time , the european union is becoming bigger .
this is not seen as an opportunity , but as a challenge .
it 's a problem of mentality . "

" we need to make sure that in future operations do n't take place in this way , " jung told reporters on monday in brussels where he was meeting with his eu counterparts . " we do n't want the population against us , " he said .
" we have to prevent that . " jung said the killing of civilians antagonized the local population and jeopardized international efforts to win the " hearts and minds " of ordinary afghans . " it is precisely the wrong tactic , " the defense minister said .
jung added that he had raised the issue with nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz josef jung , pictured here with his us counterpart robert gates , used an unusually sharp tone in his criticism jung emphasized he was referring to the us anti-terrorist operation , enduring freedom , not action by the nato-led mission in afghanistan . nato is leading a force of some 36,000 troops from 37 nations in afghanistan which is trying to extend the political reach of president hamid karzai 's central government to more lawless outlying regions . the us-led coalition is a separate force around 10,000-strong which , while it does coordinate with the nato-led contingent , is mainly involved in " anti-terror " operations . us-led coalition air strikes in southern afghanistan recently killed at least 21 afghan civilians in a bombing campaign against taliban militants hiding in the sangin district of helmand province . this comes on top of reports that nearly 60 people were killed in us airstrikes late last month . eu police mission meanwhile , eu defense ministers agreed on monday to plans for the deployment of 160 police and law enforcement officers to afghanistan .

" the situation is complicated , " conceded steinmeier , as he arrived to chair talks in brussels with his eu counterparts .
" in this situation we need to present proposals and not -lrb- trade -rrb- accusations , " he said . steinmeier took pains to quash rumors that the summit would be cancelled . " it will take place , " he told reporters .
" we have to bring an end to these discussions about whether or not the summit will take place , " he added . " the eu needs russia to resolve international conflicts , but similarly russia continues to depend on europe , so i am absolutely sure that on both sides reason will prevail , " he said . merkel admits to problems earlier in the day , german chancellor angela merkel stressed the eu 's interests in maintaining strong ties with russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia removed this soviet memorial from central tallinn last month addressing european parliamentarians in berlin , merkel acknowledged that there were a " series of problems to overcome " but said she hoped the summit would " make clear that we are interested in a close strategic partnership with russia . " eu-russia relations have been tense for more than a year , especially since many felt russia had begun using its heft as a major energy supplier to promote its foreign policy goals . also casting a pall over the summit is the recent dispute between russia and eu member estonia over the removal of a soviet memorial in tallinn dedicated to red army soldiers who died in world war two . steinmeier said the german presidency had been " successful with our involvement " in calming tensions between russia and estonia , and that it " will of course continue to work to bring progress . " meat row but steinmeier was unsure whether the dispute over moscow 's ban of polish meat and farm produce would be resolved before the summit began on friday near the russian city of samara , on the banks of the volga .
russia says the ban is a food-safety issue , while poland accuses moscow of using it as a political tool . " we will try right up to the summit to resolve the conflict concerning polish meat , " steinmeier said , but added : " i could n't say whether we will be successful . " because of the ban , poland has veto talks on a new eu-russia partnership agreement meant to replace an existing accord which expires late this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo serbs might want russia 's help to oppose kosovo 's independence but russia 's stance on kosovo - a potential political powder keg in europe - is potentially more difficult to overcome . on saturday , the russian government threatened to use its un security council veto to stop " supervised independence " being granted to the majority ethnic albanian province in serbia , so as not to set an example to separatists elsewhere . " the most important issue the eu has to solve with russia is kosovo , " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn said . the eu has planned an important mission in kosovo to help supervise the transfer of powers from the united nations to the provincial authorities , once a decision on its status is finalized . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia set for stormy eu , us talks amid heightened tensions eu foreign ministers will meet to prepare for an eu-russia summit they hope will ease tensions heightened in recent months by issues as diverse as independence for kosovo , us missile defense plans and human rights .

" germany had a lack of manpower because many men were in the wehrmacht -lrb- nazi military -rrb- , " said jakub deka , a warsaw-based planning coordinator commissioned by the polish-german reconciliation foundation to plan the new exhibition , in an interview with german broadcaster deutschlandradio . lingering cause of tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some victims of forced labor have received financial compensation " they simply looked for labor in the conquered areas - not just in poland , but all over europe - and took it back to germany , " he said .
an estimated 3 million poles were subjected to forced labor under the nazi regime in germany following the invasion of poland in 1939 , which makes it a particularly sore topic in german-polish relations .
those capable of working were sent to munitions factories and coal mines to support the war effort , while children underwent a process of " germanization " in special schools .
treatment in the camps was harsh , and prisoners were often beaten and even shot for not working up to standard or trying to escape . promoting reconciliation the exhibit 's opening in germany was attended by survivors from wartime labor camps in flensburg , frankfurt , wolfsburg and berlin .
polish-born josef kuzba , a prisoner at the sachsenhausen concentration camp from 1940 to 1945 , has been discussing his experiences with children from the city 's archenhold gymnasium and sophie scholl oberschule . " the youngsters seemed well briefed about world war ii , " he said .
" it was a pleasure talking to them . " asked if he was apprehensive about visiting germany nowadays , he replied : " no , not at all .
i 'm a frequent visitor and have good relations with friends here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuzba talks about his experiences in sachsenhausen with school children kuzba , who was born in pomerania , and now lives in warsaw , said he had been active in promoting polish-german reconciliation for years . " remembrance is one thing , reconciliation another , " kuzba said .
" both are important for our nations . " mariusz muszynski , chairman of the foundation for polish-german reconciliation , wrote in the 205-page exhibit catalog that no other event in german-polish history had ever proved so burdensome to relations as the nazi-led invasion of poland . " material payments can never make up for the sorrow and suffering caused victims - but they were seen as a symbolic gesture of fairness and respect and a contributory step towards a better understanding between the two nations , " said muszynski . millions have been paid worldwide to german slave and forced labor victims following the enactment of a law by the german parliament and the creation of a " remembrance , responsibility , future " foundation . berlin first stop on german tour original nazi documents , photographs , biographies and a documentary film make up the exhibit , which will remain in berlin until mid-october before it continues on to other german cities .
it has already been viewed by 80,000 visitors during its tour in poland .
the camp where the exhibit is currently housed was built in 1943 by albert speer , nazi minister of infrastructure and munitions , for over 2,000 workers .
it is one of 3,000 such nazi camps built in the berlin area and one of only few nazi labor camps remaining . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parliament condemns chinese labor camps , irks beijing amid protests from beijing , the german parliament thursday condemned chinese labor camps and called for special labels on goods produced in labor camps .

" the situation is complicated , " conceded steinmeier , as he arrived to chair talks in brussels with his eu counterparts .
" in this situation we need to present proposals and not -lrb- trade -rrb- accusations , " he said . steinmeier took pains to quash rumors that the summit would be cancelled . " it will take place , " he told reporters .
" we have to bring an end to these discussions about whether or not the summit will take place , " he added . " the eu needs russia to resolve international conflicts , but similarly russia continues to depend on europe , so i am absolutely sure that on both sides reason will prevail , " he said . merkel admits to problems earlier in the day , german chancellor angela merkel stressed the eu 's interests in maintaining strong ties with russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia removed this soviet memorial from central tallinn last month addressing european parliamentarians in berlin , merkel acknowledged that there were a " series of problems to overcome " but said she hoped the summit would " make clear that we are interested in a close strategic partnership with russia . " eu-russia relations have been tense for more than a year , especially since many felt russia had begun using its heft as a major energy supplier to promote its foreign policy goals . also casting a pall over the summit is the recent dispute between russia and eu member estonia over the removal of a soviet memorial in tallinn dedicated to red army soldiers who died in world war two . steinmeier said the german presidency had been " successful with our involvement " in calming tensions between russia and estonia , and that it " will of course continue to work to bring progress . " meat row but steinmeier was unsure whether the dispute over moscow 's ban of polish meat and farm produce would be resolved before the summit began on friday near the russian city of samara , on the banks of the volga .
russia says the ban is a food-safety issue , while poland accuses moscow of using it as a political tool . " we will try right up to the summit to resolve the conflict concerning polish meat , " steinmeier said , but added : " i could n't say whether we will be successful . " because of the ban , poland has veto talks on a new eu-russia partnership agreement meant to replace an existing accord which expires late this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo serbs might want russia 's help to oppose kosovo 's independence but russia 's stance on kosovo - a potential political powder keg in europe - is potentially more difficult to overcome . on saturday , the russian government threatened to use its un security council veto to stop " supervised independence " being granted to the majority ethnic albanian province in serbia , so as not to set an example to separatists elsewhere . " the most important issue the eu has to solve with russia is kosovo , " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn said . the eu has planned an important mission in kosovo to help supervise the transfer of powers from the united nations to the provincial authorities , once a decision on its status is finalized . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia set for stormy eu , us talks amid heightened tensions eu foreign ministers will meet to prepare for an eu-russia summit they hope will ease tensions heightened in recent months by issues as diverse as independence for kosovo , us missile defense plans and human rights .

when the dutch-jewish singer tried to flee with her family into liberated belgium in 1944 , the escapees are betrayed and shot by the nazis . rachel , played by dutch actress carice van houten , is the only survivor .
she changes her name to ellis de vries , dyes her hair blond and joins the dutch resistance movement .
in one decisive scene , rachel - fleeing from the gestapo - boards a train with two suitcases full of weapons and finds herself in the same car as the head of the ss in the hague , ludwig müntze . " beautiful women should n't carry heavy suitcases , " says müntze , played by german actor sebastian koch , who also had a leading role in this year 's oscar winner , " the lives of others .

but not two of germany 's leading soccer stars , who sued germany 's leading sex shop chain for doing just that .
now the sex shop has to pay up . as soccer mania started building to fever pitch in the run-up to last year 's world cup in germany , sex shop chain beate uhse thought it would take advantage of the near deification of some of the country 's national team soccer players .
it marketed two vibrators under the names " michael b. " and " olli k , " which appear to be clear references to michael ballack , now a midfielder at chelsea , and oliver kahn , bayern munich 's goalkeeper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack , sex symbol ?
maybe ...
while probably many women , and more than a few men , instantly felt an erotic frisson at the thought of taking one of the two athletes to bed , the soccer stars themselves were not amused .
they took beate uhse to court , charging them with unauthorized use of their names .
the two men are not averse to making product endorsements ; they just did n't want to do it for free , or maybe for a sex toy .
just a coincidence , really for its part , beate uhse has always insisted the company was innocent .
the vibrators , 17 cm -lrb- 6.7 inches -rrb- long and advertised as " cuddly " and " cheeky , " were not modelled on the stars ' own , er , equipment .
according to beate uhse , the company did not mean to convince buyers they were going to be getting to know the men , at least vicariously , up close and very personally .
" we never had any intention to make a connection between the vibrators on sale in our shops with the names of ' olli k. ' and ' michael b. ' and the footballers , " company spokesperson assia tsernookoff insisted at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver kahn , sex symbol ?
maybe not still , beate uhse pulled the two models off the shelves after the men fired up their lawyers .
now a court says the shop has to pay up .
beate uhse will be sending both of the millionaires 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 67,380 -rrb- for their trouble .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 14.05.2007 rubbish managers say germans are number one in recycling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : separating packaging from trash is no easy matter some people say no one likes to separate their trash as much as germans - even troops stationed in afghanistan are reported to separate their rubbish .
it 's a chacteristic that trash pleases trash management companies . separating trash for recycling is no easy matter .
for one thing , it 's sometimes difficult discerning whether the trash in your hand is actually packaging , glass , paper , hazardous or organic waste .
what bin do you use when packaging includes both cardboard and plastic ? but after you 've gone through the trouble of washing your hands of your many types of rubbish , you can at least know it 's worth it - economically , as well as for the planet . dealing in trash makes good business sense .
waste management has become a major industry in germany - with 250,000 employees in the sector , and the rubbish people throw away also generates turnover of 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 67.7 billion -rrb- . so what 's the point ? " i do try to recycle , " said one woman .
" i put paper in the blue recycling bin , yoghurt containers and tin foil in the yellow bins for packaging , and we also recycle bottles . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yellow bags hopefully carrying " green dot " packaging another woman said she 's made a conscious choice not to throw plastic in the packaging recycling bin . " you 're supposed to clean out yoghurt containers , but that uses a lot of water , and i do n't think it 's a good idea to waste so much , " she said .
" besides , people say anyway that everything is thrown back together again and then burned at the incineration plant . " in the western german city of cologne , for example , the packaging thrown into recycling bins lands in the hands of remondis , a collection company , then taken to a facility , where the so-called " dsd " trash is sorted .
visiting the remondis plant , you 'll find a mound of trash consisting of yoghurts cups , plastic wrapping and aluminum cans . dsd stands for duales system deutschland -lrb- dual system germany -rrb- , a company established in 1990 . in 1991 , a special german packaging ordinance came into force and required product manufacturers and vendors to take back packaging once the products have been used and arranged for their recycling .
dsd organizes this system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how to sort your rubbish in the berlin subway ?
packaging marked what is called the grüner punkt or green dot is part of this system .
only packaging with the green dot is supposed to be placed either in special yellow plastic bags placed outside for pickup , or placed in yellow recycling containers . refuse companies say that in international comparisons , germans are number one in recycling their packaging .
but the figures are disputed . according to dsd , largely a monopoly in the recycling sector , each consumer in germany recycles around 76 kilograms -lrb- 167 pounds -rrb- of packaging a year . critics say that translates into about 30 items of packaging per day , which they claim is unrealistic .
they estimate that on the average , each person recycles around 26 kilograms of dsd trash annually . what 's a recyclable wrapping ? but does everyone separate properly ?
do they put only " green dot " product wrappings in the yellow bags and boxes ? jürgen lennertz , director of the remondis plant in cologne , said that " people throw from 30 to 50 percent of packaging without the green dot into the yellow containers . " what is thrown in there is everything from plastic pots for plants to garden hoses .
udo koch , remondis operations manager , hit the point home with the rhetorical question : " now is that packaging ? " koch also said people also throw frying pans , cameras and even dirty diapers into the yellow recycling bins . the good news is that modern sorting machines can recognize and categorize about 90 percent of rubbish , leaving about 5 percent to be sorted by hand . the bigger picture so machines do help germans be international leaders in divvying up their trash .
koch said there is a reason for it all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ha schult has made art out of trash " i think a lot of people are thinking about the climate right now , " he said .
" the amount of energy necessary to recycle product wrappings is much less than what you need to produce the packaging in the first place . " critics , however , disagree .
they say more energy is needed to recycle smaller wrapping items than to generate them . either way , around 50 percent to 70 percent of the " yellow bin content " can be recycled . the rest , which can not is incinerated , also generates energy .
the cologne-based avg , a waste management and incineration company , said it could pass along 400,000 megawatts of power and 230,000 tons of steam to the energy industry in 2006 resulting from waste incineration . tuba tuncak -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a recycled bottle story : from drink container to winter sweater ever wonder what happens to all those plastic bottles the germans seem to be perpetually recycling ?

it 's a chacteristic that trash pleases trash management companies . separating trash for recycling is no easy matter .
for one thing , it 's sometimes difficult discerning whether the trash in your hand is actually packaging , glass , paper , hazardous or organic waste .
what bin do you use when packaging includes both cardboard and plastic ? but after you 've gone through the trouble of washing your hands of your many types of rubbish , you can at least know it 's worth it - economically , as well as for the planet . dealing in trash makes good business sense .
waste management has become a major industry in germany - with 250,000 employees in the sector , and the rubbish people throw away also generates turnover of 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 67.7 billion -rrb- . so what 's the point ? " i do try to recycle , " said one woman .
" i put paper in the blue recycling bin , yoghurt containers and tin foil in the yellow bins for packaging , and we also recycle bottles . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yellow bags hopefully carrying " green dot " packaging another woman said she 's made a conscious choice not to throw plastic in the packaging recycling bin . " you 're supposed to clean out yoghurt containers , but that uses a lot of water , and i do n't think it 's a good idea to waste so much , " she said .
" besides , people say anyway that everything is thrown back together again and then burned at the incineration plant . " in the western german city of cologne , for example , the packaging thrown into recycling bins lands in the hands of remondis , a collection company , then taken to a facility , where the so-called " dsd " trash is sorted .
visiting the remondis plant , you 'll find a mound of trash consisting of yoghurts cups , plastic wrapping and aluminum cans . dsd stands for duales system deutschland -lrb- dual system germany -rrb- , a company established in 1990 . in 1991 , a special german packaging ordinance came into force and required product manufacturers and vendors to take back packaging once the products have been used and arranged for their recycling .
dsd organizes this system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how to sort your rubbish in the berlin subway ?
packaging marked what is called the grüner punkt or green dot is part of this system .
only packaging with the green dot is supposed to be placed either in special yellow plastic bags placed outside for pickup , or placed in yellow recycling containers . refuse companies say that in international comparisons , germans are number one in recycling their packaging .
but the figures are disputed . according to dsd , largely a monopoly in the recycling sector , each consumer in germany recycles around 76 kilograms -lrb- 167 pounds -rrb- of packaging a year . critics say that translates into about 30 items of packaging per day , which they claim is unrealistic .
they estimate that on the average , each person recycles around 26 kilograms of dsd trash annually . what 's a recyclable wrapping ? but does everyone separate properly ?
do they put only " green dot " product wrappings in the yellow bags and boxes ? jürgen lennertz , director of the remondis plant in cologne , said that " people throw from 30 to 50 percent of packaging without the green dot into the yellow containers . " what is thrown in there is everything from plastic pots for plants to garden hoses .
udo koch , remondis operations manager , hit the point home with the rhetorical question : " now is that packaging ? " koch also said people also throw frying pans , cameras and even dirty diapers into the yellow recycling bins . the good news is that modern sorting machines can recognize and categorize about 90 percent of rubbish , leaving about 5 percent to be sorted by hand . the bigger picture so machines do help germans be international leaders in divvying up their trash .
koch said there is a reason for it all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ha schult has made art out of trash " i think a lot of people are thinking about the climate right now , " he said .
" the amount of energy necessary to recycle product wrappings is much less than what you need to produce the packaging in the first place . " critics , however , disagree .
they say more energy is needed to recycle smaller wrapping items than to generate them . either way , around 50 percent to 70 percent of the " yellow bin content " can be recycled . the rest , which can not is incinerated , also generates energy .
the cologne-based avg , a waste management and incineration company , said it could pass along 400,000 megawatts of power and 230,000 tons of steam to the energy industry in 2006 resulting from waste incineration . tuba tuncak -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a recycled bottle story : from drink container to winter sweater ever wonder what happens to all those plastic bottles the germans seem to be perpetually recycling ?

it 's a chacteristic that trash pleases trash management companies . separating trash for recycling is no easy matter .
for one thing , it 's sometimes difficult discerning whether the trash in your hand is actually packaging , glass , paper , hazardous or organic waste .

but the figures are disputed . according to dsd , largely a monopoly in the recycling sector , each consumer in germany recycles around 76 kilograms -lrb- 167 pounds -rrb- of packaging a year . critics say that translates into about 30 items of packaging per day , which they claim is unrealistic .

they say more energy is needed to recycle smaller wrapping items than to generate them . either way , around 50 percent to 70 percent of the " yellow bin content " can be recycled . the rest , which can not is incinerated , also generates energy .

do n't leave bonn without him großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven was born in bonn in 1770 , but lived most of his life in vienna visitors to bonn are certain to go home with a beethoven souvenir .
after all , the former capital has learned to make the most of its connection to its famous son . they come from all over the world and have one thing in common - they 've come to follow in the footsteps of ludwig van beethoven .
in bonn , where the composer lived from his birth in 1770 until the age of 22 , that 's not hard to do .
beethoven is practically everywhere - visitors are bound to come across his serious-looking profile on everything from suspenders and umbrellas to ball-point pens and chocolate truffles .
the larger-than-life statue of beethoven on bonn 's central münster square , across from the main post office , has long since become an important landmark in the city .
in fact , the monument 's consecration in 1845 , timed to coincide with the composer 's 75th birthday , was celebrated with a three-day music festival organized by none other than franz liszt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this monument was erected for beethoven 's 75th birthday " it definitely belongs in my germany photo album , " said tourist xianguo zhong from shanghai while posing for the camera together with the colossal composer .
beethoven sells every year , some 500,000 tourists and business travellers , many of them from asia , stop in bonn .
along with bonn 's many museums , beethoven is one of the former capital 's most significant attractions .
the annual beethoven festival , in particular , draws the crowds .
it has its roots in franz liszt 's 1845 festival and is a special highlight for music lovers from all over the world .
bonn tourism officials have quickly learned that , quite simply , beethoven sells .
in addition to her picture in front of the statue , xianguo zhong went home with a t-shirt with a picture of the composer on it .
" in china , every kid knows who beethoven is , " she said .
" we read stories about him in elementary school . "
souvenirs galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house attracts around 100,000 visitors per year the museum gift shop in the composer 's birth house has over 800 beethoven souvenirs on offer , including beer glasses , thimbles , playing cards , stationary and ties all printed with a variety of beethoven motives .
each year , around 100,000 pilgrims visit the house on bonngasse , where they can view some of the composer 's instruments , hand-written correspondence and original manuscripts - and take home reproductions of the " moonlight sonata " or " für elise " manuscripts printed on silk scarves and porcelain plates .
particularly enthusiastic beethoven fans can even take home a bit of the composer himself - at least from the shoulders up .
visitors can choose from 20 different types of beethoven busts measuring between five and 55 centimeters -lrb- two to 22 inches -rrb- tall and costing up to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,350 -rrb- .
the gift shop 's best-sellers , however , are the cds of the composer 's music .
they even offer a recording that simulates beethoven 's hearing loss with changes to the volume and sound of the music .
the birth house also holds a substantial beethoven archive and library .

" the situation is complicated , " conceded steinmeier , as he arrived to chair talks in brussels with his eu counterparts .
" in this situation we need to present proposals and not -lrb- trade -rrb- accusations , " he said . steinmeier took pains to quash rumors that the summit would be cancelled . " it will take place , " he told reporters .
" we have to bring an end to these discussions about whether or not the summit will take place , " he added . " the eu needs russia to resolve international conflicts , but similarly russia continues to depend on europe , so i am absolutely sure that on both sides reason will prevail , " he said . merkel admits to problems earlier in the day , german chancellor angela merkel stressed the eu 's interests in maintaining strong ties with russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia removed this soviet memorial from central tallinn last month addressing european parliamentarians in berlin , merkel acknowledged that there were a " series of problems to overcome " but said she hoped the summit would " make clear that we are interested in a close strategic partnership with russia . " eu-russia relations have been tense for more than a year , especially since many felt russia had begun using its heft as a major energy supplier to promote its foreign policy goals . also casting a pall over the summit is the recent dispute between russia and eu member estonia over the removal of a soviet memorial in tallinn dedicated to red army soldiers who died in world war two . steinmeier said the german presidency had been " successful with our involvement " in calming tensions between russia and estonia , and that it " will of course continue to work to bring progress . " meat row but steinmeier was unsure whether the dispute over moscow 's ban of polish meat and farm produce would be resolved before the summit began on friday near the russian city of samara , on the banks of the volga .
russia says the ban is a food-safety issue , while poland accuses moscow of using it as a political tool . " we will try right up to the summit to resolve the conflict concerning polish meat , " steinmeier said , but added : " i could n't say whether we will be successful .

" the most important issue the eu has to solve with russia is kosovo , " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn said . the eu has planned an important mission in kosovo to help supervise the transfer of powers from the united nations to the provincial authorities , once a decision on its status is finalized . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia set for stormy eu , us talks amid heightened tensions eu foreign ministers will meet to prepare for an eu-russia summit they hope will ease tensions heightened in recent months by issues as diverse as independence for kosovo , us missile defense plans and human rights .

" the situation is complicated , " conceded steinmeier , as he arrived to chair talks in brussels with his eu counterparts .
" in this situation we need to present proposals and not -lrb- trade -rrb- accusations , " he said . steinmeier took pains to quash rumors that the summit would be cancelled . " it will take place , " he told reporters .
" we have to bring an end to these discussions about whether or not the summit will take place , " he added . " the eu needs russia to resolve international conflicts , but similarly russia continues to depend on europe , so i am absolutely sure that on both sides reason will prevail , " he said . merkel admits to problems earlier in the day , german chancellor angela merkel stressed the eu 's interests in maintaining strong ties with russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia removed this soviet memorial from central tallinn last month addressing european parliamentarians in berlin , merkel acknowledged that there were a " series of problems to overcome " but said she hoped the summit would " make clear that we are interested in a close strategic partnership with russia . " eu-russia relations have been tense for more than a year , especially since many felt russia had begun using its heft as a major energy supplier to promote its foreign policy goals . also casting a pall over the summit is the recent dispute between russia and eu member estonia over the removal of a soviet memorial in tallinn dedicated to red army soldiers who died in world war two . steinmeier said the german presidency had been " successful with our involvement " in calming tensions between russia and estonia , and that it " will of course continue to work to bring progress . " meat row but steinmeier was unsure whether the dispute over moscow 's ban of polish meat and farm produce would be resolved before the summit began on friday near the russian city of samara , on the banks of the volga .
russia says the ban is a food-safety issue , while poland accuses moscow of using it as a political tool . " we will try right up to the summit to resolve the conflict concerning polish meat , " steinmeier said , but added : " i could n't say whether we will be successful . " because of the ban , poland has veto talks on a new eu-russia partnership agreement meant to replace an existing accord which expires late this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo serbs might want russia 's help to oppose kosovo 's independence but russia 's stance on kosovo - a potential political powder keg in europe - is potentially more difficult to overcome . on saturday , the russian government threatened to use its un security council veto to stop " supervised independence " being granted to the majority ethnic albanian province in serbia , so as not to set an example to separatists elsewhere . " the most important issue the eu has to solve with russia is kosovo , " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn said . the eu has planned an important mission in kosovo to help supervise the transfer of powers from the united nations to the provincial authorities , once a decision on its status is finalized . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia set for stormy eu , us talks amid heightened tensions eu foreign ministers will meet to prepare for an eu-russia summit they hope will ease tensions heightened in recent months by issues as diverse as independence for kosovo , us missile defense plans and human rights .

when the dutch-jewish singer tried to flee with her family into liberated belgium in 1944 , the escapees are betrayed and shot by the nazis . rachel , played by dutch actress carice van houten , is the only survivor .
she changes her name to ellis de vries , dyes her hair blond and joins the dutch resistance movement .
in one decisive scene , rachel - fleeing from the gestapo - boards a train with two suitcases full of weapons and finds herself in the same car as the head of the ss in the hague , ludwig müntze . " beautiful women should n't carry heavy suitcases , " says müntze , played by german actor sebastian koch , who also had a leading role in this year 's oscar winner , " the lives of others .

for the viewer , the lines between good and evil are intentionally blurred . he portrays the dutch resistance movement , for example , as being a sometimes volatile mix of nationalists , communists and christian pacifists , which is gnawed at by latent anti-semitism . a critical view of war-time society surprisingly , this critical view of the dutch resistance did not provoke as much criticism in the netherlands as might have been expected .

" statistics show how the dutch behaved during the war .

" the situation is complicated , " conceded steinmeier , as he arrived to chair talks in brussels with his eu counterparts .
" in this situation we need to present proposals and not -lrb- trade -rrb- accusations , " he said . steinmeier took pains to quash rumors that the summit would be cancelled . " it will take place , " he told reporters .
" we have to bring an end to these discussions about whether or not the summit will take place , " he added . " the eu needs russia to resolve international conflicts , but similarly russia continues to depend on europe , so i am absolutely sure that on both sides reason will prevail , " he said . merkel admits to problems earlier in the day , german chancellor angela merkel stressed the eu 's interests in maintaining strong ties with russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia removed this soviet memorial from central tallinn last month addressing european parliamentarians in berlin , merkel acknowledged that there were a " series of problems to overcome " but said she hoped the summit would " make clear that we are interested in a close strategic partnership with russia . " eu-russia relations have been tense for more than a year , especially since many felt russia had begun using its heft as a major energy supplier to promote its foreign policy goals . also casting a pall over the summit is the recent dispute between russia and eu member estonia over the removal of a soviet memorial in tallinn dedicated to red army soldiers who died in world war two . steinmeier said the german presidency had been " successful with our involvement " in calming tensions between russia and estonia , and that it " will of course continue to work to bring progress . " meat row but steinmeier was unsure whether the dispute over moscow 's ban of polish meat and farm produce would be resolved before the summit began on friday near the russian city of samara , on the banks of the volga .
russia says the ban is a food-safety issue , while poland accuses moscow of using it as a political tool . " we will try right up to the summit to resolve the conflict concerning polish meat , " steinmeier said , but added : " i could n't say whether we will be successful . " because of the ban , poland has veto talks on a new eu-russia partnership agreement meant to replace an existing accord which expires late this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo serbs might want russia 's help to oppose kosovo 's independence but russia 's stance on kosovo - a potential political powder keg in europe - is potentially more difficult to overcome . on saturday , the russian government threatened to use its un security council veto to stop " supervised independence " being granted to the majority ethnic albanian province in serbia , so as not to set an example to separatists elsewhere . " the most important issue the eu has to solve with russia is kosovo , " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn said . the eu has planned an important mission in kosovo to help supervise the transfer of powers from the united nations to the provincial authorities , once a decision on its status is finalized . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia set for stormy eu , us talks amid heightened tensions eu foreign ministers will meet to prepare for an eu-russia summit they hope will ease tensions heightened in recent months by issues as diverse as independence for kosovo , us missile defense plans and human rights .

it 's a chacteristic that trash pleases trash management companies . separating trash for recycling is no easy matter .
for one thing , it 's sometimes difficult discerning whether the trash in your hand is actually packaging , glass , paper , hazardous or organic waste .
what bin do you use when packaging includes both cardboard and plastic ? but after you 've gone through the trouble of washing your hands of your many types of rubbish , you can at least know it 's worth it - economically , as well as for the planet . dealing in trash makes good business sense .
waste management has become a major industry in germany - with 250,000 employees in the sector , and the rubbish people throw away also generates turnover of 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 67.7 billion -rrb- . so what 's the point ? " i do try to recycle , " said one woman .
" i put paper in the blue recycling bin , yoghurt containers and tin foil in the yellow bins for packaging , and we also recycle bottles . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yellow bags hopefully carrying " green dot " packaging another woman said she 's made a conscious choice not to throw plastic in the packaging recycling bin . " you 're supposed to clean out yoghurt containers , but that uses a lot of water , and i do n't think it 's a good idea to waste so much , " she said .
" besides , people say anyway that everything is thrown back together again and then burned at the incineration plant . " in the western german city of cologne , for example , the packaging thrown into recycling bins lands in the hands of remondis , a collection company , then taken to a facility , where the so-called " dsd " trash is sorted .
visiting the remondis plant , you 'll find a mound of trash consisting of yoghurts cups , plastic wrapping and aluminum cans . dsd stands for duales system deutschland -lrb- dual system germany -rrb- , a company established in 1990 . in 1991 , a special german packaging ordinance came into force and required product manufacturers and vendors to take back packaging once the products have been used and arranged for their recycling .
dsd organizes this system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how to sort your rubbish in the berlin subway ?
packaging marked what is called the grüner punkt or green dot is part of this system .
only packaging with the green dot is supposed to be placed either in special yellow plastic bags placed outside for pickup , or placed in yellow recycling containers . refuse companies say that in international comparisons , germans are number one in recycling their packaging .
but the figures are disputed . according to dsd , largely a monopoly in the recycling sector , each consumer in germany recycles around 76 kilograms -lrb- 167 pounds -rrb- of packaging a year . critics say that translates into about 30 items of packaging per day , which they claim is unrealistic .
they estimate that on the average , each person recycles around 26 kilograms of dsd trash annually . what 's a recyclable wrapping ? but does everyone separate properly ?
do they put only " green dot " product wrappings in the yellow bags and boxes ? jürgen lennertz , director of the remondis plant in cologne , said that " people throw from 30 to 50 percent of packaging without the green dot into the yellow containers . " what is thrown in there is everything from plastic pots for plants to garden hoses .
udo koch , remondis operations manager , hit the point home with the rhetorical question : " now is that packaging ? " koch also said people also throw frying pans , cameras and even dirty diapers into the yellow recycling bins . the good news is that modern sorting machines can recognize and categorize about 90 percent of rubbish , leaving about 5 percent to be sorted by hand . the bigger picture so machines do help germans be international leaders in divvying up their trash .
koch said there is a reason for it all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ha schult has made art out of trash " i think a lot of people are thinking about the climate right now , " he said .
" the amount of energy necessary to recycle product wrappings is much less than what you need to produce the packaging in the first place . " critics , however , disagree .
they say more energy is needed to recycle smaller wrapping items than to generate them . either way , around 50 percent to 70 percent of the " yellow bin content " can be recycled . the rest , which can not is incinerated , also generates energy .
the cologne-based avg , a waste management and incineration company , said it could pass along 400,000 megawatts of power and 230,000 tons of steam to the energy industry in 2006 resulting from waste incineration . tuba tuncak -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a recycled bottle story : from drink container to winter sweater ever wonder what happens to all those plastic bottles the germans seem to be perpetually recycling ?

it 's a chacteristic that trash pleases trash management companies . separating trash for recycling is no easy matter .
for one thing , it 's sometimes difficult discerning whether the trash in your hand is actually packaging , glass , paper , hazardous or organic waste .
what bin do you use when packaging includes both cardboard and plastic ? but after you 've gone through the trouble of washing your hands of your many types of rubbish , you can at least know it 's worth it - economically , as well as for the planet . dealing in trash makes good business sense .
waste management has become a major industry in germany - with 250,000 employees in the sector , and the rubbish people throw away also generates turnover of 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 67.7 billion -rrb- . so what 's the point ? " i do try to recycle , " said one woman .
" i put paper in the blue recycling bin , yoghurt containers and tin foil in the yellow bins for packaging , and we also recycle bottles . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yellow bags hopefully carrying " green dot " packaging another woman said she 's made a conscious choice not to throw plastic in the packaging recycling bin . " you 're supposed to clean out yoghurt containers , but that uses a lot of water , and i do n't think it 's a good idea to waste so much , " she said .
" besides , people say anyway that everything is thrown back together again and then burned at the incineration plant . " in the western german city of cologne , for example , the packaging thrown into recycling bins lands in the hands of remondis , a collection company , then taken to a facility , where the so-called " dsd " trash is sorted .
visiting the remondis plant , you 'll find a mound of trash consisting of yoghurts cups , plastic wrapping and aluminum cans . dsd stands for duales system deutschland -lrb- dual system germany -rrb- , a company established in 1990 . in 1991 , a special german packaging ordinance came into force and required product manufacturers and vendors to take back packaging once the products have been used and arranged for their recycling .
dsd organizes this system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how to sort your rubbish in the berlin subway ?
packaging marked what is called the grüner punkt or green dot is part of this system .
only packaging with the green dot is supposed to be placed either in special yellow plastic bags placed outside for pickup , or placed in yellow recycling containers . refuse companies say that in international comparisons , germans are number one in recycling their packaging .
but the figures are disputed . according to dsd , largely a monopoly in the recycling sector , each consumer in germany recycles around 76 kilograms -lrb- 167 pounds -rrb- of packaging a year . critics say that translates into about 30 items of packaging per day , which they claim is unrealistic .
they estimate that on the average , each person recycles around 26 kilograms of dsd trash annually . what 's a recyclable wrapping ? but does everyone separate properly ?
do they put only " green dot " product wrappings in the yellow bags and boxes ? jürgen lennertz , director of the remondis plant in cologne , said that " people throw from 30 to 50 percent of packaging without the green dot into the yellow containers .

it 's a chacteristic that trash pleases trash management companies . separating trash for recycling is no easy matter .
for one thing , it 's sometimes difficult discerning whether the trash in your hand is actually packaging , glass , paper , hazardous or organic waste .
what bin do you use when packaging includes both cardboard and plastic ? but after you 've gone through the trouble of washing your hands of your many types of rubbish , you can at least know it 's worth it - economically , as well as for the planet . dealing in trash makes good business sense .
waste management has become a major industry in germany - with 250,000 employees in the sector , and the rubbish people throw away also generates turnover of 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 67.7 billion -rrb- . so what 's the point ? " i do try to recycle , " said one woman .
" i put paper in the blue recycling bin , yoghurt containers and tin foil in the yellow bins for packaging , and we also recycle bottles . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yellow bags hopefully carrying " green dot " packaging another woman said she 's made a conscious choice not to throw plastic in the packaging recycling bin .

only packaging with the green dot is supposed to be placed either in special yellow plastic bags placed outside for pickup , or placed in yellow recycling containers . refuse companies say that in international comparisons , germans are number one in recycling their packaging .
but the figures are disputed . according to dsd , largely a monopoly in the recycling sector , each consumer in germany recycles around 76 kilograms -lrb- 167 pounds -rrb- of packaging a year . critics say that translates into about 30 items of packaging per day , which they claim is unrealistic .

do n't leave bonn without him großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven was born in bonn in 1770 , but lived most of his life in vienna visitors to bonn are certain to go home with a beethoven souvenir .
after all , the former capital has learned to make the most of its connection to its famous son . they come from all over the world and have one thing in common - they 've come to follow in the footsteps of ludwig van beethoven .
in bonn , where the composer lived from his birth in 1770 until the age of 22 , that 's not hard to do .
beethoven is practically everywhere - visitors are bound to come across his serious-looking profile on everything from suspenders and umbrellas to ball-point pens and chocolate truffles .
the larger-than-life statue of beethoven on bonn 's central münster square , across from the main post office , has long since become an important landmark in the city .
in fact , the monument 's consecration in 1845 , timed to coincide with the composer 's 75th birthday , was celebrated with a three-day music festival organized by none other than franz liszt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this monument was erected for beethoven 's 75th birthday " it definitely belongs in my germany photo album , " said tourist xianguo zhong from shanghai while posing for the camera together with the colossal composer .
beethoven sells every year , some 500,000 tourists and business travellers , many of them from asia , stop in bonn .
along with bonn 's many museums , beethoven is one of the former capital 's most significant attractions .
the annual beethoven festival , in particular , draws the crowds .
it has its roots in franz liszt 's 1845 festival and is a special highlight for music lovers from all over the world .
bonn tourism officials have quickly learned that , quite simply , beethoven sells .
in addition to her picture in front of the statue , xianguo zhong went home with a t-shirt with a picture of the composer on it .
" in china , every kid knows who beethoven is , " she said .
" we read stories about him in elementary school . "
souvenirs galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house attracts around 100,000 visitors per year the museum gift shop in the composer 's birth house has over 800 beethoven souvenirs on offer , including beer glasses , thimbles , playing cards , stationary and ties all printed with a variety of beethoven motives .
each year , around 100,000 pilgrims visit the house on bonngasse , where they can view some of the composer 's instruments , hand-written correspondence and original manuscripts - and take home reproductions of the " moonlight sonata " or " für elise " manuscripts printed on silk scarves and porcelain plates .
particularly enthusiastic beethoven fans can even take home a bit of the composer himself - at least from the shoulders up .
visitors can choose from 20 different types of beethoven busts measuring between five and 55 centimeters -lrb- two to 22 inches -rrb- tall and costing up to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,350 -rrb- .
the gift shop 's best-sellers , however , are the cds of the composer 's music .
they even offer a recording that simulates beethoven 's hearing loss with changes to the volume and sound of the music .
the birth house also holds a substantial beethoven archive and library .

but in the lead up to the 2007 g8 summit in germany , some economists are again raising the question of whether the right members are in the g8 club . just thinking about the current g8 members - germany , france , italy , great britain , russia , japan , the united states and canada - puts renowned economist jim o 'neill in a bad mood . " i have no idea why a country like italy is allowed to continue to be in the club , " said o 'neill , who is head of global economic research at investment bank goldman sachs . o 'neill is author of an influential report which argues that brazil , russia , india and china - the so-called brics - could become the four dominant economies by 2050 .
italy is noticeably absent in o 'neill 's report . " italy 's contribution to the world economy has been continually shrinking for a while now , but at g8 summits , italy is still a participatory to the official agreements about how the world functions today , " he said . lack of binding decisions like o 'neill , many others see the g8 as irrelevant and some would even love to see it dismantled immediately .
according to its critics , the g8 's lack of administrative structure and binding rules mean that although leaders broach issues such as debt relief and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , there are few concrete achievements . for o 'neill , the g8 members represent the world as it was more than 60 years ago and do n't reflect the current situation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is predicted to overtake germany as the world 's third largest economy by 2008 " the worst thing is that the wrong participants are sitting at the g8 table , " said o 'neill .
" it is a somewhat simplistic idea to want to rule the world according to some post-war schematic , " he said . according to him , by the middle of the century , the brics are likely to have more economic weight that the current g7 countries -lrb- g8 without russia -rrb- put together .
the economy of china alone in 2050 is likely to be 20 times bigger than it is today and will have overtaken the usa as the world 's biggest , o 'neill predicted . changing world economy russia was admitted to the group of eight in 1997 , becoming the first new member since canada came on board in 1976 .
critics like o 'neill say the g8 ca n't continue to ignore the dramatic changes to the global economy . after all , it was n't until the gleneagles summit in 2005 that the heads of states agreed to hold a separate set of meetings with ministers from emerging economies of china , india , brazil , south africa and mexico , now known as the g8 + 5 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2007 , five developing countries attended the g8 environment ministers meeting for the first time peter hajnal , an academic with the g8 research group at canada 's toronto university thinks this was an intelligent decision .
the alternative would have been to hold a meeting of the 20 leading heads of states based on the model of the g20 industrial nations forum formed in 1999 . according to hajnal , such a structure would make it more difficult to achieve real results , however , and is n't being considered as a real possibility . even economist o 'neill does n't want to see an increase in the number of g8 members .
he would prefer the introduction of rules regulating who has the right to sit at the table . " we should learn from soccer , and have a permanent league in which only the current world economic powers are allowed to play , " o 'neill said .
" you would be able to advance into and dropped from the league . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should the g8 look to soccer for inspiration ?
o 'neill has even thought of an umpire - the international monetary fund , which could use economic data to determine the lucky eight . is g8 membership desirable ? this suggestion is n't an option for hajnal , who pointed out that not all bric countries were angling for g8 membership . china has " continually emphasized that it does n't want to belong for the moment " because it was " profiting economically " by being a developing country , hajnal said . however , according to hajnal , the g8 's very informality could well come in useful in the future by making it easier for the g8 to adapt to changes in the world 's power balance .

" the situation is complicated , " conceded steinmeier , as he arrived to chair talks in brussels with his eu counterparts .
" in this situation we need to present proposals and not -lrb- trade -rrb- accusations , " he said . steinmeier took pains to quash rumors that the summit would be cancelled . " it will take place , " he told reporters .
" we have to bring an end to these discussions about whether or not the summit will take place , " he added . " the eu needs russia to resolve international conflicts , but similarly russia continues to depend on europe , so i am absolutely sure that on both sides reason will prevail , " he said . merkel admits to problems earlier in the day , german chancellor angela merkel stressed the eu 's interests in maintaining strong ties with russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia removed this soviet memorial from central tallinn last month addressing european parliamentarians in berlin , merkel acknowledged that there were a " series of problems to overcome " but said she hoped the summit would " make clear that we are interested in a close strategic partnership with russia . " eu-russia relations have been tense for more than a year , especially since many felt russia had begun using its heft as a major energy supplier to promote its foreign policy goals . also casting a pall over the summit is the recent dispute between russia and eu member estonia over the removal of a soviet memorial in tallinn dedicated to red army soldiers who died in world war two . steinmeier said the german presidency had been " successful with our involvement " in calming tensions between russia and estonia , and that it " will of course continue to work to bring progress .

russia says the ban is a food-safety issue , while poland accuses moscow of using it as a political tool . " we will try right up to the summit to resolve the conflict concerning polish meat , " steinmeier said , but added : " i could n't say whether we will be successful . " because of the ban , poland has veto talks on a new eu-russia partnership agreement meant to replace an existing accord which expires late this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo serbs might want russia 's help to oppose kosovo 's independence but russia 's stance on kosovo - a potential political powder keg in europe - is potentially more difficult to overcome . on saturday , the russian government threatened to use its un security council veto to stop " supervised independence " being granted to the majority ethnic albanian province in serbia , so as not to set an example to separatists elsewhere . " the most important issue the eu has to solve with russia is kosovo , " luxembourg 's foreign minister jean asselborn said . the eu has planned an important mission in kosovo to help supervise the transfer of powers from the united nations to the provincial authorities , once a decision on its status is finalized . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : russia set for stormy eu , us talks amid heightened tensions eu foreign ministers will meet to prepare for an eu-russia summit they hope will ease tensions heightened in recent months by issues as diverse as independence for kosovo , us missile defense plans and human rights .

russia of today is not the russia of the 90s , said expert alexander rahr . alexander rahr is a russia expert from the german society for foreign affairs , a berlin-based research group .
dw-radio : do the ongoing disputes between russia and the eu make you pessimistic about the prospects for any breakthroughs at the upcoming summit ?
alexander rahr : in the short run , i 'm very skeptical and pessimistic about the possibility of improving relations between russia and the european union , but of course one has to be more optimistic for the long run .
but presently , there is talk of a new cold war between the eu and russia .
one of the main disputes is about the power that moscow wields because of its massive reserves of oil and gas and its control over the transport of energy supplies from central asia .
how do you think this issue will be addressed at the summit ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander rahr i think that this is a temporary situation .
the situation in general will stabilize and improve because russia needs its european partners and the european market in order to sell its goods .

it has to sell it .

russia also has some new powers which we have to take into account .
what do you think russia 's expectations for the upcoming summit are ?
what does it hope to achieve ?
russia itself has a wait-and-see attitude .
it wants to have good cooperation with the european union , but it does not want to tolerate criticism of its interior policies .
russia says it wants a different kind of cooperation with the european union - not the kind of cooperation on mutual values , which the european union demands .
russia wants a purely pragmatic , business-like cooperation .
one of the main issues is the current state of human rights in russia .
some have complained that the eu has not protested enough against some of the human rights abuses in russia .
do you think this issue will be raised at the summit ?
this issue has been raised at every summit for many years .
but the fact that the problems are being raised will not lead to any solution .
russia will listen , but it will say , " the west does not understand us .
we have completely different problems and you , the west , should choose whether you want us as a pragmatic partner or whether you want to teach us democracy . "

do n't leave bonn without him großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven was born in bonn in 1770 , but lived most of his life in vienna visitors to bonn are certain to go home with a beethoven souvenir .
after all , the former capital has learned to make the most of its connection to its famous son . they come from all over the world and have one thing in common - they 've come to follow in the footsteps of ludwig van beethoven .
in bonn , where the composer lived from his birth in 1770 until the age of 22 , that 's not hard to do .
beethoven is practically everywhere - visitors are bound to come across his serious-looking profile on everything from suspenders and umbrellas to ball-point pens and chocolate truffles .
the larger-than-life statue of beethoven on bonn 's central münster square , across from the main post office , has long since become an important landmark in the city .
in fact , the monument 's consecration in 1845 , timed to coincide with the composer 's 75th birthday , was celebrated with a three-day music festival organized by none other than franz liszt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this monument was erected for beethoven 's 75th birthday " it definitely belongs in my germany photo album , " said tourist xianguo zhong from shanghai while posing for the camera together with the colossal composer .
beethoven sells every year , some 500,000 tourists and business travellers , many of them from asia , stop in bonn .
along with bonn 's many museums , beethoven is one of the former capital 's most significant attractions .
the annual beethoven festival , in particular , draws the crowds .
it has its roots in franz liszt 's 1845 festival and is a special highlight for music lovers from all over the world .
bonn tourism officials have quickly learned that , quite simply , beethoven sells .
in addition to her picture in front of the statue , xianguo zhong went home with a t-shirt with a picture of the composer on it .
" in china , every kid knows who beethoven is , " she said .
" we read stories about him in elementary school . "
souvenirs galore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's birth house attracts around 100,000 visitors per year the museum gift shop in the composer 's birth house has over 800 beethoven souvenirs on offer , including beer glasses , thimbles , playing cards , stationary and ties all printed with a variety of beethoven motives .
each year , around 100,000 pilgrims visit the house on bonngasse , where they can view some of the composer 's instruments , hand-written correspondence and original manuscripts - and take home reproductions of the " moonlight sonata " or " für elise " manuscripts printed on silk scarves and porcelain plates .
particularly enthusiastic beethoven fans can even take home a bit of the composer himself - at least from the shoulders up .
visitors can choose from 20 different types of beethoven busts measuring between five and 55 centimeters -lrb- two to 22 inches -rrb- tall and costing up to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,350 -rrb- .
the gift shop 's best-sellers , however , are the cds of the composer 's music .
they even offer a recording that simulates beethoven 's hearing loss with changes to the volume and sound of the music .
the birth house also holds a substantial beethoven archive and library .

the talks on saturday were attended by eu justice commissioner franco frattini , the interior ministers of germany , britain , poland , france , spain and italy , and united states secretary of homeland security michael chertoff .
all supported the idea of sending european investigators to west africa as part of a new drive against the smugglers .
" we have agreed to cooperate with african countries in the effort to block the new routes of colombian cocaine to europe , " said spanish interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba .
the initiative to open a new front against the traffickers coming through africa comes hot on the heels of an agreement to set up a new european body that will share intelligence and coordinate police seizures of cocaine and cannabis on the high seas .
coordinated by britain , france , ireland , italy , portugal , spain and the netherlands , the body will be officially established in lisbon later this year .
europe offering high profit margins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of latin america 's output lands on european mirrors roughly 80 percent of cocaine from latin america that was destined for markets outside of the united states in 2005 was bound for europe , according to dea estimates .
international drug trafficking rings have been drawn to the european market because of the higher prices paid for cocaine on the continent .
last year wholesale prices for cocaine in the european union ranged between 28,000 and 56,600 euros -lrb- $ 38,000 and $ 77,000 -rrb- per kilogram compared to between $ 9,000 and $ 40,000 in the united states where the supply is higher , according to the dea .
" the potential for this high profit margin has increasingly lured colombian traffickers to european markets , " dea director of operations michael braun said during his testimony before the us congress last year .
africa is increasingly being used by criminal gangs as a hub for shipping latin american cocaine and asian heroin into europe .
consumption of cocaine and hashish is also on the rise in africa , spanish secretary of state for security antonio camacho said at the international drug enforcement conference on thursday .
" this is an issue which is very worrying because of its regional and global implications , " he said .
spain the coke gateway to the eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coke ending up in the eu invariably comes through spain trafficking groups are taking advantage of weak governments in african nations as well as their historical ties to europe to smuggle drugs into the continent .
spain has become the main gateway for latin american cocaine and north african hashish into europe and has set up its own robust fight against drug smuggling .
spanish officials seized over 40 tons of cocaine last year , a record amount and more than any other nation in the world except for colombia , the united states and venezuela , camacho said .
" spain has a serious problem regarding rising drug consumption and i think it is in the interest of us all to cooperate more to fight drug trafficking , which in the case of colombia is totally linked to guerrilla groups and violence , " colombian defense minister juan manuel santos told reporters in madrid .
" cocaine is surging in europe at levels similar to what america experienced in the 1980s , " the head of the us drug enforcement administration , karen tandy , said at the three-day event in madrid .
low costs drive high consumption bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european coke consumption is at a historical high around 10 million europeans , or over three percent of all adults , have used cocaine at least once in their lives , a historically high figure , according to the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- .
britain and spain posted the highest rates of use , with over four percent of adults reporting having consumed the drug over the past year compared to an average of around one percent of adults in all of europe .
use is concentrated among young adults , especially men , in urban areas .
a substantial drop in price has contributed to the increase in usage .
the price of cocaine on europe 's streets fell by 22 percent between 1999 and 2004 , according to emcdda .
the supply of cocaine in europe has increased since the late 1990s leading to lower prices and this , combined with its association to a supposedly glamorous lifestyle , is fueling its growing use , drug experts say .
" cocaine is very much associated with success , urban lifestyles , a party atmosphere , " emcdda analyst julian vicente told afp , before adding cocaine was now the second most used illegal drug in europe after cannabis . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : report paints mixed picture of german drug and alcohol use germany 's annual report on drugs and addiction was released this week showing a overall decrease in drug-related deaths , but alarming data on prescription drug addiction and youth drinking .

" we know that the russians are getting hot and bothered as well . " german foreign minster frank-walter steinmeier , however , said it would be impossible to predetermine exactly what the eu-russia summit results would be . " the situation is complicated but particularly in time of difficulties is important to talk , " he said before the preparatory meeting of eu ministers .
" we are going to try right up to the summit to resolve the conflict concerning polish meat .
i ca n't say whether we 'll be successful . " steinmeier added that neither the eu nor russia could afford to stop working together . " i am convinced the eu needs russia to solve international conflicts and russia is going to continue to be dependent on europe , so i am absolutely sure that on both sides reason must prevail , " he said . analysts however are skeptical that things will calm down . " neither the rice talks nor the samara meeting will bring any concrete steps to overcoming disagreements , " said yevgeny volk , an analyst for the heritage foundation .
" it was only in the cold war that relations were like this .
it 's like 20 years ago . " plenty of irritants topping rice 's agenda on tuesday will be fierce russian opposition to a us plan for deploying a limited missile defense system in poland and the czech republic . she has little chance of making progress .
washington says the system is aimed at averting attacks from countries like iran or north korea , but moscow sees the system as a direct threat that could trigger a new arms race and has announced a freeze on a landmark soviet-era arms limitation treaty . last month eu trade commissioner peter mandelson warned that mistrust and a lack of respect in the relations between the european union and russia are at their worst levels since the cold war . " neither thinks they enjoy the respect and goodwill from the other they are entitled to expect , " he said , in comments which his eu colleagues have since been at pains to play down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world ii statue that is the source of much friction between moscow and tallin tension will also be high at the russia-eu summit following a row over a soviet war memorial between moscow and estonia , a former soviet republic that is now a member of the eu and nato military alliance . the foreign ministers meeting in brussels on monday will also hail serbia 's creation on friday of a pro-european government . the 27 eu nations hope the serbs ' move will help push forward plans for supervised independence in the breakaway serbian province of kosovo , a measure which russia has threatened to block at the un security council . russia on saturday dismissed as " unacceptable " a draft un security council resolution , introduced by western powers , endorsing the kosovo independence plan of un envoy martti ahtisaari . political freedoms and human rights hanging over both the us and eu meetings will be growing western criticism of russian president vladimir putin 's handling of political freedoms and human rights - a sensitive issue thrown into relief by plans for an opposition rally in samara on the day of the eu summit . police have violently broken up several earlier protest marches by the other russia coalition , bringing condemnation from western governments . on friday , a spokesman for german chancellor angela merkel , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency , urged russia to authorize the samara protest , saying : " we start from the principle that critical voices should be able to be expressed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a crackdown on protestors in st petersburg last month sparked western criticism ahead of her visit , rice attacked what she called the " turning back " of freedoms in russia under putin and said " everybody around the world " was concerned . other bones of contention include constant delays in russia 's bid for membership of the world trade organization , russian opposition to independence for serbia 's kosovo province , and a meat trade dispute with eu member poland . " worst summit in history " the russia-eu meeting " will be the worst summit in history because there 's actually nothing that can be achieved in samara , " said fyodr lukyanov , editor of the journal russia in global affairs .
prospects for rice were " not much better , " he added . analysts said that much of the bad feeling is based on political maneuvering rather than concrete problems . " i think that russia and the european union tripped up on a step that should have led to better relations , " said mark entin , professor at moscow 's european studies institute .
" the step is russia becoming richer , faster , more confident .
at the same time , the european union is becoming bigger .
this is not seen as an opportunity , but as a challenge .
it 's a problem of mentality . "
lukyanov also pointed to a " psychological " divide exacerbated by the run-up to presidential elections in the united states and russia next year . " the russian leadership is completely preoccupied with power and they use foreign policy to strengthen their position , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : " russia wants pragmatic , business-like cooperation " as relations between brussels and moscow remain tense , the russia of today is not the russia of the 90s , one expert told deutsche welle .

specialists are already arguing that patients may have to pay for more drugs themselves , with the issue becoming pressing as new drugs are developed .
but some patients offering to pay for a cancer drug are being told they would have to meet all their care costs .
it is due to different interpretations of contracts and policies designed to separate private from nhs-funded care .
the issue is becoming more critical as the number of new cancer drugs being developed grows .
in all , 180 specialist cancer doctors told the bbc they were worried or very worried about the situation , in response to a questionnaire submitted by the bbc .
the drugs in the pipeline are going to cause even more pressure professor nick james cancer tsar calls for reform around half the drugs submitted to the english nhs advisory body nice are for the treatment of cancer .
some , like herceptin for breast cancer , have won nice backing as being cost effective for the health service .
others like tarceva , which can extend the life of lung cancer patients , have been turned down .
specialists like nick james , professor of clinical oncology in birmingham , believe the gap between what the nhs can fund and what is available is going to get bigger .
" the drugs in the pipeline are going to cause even more pressure .
i think politicians need to be honest and say this gap is going to be there and we need to look at ways of filling it , " he said .
he believes it is inevitable that patients will make a bigger contribution themselves , but is worried nhs policy stands in the way .
some patients who offer to pay for a cancer drug recommended by their doctor are told they will have to transfer completely to private care .
this can have the effect of doubling bills which already run into many thousands .

mr allen is terminally ill with kidney and lung cancer and had been told he only had six months to live .
stephen allen is paying for his own drugs nhs funding for the drug recommended for him was refused , with letters explaining the health service has limited resources and faces very tough decisions .
he said : " i did n't realise we had to pay for certain drugs .

we need to have an honest debate about how we 're going to have to fund these things dr jesme fox in england , the official policy of the department of health is that allowing patients to contribute towards nhs care - known as co-payment - is against the principles and values of the nhs .
the government says it could lead to a two tier system .
in scotland a different picture is emerging .
earlier this year scotland 's chief medical officer issued much more nuanced advice to the health service there .
two-tier system he points out that if a patient opts to pay for a particular drug not available from the nhs there is no law which allows health boards to make the patient pay for all aspects of their treatment .
the letter sets out a framework for drawing up ways of allowing " the safe provision of concurrent treatment where appropriate " .
the nhs has received a record increase in funding in recent years , but it still has to set financial priorities within those limits .
a government report published by the national cancer director for england , professor mike richards , said cancer care had improved , with faster access to treatment and money spent on new equipment .
campaigning professor richards , said demand for drugs would grow , and need had to be met on a fair basis .
" we have got to look at whether we are using the current money on cancer in the nhs as effectively as we can . "
but he added : " there are limits to what the health service can pay . "
dr jesme fox , medical director of the roy castle lung cancer foundation , said she was appalled some people spend the last few months of their life in a desperate fight for nhs funding .
the average time from diagnosis to death for lung cancer patients is six months .

every fence , wall and tree is cluttered with a cacophony of posters bearing the names and beaming faces of would-be politicians .
it is a bewildering process for the voters , not least because on the ballot papers they have to write down their choice of candidates for every post .
name recognition is crucial .
that is why so many actors , tv presenters and former sports stars run for office , and one of the reasons why the names of the same powerful families keep popping up during elections .
the other reason is that these families , who still control most of the land and business opportunities in the philippines , need access to political office to maintain their economic prominence .
this means that vote-buying , intimidation and in some areas killing are a normal part of election campaigning .
family affair masbate is the third-poorest province in the country and during elections it is one of the most violent . "
i prefer not to campaign like this with all these guns , but my family insists i am able to defend myself " maloli espinosa the province was traditionally dominated by the espinosas , who own huge cattle ranches here .
but their political dominance declined after one-time governor and congressman moises espinosa was gunned down in 1989 .
a few years later his brother tito was also shot dead , followed by his son moises junior .
today his daughter maloli is trying her luck in the second congressional district .
she gave up a high-powered job in manila to run and she is up against the espinosas old rivals , the khos .
governor antonio kho is running against maloli for congress .

for jack kidd , this is particularly apt since all his business interests and his entire life are tied up with the sport .
" this is what i 'm good at , " he says as he spurs on his pony , takes aim at a small white ball and sends it flying in a graceful arch across the polo field .
keeping up with jack - brother of model jodie kidd and great-grandson of the first lord beaverbrook - is not easy , whether on the pitch or off it .
it seems the 33-year-old professional polo player is constantly doing several things at once , whether making arrangements for giant parties for the polo set while simultaneously barking instructions to one of his pupils , or riding along with one of his small children in front of him in the saddle while discussing business on his mobile .
" i do everything i can to create business , " jack declares .
" but i do n't really do it for the money .
i do it to pay for my polo . "
risky and costly if polo is addictive , jack is one of its most willing victims .
he is also one of its most active ones .
" out of all the pros in this country , i create more polo-related business than anyone else , " he grins .
at the heart of jack 's business is his home on a polo farm in berkshire .
this is where he gives polo lessons and where he keeps his more than 30 ponies .
bringing on a £ 1,000 pony can make it worth £ 20,000 , so there is money to be made here , jack explains .
" i pick ' em and crack on with it , " he says .
" basically , i play on horses that i make .
i ca n't afford to buy a horse at £ 20,000 . "
but when the risks , the costs and the time it takes to bring on a pony are taken into account , it is far less lucrative than it might seem .
so jack has branched out into other areas .
private pitches one is equestrian property management . "
if you want to play competitively in outdoor polo , you 'll spend at least £ 100,000 a year " learning to play polo jack bought the berkshire farm a few years ago , then transformed it from a run-down farm to a high-level equestrian operation .
he had a polo pitch , a bore hole and a polo arena installed , then sold it to hedge fund manager louis bacon of moore capital .
and here is the crux - proof that jack is thinking like a businessman .
it was important , he says , to " downshift from high cost , low output to low cost , high output " .
but jack has negotiated the right to continue using the polo field , and he is still living in a rambling farm house on the estate .
expensive sport jack says it is no longer rare for wealthy polo enthusiasts to construct private pitches in their grounds .
" they cost about £ 450,000 to put in , " he says .
" within a 10-mile radius of this part of berkshire , there are 20 private fields , maybe more . "
" outdoor polo on grass is a financial and logistical nightmare , though , " he says as he slows down his pony to walk . "
i started by doing raves in barns .
i 've always been putting on parties " luxury brands target polo set maintenance costs run to £ 50,000 per year , he explains .
" and every time you play , you get a van-full of people to fill the divots . "
as a sport , it makes other equestrian sports like three-day eventing look positively cheap , jack explains .
" in polo , you 'll need 10 times as many horses , 10 times as many staff and so on . "
snow and show crossing the vast polo field , jack rides up alongside a bland-looking timber arena , 100m by 50m , with a sandy base .
" this is the future of polo , " jack declares , referring to arena polo , a fast and furious form of polo , where each team has three players and where a larger , orange ball is bounced off the arena walls .
" you can ride older horses with leg problems because they stay sound .
it is much gentler on the horse . "
best of all , arena polo is much , much cheaper than grass polo .
" you can play competitively for £ 20,000 a year , whereas if you want to play competitively in outdoor polo , you 'll spend at least £ 100,000 a year , " jack says .
building an indoor arena could cost as little as £ 200-300,000 , and amateurs could take part using ponies costing £ 1,000 each .
the attraction of the budget version of polo is not lost on the punters .
during the winter , jack worked on the launch of an arena polo club at the hickstead equestrian centre in sussex .
" within three months , we had already gathered 65 members , " he says .
but it is as a spectator sport that he sees arena polo 's greatest potential .
" it 's so good to watch , " he enthuses .
" it 's condensed polo .
it 's just pure entertainment .
it 's theatre . "
jack is keen to take arena polo to city centres across the uk , by erecting temporary arenas .
" i want to drop the arena down , dump the surface down and then do polo in the city , " he says .
" you can make it happen for about £ 100,000 . "
" another future of polo is using alternative venues , " jack continues .
last summer he took a string of polo ponies to st tropez to play on the beach , and every winter he takes part in the arrangement of a winter tournament in klosters in the swiss alps , where " we build an arena out of snow and play at night under lights " .
" i 'm being paid as an entertainer , " jack muses .
in addition , the potential for sponsorship is huge , not least since such events are ideal for after-match parties .
already , jack arranges parties with budgets of up to £ 250,000 following major matches on grass , including the players ' marquee at the cartier international tournament at guards polo club in windsor great park .
and he has just started a broader events and party firm , polofashionmusic.com , which doubles as an online lifestyle magazine , with dj alain-marcos basurto de castillon of ibiza fame and jamie morrison of the royal county of berkshire polo club .
" i started by doing raves in barns .
i 've always been putting on parties , " jack says .
as yet , he has not made much from his parties , though this could soon change , he hopes .
" after three years of losing money , i nearly broke even last year , " he says .
" after a few years of doing it , it is going to be a pretty good business . "
problematic patrons so jack is forever the showman .
but he is also a professional polo player - one of just two or three dozen english pros .
this is where polo gets particularly curious .
polo pros are paid to play on the same team as their wealthy patrons .
as a rule , the pros are young from wealthy backgrounds , their parents having paid for their training , while most patrons are successful financiers or hedge fund managers , lawyers or entrepreneurs .
this has the curious effect of creating a meeting between old and new money , which creates volatile relationships at the best of times , not least since not all patrons manage to hang on to their cash .
jack 's latest patron was forced to withdraw from the sport , at least temporarily , after having been banged up in a polish prison on bribery , money-laundering and corruption charges , so jack is on the lookout for a new financial backer .
" i 'm really waiting for mr safe , a safe patron , but i really have a habit of attracting the wild ones , " quips jack as he dismounts .
back in the house , jack swings by his chaotic home office , furnished with two massive antique desks where equestrian magazines are piled high , supported by match trophies .
he has a quick chat with his secretary and fires off a couple of e-mails , mobile phone glued to his ear , before retreating to the kitchen for a hearty lunch of ham , egg and chips .
and suddenly it seems that jack is really a country boy at heart , more horseman than sportsman , more farmer than party animal .
only he never sits still long enough to find out .

" this is the future of polo , " jack declares , referring to arena polo , a fast and furious form of polo , where each team has three players and where a larger , orange ball is bounced off the arena walls .
arena polo , snow polo and beach polo are all on the rise " you can ride older horses with leg problems because they stay sound .
it is much gentler on the horse . "
best of all , arena polo is much , much cheaper than grass polo .
" you can play competitively for £ 20,000 a year , whereas if you want to play competitively in outdoor polo , you 'll spend at least £ 100,000 a year , " jack says .
building an indoor arena could cost as little as £ 200-300,000 , and amateurs could take part using ponies costing £ 1,000 each .
the attraction of the budget version of polo is not lost on the punters .
during the winter , jack worked on the launch of an arena polo club at the hickstead equestrian centre in sussex .
" within three months , we had already gathered 65 members , " he says .
but it is as a spectator sport that he sees arena polo 's greatest potential .
" it 's so good to watch , " he enthuses .
" it 's condensed polo .
it 's just pure entertainment .
it 's theatre . "
jack is keen to take arena polo to city centres across the uk , by erecting temporary arenas .
" i want to drop the arena down , dump the surface down and then do polo in the city , " he says .
" you can make it happen for about £ 100,000 . "
" another future of polo is using alternative venues , " jack continues .
last summer he took a string of polo ponies to st tropez to play on the beach , and every winter he takes part in the arrangement of a winter tournament in klosters in the swiss alps , where " we build an arena out of snow and play at night under lights " .
" i 'm being paid as an entertainer , " jack muses .
in addition , the potential for sponsorship is huge , not least since such events are ideal for after-match parties .
jack arranges spectacular after-match parties already , jack arranges parties with budgets of up to £ 250,000 following major matches on grass , including the players ' marquee at the cartier international tournament at guards polo club in windsor great park .
and he has just started a broader events and party firm , polofashionmusic.com , which doubles as an online lifestyle magazine , with dj alain-marcos basurto de castillon of ibiza fame and jamie morrison of the royal county of berkshire polo club .
" i started by doing raves in barns .
i 've always been putting on parties , " jack says .
as yet , he has not made much from his parties , though this could soon change , he hopes .
" after three years of losing money , i nearly broke even last year , " he says .
" after a few years of doing it , it is going to be a pretty good business . "
problematic patrons so jack is forever the showman .
on reflection , perhaps jack is more horseman than polo set ?
but he is also a professional polo player - one of just two or three dozen english pros .
this is where polo gets particularly curious .
polo pros are paid to play on the same team as their wealthy patrons .
as a rule , the pros are young from wealthy backgrounds , their parents having paid for their training , while most patrons are successful financiers or hedge fund managers , lawyers or entrepreneurs .
this has the curious effect of creating a meeting between old and new money , which creates volatile relationships at the best of times , not least since not all patrons manage to hang on to their cash .
jack 's latest patron was forced to withdraw from the sport , at least temporarily , after having been banged up in a polish prison on bribery , money-laundering and corruption charges , so jack is on the lookout for a new financial backer .
" i 'm really waiting for mr safe , a safe patron , but i really have a habit of attracting the wild ones , " quips jack as he dismounts .
back in the house , jack swings by his chaotic home office , furnished with two massive antique desks where equestrian magazines are piled high , supported by match trophies .
he has a quick chat with his secretary and fires off a couple of e-mails , mobile phone glued to his ear , before retreating to the kitchen for a hearty lunch of ham , egg and chips .
and suddenly it seems that jack is really a country boy at heart , more horseman than sportsman , more farmer than party animal .
only he never sits still long enough to find out .

for jack kidd , this is particularly apt since all his business interests and his entire life are tied up with the sport .
" this is what i 'm good at , " he says as he spurs on his pony , takes aim at a small white ball and sends it flying in a graceful arch across the polo field .
keeping up with jack - brother of model jodie kidd and great-grandson of the first lord beaverbrook - is not easy , whether on the pitch or off it .
it seems the 33-year-old professional polo player is constantly doing several things at once , whether making arrangements for giant parties for the polo set while simultaneously barking instructions to one of his pupils , or riding along with one of his small children in front of him in the saddle while discussing business on his mobile .

at the heart of jack 's business is his home on a polo farm in berkshire .

his factory , located in the booming yangtze river delta region of china , has expanded dramatically in the last few years .
it is now producing 30 million baseball caps each year , supplying retailers across the us and europe at an average price of $ 1 -lrb- 50p -rrb- per cap .
every day the factory fills a standard 40-foot container with 60,000 caps , which is sent down the motorway to the port of shanghai .
a sister factory , hua yuan , has an exclusive contract with nike to manufacture their branded caps .
mr qin is particularly proud of the embroidery department , where dozens of new japanese-made machines automatically reproduce the complicated logos on the front of the caps , with only a few workers in sight .
but textile and clothing manufacturing is nevertheless a labour-intensive business .
the factory employs more than 1,000 workers - mainly young women - in the large sewing rooms where the caps are put together .
workers ' lives they work a six-day week , 7:30am to 5pm , and many live in dormitories adjoining the factory .
but with average factory wages of around 1,300 rmb per month -lrb- $ 165 , £ 81 -rrb- , most want the extra work .
a worker told the bbc she had worked for the company for four-and-a-half years , while her husband worked at another factory and his parents looked after their child .
the booming export trade has made the factory owner , mr bao , a rich man .
having started from humble beginnings , he now has two homes and two cars - including an audi a6 , and can afford to educate his children privately , according to the factory manager .
export boom mr bao 's success story is not unique .
the private sector has led china 's huge export boom , which has continues to accelerate .
in the first three months of 2007 , china exported $ 252bn worth of goods , an increase of 27.8 % on 2006 , and had a trade surplus with the rest of the world of $ 46bn - nearly double the amount in the same period last year .
textiles and clothing exports are expected to reach $ 161bn this year , and in 2006 , textiles and clothing accounted for 72 % of china 's trade surplus in manufacturing .
textile and clothing exports from china have surged since the ending of restrictions on exports to western countries in 2005 , when the multi-fibre agreement was finally abolished as part of a world trade deal .
the rise in chinese exports sparked protectionist pressures in both the us and the eu , and china negotiated export restraint agreements that expire in 2008 .
the us government has also been urging china to revalue its currency , the yuan , at a faster rate in order to reduce its trade surplus .
pricing pressures but seen from the ground , chinese firms feel under increasing competitive pressures , with profit margins continually squeezed by the appreciation of the yuan and government increases in interest rates .
mr qin says that his firm has borrowed heavily to invest in the new equipment to lower their costs and improve quality and productivity .
according to government figures , the overall profit margins in the textile industry are only 3.9 % - the lowest of any major industry .
the shift of textile factories away from shanghai to cheaper cities in the interior is one way that owners can control costs .
vivian zhu , operations manager for et2c international , is a close observer of those pressures .
her firm helps oversee outsourcing contracts between western and chinese companies , often supplying bespoke services to major retailers .
she explains that rival firms often cluster in the same towns - so several baseball cap manufacturers , or several handkerchief makers , are found together .
she says that there is continuous pressure for high quality and low cost from western purchasers .
price pressures have increased since the spread of internet sites such as alibaba.com , which seeks to match buyers and suppliers in china .
ms zhu says that many of her clients also want to ensure the factories they use meet social standards and are free of child labour .
she regularly sends inspectors to the factories she uses to check quality and carry out social audits - although she admits that , faced with the issue of free trade unions , the best she can do is ask the workers whether they are happy .
but the combination of labour shortages , pressure from abroad and rapid expansion have been raising standards nevertheless .
large air-conditioning units now hang over the huaxia factory building .
going upmarket china 's export advantage no longer lies mainly in its low cost of labour .
and firms are recognising this by moving up-market or by specialising in a single product .
et2c international itself decided to move up the value chain by launching a fashion brand , urban shock , for young women .
it has now launched a series of shops in shanghai marketing the brand , and has recently opened its own factory to produce its clothes .
the firm 's factory has to pay higher wages to attract workers , but its location means that the designers can work closely with it to ensure the dresses are made to their specifications .
but et2c is not alone .
it is the domestic market , rather than cheap exports , that is now attracting a huge wave of foreign investment into china by western multinationals .

his factory , located in the booming yangtze river delta region of china , has expanded dramatically in the last few years .
it is now producing 30 million baseball caps each year , supplying retailers across the us and europe at an average price of $ 1 -lrb- 50p -rrb- per cap .
every day the factory fills a standard 40-foot container with 60,000 caps , which is sent down the motorway to the port of shanghai .
a sister factory , hua yuan , has an exclusive contract with nike to manufacture their branded caps .
pride and price pressure : running the factory is getting more difficult mr qin is particularly proud of the embroidery department , where dozens of new japanese-made machines automatically reproduce the complicated logos on the front of the caps , with only a few workers in sight .
but textile and clothing manufacturing is nevertheless a labour-intensive business .
the factory employs more than 1,000 workers - mainly young women - in the large sewing rooms where the caps are put together .
workers ' lives they work a six-day week , 7:30am to 5pm , and many live in dormitories adjoining the factory .
a good job in zhangjiagang but with average factory wages of around 1,300 rmb per month -lrb- $ 165 , £ 81 -rrb- , most want the extra work .
a worker told the bbc she had worked for the company for four-and-a-half years , while her husband worked at another factory and his parents looked after their child .
the booming export trade has made the factory owner , mr bao , a rich man .
having started from humble beginnings , he now has two homes and two cars - including an audi a6 , and can afford to educate his children privately , according to the factory manager .
export boom mr bao 's success story is not unique .
the private sector has led china 's huge export boom , which has continues to accelerate .
in the first three months of 2007 , china exported $ 252bn worth of goods , an increase of 27.8 % on 2006 , and had a trade surplus with the rest of the world of $ 46bn - nearly double the amount in the same period last year .
textiles and clothing exports are expected to reach $ 161bn this year , and in 2006 , textiles and clothing accounted for 72 % of china 's trade surplus in manufacturing .
textile and clothing exports from china have surged since the ending of restrictions on exports to western countries in 2005 , when the multi-fibre agreement was finally abolished as part of a world trade deal .
the rise in chinese exports sparked protectionist pressures in both the us and the eu , and china negotiated export restraint agreements that expire in 2008 .
the us government has also been urging china to revalue its currency , the yuan , at a faster rate in order to reduce its trade surplus .
pricing pressures but seen from the ground , chinese firms feel under increasing competitive pressures , with profit margins continually squeezed by the appreciation of the yuan and government increases in interest rates .
conditions have improved in many clothing factories mr qin says that his firm has borrowed heavily to invest in the new equipment to lower their costs and improve quality and productivity .
according to government figures , the overall profit margins in the textile industry are only 3.9 % - the lowest of any major industry .
the shift of textile factories away from shanghai to cheaper cities in the interior is one way that owners can control costs .
vivian zhu , operations manager for et2c international , is a close observer of those pressures .
her firm helps oversee outsourcing contracts between western and chinese companies , often supplying bespoke services to major retailers .
she explains that rival firms often cluster in the same towns - so several baseball cap manufacturers , or several handkerchief makers , are found together .
designers work closely with pattern cutters to produce designs she says that there is continuous pressure for high quality and low cost from western purchasers .
price pressures have increased since the spread of internet sites such as alibaba.com , which seeks to match buyers and suppliers in china .
ms zhu says that many of her clients also want to ensure the factories they use meet social standards and are free of child labour .
she regularly sends inspectors to the factories she uses to check quality and carry out social audits - although she admits that , faced with the issue of free trade unions , the best she can do is ask the workers whether they are happy .
but the combination of labour shortages , pressure from abroad and rapid expansion have been raising standards nevertheless .
large air-conditioning units now hang over the huaxia factory building .
going upmarket china 's export advantage no longer lies mainly in its low cost of labour .
moving into retail : urban shock store and firms are recognising this by moving up-market or by specialising in a single product .
et2c international itself decided to move up the value chain by launching a fashion brand , urban shock , for young women .
it has now launched a series of shops in shanghai marketing the brand , and has recently opened its own factory to produce its clothes .
the firm 's factory has to pay higher wages to attract workers , but its location means that the designers can work closely with it to ensure the dresses are made to their specifications .
but et2c is not alone .
it is the domestic market , rather than cheap exports , that is now attracting a huge wave of foreign investment into china by western multinationals .
this is one of a series of articles on how globalisation is reshaping shanghai and the yangtze river delta .
subsequent features will look at the car industry , banking and computer hardware .

the booming export trade has made the factory owner , mr bao , a rich man .
having started from humble beginnings , he now has two homes and two cars - including an audi a6 , and can afford to educate his children privately , according to the factory manager .
export boom mr bao 's success story is not unique .
the private sector has led china 's huge export boom , which has continues to accelerate .
in the first three months of 2007 , china exported $ 252bn worth of goods , an increase of 27.8 % on 2006 , and had a trade surplus with the rest of the world of $ 46bn - nearly double the amount in the same period last year .
textiles and clothing exports are expected to reach $ 161bn this year , and in 2006 , textiles and clothing accounted for 72 % of china 's trade surplus in manufacturing .
textile and clothing exports from china have surged since the ending of restrictions on exports to western countries in 2005 , when the multi-fibre agreement was finally abolished as part of a world trade deal .
the rise in chinese exports sparked protectionist pressures in both the us and the eu , and china negotiated export restraint agreements that expire in 2008 .
the us government has also been urging china to revalue its currency , the yuan , at a faster rate in order to reduce its trade surplus .
pricing pressures but seen from the ground , chinese firms feel under increasing competitive pressures , with profit margins continually squeezed by the appreciation of the yuan and government increases in interest rates .
conditions have improved in many clothing factories mr qin says that his firm has borrowed heavily to invest in the new equipment to lower their costs and improve quality and productivity .
according to government figures , the overall profit margins in the textile industry are only 3.9 % - the lowest of any major industry .
the shift of textile factories away from shanghai to cheaper cities in the interior is one way that owners can control costs .
vivian zhu , operations manager for et2c international , is a close observer of those pressures .
her firm helps oversee outsourcing contracts between western and chinese companies , often supplying bespoke services to major retailers .
she explains that rival firms often cluster in the same towns - so several baseball cap manufacturers , or several handkerchief makers , are found together .
designers work closely with pattern cutters to produce designs she says that there is continuous pressure for high quality and low cost from western purchasers .
price pressures have increased since the spread of internet sites such as alibaba.com , which seeks to match buyers and suppliers in china .
ms zhu says that many of her clients also want to ensure the factories they use meet social standards and are free of child labour .
she regularly sends inspectors to the factories she uses to check quality and carry out social audits - although she admits that , faced with the issue of free trade unions , the best she can do is ask the workers whether they are happy .
but the combination of labour shortages , pressure from abroad and rapid expansion have been raising standards nevertheless .
large air-conditioning units now hang over the huaxia factory building .
going upmarket china 's export advantage no longer lies mainly in its low cost of labour .
moving into retail : urban shock store and firms are recognising this by moving up-market or by specialising in a single product .
et2c international itself decided to move up the value chain by launching a fashion brand , urban shock , for young women .
it has now launched a series of shops in shanghai marketing the brand , and has recently opened its own factory to produce its clothes .
the firm 's factory has to pay higher wages to attract workers , but its location means that the designers can work closely with it to ensure the dresses are made to their specifications .
but et2c is not alone .
it is the domestic market , rather than cheap exports , that is now attracting a huge wave of foreign investment into china by western multinationals .
this is one of a series of articles on how globalisation is reshaping shanghai and the yangtze river delta .
subsequent features will look at the car industry , banking and computer hardware .

she was diagnosed with hodgkin 's lymphoma last november at the age of 14 , and , after months of treatment , she is now in remission .
" for at least nine months before i was diagnosed , i started getting really bad breathing problems .
" it sounded like asthmatic breathing .
we had just been on a hiking holiday , so i noticed it a lot then , and i was convinced i had asthma .
" if i got stressed , i 'd get a tightness in my chest and in my back .
" i was in bed for a couple of days , and eventually i started thinking that this was really strange .
" i went to the doctors .
they listened to my chest and said .
" it 's completely clear , so you 're fine . "
" but i kept going back , and eventually i got sent see a paediatric consultant .
they did various tests and x-rays and heart scans .
shadow over lungs " they were all clear except the x-ray , where they saw a white shadow over my lungs .
but i was convinced i 'd moved when they were taking the x-ray . "
everyone knows you 've lost your hair - what you trying to prove " " then i came back for another more fancy type of scan , called a ct scan , and they said that there was volume in the shadow .
" they called me in to the paediatric inpatient department , and said : " come prepared to stay the night . "
" that was pretty scary , because the uncertainty was the worst bit .
" they said that they were n't sure exactly , but it was either leukaemia or a lymphoma .
" at the time , i thought they were joking , because i just did n't see why i 'd get cancer : i do n't think i 'm ever going to smoke , and i eat healthily and we do n't have anything hereditary .
" i went to university college london hospital , because they have a specialist adolescent cancer ward , which was really cool .
" i stayed there for about a week and a bit , for diagnosis and biopsies .
" eventually they said that i had hodgkin 's lymphoma .
they told me if you 're going to get a cancer , lymphoma 's probably the best of the bunch because the treatment period is quite concise : it was only four months .
" i thought it was one of those things where only lucky people survive , but it turns out that - particularly with children - there is an amazing prognosis - 70 % , or something , of children are completely cured forever .
" when it 's given a name , then that gives you a sense of security , because at least you know what you 've got , and people know how to treat you .
hair loss " they give you a two-week lot of chemotherapy , and then they 'll give you two weeks off .
" the worst bit was definitely losing my hair .
i think it 's worse if you 're a girl because obviously most girls have longer hair than most boys so you 've got a lot to lose . "
i did want to be as normal as possible " " they do provide you with the free , nice , nhs wig but i chose not to wear that because , it never looks like your normal hair .
" also , everyone knows you 've lost your hair so what you trying to prove ?
i chose to wear a beanie hat instead .
" you get left with these really straggly witch-like bits .
" i could have shaved them off but i did n't want to do that because you 've just seen all your hair fall out so it seems weird to speed up the process yourself .
" i do think that losing your hair is an indication that you have cancer .
it 's what people attribute to cancer .
if you are just vomiting all the time , you 're just sick .
" i did want to be as normal as possible because people think you 're sick and if people think you 're sick , people take advantage of you because they know you 're a weakling .
" obviously there was vomiting , and really , really awful muscle pain , from your lower back , to about your mid-calf , which lasted for ages .
" they give you all these restrictions on what sort of painkillers you can take .
you ca n't take anything with paracetamol in , because it mucks up the blood results .
" so you can only take codeine , which is actually better than paracetamol , but tastes pretty foul .
" as a secondary infection , i got gastroenteritis .
on chemo , because of your low immunity , you have a really low white blood cell count .
so you just ca n't fight it .
going to school " i carried on going to school because i thought that i may not get any long-term side effects from the actual treatment but if i do n't go to school it 's quite clear what they are going to be - i 'm not going to do as well as i can in the future .
" i still have the same perspective that i had when i was well , i still want to go to university .
" i thought i 'm not going to let cancer stop that .
why should it ?
why is that fair ?
" there 's a 95 % chance that i 'm cured forever which means that there 's only a 5 % chance that it comes back which sounds minute .
" but the chances of getting cancer as a child is something like one in every 500 , so compared to that , 5 % sounds like a massive figure .
" i think there 'll always be that fear .
" the word ' cancer ' has sort of changed its meaning .
before it was a really shocking word to hear .
" it 's still scary but i 'd say probably not as scary .
" now i think i could give like my friends and family a lot more advice if they got it , and also i could be able to empathise with them . "

she was diagnosed with hodgkin 's lymphoma last november at the age of 14 , and , after months of treatment , she is now in remission .
" for at least nine months before i was diagnosed , i started getting really bad breathing problems .
" it sounded like asthmatic breathing .
we had just been on a hiking holiday , so i noticed it a lot then , and i was convinced i had asthma .
" if i got stressed , i 'd get a tightness in my chest and in my back .
" i was in bed for a couple of days , and eventually i started thinking that this was really strange .
" i went to the doctors .
they listened to my chest and said .
" it 's completely clear , so you 're fine . "
" but i kept going back , and eventually i got sent see a paediatric consultant .
they did various tests and x-rays and heart scans .
shadow over lungs " they were all clear except the x-ray , where they saw a white shadow over my lungs .
but i was convinced i 'd moved when they were taking the x-ray .
everyone knows you 've lost your hair - what you trying to prove " then i came back for another more fancy type of scan , called a ct scan , and they said that there was volume in the shadow .
" they called me in to the paediatric inpatient department , and said : " come prepared to stay the night . "
" that was pretty scary , because the uncertainty was the worst bit .
" they said that they were n't sure exactly , but it was either leukaemia or a lymphoma .
" at the time , i thought they were joking , because i just did n't see why i 'd get cancer : i do n't think i 'm ever going to smoke , and i eat healthily and we do n't have anything hereditary .
" i went to university college london hospital , because they have a specialist adolescent cancer ward , which was really cool .
" i stayed there for about a week and a bit , for diagnosis and biopsies .
" eventually they said that i had hodgkin 's lymphoma .
they told me if you 're going to get a cancer , lymphoma 's probably the best of the bunch because the treatment period is quite concise : it was only four months .
" i thought it was one of those things where only lucky people survive , but it turns out that - particularly with children - there is an amazing prognosis - 70 % , or something , of children are completely cured forever .
" when it 's given a name , then that gives you a sense of security , because at least you know what you 've got , and people know how to treat you .
hair loss " they give you a two-week lot of chemotherapy , and then they 'll give you two weeks off .
" the worst bit was definitely losing my hair .
i think it 's worse if you 're a girl because obviously most girls have longer hair than most boys so you 've got a lot to lose .
i did want to be as normal as possible " they do provide you with the free , nice , nhs wig but i chose not to wear that because , it never looks like your normal hair .
" also , everyone knows you 've lost your hair so what you trying to prove ?
i chose to wear a beanie hat instead .
" you get left with these really straggly witch-like bits .
" i could have shaved them off but i did n't want to do that because you 've just seen all your hair fall out so it seems weird to speed up the process yourself .
" i do think that losing your hair is an indication that you have cancer .
it 's what people attribute to cancer .
if you are just vomiting all the time , you 're just sick .
" i did want to be as normal as possible because people think you 're sick and if people think you 're sick , people take advantage of you because they know you 're a weakling .
" obviously there was vomiting , and really , really awful muscle pain , from your lower back , to about your mid-calf , which lasted for ages .
" they give you all these restrictions on what sort of painkillers you can take .
you ca n't take anything with paracetamol in , because it mucks up the blood results .
" so you can only take codeine , which is actually better than paracetamol , but tastes pretty foul .
" as a secondary infection , i got gastroenteritis .
on chemo , because of your low immunity , you have a really low white blood cell count .
so you just ca n't fight it .
going to school " i carried on going to school because i thought that i may not get any long-term side effects from the actual treatment but if i do n't go to school it 's quite clear what they are going to be - i 'm not going to do as well as i can in the future .
" i still have the same perspective that i had when i was well , i still want to go to university .
" i thought i 'm not going to let cancer stop that .
why should it ?

she was diagnosed with hodgkin 's lymphoma last november at the age of 14 , and , after months of treatment , she is now in remission .
" for at least nine months before i was diagnosed , i started getting really bad breathing problems .
" it sounded like asthmatic breathing .
we had just been on a hiking holiday , so i noticed it a lot then , and i was convinced i had asthma .
" if i got stressed , i 'd get a tightness in my chest and in my back .
" i was in bed for a couple of days , and eventually i started thinking that this was really strange .
" i went to the doctors .
they listened to my chest and said .
" it 's completely clear , so you 're fine . "
" but i kept going back , and eventually i got sent see a paediatric consultant .
they did various tests and x-rays and heart scans .
shadow over lungs " they were all clear except the x-ray , where they saw a white shadow over my lungs .
but i was convinced i 'd moved when they were taking the x-ray .
everyone knows you 've lost your hair - what you trying to prove " then i came back for another more fancy type of scan , called a ct scan , and they said that there was volume in the shadow .
" they called me in to the paediatric inpatient department , and said : " come prepared to stay the night . "
" that was pretty scary , because the uncertainty was the worst bit .
" they said that they were n't sure exactly , but it was either leukaemia or a lymphoma .
" at the time , i thought they were joking , because i just did n't see why i 'd get cancer : i do n't think i 'm ever going to smoke , and i eat healthily and we do n't have anything hereditary .
" i went to university college london hospital , because they have a specialist adolescent cancer ward , which was really cool .
" i stayed there for about a week and a bit , for diagnosis and biopsies .
" eventually they said that i had hodgkin 's lymphoma .
they told me if you 're going to get a cancer , lymphoma 's probably the best of the bunch because the treatment period is quite concise : it was only four months .
" i thought it was one of those things where only lucky people survive , but it turns out that - particularly with children - there is an amazing prognosis - 70 % , or something , of children are completely cured forever .
" when it 's given a name , then that gives you a sense of security , because at least you know what you 've got , and people know how to treat you .
hair loss " they give you a two-week lot of chemotherapy , and then they 'll give you two weeks off .
" the worst bit was definitely losing my hair .
i think it 's worse if you 're a girl because obviously most girls have longer hair than most boys so you 've got a lot to lose .
i did want to be as normal as possible " they do provide you with the free , nice , nhs wig but i chose not to wear that because , it never looks like your normal hair .
" also , everyone knows you 've lost your hair so what you trying to prove ?
i chose to wear a beanie hat instead .
" you get left with these really straggly witch-like bits .
" i could have shaved them off but i did n't want to do that because you 've just seen all your hair fall out so it seems weird to speed up the process yourself .
" i do think that losing your hair is an indication that you have cancer .
it 's what people attribute to cancer .
if you are just vomiting all the time , you 're just sick .
" i did want to be as normal as possible because people think you 're sick and if people think you 're sick , people take advantage of you because they know you 're a weakling .
" obviously there was vomiting , and really , really awful muscle pain , from your lower back , to about your mid-calf , which lasted for ages .
" they give you all these restrictions on what sort of painkillers you can take .
you ca n't take anything with paracetamol in , because it mucks up the blood results .
" so you can only take codeine , which is actually better than paracetamol , but tastes pretty foul .
" as a secondary infection , i got gastroenteritis .
on chemo , because of your low immunity , you have a really low white blood cell count .
so you just ca n't fight it .
going to school " i carried on going to school because i thought that i may not get any long-term side effects from the actual treatment but if i do n't go to school it 's quite clear what they are going to be - i 'm not going to do as well as i can in the future .
" i still have the same perspective that i had when i was well , i still want to go to university .
" i thought i 'm not going to let cancer stop that .
why should it ?
why is that fair ?
" there 's a 95 % chance that i 'm cured forever which means that there 's only a 5 % chance that it comes back which sounds minute .
" but the chances of getting cancer as a child is something like one in every 500 , so compared to that , 5 % sounds like a massive figure .
" i think there 'll always be that fear .
" the word ' cancer ' has sort of changed its meaning .
before it was a really shocking word to hear .
" it 's still scary but i 'd say probably not as scary .
" now i think i could give like my friends and family a lot more advice if they got it , and also i could be able to empathise with them . "
