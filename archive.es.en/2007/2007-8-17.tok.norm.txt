31 .
teams are still building their rosters , and players are mulling their options . hertha berlin 's desultory 1-0 loss to lowly frankfurt on the opening weekend of the new bundesliga season confirmed what many observers suspected - that the 2007-08 squad for the former champions league participants is very much a work in progress . normally , teams like to have their line-up more-or-less in place for their first game .
but hertha spent their summer first finding a new coach , lucien favre of switzerland , then negotiating the sale and departures of no less than 11 players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's favre has had to wait for reinforcements thus far , hertha has only succeeded in landing four new signings of any import .
commercial manager dieter hoeneß has promised a handful of further acquisitions , including much-needed help up front and in midfield . the dilemma is that , while hastily agreed transfers waste money , waiting too long can leave clubs trolling for talent in already over-fished waters .
and this season many bundesliga teams - including title contenders schalke and bremen - may have erred on the side of caution and failed to find adequate replacements for key positions . bremen would love to sign a striker of the calibre of the departed miro klose , while schalke could use a replacement playmaker for long-gone lincoln .
the question is : where are they going to find players of those descriptions at this late date ? woeful wolves ' spree continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injury to new defender roberto costa has meant further wolfsburg shopping one team that ca n't be faulted for hesitancy is wolfsburg .
the wolves were more active on the transfer market than any german club north of bayern munich . wolfsburg brought in 11 new players in the summer , while unloading almost an equal number .
unfortunately , all the wheeling and dealing did n't make the wolves any less toothless than they were last year - wolfsburg dropped their opener 3-1 at home to minnows bielefeld . the club has apparently decided that more shopping is the best form of therapy , adding defender jan simunek from sparta prague and brazilian midfield international josue during the week . but more bodies to an already crowded roster may not make it easier for coach felix magath to put together a regular - and effective - starting eleven . hamburg horror scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg would n't be smiling if van der vaart , right , bolted down and some clubs that thought they had their squads sorted out may find themselves suddenly scratching their heads .
no sooner had hamburg won their opener , than a fax arrived from spanish club valencia offering 14 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- for their best player , midfielder rafael van der vaart . what 's worse , van der vaart - whose mother is spanish - apparently told a local newspaper that he was ready and more than willing to pack his bags . " it has always been my dream to play for one of the bigger spanish clubs , " the dutch playmaker was quoted as saying in the daily hamburger abendblatt . a freak back strain while lifting his 1-year-old son followed his announcement and led the dutch de telegraaf newspaper to suggest the injury may not be genuine and linked it with van der vaart 's desire to leave the northern german port city for sunny spain . " the question is whether van der vaart faked the injury , " said the report .
" it is known that he wants to go to valencia and that he considers it absurd that hamburg did n't want to talk about their offer of 14 million euros .

" there are the necessary contacts on all levels , " peer steinbrück said .
" thus far they have proved very fruitful .
we are in close contact at the national and the international level . "
in berlin , government spokesman thomas steg said the outlook for the german economy remained fundamentally positive .
" there is no reason to believe that financial market uncertainty will jump over to the real economy , " steg said .
he welcomed an initiative from eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy to look into the activities of the ratings agencies that assess credit risks .
the agencies stand accused of failing to spot the looming crisis in us subprime mortgage lending before it broke .

after a morning during which leading shares traded on the frankfurt bourse fell 1 percent within minutes of opening , the leading dax 30 index rose to a high of 7,490 , from a morning low of 7195 , before declining to 7,451 in profit taking .
the mdax index of medium shares and the tecdax technology index followed a similar course .
german banks gained ground following heavy losses over the past week , while industrials such as basf , thyssenkrupp , continental , daimlerchrysler , and man were the top losers .
london 's ftse 100 index of top shares also surged by almost 4.0 percent to move back above 6,000 points on the fed news while the paris market also rose by around 3.0 percent .
soothing stateside jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fed chairman ben bernanke approved the cut the fed 's surprise move marked its most decisive action since the financial markets became gripped by fears over a global credit crunch .
the fed said it had lowered the rate it levies on loans to banks by 50 basis points to 5.75 percent , citing " increased uncertainty " in the financial markets .
" financial market conditions have deteriorated , and tighter credit conditions and increased uncertainty have the potential to restrain economic growth going forward , " the fed cautioned in a statement .
the central bank lowered the so-called " discount " rate to help soothe the us banking system which has been stressed in the past week by a credit crunch linked to the distressed housing market .
it is extremely unusual for the fed to act outside of its scheduled rate meetings and the last time it did so was on sept .
17 , 2001 , after the terrorist attacks that targeted new york and washington .
the move does not affect its key short-term federal funds interest rate which stands at 5.25 percent .
fed hoping to restore " orderly conditions " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us housing market woes have been felt globally the fed - which has also injected tens of billions of dollars into the stretched financial system in the past week - said it had trimmed its discount rate in a bid to restore " orderly conditions in financial markets " which have been rocked by credit fears and the troubles plaguing the housing market .
" although recent data suggest that the economy has continued to expand at a moderate pace , the federal open market committee judges that the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably , " the fed said .
the central bank said it was continuing to monitor the situation and that it was ready to act as necessary " to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets . "
us banks have tightened their lending practices in recent weeks as the financial storm affecting mortgage firms has worsened and many investors have shunned mortgage-backed securities amid a jump in home foreclosures . article based on agency reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

high-ranking german government officials on friday reiterated the country 's commitment to continue its mission in afghanistan as canadian and us officials urged berlin to increase the number of troops . attending a memorial service for three german police officers who were killed by in a bomb attack outside the afghan capital of kabul on wednesday , deputy interior minister august hanning said that the german deployment to afghanistan was in the interest of germany 's own security .
" i can assure that the german government is fully committed to the engagement in afghanistan , " hanning said in kabul on friday , calling the memorial service " a very bitter moment . "

german chancellor angela merkel personally knew one of the men as he was assigned to her security detail for several years before being sent to afghanistan .
the men were the first german police officers to be killed in afghanistan .
since the start of the mission , 25 german soldiers have died , 14 of them in attacks .

dubois said that 66 canadian military personnel and one canadian diplomat had died in afghanistan so far .
germany currently has some 3,000 soldiers stationed in afghanistan and three separate mandates are up for renewal by the parliament in the fall .
going south several german lawmakers have been traveling to afghanistan , nato 's headquarters in brussels and allied countries to prepare an extension of the mission , which is increasingly losing support in germany .
jörn thiessen , a social democratic member of parliament and his party 's defense expert , told rheinische post newspaper that us officials had told him they were expecting germany to beef up its training of afghan soldiers .
thiessen added that the americans were aware of germany 's concerns to send troops to the more dangerous south , but had asked that german soldiers accompany afghan trainees in case they are moved from the safer region around kabul to the south .

" this is something that 's under consideration within the federal government , " he said , adding that it was still unclear whether an expansion could happen within the current mandate , which is limited to 3,600 troops .
" what 's clear is that our work in the north can not be called into question just because we 're taking on new tasks , " he said , adding that convincing the german population of the importance of the afghanistan mission had failed so far . article based on news reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

31 .
teams are still building their rosters , and players are mulling their options . hertha berlin 's desultory 1-0 loss to lowly frankfurt on the opening weekend of the new bundesliga season confirmed what many observers suspected - that the 2007-08 squad for the former champions league participants is very much a work in progress . normally , teams like to have their line-up more-or-less in place for their first game .
but hertha spent their summer first finding a new coach , lucien favre of switzerland , then negotiating the sale and departures of no less than 11 players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's favre has had to wait for reinforcements thus far , hertha has only succeeded in landing four new signings of any import .
commercial manager dieter hoeneß has promised a handful of further acquisitions , including much-needed help up front and in midfield . the dilemma is that , while hastily agreed transfers waste money , waiting too long can leave clubs trolling for talent in already over-fished waters .
and this season many bundesliga teams - including title contenders schalke and bremen - may have erred on the side of caution and failed to find adequate replacements for key positions . bremen would love to sign a striker of the calibre of the departed miro klose , while schalke could use a replacement playmaker for long-gone lincoln .

the wolves were more active on the transfer market than any german club north of bayern munich . wolfsburg brought in 11 new players in the summer , while unloading almost an equal number .
unfortunately , all the wheeling and dealing did n't make the wolves any less toothless than they were last year - wolfsburg dropped their opener 3-1 at home to minnows bielefeld . the club has apparently decided that more shopping is the best form of therapy , adding defender jan simunek from sparta prague and brazilian midfield international josue during the week . but more bodies to an already crowded roster may not make it easier for coach felix magath to put together a regular - and effective - starting eleven . hamburg horror scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg would n't be smiling if van der vaart , right , bolted down and some clubs that thought they had their squads sorted out may find themselves suddenly scratching their heads .
no sooner had hamburg won their opener , than a fax arrived from spanish club valencia offering 14 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- for their best player , midfielder rafael van der vaart . what 's worse , van der vaart - whose mother is spanish - apparently told a local newspaper that he was ready and more than willing to pack his bags . " it has always been my dream to play for one of the bigger spanish clubs , " the dutch playmaker was quoted as saying in the daily hamburger abendblatt . a freak back strain while lifting his 1-year-old son followed his announcement and led the dutch de telegraaf newspaper to suggest the injury may not be genuine and linked it with van der vaart 's desire to leave the northern german port city for sunny spain . " the question is whether van der vaart faked the injury , " said the report .
" it is known that he wants to go to valencia and that he considers it absurd that hamburg did n't want to talk about their offer of 14 million euros . " playing thursday could undermine his eligibility for european action at valencia . hamburg has said it has no intentions at all of selling van der vaart .
his departure , should it come to pass , would temporarily debilitate a side that seemed on its way to recovering from a disappointing and nearly disastrous last season . and it would force hamburg to join the other bundesliga clubs frantically combing the market for the final piece in the puzzle or , in some cases , for significant portions of their squads . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

31 .
teams are still building their rosters , and players are mulling their options . hertha berlin 's desultory 1-0 loss to lowly frankfurt on the opening weekend of the new bundesliga season confirmed what many observers suspected - that the 2007-08 squad for the former champions league participants is very much a work in progress . normally , teams like to have their line-up more-or-less in place for their first game .
but hertha spent their summer first finding a new coach , lucien favre of switzerland , then negotiating the sale and departures of no less than 11 players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's favre has had to wait for reinforcements thus far , hertha has only succeeded in landing four new signings of any import .

previously , he taught at williams college and yale university .
his main areas of research are organized crime , corruption , soviet criminal history , and the dynamics of altruistic behaviour .
his book , " the russian mafia " won the ed hewitt prize of the american association for the advancement of slavic studies . dw-world : de : according to italian interior minister giuliano amato , the six killings in duisburg are linked to the ongoing san luca clan feud .
italian anti-mafia prosecutor pietro grasso has said that such killings being carried out on non-italian soil is unprecedented .
what is the significance of the killings ? federico varese : among the mafia in italy - and we just did a study on the reporting on various italian criminal groups in italy in the media - the ‘ ndrangheta is the one that is usually under the radar .
it has always been the one that has been able to avoid major scrutiny from the media so it kept a very low profile .
so it ’ s a big step to do such a high profile murder in a different country especially . obviously it raises the alarm in germany as well .
so in that sense , it ’ s quite a departure from what we have seen before .
but of course they -lrb- ‘ ndrangheta -rrb- have killed prominent politicians before . they are ruthless and in a sense they see this just as a continuation of what they do at home .
but i think from our point of view , from the point of view of the public at least , it really raises the bar . do these recent killings in duisburg indicate that ‘ ndrangheta has expanded into germany , or might it simply be the case that some of these people were in germany to escape mafia feuds back home in calabria ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency services on the scene in duisburg where the shooting took place what we know is that there is a lot of money laundering going on among the ‘ ndrangheta in various countries in europe . germany is one of those . so i do n't think these murders show anything really except that they are taking the violence outside of their home territory . earlier , they -lrb- ' ndrangheta -rrb- might have done money laundering in different countries but now it seems they are sort of expanding to violence in their activities abroad .
that 's quite significant . what interests might ‘ ndrangheta have in germany ? i think this is a general issue about so-called money laundering .
in some ways you could think that money laundering is not such a terrible crime because it ’ s a way to inject money into the economy , although it is a crime under most laws , but it ’ s obviously different from hard core crime like murder . but i think what it -lrb- the killings -rrb- highlight is that one might follow the other .
so once we allow proceeds from crime to seep into another economy or part of europe where they come from , say drug money or extortion money into germany from italy , it does not mean that is the end of it .
it might mean that the next stage is actually somehow the rooting of the group into this territory .
so i guess this is the lesson , the general point , that comes out of this instance . your research has focussed on why the ‘ ndrangheta was able to successfully expand into bardonecchia in piedmont but not verona .
what are the conditions that allow ‘ ndrangheta , to transplant itself to some places and not others ? most observers would point to migration as the main element that allows this expansion to occur . migration of people from the same territory might be a factor that helps transplantation . however , italians and people from calabria , from southern italy , from sicily , have migrated to many , many parts of the world and there was no mafia .
so it 's not as if everywhere italians migrate there is mafia – that would be a really big misconception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ' ndrangheta member giorgio basile testified in a german court in july i think in addition to migration , there are some local conditions that allow these local groups to become entrenched .
some of the conditions we have observed in northern italy , such as in piedmont , was that they were able to corner certain markets through the use of violence . what is most extraordinary about the town of bardonecchia , just outside turin , is that the town has a very , very different social and cultural makeup from southern italy .
it was a place where people would trust each other and feel safe , but there were social and economic conditions that allowed the ‘ ndrangheta to move there . one of these was connected to the state business and the construction business .
some of the calabrese that had been working in the construction business were connected to the mafia . these people helped to create cartels of firms that were connected to calabria and cornered the market so they used violence to prevent other firms to enter this market . it was a combination situation because there was a demand for their services - some people actually benefited from their presence .
the firms that were allowed to enter this very lucrative market were very happy .
and some of the workers , somewhat illegal workers , who were not legally registered with the trade unions in particular also were happy because they found employment - when they couldn ’ t find jobs in the big industries in turin , like fiat . so there was a lethal combination of some people of the economic elite who found advantages in having the ‘ ndrangheta , and some workers and this is what explains why the ‘ ndrangheta was successful in becoming entrenched in this part of italy .
that 's what germany has to look out for - make sure that these organizations don ’ t have the possibility to corner markets and eventually to generate some sort of support for their presence . is it possible for ‘ ndrangheta to recreate conditions like those in southern italy in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction sector is usually a magnet for mob activity in principle yes .
it depends on the local markets and how careful the political elite , the police and the judiciary and various other institutions of authority are to make sure that there is no access to these markets .
but there are some special markets which are more easily penetrated by organized crime - construction is typically one of those markets . special attention must be paid to these markets . in principle , it is possible that the ‘ ndrangheta does move up one step from simple money laundering to becoming entrenched in the german economy .
and this is the most dangerous situation , ever , you can imagine .
a german construction firm wanting to enter the market and prevent its competitors from entering it , might actually benefit from having their presence . obviously these guys -lrb- the ' ndrangheta -rrb- have a reputation for violence , an ability to use violence and have shown how much they can use violence in this instance .
that 's how they build up their reputation .
so next time around , if i am a german entrepreneur and someone with a calabrian accent comes around and says , ' get out of this market or i ’ ll punish you , ' i ’ ll be more inclined to believe him and move out . given the worldwide presence of ‘ ndrangheta can we expect more of these clan wars or feuds to be carried out internationally ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in july this year , italian police arrested notorious mafia boss giuseppe bellocco in calabria , southern italy that ’ s hard to tell .
i think the feud in particular will certainly continue in san luca if this is the reason behind -lrb- the killings -rrb- .
they must have felt really confident about carrying out this operation in germany . they must have been able to have intelligence on the ground .
i don ’ t think the ‘ ndrangheta has this level of intelligence everywhere .
but obviously they must have had it in this town -lrb- duisburg -rrb- because how would you know that these people were going to that restaurant ?
how would you know they were the right ones coming out at that time ?

previously , he taught at williams college and yale university .
his main areas of research are organized crime , corruption , soviet criminal history , and the dynamics of altruistic behaviour .
his book , " the russian mafia " won the ed hewitt prize of the american association for the advancement of slavic studies . dw-world : de : according to italian interior minister giuliano amato , the six killings in duisburg are linked to the ongoing san luca clan feud .
italian anti-mafia prosecutor pietro grasso has said that such killings being carried out on non-italian soil is unprecedented .
what is the significance of the killings ? federico varese : among the mafia in italy - and we just did a study on the reporting on various italian criminal groups in italy in the media - the ‘ ndrangheta is the one that is usually under the radar .
it has always been the one that has been able to avoid major scrutiny from the media so it kept a very low profile .
so it ’ s a big step to do such a high profile murder in a different country especially . obviously it raises the alarm in germany as well .
so in that sense , it ’ s quite a departure from what we have seen before .
but of course they -lrb- ‘ ndrangheta -rrb- have killed prominent politicians before . they are ruthless and in a sense they see this just as a continuation of what they do at home .
but i think from our point of view , from the point of view of the public at least , it really raises the bar . do these recent killings in duisburg indicate that ‘ ndrangheta has expanded into germany , or might it simply be the case that some of these people were in germany to escape mafia feuds back home in calabria ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency services on the scene in duisburg where the shooting took place what we know is that there is a lot of money laundering going on among the ‘ ndrangheta in various countries in europe . germany is one of those . so i do n't think these murders show anything really except that they are taking the violence outside of their home territory . earlier , they -lrb- ' ndrangheta -rrb- might have done money laundering in different countries but now it seems they are sort of expanding to violence in their activities abroad .
that 's quite significant . what interests might ‘ ndrangheta have in germany ? i think this is a general issue about so-called money laundering .
in some ways you could think that money laundering is not such a terrible crime because it ’ s a way to inject money into the economy , although it is a crime under most laws , but it ’ s obviously different from hard core crime like murder . but i think what it -lrb- the killings -rrb- highlight is that one might follow the other .
so once we allow proceeds from crime to seep into another economy or part of europe where they come from , say drug money or extortion money into germany from italy , it does not mean that is the end of it .
it might mean that the next stage is actually somehow the rooting of the group into this territory .
so i guess this is the lesson , the general point , that comes out of this instance . your research has focussed on why the ‘ ndrangheta was able to successfully expand into bardonecchia in piedmont but not verona .
what are the conditions that allow ‘ ndrangheta , to transplant itself to some places and not others ? most observers would point to migration as the main element that allows this expansion to occur . migration of people from the same territory might be a factor that helps transplantation . however , italians and people from calabria , from southern italy , from sicily , have migrated to many , many parts of the world and there was no mafia .
so it 's not as if everywhere italians migrate there is mafia – that would be a really big misconception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ' ndrangheta member giorgio basile testified in a german court in july i think in addition to migration , there are some local conditions that allow these local groups to become entrenched .
some of the conditions we have observed in northern italy , such as in piedmont , was that they were able to corner certain markets through the use of violence . what is most extraordinary about the town of bardonecchia , just outside turin , is that the town has a very , very different social and cultural makeup from southern italy .
it was a place where people would trust each other and feel safe , but there were social and economic conditions that allowed the ‘ ndrangheta to move there . one of these was connected to the state business and the construction business .
some of the calabrese that had been working in the construction business were connected to the mafia . these people helped to create cartels of firms that were connected to calabria and cornered the market so they used violence to prevent other firms to enter this market . it was a combination situation because there was a demand for their services - some people actually benefited from their presence .
the firms that were allowed to enter this very lucrative market were very happy .
and some of the workers , somewhat illegal workers , who were not legally registered with the trade unions in particular also were happy because they found employment - when they couldn ’ t find jobs in the big industries in turin , like fiat . so there was a lethal combination of some people of the economic elite who found advantages in having the ‘ ndrangheta , and some workers and this is what explains why the ‘ ndrangheta was successful in becoming entrenched in this part of italy .
that 's what germany has to look out for - make sure that these organizations don ’ t have the possibility to corner markets and eventually to generate some sort of support for their presence . is it possible for ‘ ndrangheta to recreate conditions like those in southern italy in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction sector is usually a magnet for mob activity in principle yes .
it depends on the local markets and how careful the political elite , the police and the judiciary and various other institutions of authority are to make sure that there is no access to these markets .
but there are some special markets which are more easily penetrated by organized crime - construction is typically one of those markets . special attention must be paid to these markets . in principle , it is possible that the ‘ ndrangheta does move up one step from simple money laundering to becoming entrenched in the german economy .
and this is the most dangerous situation , ever , you can imagine .
a german construction firm wanting to enter the market and prevent its competitors from entering it , might actually benefit from having their presence . obviously these guys -lrb- the ' ndrangheta -rrb- have a reputation for violence , an ability to use violence and have shown how much they can use violence in this instance .
that 's how they build up their reputation .
so next time around , if i am a german entrepreneur and someone with a calabrian accent comes around and says , ' get out of this market or i ’ ll punish you , ' i ’ ll be more inclined to believe him and move out . given the worldwide presence of ‘ ndrangheta can we expect more of these clan wars or feuds to be carried out internationally ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in july this year , italian police arrested notorious mafia boss giuseppe bellocco in calabria , southern italy that ’ s hard to tell .
i think the feud in particular will certainly continue in san luca if this is the reason behind -lrb- the killings -rrb- .
they must have felt really confident about carrying out this operation in germany . they must have been able to have intelligence on the ground .
i don ’ t think the ‘ ndrangheta has this level of intelligence everywhere .
but obviously they must have had it in this town -lrb- duisburg -rrb- because how would you know that these people were going to that restaurant ?

high-ranking german government officials on friday reiterated the country 's commitment to continue its mission in afghanistan as canadian and us officials urged berlin to increase the number of troops . attending a memorial service for three german police officers who were killed by in a bomb attack outside the afghan capital of kabul on wednesday , deputy interior minister august hanning said that the german deployment to afghanistan was in the interest of germany 's own security .
" i can assure that the german government is fully committed to the engagement in afghanistan , " hanning said in kabul on friday , calling the memorial service " a very bitter moment . "

german chancellor angela merkel personally knew one of the men as he was assigned to her security detail for several years before being sent to afghanistan .
the men were the first german police officers to be killed in afghanistan .
since the start of the mission , 25 german soldiers have died , 14 of them in attacks .
more germans wanted canadian and us officials meanwhile have called on germany to increase its presence in afghanistan .
" we would welcome it if germany and other countries - this is a concerted nato effort - would send more soldiers , " paul dubois , the canadian ambassador to germany , told the public broadcast deutschlandradio on friday .

dubois said that 66 canadian military personnel and one canadian diplomat had died in afghanistan so far .
germany currently has some 3,000 soldiers stationed in afghanistan and three separate mandates are up for renewal by the parliament in the fall .
going south several german lawmakers have been traveling to afghanistan , nato 's headquarters in brussels and allied countries to prepare an extension of the mission , which is increasingly losing support in germany .
jörn thiessen , a social democratic member of parliament and his party 's defense expert , told rheinische post newspaper that us officials had told him they were expecting germany to beef up its training of afghan soldiers .
thiessen added that the americans were aware of germany 's concerns to send troops to the more dangerous south , but had asked that german soldiers accompany afghan trainees in case they are moved from the safer region around kabul to the south .

" this is something that 's under consideration within the federal government , " he said , adding that it was still unclear whether an expansion could happen within the current mandate , which is limited to 3,600 troops .
" what 's clear is that our work in the north can not be called into question just because we 're taking on new tasks , " he said , adding that convincing the german population of the importance of the afghanistan mission had failed so far . article based on news reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

during her time with the raf , which is also known as the baader-meinhof gang , haule rose through the ranks to become the highest-ranking woman in the terrorist organization and one of its most sought-after members .
her seniority in the raf led to her involvement in the crimes , which saw her initially convicted on weapons possession charges and for membership in a terrorist organization in 1988 , and then for murder and causing explosions in 1994 .
the 1988 conviction in stuttgart , for her involvement in an attempted bomb attack on a nato facility in bavaria and a raid on an arms dealer , led to a 15-year sentence that was upgraded to life six years later .

she was also connected by the frankfurt court to two other killings and 23 attempted murders .
when she was arrested in an ice cream parlor with two additional suspects in august 1986 , haule and her associates were in possession of blueprints for the federal ministry of economic collaboration , which led investigators to believe she was masterminding a future attack on the government building .
in recent years , haule spoke through her representatives from prison of her " extremely heavy guilt " in regard to her terrorist past .
her behavior behind bars over the years also led to a downgrading of her security status ; haule was moved from the women 's prison at frankfurt preungesheim to the women 's custody institution in berlin-neukölln .
there , as an open prisoner , haule studied social educational theory and took a training course in photography .

germany 's opposition parties attacked chancellor angela merkel over her visit to greenland .
they said the trip was a pr gag that took the place of real action against climate change . chancellor merkel wraps up her two-day visit to greenland on friday with a helicopter trip around the island .
accompanied by her environment minister sigmar gabriel , a member of the social democratic party , and the premiers of greenland and denmark on thursday , she viewed ilulissat fjord , where the effects of global warming are particularly visible . and then she defended herself .
" getting an idea of things on location never hurt , " she said at a press conference .
only then could one win over people to take action with " elan and energy " against the effects of climate change .
merkel was responding to criticism from top opposition politicians , who accused her of using the trip as a pr gag instead of pursuing policies to minimize germany 's negative impact on the climate .
" historical mistake " " the merkel / gabriel tour group wo n't find what it desperately needs in greenland 's melting ice : the political decisiveness to take responsible action against climate change , " said green party chief reinhard bütikofer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether symbolic or not , the backdrop was certainly impressive he said instead of staging such a trip , merkel needed to provide " solid political craft to overcome the impediments to a climate policy without ifs and buts in the only place where that can happen : at home . "
free-market liberal fdp leader guido westerwelle was also harsh . " it 's a historical mistake to restrict environment policy to symbolism , " he said , calling into question germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
climate remains focus " if mrs. merkel believes she has to go to greenland to inform herself about the effects of climate change , she should do that .
traveling is educational , " said the left party 's gesine lötzsch . "
merkel said germany would continue to focus on climate protection during the remainder of its presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrial nations , which ends when japan takes over in january . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court said that she no longer posed a public threat . the frankfurt court announced on friday that it had ordered the release on parole of former red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- member eva haule after determining that she no is longer a danger to the public after 21 years in prison .
haule , who was first arrested in 1986 , was serving a life sentence for the three murders , including that of a us army soldier in wiesbaden in 1985 .
when she is released on tuesday , she will become the second member of the radical left-wing group to win parole this year .
during her time with the raf , which is also known as the baader-meinhof gang , haule rose through the ranks to become the highest-ranking woman in the terrorist organization and one of its most sought-after members .
her seniority in the raf led to her involvement in the crimes , which saw her initially convicted on weapons possession charges and for membership in a terrorist organization in 1988 , and then for murder and causing explosions in 1994 .
the 1988 conviction in stuttgart , for her involvement in an attempted bomb attack on a nato facility in bavaria and a raid on an arms dealer , led to a 15-year sentence that was upgraded to life six years later .

she was also connected by the frankfurt court to two other killings and 23 attempted murders .
when she was arrested in an ice cream parlor with two additional suspects in august 1986 , haule and her associates were in possession of blueprints for the federal ministry of economic collaboration , which led investigators to believe she was masterminding a future attack on the government building .
in recent years , haule spoke through her representatives from prison of her " extremely heavy guilt " in regard to her terrorist past .
her behavior behind bars over the years also led to a downgrading of her security status ; haule was moved from the women 's prison at frankfurt preungesheim to the women 's custody institution in berlin-neukölln .
there , as an open prisoner , haule studied social educational theory and took a training course in photography .
in march 2005 , an exhibition of portraits of fellow inmates was held in a parliamentary building in berlin , which caused outrage among liberal and conservative politicians at the time .
her photos have since appeared in a number of publications and books .

" there are the necessary contacts on all levels , " peer steinbrück said .
" thus far they have proved very fruitful .
we are in close contact at the national and the international level . "
in berlin , government spokesman thomas steg said the outlook for the german economy remained fundamentally positive .
" there is no reason to believe that financial market uncertainty will jump over to the real economy , " steg said .
he welcomed an initiative from eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy to look into the activities of the ratings agencies that assess credit risks .
the agencies stand accused of failing to spot the looming crisis in us subprime mortgage lending before it broke .
fed interest cut causes market surge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been a turbulent time for the frankfurt exchange meanwhile , german shares rose strongly in friday 's afternoon trading on news that the us federal reserve -lrb- fed -rrb- had cut the interest rate it charges commercial banks by half of a percentage point .
after a morning during which leading shares traded on the frankfurt bourse fell 1 percent within minutes of opening , the leading dax 30 index rose to a high of 7,490 , from a morning low of 7195 , before declining to 7,451 in profit taking .
the mdax index of medium shares and the tecdax technology index followed a similar course .
german banks gained ground following heavy losses over the past week , while industrials such as basf , thyssenkrupp , continental , daimlerchrysler , and man were the top losers .
london 's ftse 100 index of top shares also surged by almost 4.0 percent to move back above 6,000 points on the fed news while the paris market also rose by around 3.0 percent .
soothing stateside jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fed chairman ben bernanke approved the cut the fed 's surprise move marked its most decisive action since the financial markets became gripped by fears over a global credit crunch .
the fed said it had lowered the rate it levies on loans to banks by 50 basis points to 5.75 percent , citing " increased uncertainty " in the financial markets .
" financial market conditions have deteriorated , and tighter credit conditions and increased uncertainty have the potential to restrain economic growth going forward , " the fed cautioned in a statement .
the central bank lowered the so-called " discount " rate to help soothe the us banking system which has been stressed in the past week by a credit crunch linked to the distressed housing market .
it is extremely unusual for the fed to act outside of its scheduled rate meetings and the last time it did so was on sept .
17 , 2001 , after the terrorist attacks that targeted new york and washington .
the move does not affect its key short-term federal funds interest rate which stands at 5.25 percent .
fed hoping to restore " orderly conditions " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us housing market woes have been felt globally the fed - which has also injected tens of billions of dollars into the stretched financial system in the past week - said it had trimmed its discount rate in a bid to restore " orderly conditions in financial markets " which have been rocked by credit fears and the troubles plaguing the housing market .
" although recent data suggest that the economy has continued to expand at a moderate pace , the federal open market committee judges that the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably , " the fed said .
the central bank said it was continuing to monitor the situation and that it was ready to act as necessary " to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets . "
us banks have tightened their lending practices in recent weeks as the financial storm affecting mortgage firms has worsened and many investors have shunned mortgage-backed securities amid a jump in home foreclosures . article based on agency reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

31 .
teams are still building their rosters , and players are mulling their options . hertha berlin 's desultory 1-0 loss to lowly frankfurt on the opening weekend of the new bundesliga season confirmed what many observers suspected - that the 2007-08 squad for the former champions league participants is very much a work in progress . normally , teams like to have their line-up more-or-less in place for their first game .
but hertha spent their summer first finding a new coach , lucien favre of switzerland , then negotiating the sale and departures of no less than 11 players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's favre has had to wait for reinforcements thus far , hertha has only succeeded in landing four new signings of any import .
commercial manager dieter hoeneß has promised a handful of further acquisitions , including much-needed help up front and in midfield . the dilemma is that , while hastily agreed transfers waste money , waiting too long can leave clubs trolling for talent in already over-fished waters .
and this season many bundesliga teams - including title contenders schalke and bremen - may have erred on the side of caution and failed to find adequate replacements for key positions . bremen would love to sign a striker of the calibre of the departed miro klose , while schalke could use a replacement playmaker for long-gone lincoln .

the wolves were more active on the transfer market than any german club north of bayern munich . wolfsburg brought in 11 new players in the summer , while unloading almost an equal number .
unfortunately , all the wheeling and dealing did n't make the wolves any less toothless than they were last year - wolfsburg dropped their opener 3-1 at home to minnows bielefeld . the club has apparently decided that more shopping is the best form of therapy , adding defender jan simunek from sparta prague and brazilian midfield international josue during the week . but more bodies to an already crowded roster may not make it easier for coach felix magath to put together a regular - and effective - starting eleven . hamburg horror scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg would n't be smiling if van der vaart , right , bolted down and some clubs that thought they had their squads sorted out may find themselves suddenly scratching their heads .
no sooner had hamburg won their opener , than a fax arrived from spanish club valencia offering 14 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- for their best player , midfielder rafael van der vaart . what 's worse , van der vaart - whose mother is spanish - apparently told a local newspaper that he was ready and more than willing to pack his bags . " it has always been my dream to play for one of the bigger spanish clubs , " the dutch playmaker was quoted as saying in the daily hamburger abendblatt . a freak back strain while lifting his 1-year-old son followed his announcement and led the dutch de telegraaf newspaper to suggest the injury may not be genuine and linked it with van der vaart 's desire to leave the northern german port city for sunny spain .

" it is known that he wants to go to valencia and that he considers it absurd that hamburg did n't want to talk about their offer of 14 million euros .

german chancellor angela merkel personally knew one of the men as he was assigned to her security detail for several years before being sent to afghanistan .
the men were the first german police officers to be killed in afghanistan .
since the start of the mission , 25 german soldiers have died , 14 of them in attacks .
more germans wanted canadian and us officials meanwhile have called on germany to increase its presence in afghanistan .

thiessen added that the americans were aware of germany 's concerns to send troops to the more dangerous south , but had asked that german soldiers accompany afghan trainees in case they are moved from the safer region around kabul to the south .

the court said that she no longer posed a public threat . the frankfurt court announced on friday that it had ordered the release on parole of former red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- member eva haule after determining that she no is longer a danger to the public after 21 years in prison .
haule , who was first arrested in 1986 , was serving a life sentence for the three murders , including that of a us army soldier in wiesbaden in 1985 .
when she is released on tuesday , she will become the second member of the radical left-wing group to win parole this year .
during her time with the raf , which is also known as the baader-meinhof gang , haule rose through the ranks to become the highest-ranking woman in the terrorist organization and one of its most sought-after members .
her seniority in the raf led to her involvement in the crimes , which saw her initially convicted on weapons possession charges and for membership in a terrorist organization in 1988 , and then for murder and causing explosions in 1994 .
the 1988 conviction in stuttgart , for her involvement in an attempted bomb attack on a nato facility in bavaria and a raid on an arms dealer , led to a 15-year sentence that was upgraded to life six years later .
murders and bombings mean life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us rhein-main air base was targeted in 1985 a frankfurt court found her guilty in 1994 of participating in the murder of edward pimental , a 20-year-old soldier from new york city , and the bombing of the us rhein-main air base , both in august 1985 .
she was also connected by the frankfurt court to two other killings and 23 attempted murders .
when she was arrested in an ice cream parlor with two additional suspects in august 1986 , haule and her associates were in possession of blueprints for the federal ministry of economic collaboration , which led investigators to believe she was masterminding a future attack on the government building .
in recent years , haule spoke through her representatives from prison of her " extremely heavy guilt " in regard to her terrorist past .
her behavior behind bars over the years also led to a downgrading of her security status ; haule was moved from the women 's prison at frankfurt preungesheim to the women 's custody institution in berlin-neukölln .
there , as an open prisoner , haule studied social educational theory and took a training course in photography .
in march 2005 , an exhibition of portraits of fellow inmates was held in a parliamentary building in berlin , which caused outrage among liberal and conservative politicians at the time .
her photos have since appeared in a number of publications and books .

" there are the necessary contacts on all levels , " peer steinbrück said .
" thus far they have proved very fruitful .
we are in close contact at the national and the international level . "
in berlin , government spokesman thomas steg said the outlook for the german economy remained fundamentally positive .
" there is no reason to believe that financial market uncertainty will jump over to the real economy , " steg said .
he welcomed an initiative from eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy to look into the activities of the ratings agencies that assess credit risks .
the agencies stand accused of failing to spot the looming crisis in us subprime mortgage lending before it broke .
fed interest cut causes market surge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been a turbulent time for the frankfurt exchange meanwhile , german shares rose strongly in friday 's afternoon trading on news that the us federal reserve -lrb- fed -rrb- had cut the interest rate it charges commercial banks by half of a percentage point .
after a morning during which leading shares traded on the frankfurt bourse fell 1 percent within minutes of opening , the leading dax 30 index rose to a high of 7,490 , from a morning low of 7195 , before declining to 7,451 in profit taking .
the mdax index of medium shares and the tecdax technology index followed a similar course .
german banks gained ground following heavy losses over the past week , while industrials such as basf , thyssenkrupp , continental , daimlerchrysler , and man were the top losers .

soothing stateside jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fed chairman ben bernanke approved the cut the fed 's surprise move marked its most decisive action since the financial markets became gripped by fears over a global credit crunch .
the fed said it had lowered the rate it levies on loans to banks by 50 basis points to 5.75 percent , citing " increased uncertainty " in the financial markets .
" financial market conditions have deteriorated , and tighter credit conditions and increased uncertainty have the potential to restrain economic growth going forward , " the fed cautioned in a statement .
the central bank lowered the so-called " discount " rate to help soothe the us banking system which has been stressed in the past week by a credit crunch linked to the distressed housing market .
it is extremely unusual for the fed to act outside of its scheduled rate meetings and the last time it did so was on sept .
17 , 2001 , after the terrorist attacks that targeted new york and washington .
the move does not affect its key short-term federal funds interest rate which stands at 5.25 percent .
fed hoping to restore " orderly conditions " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us housing market woes have been felt globally the fed - which has also injected tens of billions of dollars into the stretched financial system in the past week - said it had trimmed its discount rate in a bid to restore " orderly conditions in financial markets " which have been rocked by credit fears and the troubles plaguing the housing market .
" although recent data suggest that the economy has continued to expand at a moderate pace , the federal open market committee judges that the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably , " the fed said .
the central bank said it was continuing to monitor the situation and that it was ready to act as necessary " to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets . "

german chancellor angela merkel personally knew one of the men as he was assigned to her security detail for several years before being sent to afghanistan .
the men were the first german police officers to be killed in afghanistan .
since the start of the mission , 25 german soldiers have died , 14 of them in attacks .
more germans wanted canadian and us officials meanwhile have called on germany to increase its presence in afghanistan .
" we would welcome it if germany and other countries - this is a concerted nato effort - would send more soldiers , " paul dubois , the canadian ambassador to germany , told the public broadcast deutschlandradio on friday .

dubois said that 66 canadian military personnel and one canadian diplomat had died in afghanistan so far .
germany currently has some 3,000 soldiers stationed in afghanistan and three separate mandates are up for renewal by the parliament in the fall .
going south several german lawmakers have been traveling to afghanistan , nato 's headquarters in brussels and allied countries to prepare an extension of the mission , which is increasingly losing support in germany .
jörn thiessen , a social democratic member of parliament and his party 's defense expert , told rheinische post newspaper that us officials had told him they were expecting germany to beef up its training of afghan soldiers .
thiessen added that the americans were aware of germany 's concerns to send troops to the more dangerous south , but had asked that german soldiers accompany afghan trainees in case they are moved from the safer region around kabul to the south .

" this is something that 's under consideration within the federal government , " he said , adding that it was still unclear whether an expansion could happen within the current mandate , which is limited to 3,600 troops .
" what 's clear is that our work in the north can not be called into question just because we 're taking on new tasks , " he said , adding that convincing the german population of the importance of the afghanistan mission had failed so far . article based on news reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

31 .
teams are still building their rosters , and players are mulling their options . hertha berlin 's desultory 1-0 loss to lowly frankfurt on the opening weekend of the new bundesliga season confirmed what many observers suspected - that the 2007-08 squad for the former champions league participants is very much a work in progress . normally , teams like to have their line-up more-or-less in place for their first game .
but hertha spent their summer first finding a new coach , lucien favre of switzerland , then negotiating the sale and departures of no less than 11 players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's favre has had to wait for reinforcements thus far , hertha has only succeeded in landing four new signings of any import .
commercial manager dieter hoeneß has promised a handful of further acquisitions , including much-needed help up front and in midfield . the dilemma is that , while hastily agreed transfers waste money , waiting too long can leave clubs trolling for talent in already over-fished waters .
and this season many bundesliga teams - including title contenders schalke and bremen - may have erred on the side of caution and failed to find adequate replacements for key positions . bremen would love to sign a striker of the calibre of the departed miro klose , while schalke could use a replacement playmaker for long-gone lincoln .
the question is : where are they going to find players of those descriptions at this late date ? woeful wolves ' spree continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injury to new defender roberto costa has meant further wolfsburg shopping one team that ca n't be faulted for hesitancy is wolfsburg .
the wolves were more active on the transfer market than any german club north of bayern munich . wolfsburg brought in 11 new players in the summer , while unloading almost an equal number .
unfortunately , all the wheeling and dealing did n't make the wolves any less toothless than they were last year - wolfsburg dropped their opener 3-1 at home to minnows bielefeld . the club has apparently decided that more shopping is the best form of therapy , adding defender jan simunek from sparta prague and brazilian midfield international josue during the week . but more bodies to an already crowded roster may not make it easier for coach felix magath to put together a regular - and effective - starting eleven . hamburg horror scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg would n't be smiling if van der vaart , right , bolted down and some clubs that thought they had their squads sorted out may find themselves suddenly scratching their heads .
no sooner had hamburg won their opener , than a fax arrived from spanish club valencia offering 14 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- for their best player , midfielder rafael van der vaart . what 's worse , van der vaart - whose mother is spanish - apparently told a local newspaper that he was ready and more than willing to pack his bags . " it has always been my dream to play for one of the bigger spanish clubs , " the dutch playmaker was quoted as saying in the daily hamburger abendblatt . a freak back strain while lifting his 1-year-old son followed his announcement and led the dutch de telegraaf newspaper to suggest the injury may not be genuine and linked it with van der vaart 's desire to leave the northern german port city for sunny spain . " the question is whether van der vaart faked the injury , " said the report .
" it is known that he wants to go to valencia and that he considers it absurd that hamburg did n't want to talk about their offer of 14 million euros . " playing thursday could undermine his eligibility for european action at valencia . hamburg has said it has no intentions at all of selling van der vaart .
his departure , should it come to pass , would temporarily debilitate a side that seemed on its way to recovering from a disappointing and nearly disastrous last season . and it would force hamburg to join the other bundesliga clubs frantically combing the market for the final piece in the puzzle or , in some cases , for significant portions of their squads . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

previously , he taught at williams college and yale university .
his main areas of research are organized crime , corruption , soviet criminal history , and the dynamics of altruistic behaviour .
his book , " the russian mafia " won the ed hewitt prize of the american association for the advancement of slavic studies . dw-world : de : according to italian interior minister giuliano amato , the six killings in duisburg are linked to the ongoing san luca clan feud .
italian anti-mafia prosecutor pietro grasso has said that such killings being carried out on non-italian soil is unprecedented .
what is the significance of the killings ? federico varese : among the mafia in italy - and we just did a study on the reporting on various italian criminal groups in italy in the media - the ‘ ndrangheta is the one that is usually under the radar .
it has always been the one that has been able to avoid major scrutiny from the media so it kept a very low profile .
so it ’ s a big step to do such a high profile murder in a different country especially . obviously it raises the alarm in germany as well .
so in that sense , it ’ s quite a departure from what we have seen before .
but of course they -lrb- ‘ ndrangheta -rrb- have killed prominent politicians before . they are ruthless and in a sense they see this just as a continuation of what they do at home .
but i think from our point of view , from the point of view of the public at least , it really raises the bar . do these recent killings in duisburg indicate that ‘ ndrangheta has expanded into germany , or might it simply be the case that some of these people were in germany to escape mafia feuds back home in calabria ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency services on the scene in duisburg where the shooting took place what we know is that there is a lot of money laundering going on among the ‘ ndrangheta in various countries in europe . germany is one of those . so i do n't think these murders show anything really except that they are taking the violence outside of their home territory . earlier , they -lrb- ' ndrangheta -rrb- might have done money laundering in different countries but now it seems they are sort of expanding to violence in their activities abroad .
that 's quite significant . what interests might ‘ ndrangheta have in germany ? i think this is a general issue about so-called money laundering .
in some ways you could think that money laundering is not such a terrible crime because it ’ s a way to inject money into the economy , although it is a crime under most laws , but it ’ s obviously different from hard core crime like murder . but i think what it -lrb- the killings -rrb- highlight is that one might follow the other .
so once we allow proceeds from crime to seep into another economy or part of europe where they come from , say drug money or extortion money into germany from italy , it does not mean that is the end of it .
it might mean that the next stage is actually somehow the rooting of the group into this territory .
so i guess this is the lesson , the general point , that comes out of this instance . your research has focussed on why the ‘ ndrangheta was able to successfully expand into bardonecchia in piedmont but not verona .
what are the conditions that allow ‘ ndrangheta , to transplant itself to some places and not others ? most observers would point to migration as the main element that allows this expansion to occur . migration of people from the same territory might be a factor that helps transplantation . however , italians and people from calabria , from southern italy , from sicily , have migrated to many , many parts of the world and there was no mafia .
so it 's not as if everywhere italians migrate there is mafia – that would be a really big misconception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ' ndrangheta member giorgio basile testified in a german court in july i think in addition to migration , there are some local conditions that allow these local groups to become entrenched .
some of the conditions we have observed in northern italy , such as in piedmont , was that they were able to corner certain markets through the use of violence . what is most extraordinary about the town of bardonecchia , just outside turin , is that the town has a very , very different social and cultural makeup from southern italy .
it was a place where people would trust each other and feel safe , but there were social and economic conditions that allowed the ‘ ndrangheta to move there . one of these was connected to the state business and the construction business .
some of the calabrese that had been working in the construction business were connected to the mafia . these people helped to create cartels of firms that were connected to calabria and cornered the market so they used violence to prevent other firms to enter this market . it was a combination situation because there was a demand for their services - some people actually benefited from their presence .
the firms that were allowed to enter this very lucrative market were very happy .
and some of the workers , somewhat illegal workers , who were not legally registered with the trade unions in particular also were happy because they found employment - when they couldn ’ t find jobs in the big industries in turin , like fiat . so there was a lethal combination of some people of the economic elite who found advantages in having the ‘ ndrangheta , and some workers and this is what explains why the ‘ ndrangheta was successful in becoming entrenched in this part of italy .
that 's what germany has to look out for - make sure that these organizations don ’ t have the possibility to corner markets and eventually to generate some sort of support for their presence . is it possible for ‘ ndrangheta to recreate conditions like those in southern italy in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction sector is usually a magnet for mob activity in principle yes .
it depends on the local markets and how careful the political elite , the police and the judiciary and various other institutions of authority are to make sure that there is no access to these markets .
but there are some special markets which are more easily penetrated by organized crime - construction is typically one of those markets . special attention must be paid to these markets . in principle , it is possible that the ‘ ndrangheta does move up one step from simple money laundering to becoming entrenched in the german economy .
and this is the most dangerous situation , ever , you can imagine .
a german construction firm wanting to enter the market and prevent its competitors from entering it , might actually benefit from having their presence . obviously these guys -lrb- the ' ndrangheta -rrb- have a reputation for violence , an ability to use violence and have shown how much they can use violence in this instance .
that 's how they build up their reputation .
so next time around , if i am a german entrepreneur and someone with a calabrian accent comes around and says , ' get out of this market or i ’ ll punish you , ' i ’ ll be more inclined to believe him and move out . given the worldwide presence of ‘ ndrangheta can we expect more of these clan wars or feuds to be carried out internationally ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in july this year , italian police arrested notorious mafia boss giuseppe bellocco in calabria , southern italy that ’ s hard to tell .
i think the feud in particular will certainly continue in san luca if this is the reason behind -lrb- the killings -rrb- .
they must have felt really confident about carrying out this operation in germany . they must have been able to have intelligence on the ground .
i don ’ t think the ‘ ndrangheta has this level of intelligence everywhere .
but obviously they must have had it in this town -lrb- duisburg -rrb- because how would you know that these people were going to that restaurant ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 17.08.2007 expert says mafia murders pose new risks in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european police were surprised italian mafia violence had spread to germany an expert on organized crime warned that germany has to be alert about an expansion of mob activity within its borders after officials linked the killing of six italians in duisburg to the calabrian mafia , ' ndrangheta . federico varese is a professor of criminology and official fellow of linacre college , oxford university .
previously , he taught at williams college and yale university .
his main areas of research are organized crime , corruption , soviet criminal history , and the dynamics of altruistic behaviour .
his book , " the russian mafia " won the ed hewitt prize of the american association for the advancement of slavic studies . dw-world : de : according to italian interior minister giuliano amato , the six killings in duisburg are linked to the ongoing san luca clan feud .
italian anti-mafia prosecutor pietro grasso has said that such killings being carried out on non-italian soil is unprecedented .
what is the significance of the killings ? federico varese : among the mafia in italy - and we just did a study on the reporting on various italian criminal groups in italy in the media - the ‘ ndrangheta is the one that is usually under the radar .
it has always been the one that has been able to avoid major scrutiny from the media so it kept a very low profile .
so it ’ s a big step to do such a high profile murder in a different country especially . obviously it raises the alarm in germany as well .
so in that sense , it ’ s quite a departure from what we have seen before .
but of course they -lrb- ‘ ndrangheta -rrb- have killed prominent politicians before . they are ruthless and in a sense they see this just as a continuation of what they do at home .
but i think from our point of view , from the point of view of the public at least , it really raises the bar . do these recent killings in duisburg indicate that ‘ ndrangheta has expanded into germany , or might it simply be the case that some of these people were in germany to escape mafia feuds back home in calabria ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency services on the scene in duisburg where the shooting took place what we know is that there is a lot of money laundering going on among the ‘ ndrangheta in various countries in europe . germany is one of those . so i do n't think these murders show anything really except that they are taking the violence outside of their home territory . earlier , they -lrb- ' ndrangheta -rrb- might have done money laundering in different countries but now it seems they are sort of expanding to violence in their activities abroad .
that 's quite significant . what interests might ‘ ndrangheta have in germany ? i think this is a general issue about so-called money laundering .
in some ways you could think that money laundering is not such a terrible crime because it ’ s a way to inject money into the economy , although it is a crime under most laws , but it ’ s obviously different from hard core crime like murder . but i think what it -lrb- the killings -rrb- highlight is that one might follow the other .
so once we allow proceeds from crime to seep into another economy or part of europe where they come from , say drug money or extortion money into germany from italy , it does not mean that is the end of it .
it might mean that the next stage is actually somehow the rooting of the group into this territory .
so i guess this is the lesson , the general point , that comes out of this instance . your research has focussed on why the ‘ ndrangheta was able to successfully expand into bardonecchia in piedmont but not verona .
what are the conditions that allow ‘ ndrangheta , to transplant itself to some places and not others ? most observers would point to migration as the main element that allows this expansion to occur . migration of people from the same territory might be a factor that helps transplantation . however , italians and people from calabria , from southern italy , from sicily , have migrated to many , many parts of the world and there was no mafia .
so it 's not as if everywhere italians migrate there is mafia – that would be a really big misconception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ' ndrangheta member giorgio basile testified in a german court in july i think in addition to migration , there are some local conditions that allow these local groups to become entrenched .
some of the conditions we have observed in northern italy , such as in piedmont , was that they were able to corner certain markets through the use of violence . what is most extraordinary about the town of bardonecchia , just outside turin , is that the town has a very , very different social and cultural makeup from southern italy .
it was a place where people would trust each other and feel safe , but there were social and economic conditions that allowed the ‘ ndrangheta to move there . one of these was connected to the state business and the construction business .
some of the calabrese that had been working in the construction business were connected to the mafia . these people helped to create cartels of firms that were connected to calabria and cornered the market so they used violence to prevent other firms to enter this market . it was a combination situation because there was a demand for their services - some people actually benefited from their presence .
the firms that were allowed to enter this very lucrative market were very happy .
and some of the workers , somewhat illegal workers , who were not legally registered with the trade unions in particular also were happy because they found employment - when they couldn ’ t find jobs in the big industries in turin , like fiat . so there was a lethal combination of some people of the economic elite who found advantages in having the ‘ ndrangheta , and some workers and this is what explains why the ‘ ndrangheta was successful in becoming entrenched in this part of italy .
that 's what germany has to look out for - make sure that these organizations don ’ t have the possibility to corner markets and eventually to generate some sort of support for their presence . is it possible for ‘ ndrangheta to recreate conditions like those in southern italy in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction sector is usually a magnet for mob activity in principle yes .
it depends on the local markets and how careful the political elite , the police and the judiciary and various other institutions of authority are to make sure that there is no access to these markets .
but there are some special markets which are more easily penetrated by organized crime - construction is typically one of those markets . special attention must be paid to these markets . in principle , it is possible that the ‘ ndrangheta does move up one step from simple money laundering to becoming entrenched in the german economy .
and this is the most dangerous situation , ever , you can imagine .
a german construction firm wanting to enter the market and prevent its competitors from entering it , might actually benefit from having their presence . obviously these guys -lrb- the ' ndrangheta -rrb- have a reputation for violence , an ability to use violence and have shown how much they can use violence in this instance .
that 's how they build up their reputation .
so next time around , if i am a german entrepreneur and someone with a calabrian accent comes around and says , ' get out of this market or i ’ ll punish you , ' i ’ ll be more inclined to believe him and move out . given the worldwide presence of ‘ ndrangheta can we expect more of these clan wars or feuds to be carried out internationally ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in july this year , italian police arrested notorious mafia boss giuseppe bellocco in calabria , southern italy that ’ s hard to tell .
i think the feud in particular will certainly continue in san luca if this is the reason behind -lrb- the killings -rrb- .
they must have felt really confident about carrying out this operation in germany . they must have been able to have intelligence on the ground .
i don ’ t think the ‘ ndrangheta has this level of intelligence everywhere .
but obviously they must have had it in this town -lrb- duisburg -rrb- because how would you know that these people were going to that restaurant ?
how would you know they were the right ones coming out at that time ?
how would you know where the one you are looking for is ? stephanie raison interviewed federico varese send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court said that she no longer posed a public threat . the frankfurt court announced on friday that it had ordered the release on parole of former red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- member eva haule after determining that she no is longer a danger to the public after 21 years in prison .
haule , who was first arrested in 1986 , was serving a life sentence for the three murders , including that of a us army soldier in wiesbaden in 1985 .
when she is released on tuesday , she will become the second member of the radical left-wing group to win parole this year .
during her time with the raf , which is also known as the baader-meinhof gang , haule rose through the ranks to become the highest-ranking woman in the terrorist organization and one of its most sought-after members .
her seniority in the raf led to her involvement in the crimes , which saw her initially convicted on weapons possession charges and for membership in a terrorist organization in 1988 , and then for murder and causing explosions in 1994 .
the 1988 conviction in stuttgart , for her involvement in an attempted bomb attack on a nato facility in bavaria and a raid on an arms dealer , led to a 15-year sentence that was upgraded to life six years later .
murders and bombings mean life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us rhein-main air base was targeted in 1985 a frankfurt court found her guilty in 1994 of participating in the murder of edward pimental , a 20-year-old soldier from new york city , and the bombing of the us rhein-main air base , both in august 1985 .
she was also connected by the frankfurt court to two other killings and 23 attempted murders .
when she was arrested in an ice cream parlor with two additional suspects in august 1986 , haule and her associates were in possession of blueprints for the federal ministry of economic collaboration , which led investigators to believe she was masterminding a future attack on the government building .
in recent years , haule spoke through her representatives from prison of her " extremely heavy guilt " in regard to her terrorist past .
her behavior behind bars over the years also led to a downgrading of her security status ; haule was moved from the women 's prison at frankfurt preungesheim to the women 's custody institution in berlin-neukölln .
there , as an open prisoner , haule studied social educational theory and took a training course in photography .
in march 2005 , an exhibition of portraits of fellow inmates was held in a parliamentary building in berlin , which caused outrage among liberal and conservative politicians at the time .
her photos have since appeared in a number of publications and books .

the court said that she no longer posed a public threat . the frankfurt court announced on friday that it had ordered the release on parole of former red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- member eva haule after determining that she no is longer a danger to the public after 21 years in prison .
haule , who was first arrested in 1986 , was serving a life sentence for the three murders , including that of a us army soldier in wiesbaden in 1985 .
when she is released on tuesday , she will become the second member of the radical left-wing group to win parole this year .
during her time with the raf , which is also known as the baader-meinhof gang , haule rose through the ranks to become the highest-ranking woman in the terrorist organization and one of its most sought-after members .
her seniority in the raf led to her involvement in the crimes , which saw her initially convicted on weapons possession charges and for membership in a terrorist organization in 1988 , and then for murder and causing explosions in 1994 .
the 1988 conviction in stuttgart , for her involvement in an attempted bomb attack on a nato facility in bavaria and a raid on an arms dealer , led to a 15-year sentence that was upgraded to life six years later .
murders and bombings mean life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us rhein-main air base was targeted in 1985 a frankfurt court found her guilty in 1994 of participating in the murder of edward pimental , a 20-year-old soldier from new york city , and the bombing of the us rhein-main air base , both in august 1985 .
she was also connected by the frankfurt court to two other killings and 23 attempted murders .
when she was arrested in an ice cream parlor with two additional suspects in august 1986 , haule and her associates were in possession of blueprints for the federal ministry of economic collaboration , which led investigators to believe she was masterminding a future attack on the government building .
in recent years , haule spoke through her representatives from prison of her " extremely heavy guilt " in regard to her terrorist past .
her behavior behind bars over the years also led to a downgrading of her security status ; haule was moved from the women 's prison at frankfurt preungesheim to the women 's custody institution in berlin-neukölln .
there , as an open prisoner , haule studied social educational theory and took a training course in photography .
in march 2005 , an exhibition of portraits of fellow inmates was held in a parliamentary building in berlin , which caused outrage among liberal and conservative politicians at the time .
her photos have since appeared in a number of publications and books .

" there are the necessary contacts on all levels , " peer steinbrück said .
" thus far they have proved very fruitful .
we are in close contact at the national and the international level . "
in berlin , government spokesman thomas steg said the outlook for the german economy remained fundamentally positive .
" there is no reason to believe that financial market uncertainty will jump over to the real economy , " steg said .
he welcomed an initiative from eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy to look into the activities of the ratings agencies that assess credit risks .
the agencies stand accused of failing to spot the looming crisis in us subprime mortgage lending before it broke .

after a morning during which leading shares traded on the frankfurt bourse fell 1 percent within minutes of opening , the leading dax 30 index rose to a high of 7,490 , from a morning low of 7195 , before declining to 7,451 in profit taking .

the fed said it had lowered the rate it levies on loans to banks by 50 basis points to 5.75 percent , citing " increased uncertainty " in the financial markets .
" financial market conditions have deteriorated , and tighter credit conditions and increased uncertainty have the potential to restrain economic growth going forward , " the fed cautioned in a statement .
the central bank lowered the so-called " discount " rate to help soothe the us banking system which has been stressed in the past week by a credit crunch linked to the distressed housing market .
it is extremely unusual for the fed to act outside of its scheduled rate meetings and the last time it did so was on sept .
17 , 2001 , after the terrorist attacks that targeted new york and washington .
the move does not affect its key short-term federal funds interest rate which stands at 5.25 percent .
fed hoping to restore " orderly conditions " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us housing market woes have been felt globally the fed - which has also injected tens of billions of dollars into the stretched financial system in the past week - said it had trimmed its discount rate in a bid to restore " orderly conditions in financial markets " which have been rocked by credit fears and the troubles plaguing the housing market .
" although recent data suggest that the economy has continued to expand at a moderate pace , the federal open market committee judges that the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably , " the fed said .
the central bank said it was continuing to monitor the situation and that it was ready to act as necessary " to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets . "
us banks have tightened their lending practices in recent weeks as the financial storm affecting mortgage firms has worsened and many investors have shunned mortgage-backed securities amid a jump in home foreclosures . article based on agency reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

previously , he taught at williams college and yale university .
his main areas of research are organized crime , corruption , soviet criminal history , and the dynamics of altruistic behaviour .
his book , " the russian mafia " won the ed hewitt prize of the american association for the advancement of slavic studies . dw-world : de : according to italian interior minister giuliano amato , the six killings in duisburg are linked to the ongoing san luca clan feud .
italian anti-mafia prosecutor pietro grasso has said that such killings being carried out on non-italian soil is unprecedented .
what is the significance of the killings ? federico varese : among the mafia in italy - and we just did a study on the reporting on various italian criminal groups in italy in the media - the ‘ ndrangheta is the one that is usually under the radar .
it has always been the one that has been able to avoid major scrutiny from the media so it kept a very low profile .
so it ’ s a big step to do such a high profile murder in a different country especially . obviously it raises the alarm in germany as well .
so in that sense , it ’ s quite a departure from what we have seen before .
but of course they -lrb- ‘ ndrangheta -rrb- have killed prominent politicians before . they are ruthless and in a sense they see this just as a continuation of what they do at home .
but i think from our point of view , from the point of view of the public at least , it really raises the bar . do these recent killings in duisburg indicate that ‘ ndrangheta has expanded into germany , or might it simply be the case that some of these people were in germany to escape mafia feuds back home in calabria ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency services on the scene in duisburg where the shooting took place what we know is that there is a lot of money laundering going on among the ‘ ndrangheta in various countries in europe . germany is one of those . so i do n't think these murders show anything really except that they are taking the violence outside of their home territory . earlier , they -lrb- ' ndrangheta -rrb- might have done money laundering in different countries but now it seems they are sort of expanding to violence in their activities abroad .
that 's quite significant . what interests might ‘ ndrangheta have in germany ? i think this is a general issue about so-called money laundering .
in some ways you could think that money laundering is not such a terrible crime because it ’ s a way to inject money into the economy , although it is a crime under most laws , but it ’ s obviously different from hard core crime like murder . but i think what it -lrb- the killings -rrb- highlight is that one might follow the other .
so once we allow proceeds from crime to seep into another economy or part of europe where they come from , say drug money or extortion money into germany from italy , it does not mean that is the end of it .
it might mean that the next stage is actually somehow the rooting of the group into this territory .
so i guess this is the lesson , the general point , that comes out of this instance . your research has focussed on why the ‘ ndrangheta was able to successfully expand into bardonecchia in piedmont but not verona .
what are the conditions that allow ‘ ndrangheta , to transplant itself to some places and not others ? most observers would point to migration as the main element that allows this expansion to occur . migration of people from the same territory might be a factor that helps transplantation . however , italians and people from calabria , from southern italy , from sicily , have migrated to many , many parts of the world and there was no mafia .
so it 's not as if everywhere italians migrate there is mafia – that would be a really big misconception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ' ndrangheta member giorgio basile testified in a german court in july i think in addition to migration , there are some local conditions that allow these local groups to become entrenched .
some of the conditions we have observed in northern italy , such as in piedmont , was that they were able to corner certain markets through the use of violence . what is most extraordinary about the town of bardonecchia , just outside turin , is that the town has a very , very different social and cultural makeup from southern italy .
it was a place where people would trust each other and feel safe , but there were social and economic conditions that allowed the ‘ ndrangheta to move there . one of these was connected to the state business and the construction business .
some of the calabrese that had been working in the construction business were connected to the mafia . these people helped to create cartels of firms that were connected to calabria and cornered the market so they used violence to prevent other firms to enter this market . it was a combination situation because there was a demand for their services - some people actually benefited from their presence .
the firms that were allowed to enter this very lucrative market were very happy .
and some of the workers , somewhat illegal workers , who were not legally registered with the trade unions in particular also were happy because they found employment - when they couldn ’ t find jobs in the big industries in turin , like fiat . so there was a lethal combination of some people of the economic elite who found advantages in having the ‘ ndrangheta , and some workers and this is what explains why the ‘ ndrangheta was successful in becoming entrenched in this part of italy .
that 's what germany has to look out for - make sure that these organizations don ’ t have the possibility to corner markets and eventually to generate some sort of support for their presence . is it possible for ‘ ndrangheta to recreate conditions like those in southern italy in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction sector is usually a magnet for mob activity in principle yes .
it depends on the local markets and how careful the political elite , the police and the judiciary and various other institutions of authority are to make sure that there is no access to these markets .
but there are some special markets which are more easily penetrated by organized crime - construction is typically one of those markets . special attention must be paid to these markets . in principle , it is possible that the ‘ ndrangheta does move up one step from simple money laundering to becoming entrenched in the german economy .
and this is the most dangerous situation , ever , you can imagine .
a german construction firm wanting to enter the market and prevent its competitors from entering it , might actually benefit from having their presence . obviously these guys -lrb- the ' ndrangheta -rrb- have a reputation for violence , an ability to use violence and have shown how much they can use violence in this instance .
that 's how they build up their reputation .
so next time around , if i am a german entrepreneur and someone with a calabrian accent comes around and says , ' get out of this market or i ’ ll punish you , ' i ’ ll be more inclined to believe him and move out . given the worldwide presence of ‘ ndrangheta can we expect more of these clan wars or feuds to be carried out internationally ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in july this year , italian police arrested notorious mafia boss giuseppe bellocco in calabria , southern italy that ’ s hard to tell .
i think the feud in particular will certainly continue in san luca if this is the reason behind -lrb- the killings -rrb- .
they must have felt really confident about carrying out this operation in germany . they must have been able to have intelligence on the ground .
i don ’ t think the ‘ ndrangheta has this level of intelligence everywhere .
but obviously they must have had it in this town -lrb- duisburg -rrb- because how would you know that these people were going to that restaurant ?
how would you know they were the right ones coming out at that time ?
how would you know where the one you are looking for is ? stephanie raison interviewed federico varese send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so i guess this is the lesson , the general point , that comes out of this instance . your research has focussed on why the ‘ ndrangheta was able to successfully expand into bardonecchia in piedmont but not verona .
what are the conditions that allow ‘ ndrangheta , to transplant itself to some places and not others ? most observers would point to migration as the main element that allows this expansion to occur . migration of people from the same territory might be a factor that helps transplantation . however , italians and people from calabria , from southern italy , from sicily , have migrated to many , many parts of the world and there was no mafia .
so it 's not as if everywhere italians migrate there is mafia – that would be a really big misconception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ' ndrangheta member giorgio basile testified in a german court in july i think in addition to migration , there are some local conditions that allow these local groups to become entrenched .
some of the conditions we have observed in northern italy , such as in piedmont , was that they were able to corner certain markets through the use of violence . what is most extraordinary about the town of bardonecchia , just outside turin , is that the town has a very , very different social and cultural makeup from southern italy .
it was a place where people would trust each other and feel safe , but there were social and economic conditions that allowed the ‘ ndrangheta to move there . one of these was connected to the state business and the construction business .
some of the calabrese that had been working in the construction business were connected to the mafia . these people helped to create cartels of firms that were connected to calabria and cornered the market so they used violence to prevent other firms to enter this market . it was a combination situation because there was a demand for their services - some people actually benefited from their presence .
the firms that were allowed to enter this very lucrative market were very happy .
and some of the workers , somewhat illegal workers , who were not legally registered with the trade unions in particular also were happy because they found employment - when they couldn ’ t find jobs in the big industries in turin , like fiat . so there was a lethal combination of some people of the economic elite who found advantages in having the ‘ ndrangheta , and some workers and this is what explains why the ‘ ndrangheta was successful in becoming entrenched in this part of italy .
that 's what germany has to look out for - make sure that these organizations don ’ t have the possibility to corner markets and eventually to generate some sort of support for their presence . is it possible for ‘ ndrangheta to recreate conditions like those in southern italy in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction sector is usually a magnet for mob activity in principle yes .
it depends on the local markets and how careful the political elite , the police and the judiciary and various other institutions of authority are to make sure that there is no access to these markets .
but there are some special markets which are more easily penetrated by organized crime - construction is typically one of those markets . special attention must be paid to these markets . in principle , it is possible that the ‘ ndrangheta does move up one step from simple money laundering to becoming entrenched in the german economy .
and this is the most dangerous situation , ever , you can imagine .
a german construction firm wanting to enter the market and prevent its competitors from entering it , might actually benefit from having their presence . obviously these guys -lrb- the ' ndrangheta -rrb- have a reputation for violence , an ability to use violence and have shown how much they can use violence in this instance .
that 's how they build up their reputation .
so next time around , if i am a german entrepreneur and someone with a calabrian accent comes around and says , ' get out of this market or i ’ ll punish you , ' i ’ ll be more inclined to believe him and move out . given the worldwide presence of ‘ ndrangheta can we expect more of these clan wars or feuds to be carried out internationally ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in july this year , italian police arrested notorious mafia boss giuseppe bellocco in calabria , southern italy that ’ s hard to tell .
i think the feud in particular will certainly continue in san luca if this is the reason behind -lrb- the killings -rrb- .
they must have felt really confident about carrying out this operation in germany . they must have been able to have intelligence on the ground .
i don ’ t think the ‘ ndrangheta has this level of intelligence everywhere .

previously , he taught at williams college and yale university .
his main areas of research are organized crime , corruption , soviet criminal history , and the dynamics of altruistic behaviour .
his book , " the russian mafia " won the ed hewitt prize of the american association for the advancement of slavic studies . dw-world : de : according to italian interior minister giuliano amato , the six killings in duisburg are linked to the ongoing san luca clan feud .
italian anti-mafia prosecutor pietro grasso has said that such killings being carried out on non-italian soil is unprecedented .
what is the significance of the killings ? federico varese : among the mafia in italy - and we just did a study on the reporting on various italian criminal groups in italy in the media - the ‘ ndrangheta is the one that is usually under the radar .
it has always been the one that has been able to avoid major scrutiny from the media so it kept a very low profile .
so it ’ s a big step to do such a high profile murder in a different country especially . obviously it raises the alarm in germany as well .
so in that sense , it ’ s quite a departure from what we have seen before .
but of course they -lrb- ‘ ndrangheta -rrb- have killed prominent politicians before . they are ruthless and in a sense they see this just as a continuation of what they do at home .
but i think from our point of view , from the point of view of the public at least , it really raises the bar . do these recent killings in duisburg indicate that ‘ ndrangheta has expanded into germany , or might it simply be the case that some of these people were in germany to escape mafia feuds back home in calabria ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency services on the scene in duisburg where the shooting took place what we know is that there is a lot of money laundering going on among the ‘ ndrangheta in various countries in europe . germany is one of those . so i do n't think these murders show anything really except that they are taking the violence outside of their home territory . earlier , they -lrb- ' ndrangheta -rrb- might have done money laundering in different countries but now it seems they are sort of expanding to violence in their activities abroad .
that 's quite significant . what interests might ‘ ndrangheta have in germany ? i think this is a general issue about so-called money laundering .
in some ways you could think that money laundering is not such a terrible crime because it ’ s a way to inject money into the economy , although it is a crime under most laws , but it ’ s obviously different from hard core crime like murder . but i think what it -lrb- the killings -rrb- highlight is that one might follow the other .

the court said that she no longer posed a public threat . the frankfurt court announced on friday that it had ordered the release on parole of former red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- member eva haule after determining that she no is longer a danger to the public after 21 years in prison .
haule , who was first arrested in 1986 , was serving a life sentence for the three murders , including that of a us army soldier in wiesbaden in 1985 .
when she is released on tuesday , she will become the second member of the radical left-wing group to win parole this year .
during her time with the raf , which is also known as the baader-meinhof gang , haule rose through the ranks to become the highest-ranking woman in the terrorist organization and one of its most sought-after members .
her seniority in the raf led to her involvement in the crimes , which saw her initially convicted on weapons possession charges and for membership in a terrorist organization in 1988 , and then for murder and causing explosions in 1994 .
the 1988 conviction in stuttgart , for her involvement in an attempted bomb attack on a nato facility in bavaria and a raid on an arms dealer , led to a 15-year sentence that was upgraded to life six years later .
murders and bombings mean life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us rhein-main air base was targeted in 1985 a frankfurt court found her guilty in 1994 of participating in the murder of edward pimental , a 20-year-old soldier from new york city , and the bombing of the us rhein-main air base , both in august 1985 .
she was also connected by the frankfurt court to two other killings and 23 attempted murders .
when she was arrested in an ice cream parlor with two additional suspects in august 1986 , haule and her associates were in possession of blueprints for the federal ministry of economic collaboration , which led investigators to believe she was masterminding a future attack on the government building .
in recent years , haule spoke through her representatives from prison of her " extremely heavy guilt " in regard to her terrorist past .
her behavior behind bars over the years also led to a downgrading of her security status ; haule was moved from the women 's prison at frankfurt preungesheim to the women 's custody institution in berlin-neukölln .
there , as an open prisoner , haule studied social educational theory and took a training course in photography .
in march 2005 , an exhibition of portraits of fellow inmates was held in a parliamentary building in berlin , which caused outrage among liberal and conservative politicians at the time .
her photos have since appeared in a number of publications and books .

the center " will send a team of experts to peru to assess the needs on the ground and identify how european civil protection can contribute to overall relief efforts , " he added .

jörn thiessen , a social democratic member of parliament and his party 's defense expert , told rheinische post newspaper that us officials had told him they were expecting germany to beef up its training of afghan soldiers .
thiessen added that the americans were aware of germany 's concerns to send troops to the more dangerous south , but had asked that german soldiers accompany afghan trainees in case they are moved from the safer region around kabul to the south .

" this is something that 's under consideration within the federal government , " he said , adding that it was still unclear whether an expansion could happen within the current mandate , which is limited to 3,600 troops .
" what 's clear is that our work in the north can not be called into question just because we 're taking on new tasks , " he said , adding that convincing the german population of the importance of the afghanistan mission had failed so far . article based on news reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court said that she no longer posed a public threat . the frankfurt court announced on friday that it had ordered the release on parole of former red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- member eva haule after determining that she no is longer a danger to the public after 21 years in prison .
haule , who was first arrested in 1986 , was serving a life sentence for the three murders , including that of a us army soldier in wiesbaden in 1985 .
when she is released on tuesday , she will become the second member of the radical left-wing group to win parole this year .
during her time with the raf , which is also known as the baader-meinhof gang , haule rose through the ranks to become the highest-ranking woman in the terrorist organization and one of its most sought-after members .
her seniority in the raf led to her involvement in the crimes , which saw her initially convicted on weapons possession charges and for membership in a terrorist organization in 1988 , and then for murder and causing explosions in 1994 .
the 1988 conviction in stuttgart , for her involvement in an attempted bomb attack on a nato facility in bavaria and a raid on an arms dealer , led to a 15-year sentence that was upgraded to life six years later .

she was also connected by the frankfurt court to two other killings and 23 attempted murders .
when she was arrested in an ice cream parlor with two additional suspects in august 1986 , haule and her associates were in possession of blueprints for the federal ministry of economic collaboration , which led investigators to believe she was masterminding a future attack on the government building .
in recent years , haule spoke through her representatives from prison of her " extremely heavy guilt " in regard to her terrorist past .
her behavior behind bars over the years also led to a downgrading of her security status ; haule was moved from the women 's prison at frankfurt preungesheim to the women 's custody institution in berlin-neukölln .
there , as an open prisoner , haule studied social educational theory and took a training course in photography .
in march 2005 , an exhibition of portraits of fellow inmates was held in a parliamentary building in berlin , which caused outrage among liberal and conservative politicians at the time .
her photos have since appeared in a number of publications and books .

the court said that she no longer posed a public threat . the frankfurt court announced on friday that it had ordered the release on parole of former red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- member eva haule after determining that she no is longer a danger to the public after 21 years in prison .
haule , who was first arrested in 1986 , was serving a life sentence for the three murders , including that of a us army soldier in wiesbaden in 1985 .
when she is released on tuesday , she will become the second member of the radical left-wing group to win parole this year .
during her time with the raf , which is also known as the baader-meinhof gang , haule rose through the ranks to become the highest-ranking woman in the terrorist organization and one of its most sought-after members .
her seniority in the raf led to her involvement in the crimes , which saw her initially convicted on weapons possession charges and for membership in a terrorist organization in 1988 , and then for murder and causing explosions in 1994 .
the 1988 conviction in stuttgart , for her involvement in an attempted bomb attack on a nato facility in bavaria and a raid on an arms dealer , led to a 15-year sentence that was upgraded to life six years later .
murders and bombings mean life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us rhein-main air base was targeted in 1985 a frankfurt court found her guilty in 1994 of participating in the murder of edward pimental , a 20-year-old soldier from new york city , and the bombing of the us rhein-main air base , both in august 1985 .
she was also connected by the frankfurt court to two other killings and 23 attempted murders .
when she was arrested in an ice cream parlor with two additional suspects in august 1986 , haule and her associates were in possession of blueprints for the federal ministry of economic collaboration , which led investigators to believe she was masterminding a future attack on the government building .
in recent years , haule spoke through her representatives from prison of her " extremely heavy guilt " in regard to her terrorist past .
her behavior behind bars over the years also led to a downgrading of her security status ; haule was moved from the women 's prison at frankfurt preungesheim to the women 's custody institution in berlin-neukölln .
there , as an open prisoner , haule studied social educational theory and took a training course in photography .
in march 2005 , an exhibition of portraits of fellow inmates was held in a parliamentary building in berlin , which caused outrage among liberal and conservative politicians at the time .
her photos have since appeared in a number of publications and books .

germany 's opposition parties attacked chancellor angela merkel over her visit to greenland .
they said the trip was a pr gag that took the place of real action against climate change . chancellor merkel wraps up her two-day visit to greenland on friday with a helicopter trip around the island .
accompanied by her environment minister sigmar gabriel , a member of the social democratic party , and the premiers of greenland and denmark on thursday , she viewed ilulissat fjord , where the effects of global warming are particularly visible . and then she defended herself .
" getting an idea of things on location never hurt , " she said at a press conference .
only then could one win over people to take action with " elan and energy " against the effects of climate change .
merkel was responding to criticism from top opposition politicians , who accused her of using the trip as a pr gag instead of pursuing policies to minimize germany 's negative impact on the climate .
" historical mistake " " the merkel / gabriel tour group wo n't find what it desperately needs in greenland 's melting ice : the political decisiveness to take responsible action against climate change , " said green party chief reinhard bütikofer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether symbolic or not , the backdrop was certainly impressive he said instead of staging such a trip , merkel needed to provide " solid political craft to overcome the impediments to a climate policy without ifs and buts in the only place where that can happen : at home . "
free-market liberal fdp leader guido westerwelle was also harsh . " it 's a historical mistake to restrict environment policy to symbolism , " he said , calling into question germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
climate remains focus " if mrs. merkel believes she has to go to greenland to inform herself about the effects of climate change , she should do that .
traveling is educational , " said the left party 's gesine lötzsch . "
merkel said germany would continue to focus on climate protection during the remainder of its presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrial nations , which ends when japan takes over in january . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's opposition parties attacked chancellor angela merkel over her visit to greenland .
they said the trip was a pr gag that took the place of real action against climate change . chancellor merkel wraps up her two-day visit to greenland on friday with a helicopter trip around the island .

only then could one win over people to take action with " elan and energy " against the effects of climate change .
merkel was responding to criticism from top opposition politicians , who accused her of using the trip as a pr gag instead of pursuing policies to minimize germany 's negative impact on the climate .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether symbolic or not , the backdrop was certainly impressive he said instead of staging such a trip , merkel needed to provide " solid political craft to overcome the impediments to a climate policy without ifs and buts in the only place where that can happen : at home . "
free-market liberal fdp leader guido westerwelle was also harsh . " it 's a historical mistake to restrict environment policy to symbolism , " he said , calling into question germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
climate remains focus " if mrs. merkel believes she has to go to greenland to inform herself about the effects of climate change , she should do that .

" there are the necessary contacts on all levels , " peer steinbrück said .
" thus far they have proved very fruitful .
we are in close contact at the national and the international level . "
in berlin , government spokesman thomas steg said the outlook for the german economy remained fundamentally positive .
" there is no reason to believe that financial market uncertainty will jump over to the real economy , " steg said .
he welcomed an initiative from eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy to look into the activities of the ratings agencies that assess credit risks .
the agencies stand accused of failing to spot the looming crisis in us subprime mortgage lending before it broke .
fed interest cut causes market surge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been a turbulent time for the frankfurt exchange meanwhile , german shares rose strongly in friday 's afternoon trading on news that the us federal reserve -lrb- fed -rrb- had cut the interest rate it charges commercial banks by half of a percentage point .
after a morning during which leading shares traded on the frankfurt bourse fell 1 percent within minutes of opening , the leading dax 30 index rose to a high of 7,490 , from a morning low of 7195 , before declining to 7,451 in profit taking .
the mdax index of medium shares and the tecdax technology index followed a similar course .
german banks gained ground following heavy losses over the past week , while industrials such as basf , thyssenkrupp , continental , daimlerchrysler , and man were the top losers .
london 's ftse 100 index of top shares also surged by almost 4.0 percent to move back above 6,000 points on the fed news while the paris market also rose by around 3.0 percent .
soothing stateside jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fed chairman ben bernanke approved the cut the fed 's surprise move marked its most decisive action since the financial markets became gripped by fears over a global credit crunch .
the fed said it had lowered the rate it levies on loans to banks by 50 basis points to 5.75 percent , citing " increased uncertainty " in the financial markets .
" financial market conditions have deteriorated , and tighter credit conditions and increased uncertainty have the potential to restrain economic growth going forward , " the fed cautioned in a statement .
the central bank lowered the so-called " discount " rate to help soothe the us banking system which has been stressed in the past week by a credit crunch linked to the distressed housing market .
it is extremely unusual for the fed to act outside of its scheduled rate meetings and the last time it did so was on sept .
17 , 2001 , after the terrorist attacks that targeted new york and washington .
the move does not affect its key short-term federal funds interest rate which stands at 5.25 percent .
fed hoping to restore " orderly conditions " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us housing market woes have been felt globally the fed - which has also injected tens of billions of dollars into the stretched financial system in the past week - said it had trimmed its discount rate in a bid to restore " orderly conditions in financial markets " which have been rocked by credit fears and the troubles plaguing the housing market .
" although recent data suggest that the economy has continued to expand at a moderate pace , the federal open market committee judges that the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably , " the fed said .
the central bank said it was continuing to monitor the situation and that it was ready to act as necessary " to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets . "

" there are the necessary contacts on all levels , " peer steinbrück said .
" thus far they have proved very fruitful .
we are in close contact at the national and the international level . "
in berlin , government spokesman thomas steg said the outlook for the german economy remained fundamentally positive .
" there is no reason to believe that financial market uncertainty will jump over to the real economy , " steg said .
he welcomed an initiative from eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy to look into the activities of the ratings agencies that assess credit risks .
the agencies stand accused of failing to spot the looming crisis in us subprime mortgage lending before it broke .
fed interest cut causes market surge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been a turbulent time for the frankfurt exchange meanwhile , german shares rose strongly in friday 's afternoon trading on news that the us federal reserve -lrb- fed -rrb- had cut the interest rate it charges commercial banks by half of a percentage point .
after a morning during which leading shares traded on the frankfurt bourse fell 1 percent within minutes of opening , the leading dax 30 index rose to a high of 7,490 , from a morning low of 7195 , before declining to 7,451 in profit taking .
the mdax index of medium shares and the tecdax technology index followed a similar course .
german banks gained ground following heavy losses over the past week , while industrials such as basf , thyssenkrupp , continental , daimlerchrysler , and man were the top losers .
london 's ftse 100 index of top shares also surged by almost 4.0 percent to move back above 6,000 points on the fed news while the paris market also rose by around 3.0 percent .
soothing stateside jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fed chairman ben bernanke approved the cut the fed 's surprise move marked its most decisive action since the financial markets became gripped by fears over a global credit crunch .
the fed said it had lowered the rate it levies on loans to banks by 50 basis points to 5.75 percent , citing " increased uncertainty " in the financial markets .
" financial market conditions have deteriorated , and tighter credit conditions and increased uncertainty have the potential to restrain economic growth going forward , " the fed cautioned in a statement .
the central bank lowered the so-called " discount " rate to help soothe the us banking system which has been stressed in the past week by a credit crunch linked to the distressed housing market .
it is extremely unusual for the fed to act outside of its scheduled rate meetings and the last time it did so was on sept .
17 , 2001 , after the terrorist attacks that targeted new york and washington .
the move does not affect its key short-term federal funds interest rate which stands at 5.25 percent .
fed hoping to restore " orderly conditions " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us housing market woes have been felt globally the fed - which has also injected tens of billions of dollars into the stretched financial system in the past week - said it had trimmed its discount rate in a bid to restore " orderly conditions in financial markets " which have been rocked by credit fears and the troubles plaguing the housing market .
" although recent data suggest that the economy has continued to expand at a moderate pace , the federal open market committee judges that the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably , " the fed said .
the central bank said it was continuing to monitor the situation and that it was ready to act as necessary " to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 17.08.2007 expert says mafia murders pose new risks in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european police were surprised italian mafia violence had spread to germany an expert on organized crime warned that germany has to be alert about an expansion of mob activity within its borders after officials linked the killing of six italians in duisburg to the calabrian mafia , ' ndrangheta . federico varese is a professor of criminology and official fellow of linacre college , oxford university .
previously , he taught at williams college and yale university .
his main areas of research are organized crime , corruption , soviet criminal history , and the dynamics of altruistic behaviour .
his book , " the russian mafia " won the ed hewitt prize of the american association for the advancement of slavic studies . dw-world : de : according to italian interior minister giuliano amato , the six killings in duisburg are linked to the ongoing san luca clan feud .
italian anti-mafia prosecutor pietro grasso has said that such killings being carried out on non-italian soil is unprecedented .
what is the significance of the killings ? federico varese : among the mafia in italy - and we just did a study on the reporting on various italian criminal groups in italy in the media - the ‘ ndrangheta is the one that is usually under the radar .
it has always been the one that has been able to avoid major scrutiny from the media so it kept a very low profile .
so it ’ s a big step to do such a high profile murder in a different country especially . obviously it raises the alarm in germany as well .
so in that sense , it ’ s quite a departure from what we have seen before .
but of course they -lrb- ‘ ndrangheta -rrb- have killed prominent politicians before . they are ruthless and in a sense they see this just as a continuation of what they do at home .
but i think from our point of view , from the point of view of the public at least , it really raises the bar . do these recent killings in duisburg indicate that ‘ ndrangheta has expanded into germany , or might it simply be the case that some of these people were in germany to escape mafia feuds back home in calabria ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency services on the scene in duisburg where the shooting took place what we know is that there is a lot of money laundering going on among the ‘ ndrangheta in various countries in europe . germany is one of those . so i do n't think these murders show anything really except that they are taking the violence outside of their home territory . earlier , they -lrb- ' ndrangheta -rrb- might have done money laundering in different countries but now it seems they are sort of expanding to violence in their activities abroad .
that 's quite significant . what interests might ‘ ndrangheta have in germany ? i think this is a general issue about so-called money laundering .
in some ways you could think that money laundering is not such a terrible crime because it ’ s a way to inject money into the economy , although it is a crime under most laws , but it ’ s obviously different from hard core crime like murder . but i think what it -lrb- the killings -rrb- highlight is that one might follow the other .
so once we allow proceeds from crime to seep into another economy or part of europe where they come from , say drug money or extortion money into germany from italy , it does not mean that is the end of it .
it might mean that the next stage is actually somehow the rooting of the group into this territory .
so i guess this is the lesson , the general point , that comes out of this instance . your research has focussed on why the ‘ ndrangheta was able to successfully expand into bardonecchia in piedmont but not verona .
what are the conditions that allow ‘ ndrangheta , to transplant itself to some places and not others ? most observers would point to migration as the main element that allows this expansion to occur . migration of people from the same territory might be a factor that helps transplantation . however , italians and people from calabria , from southern italy , from sicily , have migrated to many , many parts of the world and there was no mafia .
so it 's not as if everywhere italians migrate there is mafia – that would be a really big misconception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ' ndrangheta member giorgio basile testified in a german court in july i think in addition to migration , there are some local conditions that allow these local groups to become entrenched .
some of the conditions we have observed in northern italy , such as in piedmont , was that they were able to corner certain markets through the use of violence . what is most extraordinary about the town of bardonecchia , just outside turin , is that the town has a very , very different social and cultural makeup from southern italy .
it was a place where people would trust each other and feel safe , but there were social and economic conditions that allowed the ‘ ndrangheta to move there . one of these was connected to the state business and the construction business .
some of the calabrese that had been working in the construction business were connected to the mafia . these people helped to create cartels of firms that were connected to calabria and cornered the market so they used violence to prevent other firms to enter this market . it was a combination situation because there was a demand for their services - some people actually benefited from their presence .
the firms that were allowed to enter this very lucrative market were very happy .
and some of the workers , somewhat illegal workers , who were not legally registered with the trade unions in particular also were happy because they found employment - when they couldn ’ t find jobs in the big industries in turin , like fiat . so there was a lethal combination of some people of the economic elite who found advantages in having the ‘ ndrangheta , and some workers and this is what explains why the ‘ ndrangheta was successful in becoming entrenched in this part of italy .

previously , he taught at williams college and yale university .
his main areas of research are organized crime , corruption , soviet criminal history , and the dynamics of altruistic behaviour .
his book , " the russian mafia " won the ed hewitt prize of the american association for the advancement of slavic studies . dw-world : de : according to italian interior minister giuliano amato , the six killings in duisburg are linked to the ongoing san luca clan feud .
italian anti-mafia prosecutor pietro grasso has said that such killings being carried out on non-italian soil is unprecedented .
what is the significance of the killings ? federico varese : among the mafia in italy - and we just did a study on the reporting on various italian criminal groups in italy in the media - the ‘ ndrangheta is the one that is usually under the radar .
it has always been the one that has been able to avoid major scrutiny from the media so it kept a very low profile .
so it ’ s a big step to do such a high profile murder in a different country especially . obviously it raises the alarm in germany as well .
so in that sense , it ’ s quite a departure from what we have seen before .
but of course they -lrb- ‘ ndrangheta -rrb- have killed prominent politicians before . they are ruthless and in a sense they see this just as a continuation of what they do at home .
but i think from our point of view , from the point of view of the public at least , it really raises the bar . do these recent killings in duisburg indicate that ‘ ndrangheta has expanded into germany , or might it simply be the case that some of these people were in germany to escape mafia feuds back home in calabria ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency services on the scene in duisburg where the shooting took place what we know is that there is a lot of money laundering going on among the ‘ ndrangheta in various countries in europe . germany is one of those . so i do n't think these murders show anything really except that they are taking the violence outside of their home territory . earlier , they -lrb- ' ndrangheta -rrb- might have done money laundering in different countries but now it seems they are sort of expanding to violence in their activities abroad .
that 's quite significant . what interests might ‘ ndrangheta have in germany ? i think this is a general issue about so-called money laundering .
in some ways you could think that money laundering is not such a terrible crime because it ’ s a way to inject money into the economy , although it is a crime under most laws , but it ’ s obviously different from hard core crime like murder . but i think what it -lrb- the killings -rrb- highlight is that one might follow the other .
so once we allow proceeds from crime to seep into another economy or part of europe where they come from , say drug money or extortion money into germany from italy , it does not mean that is the end of it .
it might mean that the next stage is actually somehow the rooting of the group into this territory .
so i guess this is the lesson , the general point , that comes out of this instance . your research has focussed on why the ‘ ndrangheta was able to successfully expand into bardonecchia in piedmont but not verona .
what are the conditions that allow ‘ ndrangheta , to transplant itself to some places and not others ? most observers would point to migration as the main element that allows this expansion to occur . migration of people from the same territory might be a factor that helps transplantation . however , italians and people from calabria , from southern italy , from sicily , have migrated to many , many parts of the world and there was no mafia .
so it 's not as if everywhere italians migrate there is mafia – that would be a really big misconception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ' ndrangheta member giorgio basile testified in a german court in july i think in addition to migration , there are some local conditions that allow these local groups to become entrenched .
some of the conditions we have observed in northern italy , such as in piedmont , was that they were able to corner certain markets through the use of violence . what is most extraordinary about the town of bardonecchia , just outside turin , is that the town has a very , very different social and cultural makeup from southern italy .
it was a place where people would trust each other and feel safe , but there were social and economic conditions that allowed the ‘ ndrangheta to move there . one of these was connected to the state business and the construction business .
some of the calabrese that had been working in the construction business were connected to the mafia . these people helped to create cartels of firms that were connected to calabria and cornered the market so they used violence to prevent other firms to enter this market . it was a combination situation because there was a demand for their services - some people actually benefited from their presence .
the firms that were allowed to enter this very lucrative market were very happy .
and some of the workers , somewhat illegal workers , who were not legally registered with the trade unions in particular also were happy because they found employment - when they couldn ’ t find jobs in the big industries in turin , like fiat . so there was a lethal combination of some people of the economic elite who found advantages in having the ‘ ndrangheta , and some workers and this is what explains why the ‘ ndrangheta was successful in becoming entrenched in this part of italy .
that 's what germany has to look out for - make sure that these organizations don ’ t have the possibility to corner markets and eventually to generate some sort of support for their presence . is it possible for ‘ ndrangheta to recreate conditions like those in southern italy in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction sector is usually a magnet for mob activity in principle yes .

previously , he taught at williams college and yale university .
his main areas of research are organized crime , corruption , soviet criminal history , and the dynamics of altruistic behaviour .
his book , " the russian mafia " won the ed hewitt prize of the american association for the advancement of slavic studies . dw-world : de : according to italian interior minister giuliano amato , the six killings in duisburg are linked to the ongoing san luca clan feud .
italian anti-mafia prosecutor pietro grasso has said that such killings being carried out on non-italian soil is unprecedented .
what is the significance of the killings ? federico varese : among the mafia in italy - and we just did a study on the reporting on various italian criminal groups in italy in the media - the ‘ ndrangheta is the one that is usually under the radar .
it has always been the one that has been able to avoid major scrutiny from the media so it kept a very low profile .
so it ’ s a big step to do such a high profile murder in a different country especially . obviously it raises the alarm in germany as well .
so in that sense , it ’ s quite a departure from what we have seen before .
but of course they -lrb- ‘ ndrangheta -rrb- have killed prominent politicians before . they are ruthless and in a sense they see this just as a continuation of what they do at home .
but i think from our point of view , from the point of view of the public at least , it really raises the bar . do these recent killings in duisburg indicate that ‘ ndrangheta has expanded into germany , or might it simply be the case that some of these people were in germany to escape mafia feuds back home in calabria ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency services on the scene in duisburg where the shooting took place what we know is that there is a lot of money laundering going on among the ‘ ndrangheta in various countries in europe . germany is one of those . so i do n't think these murders show anything really except that they are taking the violence outside of their home territory . earlier , they -lrb- ' ndrangheta -rrb- might have done money laundering in different countries but now it seems they are sort of expanding to violence in their activities abroad .
that 's quite significant . what interests might ‘ ndrangheta have in germany ? i think this is a general issue about so-called money laundering .
in some ways you could think that money laundering is not such a terrible crime because it ’ s a way to inject money into the economy , although it is a crime under most laws , but it ’ s obviously different from hard core crime like murder . but i think what it -lrb- the killings -rrb- highlight is that one might follow the other .
so once we allow proceeds from crime to seep into another economy or part of europe where they come from , say drug money or extortion money into germany from italy , it does not mean that is the end of it .
it might mean that the next stage is actually somehow the rooting of the group into this territory .
so i guess this is the lesson , the general point , that comes out of this instance . your research has focussed on why the ‘ ndrangheta was able to successfully expand into bardonecchia in piedmont but not verona .
what are the conditions that allow ‘ ndrangheta , to transplant itself to some places and not others ? most observers would point to migration as the main element that allows this expansion to occur . migration of people from the same territory might be a factor that helps transplantation . however , italians and people from calabria , from southern italy , from sicily , have migrated to many , many parts of the world and there was no mafia .
so it 's not as if everywhere italians migrate there is mafia – that would be a really big misconception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ' ndrangheta member giorgio basile testified in a german court in july i think in addition to migration , there are some local conditions that allow these local groups to become entrenched .
some of the conditions we have observed in northern italy , such as in piedmont , was that they were able to corner certain markets through the use of violence . what is most extraordinary about the town of bardonecchia , just outside turin , is that the town has a very , very different social and cultural makeup from southern italy .
it was a place where people would trust each other and feel safe , but there were social and economic conditions that allowed the ‘ ndrangheta to move there . one of these was connected to the state business and the construction business .
some of the calabrese that had been working in the construction business were connected to the mafia . these people helped to create cartels of firms that were connected to calabria and cornered the market so they used violence to prevent other firms to enter this market . it was a combination situation because there was a demand for their services - some people actually benefited from their presence .

some of the calabrese that had been working in the construction business were connected to the mafia . these people helped to create cartels of firms that were connected to calabria and cornered the market so they used violence to prevent other firms to enter this market . it was a combination situation because there was a demand for their services - some people actually benefited from their presence .
the firms that were allowed to enter this very lucrative market were very happy .
and some of the workers , somewhat illegal workers , who were not legally registered with the trade unions in particular also were happy because they found employment - when they couldn ’ t find jobs in the big industries in turin , like fiat . so there was a lethal combination of some people of the economic elite who found advantages in having the ‘ ndrangheta , and some workers and this is what explains why the ‘ ndrangheta was successful in becoming entrenched in this part of italy .
that 's what germany has to look out for - make sure that these organizations don ’ t have the possibility to corner markets and eventually to generate some sort of support for their presence . is it possible for ‘ ndrangheta to recreate conditions like those in southern italy in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction sector is usually a magnet for mob activity in principle yes .
it depends on the local markets and how careful the political elite , the police and the judiciary and various other institutions of authority are to make sure that there is no access to these markets .
but there are some special markets which are more easily penetrated by organized crime - construction is typically one of those markets . special attention must be paid to these markets . in principle , it is possible that the ‘ ndrangheta does move up one step from simple money laundering to becoming entrenched in the german economy .
and this is the most dangerous situation , ever , you can imagine .
a german construction firm wanting to enter the market and prevent its competitors from entering it , might actually benefit from having their presence . obviously these guys -lrb- the ' ndrangheta -rrb- have a reputation for violence , an ability to use violence and have shown how much they can use violence in this instance .
that 's how they build up their reputation .
so next time around , if i am a german entrepreneur and someone with a calabrian accent comes around and says , ' get out of this market or i ’ ll punish you , ' i ’ ll be more inclined to believe him and move out . given the worldwide presence of ‘ ndrangheta can we expect more of these clan wars or feuds to be carried out internationally ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in july this year , italian police arrested notorious mafia boss giuseppe bellocco in calabria , southern italy that ’ s hard to tell .
i think the feud in particular will certainly continue in san luca if this is the reason behind -lrb- the killings -rrb- .
they must have felt really confident about carrying out this operation in germany . they must have been able to have intelligence on the ground .
i don ’ t think the ‘ ndrangheta has this level of intelligence everywhere .
but obviously they must have had it in this town -lrb- duisburg -rrb- because how would you know that these people were going to that restaurant ?
how would you know they were the right ones coming out at that time ?
how would you know where the one you are looking for is ? stephanie raison interviewed federico varese send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's opposition parties attacked chancellor angela merkel over her visit to greenland .
they said the trip was a pr gag that took the place of real action against climate change . chancellor merkel wraps up her two-day visit to greenland on friday with a helicopter trip around the island .
accompanied by her environment minister sigmar gabriel , a member of the social democratic party , and the premiers of greenland and denmark on thursday , she viewed ilulissat fjord , where the effects of global warming are particularly visible . and then she defended herself .
" getting an idea of things on location never hurt , " she said at a press conference .
only then could one win over people to take action with " elan and energy " against the effects of climate change .
merkel was responding to criticism from top opposition politicians , who accused her of using the trip as a pr gag instead of pursuing policies to minimize germany 's negative impact on the climate .
" historical mistake " " the merkel / gabriel tour group wo n't find what it desperately needs in greenland 's melting ice : the political decisiveness to take responsible action against climate change , " said green party chief reinhard bütikofer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether symbolic or not , the backdrop was certainly impressive he said instead of staging such a trip , merkel needed to provide " solid political craft to overcome the impediments to a climate policy without ifs and buts in the only place where that can happen : at home . "
free-market liberal fdp leader guido westerwelle was also harsh . " it 's a historical mistake to restrict environment policy to symbolism , " he said , calling into question germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
climate remains focus " if mrs. merkel believes she has to go to greenland to inform herself about the effects of climate change , she should do that .
traveling is educational , " said the left party 's gesine lötzsch . "
merkel said germany would continue to focus on climate protection during the remainder of its presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrial nations , which ends when japan takes over in january . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

31 .
teams are still building their rosters , and players are mulling their options . hertha berlin 's desultory 1-0 loss to lowly frankfurt on the opening weekend of the new bundesliga season confirmed what many observers suspected - that the 2007-08 squad for the former champions league participants is very much a work in progress . normally , teams like to have their line-up more-or-less in place for their first game .
but hertha spent their summer first finding a new coach , lucien favre of switzerland , then negotiating the sale and departures of no less than 11 players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's favre has had to wait for reinforcements thus far , hertha has only succeeded in landing four new signings of any import .
commercial manager dieter hoeneß has promised a handful of further acquisitions , including much-needed help up front and in midfield . the dilemma is that , while hastily agreed transfers waste money , waiting too long can leave clubs trolling for talent in already over-fished waters .
and this season many bundesliga teams - including title contenders schalke and bremen - may have erred on the side of caution and failed to find adequate replacements for key positions . bremen would love to sign a striker of the calibre of the departed miro klose , while schalke could use a replacement playmaker for long-gone lincoln .
the question is : where are they going to find players of those descriptions at this late date ? woeful wolves ' spree continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injury to new defender roberto costa has meant further wolfsburg shopping one team that ca n't be faulted for hesitancy is wolfsburg .
the wolves were more active on the transfer market than any german club north of bayern munich . wolfsburg brought in 11 new players in the summer , while unloading almost an equal number .
unfortunately , all the wheeling and dealing did n't make the wolves any less toothless than they were last year - wolfsburg dropped their opener 3-1 at home to minnows bielefeld . the club has apparently decided that more shopping is the best form of therapy , adding defender jan simunek from sparta prague and brazilian midfield international josue during the week . but more bodies to an already crowded roster may not make it easier for coach felix magath to put together a regular - and effective - starting eleven . hamburg horror scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg would n't be smiling if van der vaart , right , bolted down and some clubs that thought they had their squads sorted out may find themselves suddenly scratching their heads .
no sooner had hamburg won their opener , than a fax arrived from spanish club valencia offering 14 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- for their best player , midfielder rafael van der vaart . what 's worse , van der vaart - whose mother is spanish - apparently told a local newspaper that he was ready and more than willing to pack his bags . " it has always been my dream to play for one of the bigger spanish clubs , " the dutch playmaker was quoted as saying in the daily hamburger abendblatt . a freak back strain while lifting his 1-year-old son followed his announcement and led the dutch de telegraaf newspaper to suggest the injury may not be genuine and linked it with van der vaart 's desire to leave the northern german port city for sunny spain . " the question is whether van der vaart faked the injury , " said the report .
" it is known that he wants to go to valencia and that he considers it absurd that hamburg did n't want to talk about their offer of 14 million euros . " playing thursday could undermine his eligibility for european action at valencia . hamburg has said it has no intentions at all of selling van der vaart .
his departure , should it come to pass , would temporarily debilitate a side that seemed on its way to recovering from a disappointing and nearly disastrous last season . and it would force hamburg to join the other bundesliga clubs frantically combing the market for the final piece in the puzzle or , in some cases , for significant portions of their squads . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's opposition parties attacked chancellor angela merkel over her visit to greenland .
they said the trip was a pr gag that took the place of real action against climate change . chancellor merkel wraps up her two-day visit to greenland on friday with a helicopter trip around the island .
accompanied by her environment minister sigmar gabriel , a member of the social democratic party , and the premiers of greenland and denmark on thursday , she viewed ilulissat fjord , where the effects of global warming are particularly visible . and then she defended herself .
" getting an idea of things on location never hurt , " she said at a press conference .
only then could one win over people to take action with " elan and energy " against the effects of climate change .
merkel was responding to criticism from top opposition politicians , who accused her of using the trip as a pr gag instead of pursuing policies to minimize germany 's negative impact on the climate .
" historical mistake " " the merkel / gabriel tour group wo n't find what it desperately needs in greenland 's melting ice : the political decisiveness to take responsible action against climate change , " said green party chief reinhard bütikofer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether symbolic or not , the backdrop was certainly impressive he said instead of staging such a trip , merkel needed to provide " solid political craft to overcome the impediments to a climate policy without ifs and buts in the only place where that can happen : at home . "
free-market liberal fdp leader guido westerwelle was also harsh . " it 's a historical mistake to restrict environment policy to symbolism , " he said , calling into question germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
climate remains focus " if mrs. merkel believes she has to go to greenland to inform herself about the effects of climate change , she should do that .
traveling is educational , " said the left party 's gesine lötzsch . "
merkel said germany would continue to focus on climate protection during the remainder of its presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrial nations , which ends when japan takes over in january . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court said that she no longer posed a public threat . the frankfurt court announced on friday that it had ordered the release on parole of former red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- member eva haule after determining that she no is longer a danger to the public after 21 years in prison .
haule , who was first arrested in 1986 , was serving a life sentence for the three murders , including that of a us army soldier in wiesbaden in 1985 .
when she is released on tuesday , she will become the second member of the radical left-wing group to win parole this year .
during her time with the raf , which is also known as the baader-meinhof gang , haule rose through the ranks to become the highest-ranking woman in the terrorist organization and one of its most sought-after members .
her seniority in the raf led to her involvement in the crimes , which saw her initially convicted on weapons possession charges and for membership in a terrorist organization in 1988 , and then for murder and causing explosions in 1994 .
the 1988 conviction in stuttgart , for her involvement in an attempted bomb attack on a nato facility in bavaria and a raid on an arms dealer , led to a 15-year sentence that was upgraded to life six years later .
murders and bombings mean life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us rhein-main air base was targeted in 1985 a frankfurt court found her guilty in 1994 of participating in the murder of edward pimental , a 20-year-old soldier from new york city , and the bombing of the us rhein-main air base , both in august 1985 .
she was also connected by the frankfurt court to two other killings and 23 attempted murders .
when she was arrested in an ice cream parlor with two additional suspects in august 1986 , haule and her associates were in possession of blueprints for the federal ministry of economic collaboration , which led investigators to believe she was masterminding a future attack on the government building .
in recent years , haule spoke through her representatives from prison of her " extremely heavy guilt " in regard to her terrorist past .
her behavior behind bars over the years also led to a downgrading of her security status ; haule was moved from the women 's prison at frankfurt preungesheim to the women 's custody institution in berlin-neukölln .
there , as an open prisoner , haule studied social educational theory and took a training course in photography .
in march 2005 , an exhibition of portraits of fellow inmates was held in a parliamentary building in berlin , which caused outrage among liberal and conservative politicians at the time .
her photos have since appeared in a number of publications and books .

the court said that she no longer posed a public threat . the frankfurt court announced on friday that it had ordered the release on parole of former red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- member eva haule after determining that she no is longer a danger to the public after 21 years in prison .
haule , who was first arrested in 1986 , was serving a life sentence for the three murders , including that of a us army soldier in wiesbaden in 1985 .
when she is released on tuesday , she will become the second member of the radical left-wing group to win parole this year .
during her time with the raf , which is also known as the baader-meinhof gang , haule rose through the ranks to become the highest-ranking woman in the terrorist organization and one of its most sought-after members .
her seniority in the raf led to her involvement in the crimes , which saw her initially convicted on weapons possession charges and for membership in a terrorist organization in 1988 , and then for murder and causing explosions in 1994 .
the 1988 conviction in stuttgart , for her involvement in an attempted bomb attack on a nato facility in bavaria and a raid on an arms dealer , led to a 15-year sentence that was upgraded to life six years later .
murders and bombings mean life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us rhein-main air base was targeted in 1985 a frankfurt court found her guilty in 1994 of participating in the murder of edward pimental , a 20-year-old soldier from new york city , and the bombing of the us rhein-main air base , both in august 1985 .
she was also connected by the frankfurt court to two other killings and 23 attempted murders .
when she was arrested in an ice cream parlor with two additional suspects in august 1986 , haule and her associates were in possession of blueprints for the federal ministry of economic collaboration , which led investigators to believe she was masterminding a future attack on the government building .
in recent years , haule spoke through her representatives from prison of her " extremely heavy guilt " in regard to her terrorist past .
her behavior behind bars over the years also led to a downgrading of her security status ; haule was moved from the women 's prison at frankfurt preungesheim to the women 's custody institution in berlin-neukölln .
there , as an open prisoner , haule studied social educational theory and took a training course in photography .
in march 2005 , an exhibition of portraits of fellow inmates was held in a parliamentary building in berlin , which caused outrage among liberal and conservative politicians at the time .
her photos have since appeared in a number of publications and books .

germany 's opposition parties attacked chancellor angela merkel over her visit to greenland .
they said the trip was a pr gag that took the place of real action against climate change . chancellor merkel wraps up her two-day visit to greenland on friday with a helicopter trip around the island .

" getting an idea of things on location never hurt , " she said at a press conference .
only then could one win over people to take action with " elan and energy " against the effects of climate change .
merkel was responding to criticism from top opposition politicians , who accused her of using the trip as a pr gag instead of pursuing policies to minimize germany 's negative impact on the climate .
" historical mistake " " the merkel / gabriel tour group wo n't find what it desperately needs in greenland 's melting ice : the political decisiveness to take responsible action against climate change , " said green party chief reinhard bütikofer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether symbolic or not , the backdrop was certainly impressive he said instead of staging such a trip , merkel needed to provide " solid political craft to overcome the impediments to a climate policy without ifs and buts in the only place where that can happen : at home .

free-market liberal fdp leader guido westerwelle was also harsh . " it 's a historical mistake to restrict environment policy to symbolism , " he said , calling into question germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 17.08.2007 expert says mafia murders pose new risks in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european police were surprised italian mafia violence had spread to germany an expert on organized crime warned that germany has to be alert about an expansion of mob activity within its borders after officials linked the killing of six italians in duisburg to the calabrian mafia , ' ndrangheta . federico varese is a professor of criminology and official fellow of linacre college , oxford university .
previously , he taught at williams college and yale university .
his main areas of research are organized crime , corruption , soviet criminal history , and the dynamics of altruistic behaviour .
his book , " the russian mafia " won the ed hewitt prize of the american association for the advancement of slavic studies . dw-world : de : according to italian interior minister giuliano amato , the six killings in duisburg are linked to the ongoing san luca clan feud .
italian anti-mafia prosecutor pietro grasso has said that such killings being carried out on non-italian soil is unprecedented .
what is the significance of the killings ? federico varese : among the mafia in italy - and we just did a study on the reporting on various italian criminal groups in italy in the media - the ‘ ndrangheta is the one that is usually under the radar .
it has always been the one that has been able to avoid major scrutiny from the media so it kept a very low profile .
so it ’ s a big step to do such a high profile murder in a different country especially . obviously it raises the alarm in germany as well .
so in that sense , it ’ s quite a departure from what we have seen before .
but of course they -lrb- ‘ ndrangheta -rrb- have killed prominent politicians before . they are ruthless and in a sense they see this just as a continuation of what they do at home .
but i think from our point of view , from the point of view of the public at least , it really raises the bar . do these recent killings in duisburg indicate that ‘ ndrangheta has expanded into germany , or might it simply be the case that some of these people were in germany to escape mafia feuds back home in calabria ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency services on the scene in duisburg where the shooting took place what we know is that there is a lot of money laundering going on among the ‘ ndrangheta in various countries in europe . germany is one of those . so i do n't think these murders show anything really except that they are taking the violence outside of their home territory . earlier , they -lrb- ' ndrangheta -rrb- might have done money laundering in different countries but now it seems they are sort of expanding to violence in their activities abroad .
that 's quite significant . what interests might ‘ ndrangheta have in germany ? i think this is a general issue about so-called money laundering .
in some ways you could think that money laundering is not such a terrible crime because it ’ s a way to inject money into the economy , although it is a crime under most laws , but it ’ s obviously different from hard core crime like murder . but i think what it -lrb- the killings -rrb- highlight is that one might follow the other .
so once we allow proceeds from crime to seep into another economy or part of europe where they come from , say drug money or extortion money into germany from italy , it does not mean that is the end of it .
it might mean that the next stage is actually somehow the rooting of the group into this territory .
so i guess this is the lesson , the general point , that comes out of this instance . your research has focussed on why the ‘ ndrangheta was able to successfully expand into bardonecchia in piedmont but not verona .
what are the conditions that allow ‘ ndrangheta , to transplant itself to some places and not others ? most observers would point to migration as the main element that allows this expansion to occur . migration of people from the same territory might be a factor that helps transplantation . however , italians and people from calabria , from southern italy , from sicily , have migrated to many , many parts of the world and there was no mafia .
so it 's not as if everywhere italians migrate there is mafia – that would be a really big misconception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ' ndrangheta member giorgio basile testified in a german court in july i think in addition to migration , there are some local conditions that allow these local groups to become entrenched .
some of the conditions we have observed in northern italy , such as in piedmont , was that they were able to corner certain markets through the use of violence . what is most extraordinary about the town of bardonecchia , just outside turin , is that the town has a very , very different social and cultural makeup from southern italy .
it was a place where people would trust each other and feel safe , but there were social and economic conditions that allowed the ‘ ndrangheta to move there . one of these was connected to the state business and the construction business .
some of the calabrese that had been working in the construction business were connected to the mafia . these people helped to create cartels of firms that were connected to calabria and cornered the market so they used violence to prevent other firms to enter this market . it was a combination situation because there was a demand for their services - some people actually benefited from their presence .
the firms that were allowed to enter this very lucrative market were very happy .
and some of the workers , somewhat illegal workers , who were not legally registered with the trade unions in particular also were happy because they found employment - when they couldn ’ t find jobs in the big industries in turin , like fiat . so there was a lethal combination of some people of the economic elite who found advantages in having the ‘ ndrangheta , and some workers and this is what explains why the ‘ ndrangheta was successful in becoming entrenched in this part of italy .
that 's what germany has to look out for - make sure that these organizations don ’ t have the possibility to corner markets and eventually to generate some sort of support for their presence . is it possible for ‘ ndrangheta to recreate conditions like those in southern italy in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction sector is usually a magnet for mob activity in principle yes .
it depends on the local markets and how careful the political elite , the police and the judiciary and various other institutions of authority are to make sure that there is no access to these markets .
but there are some special markets which are more easily penetrated by organized crime - construction is typically one of those markets . special attention must be paid to these markets . in principle , it is possible that the ‘ ndrangheta does move up one step from simple money laundering to becoming entrenched in the german economy .
and this is the most dangerous situation , ever , you can imagine .
a german construction firm wanting to enter the market and prevent its competitors from entering it , might actually benefit from having their presence . obviously these guys -lrb- the ' ndrangheta -rrb- have a reputation for violence , an ability to use violence and have shown how much they can use violence in this instance .
that 's how they build up their reputation .
so next time around , if i am a german entrepreneur and someone with a calabrian accent comes around and says , ' get out of this market or i ’ ll punish you , ' i ’ ll be more inclined to believe him and move out . given the worldwide presence of ‘ ndrangheta can we expect more of these clan wars or feuds to be carried out internationally ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in july this year , italian police arrested notorious mafia boss giuseppe bellocco in calabria , southern italy that ’ s hard to tell .
i think the feud in particular will certainly continue in san luca if this is the reason behind -lrb- the killings -rrb- .
they must have felt really confident about carrying out this operation in germany . they must have been able to have intelligence on the ground .
i don ’ t think the ‘ ndrangheta has this level of intelligence everywhere .
but obviously they must have had it in this town -lrb- duisburg -rrb- because how would you know that these people were going to that restaurant ?
how would you know they were the right ones coming out at that time ?
how would you know where the one you are looking for is ? stephanie raison interviewed federico varese send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

previously , he taught at williams college and yale university .
his main areas of research are organized crime , corruption , soviet criminal history , and the dynamics of altruistic behaviour .
his book , " the russian mafia " won the ed hewitt prize of the american association for the advancement of slavic studies . dw-world : de : according to italian interior minister giuliano amato , the six killings in duisburg are linked to the ongoing san luca clan feud .
italian anti-mafia prosecutor pietro grasso has said that such killings being carried out on non-italian soil is unprecedented .
what is the significance of the killings ? federico varese : among the mafia in italy - and we just did a study on the reporting on various italian criminal groups in italy in the media - the ‘ ndrangheta is the one that is usually under the radar .
it has always been the one that has been able to avoid major scrutiny from the media so it kept a very low profile .
so it ’ s a big step to do such a high profile murder in a different country especially . obviously it raises the alarm in germany as well .
so in that sense , it ’ s quite a departure from what we have seen before .
but of course they -lrb- ‘ ndrangheta -rrb- have killed prominent politicians before . they are ruthless and in a sense they see this just as a continuation of what they do at home .
but i think from our point of view , from the point of view of the public at least , it really raises the bar . do these recent killings in duisburg indicate that ‘ ndrangheta has expanded into germany , or might it simply be the case that some of these people were in germany to escape mafia feuds back home in calabria ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency services on the scene in duisburg where the shooting took place what we know is that there is a lot of money laundering going on among the ‘ ndrangheta in various countries in europe . germany is one of those . so i do n't think these murders show anything really except that they are taking the violence outside of their home territory . earlier , they -lrb- ' ndrangheta -rrb- might have done money laundering in different countries but now it seems they are sort of expanding to violence in their activities abroad .
that 's quite significant . what interests might ‘ ndrangheta have in germany ? i think this is a general issue about so-called money laundering .
in some ways you could think that money laundering is not such a terrible crime because it ’ s a way to inject money into the economy , although it is a crime under most laws , but it ’ s obviously different from hard core crime like murder . but i think what it -lrb- the killings -rrb- highlight is that one might follow the other .
so once we allow proceeds from crime to seep into another economy or part of europe where they come from , say drug money or extortion money into germany from italy , it does not mean that is the end of it .
it might mean that the next stage is actually somehow the rooting of the group into this territory .
so i guess this is the lesson , the general point , that comes out of this instance . your research has focussed on why the ‘ ndrangheta was able to successfully expand into bardonecchia in piedmont but not verona .
what are the conditions that allow ‘ ndrangheta , to transplant itself to some places and not others ? most observers would point to migration as the main element that allows this expansion to occur . migration of people from the same territory might be a factor that helps transplantation . however , italians and people from calabria , from southern italy , from sicily , have migrated to many , many parts of the world and there was no mafia .
so it 's not as if everywhere italians migrate there is mafia – that would be a really big misconception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ' ndrangheta member giorgio basile testified in a german court in july i think in addition to migration , there are some local conditions that allow these local groups to become entrenched .
some of the conditions we have observed in northern italy , such as in piedmont , was that they were able to corner certain markets through the use of violence . what is most extraordinary about the town of bardonecchia , just outside turin , is that the town has a very , very different social and cultural makeup from southern italy .
it was a place where people would trust each other and feel safe , but there were social and economic conditions that allowed the ‘ ndrangheta to move there . one of these was connected to the state business and the construction business .
some of the calabrese that had been working in the construction business were connected to the mafia . these people helped to create cartels of firms that were connected to calabria and cornered the market so they used violence to prevent other firms to enter this market . it was a combination situation because there was a demand for their services - some people actually benefited from their presence .
the firms that were allowed to enter this very lucrative market were very happy .
and some of the workers , somewhat illegal workers , who were not legally registered with the trade unions in particular also were happy because they found employment - when they couldn ’ t find jobs in the big industries in turin , like fiat . so there was a lethal combination of some people of the economic elite who found advantages in having the ‘ ndrangheta , and some workers and this is what explains why the ‘ ndrangheta was successful in becoming entrenched in this part of italy .
that 's what germany has to look out for - make sure that these organizations don ’ t have the possibility to corner markets and eventually to generate some sort of support for their presence . is it possible for ‘ ndrangheta to recreate conditions like those in southern italy in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction sector is usually a magnet for mob activity in principle yes .
it depends on the local markets and how careful the political elite , the police and the judiciary and various other institutions of authority are to make sure that there is no access to these markets .
but there are some special markets which are more easily penetrated by organized crime - construction is typically one of those markets . special attention must be paid to these markets . in principle , it is possible that the ‘ ndrangheta does move up one step from simple money laundering to becoming entrenched in the german economy .
and this is the most dangerous situation , ever , you can imagine .
a german construction firm wanting to enter the market and prevent its competitors from entering it , might actually benefit from having their presence . obviously these guys -lrb- the ' ndrangheta -rrb- have a reputation for violence , an ability to use violence and have shown how much they can use violence in this instance .
that 's how they build up their reputation .
so next time around , if i am a german entrepreneur and someone with a calabrian accent comes around and says , ' get out of this market or i ’ ll punish you , ' i ’ ll be more inclined to believe him and move out . given the worldwide presence of ‘ ndrangheta can we expect more of these clan wars or feuds to be carried out internationally ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in july this year , italian police arrested notorious mafia boss giuseppe bellocco in calabria , southern italy that ’ s hard to tell .
i think the feud in particular will certainly continue in san luca if this is the reason behind -lrb- the killings -rrb- .
they must have felt really confident about carrying out this operation in germany . they must have been able to have intelligence on the ground .
i don ’ t think the ‘ ndrangheta has this level of intelligence everywhere .
but obviously they must have had it in this town -lrb- duisburg -rrb- because how would you know that these people were going to that restaurant ?
how would you know they were the right ones coming out at that time ?

previously , he taught at williams college and yale university .
his main areas of research are organized crime , corruption , soviet criminal history , and the dynamics of altruistic behaviour .
his book , " the russian mafia " won the ed hewitt prize of the american association for the advancement of slavic studies . dw-world : de : according to italian interior minister giuliano amato , the six killings in duisburg are linked to the ongoing san luca clan feud .
italian anti-mafia prosecutor pietro grasso has said that such killings being carried out on non-italian soil is unprecedented .
what is the significance of the killings ? federico varese : among the mafia in italy - and we just did a study on the reporting on various italian criminal groups in italy in the media - the ‘ ndrangheta is the one that is usually under the radar .
it has always been the one that has been able to avoid major scrutiny from the media so it kept a very low profile .
so it ’ s a big step to do such a high profile murder in a different country especially . obviously it raises the alarm in germany as well .
so in that sense , it ’ s quite a departure from what we have seen before .
but of course they -lrb- ‘ ndrangheta -rrb- have killed prominent politicians before . they are ruthless and in a sense they see this just as a continuation of what they do at home .
but i think from our point of view , from the point of view of the public at least , it really raises the bar . do these recent killings in duisburg indicate that ‘ ndrangheta has expanded into germany , or might it simply be the case that some of these people were in germany to escape mafia feuds back home in calabria ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency services on the scene in duisburg where the shooting took place what we know is that there is a lot of money laundering going on among the ‘ ndrangheta in various countries in europe . germany is one of those . so i do n't think these murders show anything really except that they are taking the violence outside of their home territory . earlier , they -lrb- ' ndrangheta -rrb- might have done money laundering in different countries but now it seems they are sort of expanding to violence in their activities abroad .
that 's quite significant . what interests might ‘ ndrangheta have in germany ? i think this is a general issue about so-called money laundering .
in some ways you could think that money laundering is not such a terrible crime because it ’ s a way to inject money into the economy , although it is a crime under most laws , but it ’ s obviously different from hard core crime like murder . but i think what it -lrb- the killings -rrb- highlight is that one might follow the other .
so once we allow proceeds from crime to seep into another economy or part of europe where they come from , say drug money or extortion money into germany from italy , it does not mean that is the end of it .
it might mean that the next stage is actually somehow the rooting of the group into this territory .
so i guess this is the lesson , the general point , that comes out of this instance . your research has focussed on why the ‘ ndrangheta was able to successfully expand into bardonecchia in piedmont but not verona .
what are the conditions that allow ‘ ndrangheta , to transplant itself to some places and not others ? most observers would point to migration as the main element that allows this expansion to occur . migration of people from the same territory might be a factor that helps transplantation . however , italians and people from calabria , from southern italy , from sicily , have migrated to many , many parts of the world and there was no mafia .
so it 's not as if everywhere italians migrate there is mafia – that would be a really big misconception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ' ndrangheta member giorgio basile testified in a german court in july i think in addition to migration , there are some local conditions that allow these local groups to become entrenched .
some of the conditions we have observed in northern italy , such as in piedmont , was that they were able to corner certain markets through the use of violence . what is most extraordinary about the town of bardonecchia , just outside turin , is that the town has a very , very different social and cultural makeup from southern italy .
it was a place where people would trust each other and feel safe , but there were social and economic conditions that allowed the ‘ ndrangheta to move there . one of these was connected to the state business and the construction business .
some of the calabrese that had been working in the construction business were connected to the mafia . these people helped to create cartels of firms that were connected to calabria and cornered the market so they used violence to prevent other firms to enter this market . it was a combination situation because there was a demand for their services - some people actually benefited from their presence .
the firms that were allowed to enter this very lucrative market were very happy .
and some of the workers , somewhat illegal workers , who were not legally registered with the trade unions in particular also were happy because they found employment - when they couldn ’ t find jobs in the big industries in turin , like fiat . so there was a lethal combination of some people of the economic elite who found advantages in having the ‘ ndrangheta , and some workers and this is what explains why the ‘ ndrangheta was successful in becoming entrenched in this part of italy .
that 's what germany has to look out for - make sure that these organizations don ’ t have the possibility to corner markets and eventually to generate some sort of support for their presence . is it possible for ‘ ndrangheta to recreate conditions like those in southern italy in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction sector is usually a magnet for mob activity in principle yes .
it depends on the local markets and how careful the political elite , the police and the judiciary and various other institutions of authority are to make sure that there is no access to these markets .
but there are some special markets which are more easily penetrated by organized crime - construction is typically one of those markets . special attention must be paid to these markets . in principle , it is possible that the ‘ ndrangheta does move up one step from simple money laundering to becoming entrenched in the german economy .
and this is the most dangerous situation , ever , you can imagine .
a german construction firm wanting to enter the market and prevent its competitors from entering it , might actually benefit from having their presence . obviously these guys -lrb- the ' ndrangheta -rrb- have a reputation for violence , an ability to use violence and have shown how much they can use violence in this instance .
that 's how they build up their reputation .
so next time around , if i am a german entrepreneur and someone with a calabrian accent comes around and says , ' get out of this market or i ’ ll punish you , ' i ’ ll be more inclined to believe him and move out . given the worldwide presence of ‘ ndrangheta can we expect more of these clan wars or feuds to be carried out internationally ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in july this year , italian police arrested notorious mafia boss giuseppe bellocco in calabria , southern italy that ’ s hard to tell .
i think the feud in particular will certainly continue in san luca if this is the reason behind -lrb- the killings -rrb- .
they must have felt really confident about carrying out this operation in germany . they must have been able to have intelligence on the ground .
i don ’ t think the ‘ ndrangheta has this level of intelligence everywhere .
but obviously they must have had it in this town -lrb- duisburg -rrb- because how would you know that these people were going to that restaurant ?
how would you know they were the right ones coming out at that time ?

germany 's opposition parties attacked chancellor angela merkel over her visit to greenland .
they said the trip was a pr gag that took the place of real action against climate change . chancellor merkel wraps up her two-day visit to greenland on friday with a helicopter trip around the island .
accompanied by her environment minister sigmar gabriel , a member of the social democratic party , and the premiers of greenland and denmark on thursday , she viewed ilulissat fjord , where the effects of global warming are particularly visible . and then she defended herself .
" getting an idea of things on location never hurt , " she said at a press conference .
only then could one win over people to take action with " elan and energy " against the effects of climate change .
merkel was responding to criticism from top opposition politicians , who accused her of using the trip as a pr gag instead of pursuing policies to minimize germany 's negative impact on the climate .
" historical mistake " " the merkel / gabriel tour group wo n't find what it desperately needs in greenland 's melting ice : the political decisiveness to take responsible action against climate change , " said green party chief reinhard bütikofer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether symbolic or not , the backdrop was certainly impressive he said instead of staging such a trip , merkel needed to provide " solid political craft to overcome the impediments to a climate policy without ifs and buts in the only place where that can happen : at home . "
free-market liberal fdp leader guido westerwelle was also harsh . " it 's a historical mistake to restrict environment policy to symbolism , " he said , calling into question germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
climate remains focus " if mrs. merkel believes she has to go to greenland to inform herself about the effects of climate change , she should do that .
traveling is educational , " said the left party 's gesine lötzsch . "

germany 's opposition parties attacked chancellor angela merkel over her visit to greenland .
they said the trip was a pr gag that took the place of real action against climate change . chancellor merkel wraps up her two-day visit to greenland on friday with a helicopter trip around the island .
accompanied by her environment minister sigmar gabriel , a member of the social democratic party , and the premiers of greenland and denmark on thursday , she viewed ilulissat fjord , where the effects of global warming are particularly visible . and then she defended herself .
" getting an idea of things on location never hurt , " she said at a press conference .
only then could one win over people to take action with " elan and energy " against the effects of climate change .
merkel was responding to criticism from top opposition politicians , who accused her of using the trip as a pr gag instead of pursuing policies to minimize germany 's negative impact on the climate .
" historical mistake " " the merkel / gabriel tour group wo n't find what it desperately needs in greenland 's melting ice : the political decisiveness to take responsible action against climate change , " said green party chief reinhard bütikofer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether symbolic or not , the backdrop was certainly impressive he said instead of staging such a trip , merkel needed to provide " solid political craft to overcome the impediments to a climate policy without ifs and buts in the only place where that can happen : at home . "
free-market liberal fdp leader guido westerwelle was also harsh . " it 's a historical mistake to restrict environment policy to symbolism , " he said , calling into question germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
climate remains focus " if mrs. merkel believes she has to go to greenland to inform herself about the effects of climate change , she should do that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 17.08.2007 expert says mafia murders pose new risks in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european police were surprised italian mafia violence had spread to germany an expert on organized crime warned that germany has to be alert about an expansion of mob activity within its borders after officials linked the killing of six italians in duisburg to the calabrian mafia , ' ndrangheta . federico varese is a professor of criminology and official fellow of linacre college , oxford university .
previously , he taught at williams college and yale university .
his main areas of research are organized crime , corruption , soviet criminal history , and the dynamics of altruistic behaviour .
his book , " the russian mafia " won the ed hewitt prize of the american association for the advancement of slavic studies . dw-world : de : according to italian interior minister giuliano amato , the six killings in duisburg are linked to the ongoing san luca clan feud .
italian anti-mafia prosecutor pietro grasso has said that such killings being carried out on non-italian soil is unprecedented .
what is the significance of the killings ? federico varese : among the mafia in italy - and we just did a study on the reporting on various italian criminal groups in italy in the media - the ‘ ndrangheta is the one that is usually under the radar .
it has always been the one that has been able to avoid major scrutiny from the media so it kept a very low profile .
so it ’ s a big step to do such a high profile murder in a different country especially . obviously it raises the alarm in germany as well .
so in that sense , it ’ s quite a departure from what we have seen before .
but of course they -lrb- ‘ ndrangheta -rrb- have killed prominent politicians before . they are ruthless and in a sense they see this just as a continuation of what they do at home .
but i think from our point of view , from the point of view of the public at least , it really raises the bar . do these recent killings in duisburg indicate that ‘ ndrangheta has expanded into germany , or might it simply be the case that some of these people were in germany to escape mafia feuds back home in calabria ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency services on the scene in duisburg where the shooting took place what we know is that there is a lot of money laundering going on among the ‘ ndrangheta in various countries in europe . germany is one of those . so i do n't think these murders show anything really except that they are taking the violence outside of their home territory . earlier , they -lrb- ' ndrangheta -rrb- might have done money laundering in different countries but now it seems they are sort of expanding to violence in their activities abroad .
that 's quite significant . what interests might ‘ ndrangheta have in germany ? i think this is a general issue about so-called money laundering .
in some ways you could think that money laundering is not such a terrible crime because it ’ s a way to inject money into the economy , although it is a crime under most laws , but it ’ s obviously different from hard core crime like murder . but i think what it -lrb- the killings -rrb- highlight is that one might follow the other .
so once we allow proceeds from crime to seep into another economy or part of europe where they come from , say drug money or extortion money into germany from italy , it does not mean that is the end of it .
it might mean that the next stage is actually somehow the rooting of the group into this territory .
so i guess this is the lesson , the general point , that comes out of this instance . your research has focussed on why the ‘ ndrangheta was able to successfully expand into bardonecchia in piedmont but not verona .
what are the conditions that allow ‘ ndrangheta , to transplant itself to some places and not others ? most observers would point to migration as the main element that allows this expansion to occur . migration of people from the same territory might be a factor that helps transplantation . however , italians and people from calabria , from southern italy , from sicily , have migrated to many , many parts of the world and there was no mafia .
so it 's not as if everywhere italians migrate there is mafia – that would be a really big misconception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ' ndrangheta member giorgio basile testified in a german court in july i think in addition to migration , there are some local conditions that allow these local groups to become entrenched .
some of the conditions we have observed in northern italy , such as in piedmont , was that they were able to corner certain markets through the use of violence . what is most extraordinary about the town of bardonecchia , just outside turin , is that the town has a very , very different social and cultural makeup from southern italy .
it was a place where people would trust each other and feel safe , but there were social and economic conditions that allowed the ‘ ndrangheta to move there . one of these was connected to the state business and the construction business .
some of the calabrese that had been working in the construction business were connected to the mafia . these people helped to create cartels of firms that were connected to calabria and cornered the market so they used violence to prevent other firms to enter this market . it was a combination situation because there was a demand for their services - some people actually benefited from their presence .
the firms that were allowed to enter this very lucrative market were very happy .
and some of the workers , somewhat illegal workers , who were not legally registered with the trade unions in particular also were happy because they found employment - when they couldn ’ t find jobs in the big industries in turin , like fiat . so there was a lethal combination of some people of the economic elite who found advantages in having the ‘ ndrangheta , and some workers and this is what explains why the ‘ ndrangheta was successful in becoming entrenched in this part of italy .
that 's what germany has to look out for - make sure that these organizations don ’ t have the possibility to corner markets and eventually to generate some sort of support for their presence . is it possible for ‘ ndrangheta to recreate conditions like those in southern italy in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction sector is usually a magnet for mob activity in principle yes .
it depends on the local markets and how careful the political elite , the police and the judiciary and various other institutions of authority are to make sure that there is no access to these markets .
but there are some special markets which are more easily penetrated by organized crime - construction is typically one of those markets . special attention must be paid to these markets . in principle , it is possible that the ‘ ndrangheta does move up one step from simple money laundering to becoming entrenched in the german economy .
and this is the most dangerous situation , ever , you can imagine .
a german construction firm wanting to enter the market and prevent its competitors from entering it , might actually benefit from having their presence . obviously these guys -lrb- the ' ndrangheta -rrb- have a reputation for violence , an ability to use violence and have shown how much they can use violence in this instance .
that 's how they build up their reputation .
so next time around , if i am a german entrepreneur and someone with a calabrian accent comes around and says , ' get out of this market or i ’ ll punish you , ' i ’ ll be more inclined to believe him and move out . given the worldwide presence of ‘ ndrangheta can we expect more of these clan wars or feuds to be carried out internationally ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in july this year , italian police arrested notorious mafia boss giuseppe bellocco in calabria , southern italy that ’ s hard to tell .

previously , he taught at williams college and yale university .
his main areas of research are organized crime , corruption , soviet criminal history , and the dynamics of altruistic behaviour .
his book , " the russian mafia " won the ed hewitt prize of the american association for the advancement of slavic studies . dw-world : de : according to italian interior minister giuliano amato , the six killings in duisburg are linked to the ongoing san luca clan feud .
italian anti-mafia prosecutor pietro grasso has said that such killings being carried out on non-italian soil is unprecedented .
what is the significance of the killings ? federico varese : among the mafia in italy - and we just did a study on the reporting on various italian criminal groups in italy in the media - the ‘ ndrangheta is the one that is usually under the radar .
it has always been the one that has been able to avoid major scrutiny from the media so it kept a very low profile .
so it ’ s a big step to do such a high profile murder in a different country especially . obviously it raises the alarm in germany as well .
so in that sense , it ’ s quite a departure from what we have seen before .
but of course they -lrb- ‘ ndrangheta -rrb- have killed prominent politicians before . they are ruthless and in a sense they see this just as a continuation of what they do at home .
but i think from our point of view , from the point of view of the public at least , it really raises the bar . do these recent killings in duisburg indicate that ‘ ndrangheta has expanded into germany , or might it simply be the case that some of these people were in germany to escape mafia feuds back home in calabria ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency services on the scene in duisburg where the shooting took place what we know is that there is a lot of money laundering going on among the ‘ ndrangheta in various countries in europe . germany is one of those . so i do n't think these murders show anything really except that they are taking the violence outside of their home territory . earlier , they -lrb- ' ndrangheta -rrb- might have done money laundering in different countries but now it seems they are sort of expanding to violence in their activities abroad .
that 's quite significant . what interests might ‘ ndrangheta have in germany ? i think this is a general issue about so-called money laundering .
in some ways you could think that money laundering is not such a terrible crime because it ’ s a way to inject money into the economy , although it is a crime under most laws , but it ’ s obviously different from hard core crime like murder . but i think what it -lrb- the killings -rrb- highlight is that one might follow the other .
so once we allow proceeds from crime to seep into another economy or part of europe where they come from , say drug money or extortion money into germany from italy , it does not mean that is the end of it .
it might mean that the next stage is actually somehow the rooting of the group into this territory .

" there are the necessary contacts on all levels , " peer steinbrück said .
" thus far they have proved very fruitful .
we are in close contact at the national and the international level . "
in berlin , government spokesman thomas steg said the outlook for the german economy remained fundamentally positive .
" there is no reason to believe that financial market uncertainty will jump over to the real economy , " steg said .
he welcomed an initiative from eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy to look into the activities of the ratings agencies that assess credit risks .
the agencies stand accused of failing to spot the looming crisis in us subprime mortgage lending before it broke .
fed interest cut causes market surge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been a turbulent time for the frankfurt exchange meanwhile , german shares rose strongly in friday 's afternoon trading on news that the us federal reserve -lrb- fed -rrb- had cut the interest rate it charges commercial banks by half of a percentage point .
after a morning during which leading shares traded on the frankfurt bourse fell 1 percent within minutes of opening , the leading dax 30 index rose to a high of 7,490 , from a morning low of 7195 , before declining to 7,451 in profit taking .
the mdax index of medium shares and the tecdax technology index followed a similar course .
german banks gained ground following heavy losses over the past week , while industrials such as basf , thyssenkrupp , continental , daimlerchrysler , and man were the top losers .
london 's ftse 100 index of top shares also surged by almost 4.0 percent to move back above 6,000 points on the fed news while the paris market also rose by around 3.0 percent .
soothing stateside jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fed chairman ben bernanke approved the cut the fed 's surprise move marked its most decisive action since the financial markets became gripped by fears over a global credit crunch .
the fed said it had lowered the rate it levies on loans to banks by 50 basis points to 5.75 percent , citing " increased uncertainty " in the financial markets .
" financial market conditions have deteriorated , and tighter credit conditions and increased uncertainty have the potential to restrain economic growth going forward , " the fed cautioned in a statement .
the central bank lowered the so-called " discount " rate to help soothe the us banking system which has been stressed in the past week by a credit crunch linked to the distressed housing market .
it is extremely unusual for the fed to act outside of its scheduled rate meetings and the last time it did so was on sept .

" there are the necessary contacts on all levels , " peer steinbrück said .
" thus far they have proved very fruitful .
we are in close contact at the national and the international level . "
in berlin , government spokesman thomas steg said the outlook for the german economy remained fundamentally positive .
" there is no reason to believe that financial market uncertainty will jump over to the real economy , " steg said .
he welcomed an initiative from eu internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy to look into the activities of the ratings agencies that assess credit risks .
the agencies stand accused of failing to spot the looming crisis in us subprime mortgage lending before it broke .
fed interest cut causes market surge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been a turbulent time for the frankfurt exchange meanwhile , german shares rose strongly in friday 's afternoon trading on news that the us federal reserve -lrb- fed -rrb- had cut the interest rate it charges commercial banks by half of a percentage point .
after a morning during which leading shares traded on the frankfurt bourse fell 1 percent within minutes of opening , the leading dax 30 index rose to a high of 7,490 , from a morning low of 7195 , before declining to 7,451 in profit taking .
the mdax index of medium shares and the tecdax technology index followed a similar course .
german banks gained ground following heavy losses over the past week , while industrials such as basf , thyssenkrupp , continental , daimlerchrysler , and man were the top losers .
london 's ftse 100 index of top shares also surged by almost 4.0 percent to move back above 6,000 points on the fed news while the paris market also rose by around 3.0 percent .
soothing stateside jitters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fed chairman ben bernanke approved the cut the fed 's surprise move marked its most decisive action since the financial markets became gripped by fears over a global credit crunch .
the fed said it had lowered the rate it levies on loans to banks by 50 basis points to 5.75 percent , citing " increased uncertainty " in the financial markets .
" financial market conditions have deteriorated , and tighter credit conditions and increased uncertainty have the potential to restrain economic growth going forward , " the fed cautioned in a statement .
the central bank lowered the so-called " discount " rate to help soothe the us banking system which has been stressed in the past week by a credit crunch linked to the distressed housing market .
it is extremely unusual for the fed to act outside of its scheduled rate meetings and the last time it did so was on sept .
17 , 2001 , after the terrorist attacks that targeted new york and washington .
the move does not affect its key short-term federal funds interest rate which stands at 5.25 percent .
fed hoping to restore " orderly conditions " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us housing market woes have been felt globally the fed - which has also injected tens of billions of dollars into the stretched financial system in the past week - said it had trimmed its discount rate in a bid to restore " orderly conditions in financial markets " which have been rocked by credit fears and the troubles plaguing the housing market .
" although recent data suggest that the economy has continued to expand at a moderate pace , the federal open market committee judges that the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably , " the fed said .
the central bank said it was continuing to monitor the situation and that it was ready to act as necessary " to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets . "
us banks have tightened their lending practices in recent weeks as the financial storm affecting mortgage firms has worsened and many investors have shunned mortgage-backed securities amid a jump in home foreclosures . article based on agency reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

teams are still building their rosters , and players are mulling their options . hertha berlin 's desultory 1-0 loss to lowly frankfurt on the opening weekend of the new bundesliga season confirmed what many observers suspected - that the 2007-08 squad for the former champions league participants is very much a work in progress . normally , teams like to have their line-up more-or-less in place for their first game .
but hertha spent their summer first finding a new coach , lucien favre of switzerland , then negotiating the sale and departures of no less than 11 players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's favre has had to wait for reinforcements thus far , hertha has only succeeded in landing four new signings of any import .
commercial manager dieter hoeneß has promised a handful of further acquisitions , including much-needed help up front and in midfield . the dilemma is that , while hastily agreed transfers waste money , waiting too long can leave clubs trolling for talent in already over-fished waters .
and this season many bundesliga teams - including title contenders schalke and bremen - may have erred on the side of caution and failed to find adequate replacements for key positions . bremen would love to sign a striker of the calibre of the departed miro klose , while schalke could use a replacement playmaker for long-gone lincoln .

the wolves were more active on the transfer market than any german club north of bayern munich . wolfsburg brought in 11 new players in the summer , while unloading almost an equal number .
unfortunately , all the wheeling and dealing did n't make the wolves any less toothless than they were last year - wolfsburg dropped their opener 3-1 at home to minnows bielefeld . the club has apparently decided that more shopping is the best form of therapy , adding defender jan simunek from sparta prague and brazilian midfield international josue during the week . but more bodies to an already crowded roster may not make it easier for coach felix magath to put together a regular - and effective - starting eleven . hamburg horror scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg would n't be smiling if van der vaart , right , bolted down and some clubs that thought they had their squads sorted out may find themselves suddenly scratching their heads .
no sooner had hamburg won their opener , than a fax arrived from spanish club valencia offering 14 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- for their best player , midfielder rafael van der vaart . what 's worse , van der vaart - whose mother is spanish - apparently told a local newspaper that he was ready and more than willing to pack his bags . " it has always been my dream to play for one of the bigger spanish clubs , " the dutch playmaker was quoted as saying in the daily hamburger abendblatt . a freak back strain while lifting his 1-year-old son followed his announcement and led the dutch de telegraaf newspaper to suggest the injury may not be genuine and linked it with van der vaart 's desire to leave the northern german port city for sunny spain . " the question is whether van der vaart faked the injury , " said the report .
" it is known that he wants to go to valencia and that he considers it absurd that hamburg did n't want to talk about their offer of 14 million euros . " playing thursday could undermine his eligibility for european action at valencia . hamburg has said it has no intentions at all of selling van der vaart .

but hertha spent their summer first finding a new coach , lucien favre of switzerland , then negotiating the sale and departures of no less than 11 players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's favre has had to wait for reinforcements thus far , hertha has only succeeded in landing four new signings of any import .
commercial manager dieter hoeneß has promised a handful of further acquisitions , including much-needed help up front and in midfield . the dilemma is that , while hastily agreed transfers waste money , waiting too long can leave clubs trolling for talent in already over-fished waters .
and this season many bundesliga teams - including title contenders schalke and bremen - may have erred on the side of caution and failed to find adequate replacements for key positions . bremen would love to sign a striker of the calibre of the departed miro klose , while schalke could use a replacement playmaker for long-gone lincoln .
the question is : where are they going to find players of those descriptions at this late date ? woeful wolves ' spree continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an injury to new defender roberto costa has meant further wolfsburg shopping one team that ca n't be faulted for hesitancy is wolfsburg .
the wolves were more active on the transfer market than any german club north of bayern munich . wolfsburg brought in 11 new players in the summer , while unloading almost an equal number .
unfortunately , all the wheeling and dealing did n't make the wolves any less toothless than they were last year - wolfsburg dropped their opener 3-1 at home to minnows bielefeld . the club has apparently decided that more shopping is the best form of therapy , adding defender jan simunek from sparta prague and brazilian midfield international josue during the week . but more bodies to an already crowded roster may not make it easier for coach felix magath to put together a regular - and effective - starting eleven . hamburg horror scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg would n't be smiling if van der vaart , right , bolted down and some clubs that thought they had their squads sorted out may find themselves suddenly scratching their heads .
no sooner had hamburg won their opener , than a fax arrived from spanish club valencia offering 14 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- for their best player , midfielder rafael van der vaart . what 's worse , van der vaart - whose mother is spanish - apparently told a local newspaper that he was ready and more than willing to pack his bags . " it has always been my dream to play for one of the bigger spanish clubs , " the dutch playmaker was quoted as saying in the daily hamburger abendblatt . a freak back strain while lifting his 1-year-old son followed his announcement and led the dutch de telegraaf newspaper to suggest the injury may not be genuine and linked it with van der vaart 's desire to leave the northern german port city for sunny spain . " the question is whether van der vaart faked the injury , " said the report .
" it is known that he wants to go to valencia and that he considers it absurd that hamburg did n't want to talk about their offer of 14 million euros . " playing thursday could undermine his eligibility for european action at valencia . hamburg has said it has no intentions at all of selling van der vaart .
his departure , should it come to pass , would temporarily debilitate a side that seemed on its way to recovering from a disappointing and nearly disastrous last season . and it would force hamburg to join the other bundesliga clubs frantically combing the market for the final piece in the puzzle or , in some cases , for significant portions of their squads . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court said that she no longer posed a public threat . the frankfurt court announced on friday that it had ordered the release on parole of former red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- member eva haule after determining that she no is longer a danger to the public after 21 years in prison .
haule , who was first arrested in 1986 , was serving a life sentence for the three murders , including that of a us army soldier in wiesbaden in 1985 .
when she is released on tuesday , she will become the second member of the radical left-wing group to win parole this year .
during her time with the raf , which is also known as the baader-meinhof gang , haule rose through the ranks to become the highest-ranking woman in the terrorist organization and one of its most sought-after members .
her seniority in the raf led to her involvement in the crimes , which saw her initially convicted on weapons possession charges and for membership in a terrorist organization in 1988 , and then for murder and causing explosions in 1994 .
the 1988 conviction in stuttgart , for her involvement in an attempted bomb attack on a nato facility in bavaria and a raid on an arms dealer , led to a 15-year sentence that was upgraded to life six years later .

she was also connected by the frankfurt court to two other killings and 23 attempted murders .
when she was arrested in an ice cream parlor with two additional suspects in august 1986 , haule and her associates were in possession of blueprints for the federal ministry of economic collaboration , which led investigators to believe she was masterminding a future attack on the government building .
in recent years , haule spoke through her representatives from prison of her " extremely heavy guilt " in regard to her terrorist past .
her behavior behind bars over the years also led to a downgrading of her security status ; haule was moved from the women 's prison at frankfurt preungesheim to the women 's custody institution in berlin-neukölln .
there , as an open prisoner , haule studied social educational theory and took a training course in photography .
in march 2005 , an exhibition of portraits of fellow inmates was held in a parliamentary building in berlin , which caused outrage among liberal and conservative politicians at the time .
her photos have since appeared in a number of publications and books .

the court said that she no longer posed a public threat . the frankfurt court announced on friday that it had ordered the release on parole of former red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- member eva haule after determining that she no is longer a danger to the public after 21 years in prison .
haule , who was first arrested in 1986 , was serving a life sentence for the three murders , including that of a us army soldier in wiesbaden in 1985 .
when she is released on tuesday , she will become the second member of the radical left-wing group to win parole this year .
during her time with the raf , which is also known as the baader-meinhof gang , haule rose through the ranks to become the highest-ranking woman in the terrorist organization and one of its most sought-after members .
her seniority in the raf led to her involvement in the crimes , which saw her initially convicted on weapons possession charges and for membership in a terrorist organization in 1988 , and then for murder and causing explosions in 1994 .
the 1988 conviction in stuttgart , for her involvement in an attempted bomb attack on a nato facility in bavaria and a raid on an arms dealer , led to a 15-year sentence that was upgraded to life six years later .
murders and bombings mean life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us rhein-main air base was targeted in 1985 a frankfurt court found her guilty in 1994 of participating in the murder of edward pimental , a 20-year-old soldier from new york city , and the bombing of the us rhein-main air base , both in august 1985 .
she was also connected by the frankfurt court to two other killings and 23 attempted murders .
when she was arrested in an ice cream parlor with two additional suspects in august 1986 , haule and her associates were in possession of blueprints for the federal ministry of economic collaboration , which led investigators to believe she was masterminding a future attack on the government building .
in recent years , haule spoke through her representatives from prison of her " extremely heavy guilt " in regard to her terrorist past .
her behavior behind bars over the years also led to a downgrading of her security status ; haule was moved from the women 's prison at frankfurt preungesheim to the women 's custody institution in berlin-neukölln .
there , as an open prisoner , haule studied social educational theory and took a training course in photography .
in march 2005 , an exhibition of portraits of fellow inmates was held in a parliamentary building in berlin , which caused outrage among liberal and conservative politicians at the time .
her photos have since appeared in a number of publications and books .

31 .
teams are still building their rosters , and players are mulling their options . hertha berlin 's desultory 1-0 loss to lowly frankfurt on the opening weekend of the new bundesliga season confirmed what many observers suspected - that the 2007-08 squad for the former champions league participants is very much a work in progress . normally , teams like to have their line-up more-or-less in place for their first game .
but hertha spent their summer first finding a new coach , lucien favre of switzerland , then negotiating the sale and departures of no less than 11 players . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's favre has had to wait for reinforcements thus far , hertha has only succeeded in landing four new signings of any import .
commercial manager dieter hoeneß has promised a handful of further acquisitions , including much-needed help up front and in midfield . the dilemma is that , while hastily agreed transfers waste money , waiting too long can leave clubs trolling for talent in already over-fished waters .
and this season many bundesliga teams - including title contenders schalke and bremen - may have erred on the side of caution and failed to find adequate replacements for key positions . bremen would love to sign a striker of the calibre of the departed miro klose , while schalke could use a replacement playmaker for long-gone lincoln .

the wolves were more active on the transfer market than any german club north of bayern munich . wolfsburg brought in 11 new players in the summer , while unloading almost an equal number .
unfortunately , all the wheeling and dealing did n't make the wolves any less toothless than they were last year - wolfsburg dropped their opener 3-1 at home to minnows bielefeld . the club has apparently decided that more shopping is the best form of therapy , adding defender jan simunek from sparta prague and brazilian midfield international josue during the week . but more bodies to an already crowded roster may not make it easier for coach felix magath to put together a regular - and effective - starting eleven . hamburg horror scenario bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg would n't be smiling if van der vaart , right , bolted down and some clubs that thought they had their squads sorted out may find themselves suddenly scratching their heads .
no sooner had hamburg won their opener , than a fax arrived from spanish club valencia offering 14 million euros -lrb- $ 19 million -rrb- for their best player , midfielder rafael van der vaart . what 's worse , van der vaart - whose mother is spanish - apparently told a local newspaper that he was ready and more than willing to pack his bags . " it has always been my dream to play for one of the bigger spanish clubs , " the dutch playmaker was quoted as saying in the daily hamburger abendblatt . a freak back strain while lifting his 1-year-old son followed his announcement and led the dutch de telegraaf newspaper to suggest the injury may not be genuine and linked it with van der vaart 's desire to leave the northern german port city for sunny spain .

german chancellor angela merkel personally knew one of the men as he was assigned to her security detail for several years before being sent to afghanistan .
the men were the first german police officers to be killed in afghanistan .
since the start of the mission , 25 german soldiers have died , 14 of them in attacks .

dubois said that 66 canadian military personnel and one canadian diplomat had died in afghanistan so far .
germany currently has some 3,000 soldiers stationed in afghanistan and three separate mandates are up for renewal by the parliament in the fall .
going south several german lawmakers have been traveling to afghanistan , nato 's headquarters in brussels and allied countries to prepare an extension of the mission , which is increasingly losing support in germany .
jörn thiessen , a social democratic member of parliament and his party 's defense expert , told rheinische post newspaper that us officials had told him they were expecting germany to beef up its training of afghan soldiers .
thiessen added that the americans were aware of germany 's concerns to send troops to the more dangerous south , but had asked that german soldiers accompany afghan trainees in case they are moved from the safer region around kabul to the south .

" this is something that 's under consideration within the federal government , " he said , adding that it was still unclear whether an expansion could happen within the current mandate , which is limited to 3,600 troops .
" what 's clear is that our work in the north can not be called into question just because we 're taking on new tasks , " he said , adding that convincing the german population of the importance of the afghanistan mission had failed so far . article based on news reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

previously , he taught at williams college and yale university .
his main areas of research are organized crime , corruption , soviet criminal history , and the dynamics of altruistic behaviour .
his book , " the russian mafia " won the ed hewitt prize of the american association for the advancement of slavic studies . dw-world : de : according to italian interior minister giuliano amato , the six killings in duisburg are linked to the ongoing san luca clan feud .
italian anti-mafia prosecutor pietro grasso has said that such killings being carried out on non-italian soil is unprecedented .
what is the significance of the killings ? federico varese : among the mafia in italy - and we just did a study on the reporting on various italian criminal groups in italy in the media - the ‘ ndrangheta is the one that is usually under the radar .
it has always been the one that has been able to avoid major scrutiny from the media so it kept a very low profile .
so it ’ s a big step to do such a high profile murder in a different country especially . obviously it raises the alarm in germany as well .
so in that sense , it ’ s quite a departure from what we have seen before .
but of course they -lrb- ‘ ndrangheta -rrb- have killed prominent politicians before . they are ruthless and in a sense they see this just as a continuation of what they do at home .
but i think from our point of view , from the point of view of the public at least , it really raises the bar . do these recent killings in duisburg indicate that ‘ ndrangheta has expanded into germany , or might it simply be the case that some of these people were in germany to escape mafia feuds back home in calabria ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency services on the scene in duisburg where the shooting took place what we know is that there is a lot of money laundering going on among the ‘ ndrangheta in various countries in europe . germany is one of those . so i do n't think these murders show anything really except that they are taking the violence outside of their home territory . earlier , they -lrb- ' ndrangheta -rrb- might have done money laundering in different countries but now it seems they are sort of expanding to violence in their activities abroad .
that 's quite significant . what interests might ‘ ndrangheta have in germany ? i think this is a general issue about so-called money laundering .
in some ways you could think that money laundering is not such a terrible crime because it ’ s a way to inject money into the economy , although it is a crime under most laws , but it ’ s obviously different from hard core crime like murder . but i think what it -lrb- the killings -rrb- highlight is that one might follow the other .
so once we allow proceeds from crime to seep into another economy or part of europe where they come from , say drug money or extortion money into germany from italy , it does not mean that is the end of it .
it might mean that the next stage is actually somehow the rooting of the group into this territory .
so i guess this is the lesson , the general point , that comes out of this instance . your research has focussed on why the ‘ ndrangheta was able to successfully expand into bardonecchia in piedmont but not verona .
what are the conditions that allow ‘ ndrangheta , to transplant itself to some places and not others ? most observers would point to migration as the main element that allows this expansion to occur . migration of people from the same territory might be a factor that helps transplantation . however , italians and people from calabria , from southern italy , from sicily , have migrated to many , many parts of the world and there was no mafia .
so it 's not as if everywhere italians migrate there is mafia – that would be a really big misconception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ' ndrangheta member giorgio basile testified in a german court in july i think in addition to migration , there are some local conditions that allow these local groups to become entrenched .
some of the conditions we have observed in northern italy , such as in piedmont , was that they were able to corner certain markets through the use of violence . what is most extraordinary about the town of bardonecchia , just outside turin , is that the town has a very , very different social and cultural makeup from southern italy .
it was a place where people would trust each other and feel safe , but there were social and economic conditions that allowed the ‘ ndrangheta to move there . one of these was connected to the state business and the construction business .
some of the calabrese that had been working in the construction business were connected to the mafia . these people helped to create cartels of firms that were connected to calabria and cornered the market so they used violence to prevent other firms to enter this market . it was a combination situation because there was a demand for their services - some people actually benefited from their presence .
the firms that were allowed to enter this very lucrative market were very happy .
and some of the workers , somewhat illegal workers , who were not legally registered with the trade unions in particular also were happy because they found employment - when they couldn ’ t find jobs in the big industries in turin , like fiat . so there was a lethal combination of some people of the economic elite who found advantages in having the ‘ ndrangheta , and some workers and this is what explains why the ‘ ndrangheta was successful in becoming entrenched in this part of italy .
that 's what germany has to look out for - make sure that these organizations don ’ t have the possibility to corner markets and eventually to generate some sort of support for their presence . is it possible for ‘ ndrangheta to recreate conditions like those in southern italy in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction sector is usually a magnet for mob activity in principle yes .
it depends on the local markets and how careful the political elite , the police and the judiciary and various other institutions of authority are to make sure that there is no access to these markets .
but there are some special markets which are more easily penetrated by organized crime - construction is typically one of those markets . special attention must be paid to these markets . in principle , it is possible that the ‘ ndrangheta does move up one step from simple money laundering to becoming entrenched in the german economy .
and this is the most dangerous situation , ever , you can imagine .
a german construction firm wanting to enter the market and prevent its competitors from entering it , might actually benefit from having their presence . obviously these guys -lrb- the ' ndrangheta -rrb- have a reputation for violence , an ability to use violence and have shown how much they can use violence in this instance .
that 's how they build up their reputation .
so next time around , if i am a german entrepreneur and someone with a calabrian accent comes around and says , ' get out of this market or i ’ ll punish you , ' i ’ ll be more inclined to believe him and move out . given the worldwide presence of ‘ ndrangheta can we expect more of these clan wars or feuds to be carried out internationally ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in july this year , italian police arrested notorious mafia boss giuseppe bellocco in calabria , southern italy that ’ s hard to tell .
i think the feud in particular will certainly continue in san luca if this is the reason behind -lrb- the killings -rrb- .
they must have felt really confident about carrying out this operation in germany . they must have been able to have intelligence on the ground .
i don ’ t think the ‘ ndrangheta has this level of intelligence everywhere .
but obviously they must have had it in this town -lrb- duisburg -rrb- because how would you know that these people were going to that restaurant ?
how would you know they were the right ones coming out at that time ?
how would you know where the one you are looking for is ? stephanie raison interviewed federico varese send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court said that she no longer posed a public threat . the frankfurt court announced on friday that it had ordered the release on parole of former red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- member eva haule after determining that she no is longer a danger to the public after 21 years in prison .
haule , who was first arrested in 1986 , was serving a life sentence for the three murders , including that of a us army soldier in wiesbaden in 1985 .
when she is released on tuesday , she will become the second member of the radical left-wing group to win parole this year .
during her time with the raf , which is also known as the baader-meinhof gang , haule rose through the ranks to become the highest-ranking woman in the terrorist organization and one of its most sought-after members .
her seniority in the raf led to her involvement in the crimes , which saw her initially convicted on weapons possession charges and for membership in a terrorist organization in 1988 , and then for murder and causing explosions in 1994 .
the 1988 conviction in stuttgart , for her involvement in an attempted bomb attack on a nato facility in bavaria and a raid on an arms dealer , led to a 15-year sentence that was upgraded to life six years later .
murders and bombings mean life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us rhein-main air base was targeted in 1985 a frankfurt court found her guilty in 1994 of participating in the murder of edward pimental , a 20-year-old soldier from new york city , and the bombing of the us rhein-main air base , both in august 1985 .
she was also connected by the frankfurt court to two other killings and 23 attempted murders .
when she was arrested in an ice cream parlor with two additional suspects in august 1986 , haule and her associates were in possession of blueprints for the federal ministry of economic collaboration , which led investigators to believe she was masterminding a future attack on the government building .
in recent years , haule spoke through her representatives from prison of her " extremely heavy guilt " in regard to her terrorist past .
her behavior behind bars over the years also led to a downgrading of her security status ; haule was moved from the women 's prison at frankfurt preungesheim to the women 's custody institution in berlin-neukölln .
there , as an open prisoner , haule studied social educational theory and took a training course in photography .
in march 2005 , an exhibition of portraits of fellow inmates was held in a parliamentary building in berlin , which caused outrage among liberal and conservative politicians at the time .
her photos have since appeared in a number of publications and books .

germany 's opposition parties attacked chancellor angela merkel over her visit to greenland .
they said the trip was a pr gag that took the place of real action against climate change . chancellor merkel wraps up her two-day visit to greenland on friday with a helicopter trip around the island .
accompanied by her environment minister sigmar gabriel , a member of the social democratic party , and the premiers of greenland and denmark on thursday , she viewed ilulissat fjord , where the effects of global warming are particularly visible . and then she defended herself .
" getting an idea of things on location never hurt , " she said at a press conference .
only then could one win over people to take action with " elan and energy " against the effects of climate change .
merkel was responding to criticism from top opposition politicians , who accused her of using the trip as a pr gag instead of pursuing policies to minimize germany 's negative impact on the climate .
" historical mistake " " the merkel / gabriel tour group wo n't find what it desperately needs in greenland 's melting ice : the political decisiveness to take responsible action against climate change , " said green party chief reinhard bütikofer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether symbolic or not , the backdrop was certainly impressive he said instead of staging such a trip , merkel needed to provide " solid political craft to overcome the impediments to a climate policy without ifs and buts in the only place where that can happen : at home . "
free-market liberal fdp leader guido westerwelle was also harsh . " it 's a historical mistake to restrict environment policy to symbolism , " he said , calling into question germany 's decision to phase out nuclear power by 2021 .
climate remains focus " if mrs. merkel believes she has to go to greenland to inform herself about the effects of climate change , she should do that .
traveling is educational , " said the left party 's gesine lötzsch . "
merkel said germany would continue to focus on climate protection during the remainder of its presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leading industrial nations , which ends when japan takes over in january . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

previously , he taught at williams college and yale university .
his main areas of research are organized crime , corruption , soviet criminal history , and the dynamics of altruistic behaviour .
his book , " the russian mafia " won the ed hewitt prize of the american association for the advancement of slavic studies . dw-world : de : according to italian interior minister giuliano amato , the six killings in duisburg are linked to the ongoing san luca clan feud .
italian anti-mafia prosecutor pietro grasso has said that such killings being carried out on non-italian soil is unprecedented .
what is the significance of the killings ? federico varese : among the mafia in italy - and we just did a study on the reporting on various italian criminal groups in italy in the media - the ‘ ndrangheta is the one that is usually under the radar .
it has always been the one that has been able to avoid major scrutiny from the media so it kept a very low profile .
so it ’ s a big step to do such a high profile murder in a different country especially . obviously it raises the alarm in germany as well .
so in that sense , it ’ s quite a departure from what we have seen before .
but of course they -lrb- ‘ ndrangheta -rrb- have killed prominent politicians before . they are ruthless and in a sense they see this just as a continuation of what they do at home .
but i think from our point of view , from the point of view of the public at least , it really raises the bar . do these recent killings in duisburg indicate that ‘ ndrangheta has expanded into germany , or might it simply be the case that some of these people were in germany to escape mafia feuds back home in calabria ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency services on the scene in duisburg where the shooting took place what we know is that there is a lot of money laundering going on among the ‘ ndrangheta in various countries in europe . germany is one of those . so i do n't think these murders show anything really except that they are taking the violence outside of their home territory . earlier , they -lrb- ' ndrangheta -rrb- might have done money laundering in different countries but now it seems they are sort of expanding to violence in their activities abroad .
that 's quite significant . what interests might ‘ ndrangheta have in germany ? i think this is a general issue about so-called money laundering .
in some ways you could think that money laundering is not such a terrible crime because it ’ s a way to inject money into the economy , although it is a crime under most laws , but it ’ s obviously different from hard core crime like murder . but i think what it -lrb- the killings -rrb- highlight is that one might follow the other .
so once we allow proceeds from crime to seep into another economy or part of europe where they come from , say drug money or extortion money into germany from italy , it does not mean that is the end of it .
it might mean that the next stage is actually somehow the rooting of the group into this territory .
so i guess this is the lesson , the general point , that comes out of this instance . your research has focussed on why the ‘ ndrangheta was able to successfully expand into bardonecchia in piedmont but not verona .
what are the conditions that allow ‘ ndrangheta , to transplant itself to some places and not others ? most observers would point to migration as the main element that allows this expansion to occur . migration of people from the same territory might be a factor that helps transplantation . however , italians and people from calabria , from southern italy , from sicily , have migrated to many , many parts of the world and there was no mafia .
so it 's not as if everywhere italians migrate there is mafia – that would be a really big misconception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former ' ndrangheta member giorgio basile testified in a german court in july i think in addition to migration , there are some local conditions that allow these local groups to become entrenched .
some of the conditions we have observed in northern italy , such as in piedmont , was that they were able to corner certain markets through the use of violence . what is most extraordinary about the town of bardonecchia , just outside turin , is that the town has a very , very different social and cultural makeup from southern italy .
it was a place where people would trust each other and feel safe , but there were social and economic conditions that allowed the ‘ ndrangheta to move there . one of these was connected to the state business and the construction business .
some of the calabrese that had been working in the construction business were connected to the mafia . these people helped to create cartels of firms that were connected to calabria and cornered the market so they used violence to prevent other firms to enter this market . it was a combination situation because there was a demand for their services - some people actually benefited from their presence .
the firms that were allowed to enter this very lucrative market were very happy .
and some of the workers , somewhat illegal workers , who were not legally registered with the trade unions in particular also were happy because they found employment - when they couldn ’ t find jobs in the big industries in turin , like fiat . so there was a lethal combination of some people of the economic elite who found advantages in having the ‘ ndrangheta , and some workers and this is what explains why the ‘ ndrangheta was successful in becoming entrenched in this part of italy .
that 's what germany has to look out for - make sure that these organizations don ’ t have the possibility to corner markets and eventually to generate some sort of support for their presence . is it possible for ‘ ndrangheta to recreate conditions like those in southern italy in germany ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction sector is usually a magnet for mob activity in principle yes .
it depends on the local markets and how careful the political elite , the police and the judiciary and various other institutions of authority are to make sure that there is no access to these markets .
but there are some special markets which are more easily penetrated by organized crime - construction is typically one of those markets . special attention must be paid to these markets . in principle , it is possible that the ‘ ndrangheta does move up one step from simple money laundering to becoming entrenched in the german economy .
and this is the most dangerous situation , ever , you can imagine .
a german construction firm wanting to enter the market and prevent its competitors from entering it , might actually benefit from having their presence . obviously these guys -lrb- the ' ndrangheta -rrb- have a reputation for violence , an ability to use violence and have shown how much they can use violence in this instance .
that 's how they build up their reputation .
so next time around , if i am a german entrepreneur and someone with a calabrian accent comes around and says , ' get out of this market or i ’ ll punish you , ' i ’ ll be more inclined to believe him and move out . given the worldwide presence of ‘ ndrangheta can we expect more of these clan wars or feuds to be carried out internationally ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in july this year , italian police arrested notorious mafia boss giuseppe bellocco in calabria , southern italy that ’ s hard to tell .
i think the feud in particular will certainly continue in san luca if this is the reason behind -lrb- the killings -rrb- .
they must have felt really confident about carrying out this operation in germany . they must have been able to have intelligence on the ground .
i don ’ t think the ‘ ndrangheta has this level of intelligence everywhere .
but obviously they must have had it in this town -lrb- duisburg -rrb- because how would you know that these people were going to that restaurant ?
how would you know they were the right ones coming out at that time ?
how would you know where the one you are looking for is ? stephanie raison interviewed federico varese send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

professor gordon parker claims the threshold for clinical depression is too low and risks treating normal emotional states as illness .
writing in the british medical journal , he calls depression a " catch-all " diagnosis driven by clever marketing .
but another psychiatrist writing in the journal contradicts his views , praising the increased diagnosis of depression .
the milder , more common experiences risk being pathologised professor gordon parker professor ian hickie writes that an increased diagnosis and treatment of depression has led to a reduction in suicides and removal of the old stigma surrounding mental illness .
under the current diagnosis guidelines , around one in five adults is thought to suffer depression during their lifetime .
this costs the uk economy billions in lost productivity and treatment .
professor parker , from the university of new south wales , in australia , said the " over-diagnosis " began around 25 years ago .
study of teachers the professor , who carried out a 15-year study of 242 teachers , found that more than three-quarters of them met the current criteria for depression .
he writes in the bmj that almost everyone had symptoms such as " feeling sad , blue or down in the dumps " at some point in their lives - but this was not the same as clinical depression which required treatment .
have your say people get a bit fed up with life and think they have depression , but if they had actually suffered with depression they would know about it mrs jackman , wirral , uk send us your comments he said prescribing medication may raise false hopes and might not be effective as there was nothing biologically wrong with the patient .
he said : " over the last 30 years the formal definitions for defining clinical depression have expanded into the territory of normal depression , and the real risk is that the milder , more common experiences risk being pathologised . "
but professor hickie said if only the most severe cases were treated , people would die unnecessarily .
marjorie wallace , chief executive of the mental health charity sane , said : " depression can be a complex and challenging condition ranging from feeling low to being so disabled that the person may be unable to get out of bed in the morning , sustain relationships or work .
" it is not surprising that with such a wide range of symptoms , identification varies from one doctor to another .
" sane believes that it is better to risk over diagnosis than to leave depression untreated .

he writes in the bmj that almost everyone had symptoms such as " feeling sad , blue or down in the dumps " at some point in their lives - but this was not the same as clinical depression which required treatment .
have your say people get a bit fed up with life and think they have depression , but if they had actually suffered with depression they would know about it mrs jackman , wirral , uk send us your comments he said prescribing medication may raise false hopes and might not be effective as there was nothing biologically wrong with the patient .
he said : " over the last 30 years the formal definitions for defining clinical depression have expanded into the territory of normal depression , and the real risk is that the milder , more common experiences risk being pathologised . "
but professor hickie said if only the most severe cases were treated , people would die unnecessarily .
marjorie wallace , chief executive of the mental health charity sane , said : " depression can be a complex and challenging condition ranging from feeling low to being so disabled that the person may be unable to get out of bed in the morning , sustain relationships or work .
" it is not surprising that with such a wide range of symptoms , identification varies from one doctor to another .
" sane believes that it is better to risk over diagnosis than to leave depression untreated .
one in ten people with severe depression may take their own life . "
the number of prescriptions for antidepressants in england hit a record high of more than 31 million prescriptions earlier this year - a 6 % rise in two years .

kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev told the shanghai co-operation organisation -lrb- sco -rrb- meeting in bishkek that it should form an energy club .
guest of honour , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , used the occasion to hit out at us missile defence plans .
the sco is increasingly seen by some as a way to stem western influence .
spanning a strategically important region rich in oil and gas reserves , it is gradually gaining clout and influence , correspondents say .
europe links mr nazarbayev said the region 's soviet-era network of gas and oil pipelines could form the basis for an asian energy market - adding that kazakhstan had already drawn up a draft strategy for an sco energy club .
sco members are undertaking joint military exercises in russia " we think that a mechanism of meetings of energy ministers from the sco member and observer states should function in the context of the idea of an energy club , " he told the summit .
" this , in our view , might become one of the main elements of an asian energy strategy . "
he also spoke of the importance of increased co-operation between the sco and the european union , particularly over a trans-continental transport corridor " which could be a new manifestation of the traditions of the great silk road " .
as well as energy , drug trafficking and political instability in afghanistan was also discussed at the one-day summit .
military exercises the shanghai co-operation organisation , officially formed six years ago , draws together china and russia and the four much weaker central asian states between them - kazakhstan , uzbekistan , tajikistan and kyrgyzstan .
most meetings take place behind closed doors , and so far none of the public statements have gone beyond general praise of friendship and deepening of ties .
but these annual summits are becoming increasingly influential , and the alliance is turning into a prestigious regional club with global ambitions , according to natalia antelava , the bbc correspondent in bishkek , kyrgyzstan .
the main message of this summit is clearly that " the world is bigger than the west " , our correspondent says .
this year the summit was attended by the leaders of iran , afghanistan , turkmenistan and mongolia , as well as senior officials from india and pakistan .
iran , in particular , is interested in obtaining full membership status .
mr ahmadinejad 's visit is adding to the suspicion with which the us and europe have always viewed the organisation , our correspondent says .
the iranian leader took the opportunity to tell the summit that us plans for a missile defence shield " concern most of the continent , both asia and the sco members " .
after the summit , all six sco leaders were due to travel to russia where more than 6,000 troops from all member states are holding joint military exercises .
this is proof the sco is taking its growing role very seriously indeed , our correspondent adds .

the iranian leader took the opportunity to tell the summit that us plans for a missile defence shield " concern most of the continent , both asia and the sco members " .
after the summit , all six sco leaders were due to travel to russia where more than 6,000 troops from all member states are holding joint military exercises .
this is proof the sco is taking its growing role very seriously indeed , our correspondent adds .

most european countries face the same difficulty , amid ageing populations and low birth rates .
italy 's budget crisis makes pension reform especially pressing for prime minister romano prodi , but france , germany and the uk have also announced ambitious plans to overhaul pensions .
the big stock market losses have fuelled fears about the future value of pensions .
bbc correspondents in europe examine the challenges eu members face .
italy france uk ireland hungary germany denmark spain have your say : are you concerned about your pension ?
italy - david willey italy 's hitherto generous state pension scheme faces bankruptcy within the next decade unless some radical reforms are enacted soon .
italy 's state pension fund will shortly have to pay out to retirees more than it receives each year in contributions from an ever decreasing national workforce .
the governor of the bank of italy , mario draghi , put the problem bluntly recently .
today , the number of italians over 60 is equivalent to 42 % of the working population , he said .
that figure will reach 53 % by 2020 .
unless the government gets its pension accounts quickly into order , young people entering the workforce today will have to pay contributions amounting to 127 % of their salaries over the next 15 years in order to receive the same benefits current pensioners receive .
the official retirement age at present for women is 55 , for men 57 plus a minimum of 35 years of pension contributions .
under the latest reform scheme agreed last month by the centre-left coalition headed by romano prodi , the official retirement age will be progressively raised each year until 2014 .
pension reform has been a major stumbling block for italian governments during two decades .
in 1994 silvio berlusconi 's first coalition fell after less than a year in office because of massive protests against his plan to prop up the already failing state pension scheme .
during his second much longer term as prime minister which ended in 2006 , he managed to push through a reform scheme under which the retirement age would be raised to 60 by 2009 and workers would be encouraged to take out supplementary private pension schemes .
once mr prodi came to office , the former communists and the unions managed to force a backtrack , despite warnings that the whole state pension system was in jeopardy .
return to top france - emma-jane kirby during the french election , nicolas sarkozy went on the campaign trail to metz in eastern france where he visited factories and former mines .
the theme of his speech there was the same as the theme of all his speeches - that france had to work harder to earn more pay : " if you think 53 makes you old enough to retire , " yelled mr sarkozy from his podium -lrb- who had himself just turned 53 -rrb- , " then fine , go ahead and retire .
but do n't expect the state to pay for it . "
he is determined to overhaul france 's generous welfare system and cut back on state pensions , which are crippling the country 's finances .
the state coffers are badly in the red .
public debt stands at 67 % - five times its level in 1980 .
including gross pension liabilities raises the public debt to 120 % of gdp .
one in four people are employed by the public sector and there are simply not enough people working to fund the pensions of those who are retired .
france has one of the lowest labour rates in the world with just 41 % of the adult population working and extremely few workers in the 55-65 age group still employed .
and despite having the highest birth rate in europe , france , like other eu countries , faces the challenge of an ageing population .
france 's 2003 pension reform gave priority to extending people 's working lives , to finance pensions in the long term .
the retirement age is now 65 for certain groups and public sector workers must work for 40 years rather than 37.5 to qualify for full pension rights .
in september , president sarkozy intends to push things further - reforming the " special pensions " that certain public sector workers currently enjoy .
such schemes allow transport workers and others full pension entitlements even if they retire early .
but the unions are not likely to accept change without protest .
previous attempts at reforming state workers ' pensions have ended in mass strikes which have brought the country to a standstill and have toppled governments .
return to top uk - julian knight the uk is going through the biggest pension shake-up in 50 years .
in response to rising life expectancy and falling levels of pension saving , the labour government has overhauled the state pension system .
as a result , the age at which britons can claim the state pension will rise gradually from 65 to 68 over the next three decades .
in return for a delayed state pension , payments will be increased in line with average earnings rather than inflation .
generally earnings rise faster than prices , so , in effect , the uk state pension will become more generous .
in an attempt to improve the state pension prospects of women - who often take time out of work to look after children - the number of years of national insurance contributions -lrb- nics -rrb- it takes to earn a full state pension will be cut from 44 to 30 .
this will mean millions more people , mainly women , will be entitled to a full state pension .
the government has also tried to tackle the issue of vanishing workplace pension provision , as firms move to cut staff pensions .
from 2012 , at the earliest , workers who do not currently pay into a work pension will be automatically enrolled into a state-sponsored personal accounts pension scheme .
there has been a surprising degree of agreement over the uk government 's plans for pensions .
opposition parties have agreed with the broad thrust of the reforms .
the conservatives are happy that the reforms will not cost much extra cash ; mainly because of the later state pension age . "
the current high levels of immigration may prove a saving grace " uk 's ageing revolution the liberal democrats have welcomed the focus on women 's ' pensions .
meanwhile , the unions have been brought on board , as lucrative public sector pensions schemes in local and central government have been largely ring-fenced .
they are also pleased that employers will be compelled to contribute into their employers ' personal accounts scheme once it is up and running .
but the pension settlement merely aims to hold things as they are .
the uk still has an ageing population and it will become difficult to pay for pensions and long-term care for the elderly .
the current high levels of immigration may prove a saving grace , however .
an influx of young people will address the balance between the number of workers and the retired .
ultimately , this could prove a more important development than the present round of pension reforms .
return to top germany - tristana moore germany has one of the lowest birth rates in europe , and at the same time , people are living longer .
recently , the pensions debate has become a political hot potato .
in march , the german parliament voted to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 as part of a reform programme aimed at tackling rapid population ageing and spiralling pension costs .
the government is hoping that by keeping people in jobs longer , it will reduce the burden on the state pension fund .
but the decision has been heavily criticised by trade unions and groups representing germany 's 20 million pensioners .
such was the level of public anger that many demonstrations were staged against the government 's plans in berlin and other german cities .
the head of the dgb trade union federation , michael sommer , said the new law was tantamount to lowering retirement benefits .
opposition politicians argued that the changes would lead to higher unemployment and increased pensioner poverty .
germany currently has one of the highest levels of public spending on pensions in the 30 countries of the oecd -lrb- organisation for economic co-operation and development -rrb- .
the system provides a high level of cover , but it is widely believed to be unaffordable in the long term .
most germans stop working on average at the age of 63 .
critics say it is still too easy for workers to take early retirement and they claim that many companies encourage early retirement schemes .
given growing concerns over the demographic time-bomb , some pensioner groups have argued that those people retiring now are receiving state pension benefits which are around 10 % less than they were in the past .
according to some surveys , one in three pensioners from 2030 will not be able to make ends meet if they rely on their normal pension scheme .
return to top ireland - james helm with ireland 's property prices having soared over the past decade -lrb- though they have cooled down in recent months -rrb- , many irish people have seen bricks and mortar as a smart way of investing for their retirement .
buying houses overseas has also been hugely popular , as ireland 's booming economy has left many people with larger disposable incomes and opportunities to invest .
while pension provision has not become the political issue it is in the uk , for example , there is debate here about future pension requirements and policies .
ireland 's workforce has grown rapidly over the past 10 years or so , as the economy has grown , although with a younger population than the eu average ireland may not have the immediate needs and worries of some european counterparts , where the workforce is closer to retirement .
at present the state pension for a worker who retires at 65 is about 200 euros -lrb- £ 135 -rrb- , though the current government says it will raise that significantly over the next parliament .
about half of the working population of two million people also have private or occupational pensions which will eventually top up what they are due from the state on retirement .
many of those are in public sector jobs .
in the private sector , one in three workers are putting something aside for later life in a private pension .
some here believe that figure needs to rise significantly to ensure people 's financial security .
return to top hungary - nick thorpe hungary 's population is ageing - and dying - fast .
parallel to low fertility rates , the country is set to lose 8 % of its population between 2000 and 2025 , according to the latest un figures .
only 60 % of working age hungarians actually work .
the pension funding crisis , already bad enough , would be far worse were it not for the poor health of the population - many men in particular die soon after , or even before , reaching retirement age .
the last major reform in 1997 established a system of private pension funds , parallel to that of the state .
they are especially aimed at new employees coming onto the labour market .
by the end of 1999 , two million people had joined one .
but private funds have not performed as well as many hoped .
experts calculated that over the past year , 150,000 employees would receive lower pensions than they would have with the state fund .
hardest hit are those in the army and police expecting to take early retirement .
the economy minister , janos veres , ruled out any compensation for them , saying the state was not responsible .
pension reforms have already been sketched out in the socialist-liberal government 's convergence programme , which aims to make it possible for hungary to introduce the euro by 2014 .
this allows for a gradual increase in retirement age until 2009 , and stricter conditions for early retirement .
an expert roundtable is seeking cross-party agreement on pensions .
its first conclusions are expected in september , but the final conclusions only at the end of the year .
a new pension reform is likely to be launched early in 2008 .
one option is to decouple pensions from wage increases , and link them solely to inflation - now running at nearly 9 % in hungary .
another is to boost private funds , at the cost of the state pension fund .
return to top spain - danny wood spain 's pension system has been in a state of almost continuous reform since the transition to democracy during the late 1970s .
radical change - for example privatisation - is off the current government 's agenda but reforming the existing public system is nothing new and is a hot topic .
spain is very aware of the urgent issues bearing down on europe 's pensions because these concerns are especially keenly felt here .
the country has one of the most rapidly ageing populations in europe as well as one of the lowest birth rates .
moreover , spaniards tend to live longer than most of their european counterparts .
a sharp rise in the number of women and immigrants in the workforce over the last 10 years is helping to pay the pensions of people who are retiring now .
but there are real concerns that the public system could run out of money during the next few decades , when the number of retirees is set to shoot upwards .
the current socialist government is committed to consolidating , rather than radically changing , the current pension system to defend it from future threats .
the publicly funded pension system based on employee and employer contributions is held dear by many spaniards and the thought of privatisation or forcing the retirement age up to keep the coffers full is very unpopular .
companies and employees can and do have separate private pension funds , but the government insists that these will continue to be complementary rather than an alternative to the public system .
as part of a current round of reforms , the government wants to create a large reserve fund to back up any future shortfalls in money .
incentives - rather than rules - to encourage people to work beyond the current retirement age of 65 are also on the agenda .
there are doubts , but spaniards will be hoping that reforms like this might be enough to safeguard their future pensions .
return to top denmark - thomas buch-andersen in denmark , there is broad political consensus that the retirement age must be raised .
an ageing danish population and the rise in life expectancy means there will be more elderly who need care and fewer hands to give it .
meanwhile , the strict danish immigration laws currently limit the number of foreign workers who come to denmark and join the labour market .
in 2006 , the so-called welfare agreement act was passed in the danish parliament , folketinget .
the agreement means the retirement age will increase from 65 to 67 .
in order not to create financial insecurity for those affected , this will happen gradually , with an increase by half a year in 2024 , 2025 , 2026 and 2027 .
but it is in principle open-ended .
thus , if life expectancy continues to rise , politicians have agreed to let the retirement age follow suit - again with a time buffer so those affected have time to prepare themselves financially .
even the social democrats - who have taken a leading role in building one of the world 's most generous welfare states - now agree that danes must spend more of their lives working .
while labour unions agree to these changes , the extreme left parties have opposed them .
the danish pension system is based on three pillars .
they are : the state pension , which serves as basic security for all citizens against poverty in old age ; the employment-based schemes which ensure a reasonable relationship between income while employed and in old age ; and private pension savings , which act as a supplement to the other two schemes .

most european countries face the same difficulty , amid ageing populations and low birth rates .

italy - david willey italy 's hitherto generous state pension scheme faces bankruptcy within the next decade unless some radical reforms are enacted soon .
immigrants are filling care jobs in many eu countries italy 's state pension fund will shortly have to pay out to retirees more than it receives each year in contributions from an ever decreasing national workforce .
the governor of the bank of italy , mario draghi , put the problem bluntly recently .
today , the number of italians over 60 is equivalent to 42 % of the working population , he said .
that figure will reach 53 % by 2020 .
unless the government gets its pension accounts quickly into order , young people entering the workforce today will have to pay contributions amounting to 127 % of their salaries over the next 15 years in order to receive the same benefits current pensioners receive .
the official retirement age at present for women is 55 , for men 57 plus a minimum of 35 years of pension contributions .
under the latest reform scheme agreed last month by the centre-left coalition headed by romano prodi , the official retirement age will be progressively raised each year until 2014 .

the official retirement age at present for women is 55 , for men 57 plus a minimum of 35 years of pension contributions .
under the latest reform scheme agreed last month by the centre-left coalition headed by romano prodi , the official retirement age will be progressively raised each year until 2014 .
pension reform has been a major stumbling block for italian governments during two decades .
in 1994 silvio berlusconi 's first coalition fell after less than a year in office because of massive protests against his plan to prop up the already failing state pension scheme .
during his second much longer term as prime minister which ended in 2006 , he managed to push through a reform scheme under which the retirement age would be raised to 60 by 2009 and workers would be encouraged to take out supplementary private pension schemes .
once mr prodi came to office , the former communists and the unions managed to force a backtrack , despite warnings that the whole state pension system was in jeopardy .
return to top france - emma-jane kirby during the french election , nicolas sarkozy went on the campaign trail to metz in eastern france where he visited factories and former mines .
president sarkozy wants to tackle pensions with other labour reforms the theme of his speech there was the same as the theme of all his speeches - that france had to work harder to earn more pay : " if you think 53 makes you old enough to retire , " yelled mr sarkozy from his podium -lrb- who had himself just turned 53 -rrb- , " then fine , go ahead and retire .
but do n't expect the state to pay for it . "
he is determined to overhaul france 's generous welfare system and cut back on state pensions , which are crippling the country 's finances .
the state coffers are badly in the red .
public debt stands at 67 % - five times its level in 1980 .
including gross pension liabilities raises the public debt to 120 % of gdp .
one in four people are employed by the public sector and there are simply not enough people working to fund the pensions of those who are retired .
france has one of the lowest labour rates in the world with just 41 % of the adult population working and extremely few workers in the 55-65 age group still employed .
and despite having the highest birth rate in europe , france , like other eu countries , faces the challenge of an ageing population .
france 's 2003 pension reform gave priority to extending people 's working lives , to finance pensions in the long term .
the retirement age is now 65 for certain groups and public sector workers must work for 40 years rather than 37.5 to qualify for full pension rights .
in september , president sarkozy intends to push things further - reforming the " special pensions " that certain public sector workers currently enjoy .
such schemes allow transport workers and others full pension entitlements even if they retire early .
but the unions are not likely to accept change without protest .
previous attempts at reforming state workers ' pensions have ended in mass strikes which have brought the country to a standstill and have toppled governments .
return to top uk - julian knight the uk is going through the biggest pension shake-up in 50 years .
in response to rising life expectancy and falling levels of pension saving , the labour government has overhauled the state pension system .
the uk has seen protests over pensions and the cost of council tax as a result , the age at which britons can claim the state pension will rise gradually from 65 to 68 over the next three decades .
in return for a delayed state pension , payments will be increased in line with average earnings rather than inflation .
generally earnings rise faster than prices , so , in effect , the uk state pension will become more generous .
in an attempt to improve the state pension prospects of women - who often take time out of work to look after children - the number of years of national insurance contributions -lrb- nics -rrb- it takes to earn a full state pension will be cut from 44 to 30 .
this will mean millions more people , mainly women , will be entitled to a full state pension .
the government has also tried to tackle the issue of vanishing workplace pension provision , as firms move to cut staff pensions .
from 2012 , at the earliest , workers who do not currently pay into a work pension will be automatically enrolled into a state-sponsored personal accounts pension scheme .
there has been a surprising degree of agreement over the uk government 's plans for pensions .
opposition parties have agreed with the broad thrust of the reforms .
the conservatives are happy that the reforms will not cost much extra cash ; mainly because of the later state pension age .
the current high levels of immigration may prove a saving grace uk 's ageing revolution the liberal democrats have welcomed the focus on women 's ' pensions .
meanwhile , the unions have been brought on board , as lucrative public sector pensions schemes in local and central government have been largely ring-fenced .
they are also pleased that employers will be compelled to contribute into their employers ' personal accounts scheme once it is up and running .
but the pension settlement merely aims to hold things as they are .
the uk still has an ageing population and it will become difficult to pay for pensions and long-term care for the elderly .
the current high levels of immigration may prove a saving grace , however .
an influx of young people will address the balance between the number of workers and the retired .
ultimately , this could prove a more important development than the present round of pension reforms .
return to top germany - tristana moore germany has one of the lowest birth rates in europe , and at the same time , people are living longer .
recently , the pensions debate has become a political hot potato .
in march , the german parliament voted to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 as part of a reform programme aimed at tackling rapid population ageing and spiralling pension costs .
the government is hoping that by keeping people in jobs longer , it will reduce the burden on the state pension fund .
but the decision has been heavily criticised by trade unions and groups representing germany 's 20 million pensioners .
such was the level of public anger that many demonstrations were staged against the government 's plans in berlin and other german cities .
the head of the dgb trade union federation , michael sommer , said the new law was tantamount to lowering retirement benefits .
opposition politicians argued that the changes would lead to higher unemployment and increased pensioner poverty .
germany currently has one of the highest levels of public spending on pensions in the 30 countries of the oecd -lrb- organisation for economic co-operation and development -rrb- .
the system provides a high level of cover , but it is widely believed to be unaffordable in the long term .
most germans stop working on average at the age of 63 .
critics say it is still too easy for workers to take early retirement and they claim that many companies encourage early retirement schemes .
given growing concerns over the demographic time-bomb , some pensioner groups have argued that those people retiring now are receiving state pension benefits which are around 10 % less than they were in the past .
according to some surveys , one in three pensioners from 2030 will not be able to make ends meet if they rely on their normal pension scheme .
return to top ireland - james helm with ireland 's property prices having soared over the past decade -lrb- though they have cooled down in recent months -rrb- , many irish people have seen bricks and mortar as a smart way of investing for their retirement .
buying houses overseas has also been hugely popular , as ireland 's booming economy has left many people with larger disposable incomes and opportunities to invest .
while pension provision has not become the political issue it is in the uk , for example , there is debate here about future pension requirements and policies .
ireland 's workforce has grown rapidly over the past 10 years or so , as the economy has grown , although with a younger population than the eu average ireland may not have the immediate needs and worries of some european counterparts , where the workforce is closer to retirement .
at present the state pension for a worker who retires at 65 is about 200 euros -lrb- £ 135 -rrb- , though the current government says it will raise that significantly over the next parliament .
about half of the working population of two million people also have private or occupational pensions which will eventually top up what they are due from the state on retirement .
many of those are in public sector jobs .
in the private sector , one in three workers are putting something aside for later life in a private pension .
some here believe that figure needs to rise significantly to ensure people 's financial security .
return to top hungary - nick thorpe hungary 's population is ageing - and dying - fast .
parallel to low fertility rates , the country is set to lose 8 % of its population between 2000 and 2025 , according to the latest un figures .
only 60 % of working age hungarians actually work .
the pension funding crisis , already bad enough , would be far worse were it not for the poor health of the population - many men in particular die soon after , or even before , reaching retirement age .
the last major reform in 1997 established a system of private pension funds , parallel to that of the state .
they are especially aimed at new employees coming onto the labour market .
by the end of 1999 , two million people had joined one .
but private funds have not performed as well as many hoped .
experts calculated that over the past year , 150,000 employees would receive lower pensions than they would have with the state fund .
hardest hit are those in the army and police expecting to take early retirement .
the economy minister , janos veres , ruled out any compensation for them , saying the state was not responsible .
pension reforms have already been sketched out in the socialist-liberal government 's convergence programme , which aims to make it possible for hungary to introduce the euro by 2014 .
this allows for a gradual increase in retirement age until 2009 , and stricter conditions for early retirement .
an expert roundtable is seeking cross-party agreement on pensions .
its first conclusions are expected in september , but the final conclusions only at the end of the year .
a new pension reform is likely to be launched early in 2008 .
one option is to decouple pensions from wage increases , and link them solely to inflation - now running at nearly 9 % in hungary .
another is to boost private funds , at the cost of the state pension fund .
return to top spain - danny wood spain 's pension system has been in a state of almost continuous reform since the transition to democracy during the late 1970s .
radical change - for example privatisation - is off the current government 's agenda but reforming the existing public system is nothing new and is a hot topic .
spain is very aware of the urgent issues bearing down on europe 's pensions because these concerns are especially keenly felt here .
the country has one of the most rapidly ageing populations in europe as well as one of the lowest birth rates .
moreover , spaniards tend to live longer than most of their european counterparts .
a sharp rise in the number of women and immigrants in the workforce over the last 10 years is helping to pay the pensions of people who are retiring now .
but there are real concerns that the public system could run out of money during the next few decades , when the number of retirees is set to shoot upwards .
the current socialist government is committed to consolidating , rather than radically changing , the current pension system to defend it from future threats .
the publicly funded pension system based on employee and employer contributions is held dear by many spaniards and the thought of privatisation or forcing the retirement age up to keep the coffers full is very unpopular .
companies and employees can and do have separate private pension funds , but the government insists that these will continue to be complementary rather than an alternative to the public system .
as part of a current round of reforms , the government wants to create a large reserve fund to back up any future shortfalls in money .
incentives - rather than rules - to encourage people to work beyond the current retirement age of 65 are also on the agenda .
there are doubts , but spaniards will be hoping that reforms like this might be enough to safeguard their future pensions .
return to top denmark - thomas buch-andersen in denmark , there is broad political consensus that the retirement age must be raised .
an ageing danish population and the rise in life expectancy means there will be more elderly who need care and fewer hands to give it .
meanwhile , the strict danish immigration laws currently limit the number of foreign workers who come to denmark and join the labour market .
in 2006 , the so-called welfare agreement act was passed in the danish parliament , folketinget .
the agreement means the retirement age will increase from 65 to 67 .
in order not to create financial insecurity for those affected , this will happen gradually , with an increase by half a year in 2024 , 2025 , 2026 and 2027 .
but it is in principle open-ended .
thus , if life expectancy continues to rise , politicians have agreed to let the retirement age follow suit - again with a time buffer so those affected have time to prepare themselves financially .
even the social democrats - who have taken a leading role in building one of the world 's most generous welfare states - now agree that danes must spend more of their lives working .
while labour unions agree to these changes , the extreme left parties have opposed them .
the danish pension system is based on three pillars .
they are : the state pension , which serves as basic security for all citizens against poverty in old age ; the employment-based schemes which ensure a reasonable relationship between income while employed and in old age ; and private pension savings , which act as a supplement to the other two schemes .

most european countries face the same difficulty , amid ageing populations and low birth rates .

the big stock market losses have fuelled fears about the future value of pensions .

italy - david willey italy 's hitherto generous state pension scheme faces bankruptcy within the next decade unless some radical reforms are enacted soon .
immigrants are filling care jobs in many eu countries italy 's state pension fund will shortly have to pay out to retirees more than it receives each year in contributions from an ever decreasing national workforce .
the governor of the bank of italy , mario draghi , put the problem bluntly recently .
today , the number of italians over 60 is equivalent to 42 % of the working population , he said .
that figure will reach 53 % by 2020 .
unless the government gets its pension accounts quickly into order , young people entering the workforce today will have to pay contributions amounting to 127 % of their salaries over the next 15 years in order to receive the same benefits current pensioners receive .

most european countries face the same difficulty , amid ageing populations and low birth rates .
italy 's budget crisis makes pension reform especially pressing for prime minister romano prodi , but france , germany and the uk have also announced ambitious plans to overhaul pensions .
the big stock market losses have fuelled fears about the future value of pensions .

italy france uk ireland hungary germany denmark spain have your say : are you concerned about your pension ?
italy - david willey italy 's hitherto generous state pension scheme faces bankruptcy within the next decade unless some radical reforms are enacted soon .
immigrants are filling care jobs in many eu countries italy 's state pension fund will shortly have to pay out to retirees more than it receives each year in contributions from an ever decreasing national workforce .
the governor of the bank of italy , mario draghi , put the problem bluntly recently .
today , the number of italians over 60 is equivalent to 42 % of the working population , he said .
that figure will reach 53 % by 2020 .
unless the government gets its pension accounts quickly into order , young people entering the workforce today will have to pay contributions amounting to 127 % of their salaries over the next 15 years in order to receive the same benefits current pensioners receive .
the official retirement age at present for women is 55 , for men 57 plus a minimum of 35 years of pension contributions .
under the latest reform scheme agreed last month by the centre-left coalition headed by romano prodi , the official retirement age will be progressively raised each year until 2014 .
pension reform has been a major stumbling block for italian governments during two decades .
in 1994 silvio berlusconi 's first coalition fell after less than a year in office because of massive protests against his plan to prop up the already failing state pension scheme .
during his second much longer term as prime minister which ended in 2006 , he managed to push through a reform scheme under which the retirement age would be raised to 60 by 2009 and workers would be encouraged to take out supplementary private pension schemes .
once mr prodi came to office , the former communists and the unions managed to force a backtrack , despite warnings that the whole state pension system was in jeopardy .
return to top france - emma-jane kirby during the french election , nicolas sarkozy went on the campaign trail to metz in eastern france where he visited factories and former mines .
president sarkozy wants to tackle pensions with other labour reforms the theme of his speech there was the same as the theme of all his speeches - that france had to work harder to earn more pay : " if you think 53 makes you old enough to retire , " yelled mr sarkozy from his podium -lrb- who had himself just turned 53 -rrb- , " then fine , go ahead and retire .
but do n't expect the state to pay for it . "
he is determined to overhaul france 's generous welfare system and cut back on state pensions , which are crippling the country 's finances .
the state coffers are badly in the red .
public debt stands at 67 % - five times its level in 1980 .
including gross pension liabilities raises the public debt to 120 % of gdp .
one in four people are employed by the public sector and there are simply not enough people working to fund the pensions of those who are retired .
france has one of the lowest labour rates in the world with just 41 % of the adult population working and extremely few workers in the 55-65 age group still employed .
and despite having the highest birth rate in europe , france , like other eu countries , faces the challenge of an ageing population .
france 's 2003 pension reform gave priority to extending people 's working lives , to finance pensions in the long term .
the retirement age is now 65 for certain groups and public sector workers must work for 40 years rather than 37.5 to qualify for full pension rights .
in september , president sarkozy intends to push things further - reforming the " special pensions " that certain public sector workers currently enjoy .
such schemes allow transport workers and others full pension entitlements even if they retire early .
but the unions are not likely to accept change without protest .
previous attempts at reforming state workers ' pensions have ended in mass strikes which have brought the country to a standstill and have toppled governments .
return to top uk - julian knight the uk is going through the biggest pension shake-up in 50 years .
in response to rising life expectancy and falling levels of pension saving , the labour government has overhauled the state pension system .
the uk has seen protests over pensions and the cost of council tax as a result , the age at which britons can claim the state pension will rise gradually from 65 to 68 over the next three decades .
in return for a delayed state pension , payments will be increased in line with average earnings rather than inflation .
generally earnings rise faster than prices , so , in effect , the uk state pension will become more generous .
in an attempt to improve the state pension prospects of women - who often take time out of work to look after children - the number of years of national insurance contributions -lrb- nics -rrb- it takes to earn a full state pension will be cut from 44 to 30 .
this will mean millions more people , mainly women , will be entitled to a full state pension .
the government has also tried to tackle the issue of vanishing workplace pension provision , as firms move to cut staff pensions .
from 2012 , at the earliest , workers who do not currently pay into a work pension will be automatically enrolled into a state-sponsored personal accounts pension scheme .
there has been a surprising degree of agreement over the uk government 's plans for pensions .
opposition parties have agreed with the broad thrust of the reforms .
the conservatives are happy that the reforms will not cost much extra cash ; mainly because of the later state pension age .
the current high levels of immigration may prove a saving grace uk 's ageing revolution the liberal democrats have welcomed the focus on women 's ' pensions .
meanwhile , the unions have been brought on board , as lucrative public sector pensions schemes in local and central government have been largely ring-fenced .
they are also pleased that employers will be compelled to contribute into their employers ' personal accounts scheme once it is up and running .
but the pension settlement merely aims to hold things as they are .
the uk still has an ageing population and it will become difficult to pay for pensions and long-term care for the elderly .
the current high levels of immigration may prove a saving grace , however .
an influx of young people will address the balance between the number of workers and the retired .
ultimately , this could prove a more important development than the present round of pension reforms .
return to top germany - tristana moore germany has one of the lowest birth rates in europe , and at the same time , people are living longer .
recently , the pensions debate has become a political hot potato .
in march , the german parliament voted to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 as part of a reform programme aimed at tackling rapid population ageing and spiralling pension costs .
the government is hoping that by keeping people in jobs longer , it will reduce the burden on the state pension fund .
but the decision has been heavily criticised by trade unions and groups representing germany 's 20 million pensioners .
such was the level of public anger that many demonstrations were staged against the government 's plans in berlin and other german cities .
the head of the dgb trade union federation , michael sommer , said the new law was tantamount to lowering retirement benefits .
opposition politicians argued that the changes would lead to higher unemployment and increased pensioner poverty .
germany currently has one of the highest levels of public spending on pensions in the 30 countries of the oecd -lrb- organisation for economic co-operation and development -rrb- .
the system provides a high level of cover , but it is widely believed to be unaffordable in the long term .
most germans stop working on average at the age of 63 .
critics say it is still too easy for workers to take early retirement and they claim that many companies encourage early retirement schemes .
given growing concerns over the demographic time-bomb , some pensioner groups have argued that those people retiring now are receiving state pension benefits which are around 10 % less than they were in the past .
according to some surveys , one in three pensioners from 2030 will not be able to make ends meet if they rely on their normal pension scheme .
return to top ireland - james helm with ireland 's property prices having soared over the past decade -lrb- though they have cooled down in recent months -rrb- , many irish people have seen bricks and mortar as a smart way of investing for their retirement .
buying houses overseas has also been hugely popular , as ireland 's booming economy has left many people with larger disposable incomes and opportunities to invest .
while pension provision has not become the political issue it is in the uk , for example , there is debate here about future pension requirements and policies .
ireland 's workforce has grown rapidly over the past 10 years or so , as the economy has grown , although with a younger population than the eu average ireland may not have the immediate needs and worries of some european counterparts , where the workforce is closer to retirement .
at present the state pension for a worker who retires at 65 is about 200 euros -lrb- £ 135 -rrb- , though the current government says it will raise that significantly over the next parliament .
about half of the working population of two million people also have private or occupational pensions which will eventually top up what they are due from the state on retirement .
many of those are in public sector jobs .
in the private sector , one in three workers are putting something aside for later life in a private pension .
some here believe that figure needs to rise significantly to ensure people 's financial security .
return to top hungary - nick thorpe hungary 's population is ageing - and dying - fast .
parallel to low fertility rates , the country is set to lose 8 % of its population between 2000 and 2025 , according to the latest un figures .
only 60 % of working age hungarians actually work .
the pension funding crisis , already bad enough , would be far worse were it not for the poor health of the population - many men in particular die soon after , or even before , reaching retirement age .
the last major reform in 1997 established a system of private pension funds , parallel to that of the state .
they are especially aimed at new employees coming onto the labour market .
by the end of 1999 , two million people had joined one .
but private funds have not performed as well as many hoped .
experts calculated that over the past year , 150,000 employees would receive lower pensions than they would have with the state fund .
hardest hit are those in the army and police expecting to take early retirement .
the economy minister , janos veres , ruled out any compensation for them , saying the state was not responsible .
pension reforms have already been sketched out in the socialist-liberal government 's convergence programme , which aims to make it possible for hungary to introduce the euro by 2014 .
this allows for a gradual increase in retirement age until 2009 , and stricter conditions for early retirement .
an expert roundtable is seeking cross-party agreement on pensions .
its first conclusions are expected in september , but the final conclusions only at the end of the year .
a new pension reform is likely to be launched early in 2008 .
one option is to decouple pensions from wage increases , and link them solely to inflation - now running at nearly 9 % in hungary .
another is to boost private funds , at the cost of the state pension fund .
return to top spain - danny wood spain 's pension system has been in a state of almost continuous reform since the transition to democracy during the late 1970s .
radical change - for example privatisation - is off the current government 's agenda but reforming the existing public system is nothing new and is a hot topic .
spain is very aware of the urgent issues bearing down on europe 's pensions because these concerns are especially keenly felt here .
the country has one of the most rapidly ageing populations in europe as well as one of the lowest birth rates .
moreover , spaniards tend to live longer than most of their european counterparts .
a sharp rise in the number of women and immigrants in the workforce over the last 10 years is helping to pay the pensions of people who are retiring now .
but there are real concerns that the public system could run out of money during the next few decades , when the number of retirees is set to shoot upwards .
the current socialist government is committed to consolidating , rather than radically changing , the current pension system to defend it from future threats .
the publicly funded pension system based on employee and employer contributions is held dear by many spaniards and the thought of privatisation or forcing the retirement age up to keep the coffers full is very unpopular .
companies and employees can and do have separate private pension funds , but the government insists that these will continue to be complementary rather than an alternative to the public system .
as part of a current round of reforms , the government wants to create a large reserve fund to back up any future shortfalls in money .
incentives - rather than rules - to encourage people to work beyond the current retirement age of 65 are also on the agenda .
there are doubts , but spaniards will be hoping that reforms like this might be enough to safeguard their future pensions .
return to top denmark - thomas buch-andersen in denmark , there is broad political consensus that the retirement age must be raised .
an ageing danish population and the rise in life expectancy means there will be more elderly who need care and fewer hands to give it .
meanwhile , the strict danish immigration laws currently limit the number of foreign workers who come to denmark and join the labour market .
in 2006 , the so-called welfare agreement act was passed in the danish parliament , folketinget .
the agreement means the retirement age will increase from 65 to 67 .
in order not to create financial insecurity for those affected , this will happen gradually , with an increase by half a year in 2024 , 2025 , 2026 and 2027 .
but it is in principle open-ended .
thus , if life expectancy continues to rise , politicians have agreed to let the retirement age follow suit - again with a time buffer so those affected have time to prepare themselves financially .
even the social democrats - who have taken a leading role in building one of the world 's most generous welfare states - now agree that danes must spend more of their lives working .
while labour unions agree to these changes , the extreme left parties have opposed them .
the danish pension system is based on three pillars .
they are : the state pension , which serves as basic security for all citizens against poverty in old age ; the employment-based schemes which ensure a reasonable relationship between income while employed and in old age ; and private pension savings , which act as a supplement to the other two schemes .

most european countries face the same difficulty , amid ageing populations and low birth rates .
italy 's budget crisis makes pension reform especially pressing for prime minister romano prodi , but france , germany and the uk have also announced ambitious plans to overhaul pensions .
the big stock market losses have fuelled fears about the future value of pensions .
bbc correspondents in europe examine the challenges eu members face .
italy france uk ireland hungary germany denmark spain have your say : are you concerned about your pension ?
italy - david willey italy 's hitherto generous state pension scheme faces bankruptcy within the next decade unless some radical reforms are enacted soon .
immigrants are filling care jobs in many eu countries italy 's state pension fund will shortly have to pay out to retirees more than it receives each year in contributions from an ever decreasing national workforce .
the governor of the bank of italy , mario draghi , put the problem bluntly recently .
today , the number of italians over 60 is equivalent to 42 % of the working population , he said .
that figure will reach 53 % by 2020 .
unless the government gets its pension accounts quickly into order , young people entering the workforce today will have to pay contributions amounting to 127 % of their salaries over the next 15 years in order to receive the same benefits current pensioners receive .
the official retirement age at present for women is 55 , for men 57 plus a minimum of 35 years of pension contributions .
under the latest reform scheme agreed last month by the centre-left coalition headed by romano prodi , the official retirement age will be progressively raised each year until 2014 .
pension reform has been a major stumbling block for italian governments during two decades .
in 1994 silvio berlusconi 's first coalition fell after less than a year in office because of massive protests against his plan to prop up the already failing state pension scheme .
during his second much longer term as prime minister which ended in 2006 , he managed to push through a reform scheme under which the retirement age would be raised to 60 by 2009 and workers would be encouraged to take out supplementary private pension schemes .
once mr prodi came to office , the former communists and the unions managed to force a backtrack , despite warnings that the whole state pension system was in jeopardy .
return to top france - emma-jane kirby during the french election , nicolas sarkozy went on the campaign trail to metz in eastern france where he visited factories and former mines .
president sarkozy wants to tackle pensions with other labour reforms the theme of his speech there was the same as the theme of all his speeches - that france had to work harder to earn more pay : " if you think 53 makes you old enough to retire , " yelled mr sarkozy from his podium -lrb- who had himself just turned 53 -rrb- , " then fine , go ahead and retire .
but do n't expect the state to pay for it . "
he is determined to overhaul france 's generous welfare system and cut back on state pensions , which are crippling the country 's finances .
the state coffers are badly in the red .
public debt stands at 67 % - five times its level in 1980 .
including gross pension liabilities raises the public debt to 120 % of gdp .
one in four people are employed by the public sector and there are simply not enough people working to fund the pensions of those who are retired .
france has one of the lowest labour rates in the world with just 41 % of the adult population working and extremely few workers in the 55-65 age group still employed .
and despite having the highest birth rate in europe , france , like other eu countries , faces the challenge of an ageing population .
france 's 2003 pension reform gave priority to extending people 's working lives , to finance pensions in the long term .
the retirement age is now 65 for certain groups and public sector workers must work for 40 years rather than 37.5 to qualify for full pension rights .
in september , president sarkozy intends to push things further - reforming the " special pensions " that certain public sector workers currently enjoy .
such schemes allow transport workers and others full pension entitlements even if they retire early .
but the unions are not likely to accept change without protest .
previous attempts at reforming state workers ' pensions have ended in mass strikes which have brought the country to a standstill and have toppled governments .
return to top uk - julian knight the uk is going through the biggest pension shake-up in 50 years .
in response to rising life expectancy and falling levels of pension saving , the labour government has overhauled the state pension system .
the uk has seen protests over pensions and the cost of council tax as a result , the age at which britons can claim the state pension will rise gradually from 65 to 68 over the next three decades .
in return for a delayed state pension , payments will be increased in line with average earnings rather than inflation .
generally earnings rise faster than prices , so , in effect , the uk state pension will become more generous .
in an attempt to improve the state pension prospects of women - who often take time out of work to look after children - the number of years of national insurance contributions -lrb- nics -rrb- it takes to earn a full state pension will be cut from 44 to 30 .
this will mean millions more people , mainly women , will be entitled to a full state pension .
the government has also tried to tackle the issue of vanishing workplace pension provision , as firms move to cut staff pensions .
from 2012 , at the earliest , workers who do not currently pay into a work pension will be automatically enrolled into a state-sponsored personal accounts pension scheme .
there has been a surprising degree of agreement over the uk government 's plans for pensions .
opposition parties have agreed with the broad thrust of the reforms .
the conservatives are happy that the reforms will not cost much extra cash ; mainly because of the later state pension age .
the current high levels of immigration may prove a saving grace uk 's ageing revolution the liberal democrats have welcomed the focus on women 's ' pensions .
meanwhile , the unions have been brought on board , as lucrative public sector pensions schemes in local and central government have been largely ring-fenced .
they are also pleased that employers will be compelled to contribute into their employers ' personal accounts scheme once it is up and running .
but the pension settlement merely aims to hold things as they are .
the uk still has an ageing population and it will become difficult to pay for pensions and long-term care for the elderly .
the current high levels of immigration may prove a saving grace , however .
an influx of young people will address the balance between the number of workers and the retired .
ultimately , this could prove a more important development than the present round of pension reforms .
return to top germany - tristana moore germany has one of the lowest birth rates in europe , and at the same time , people are living longer .
recently , the pensions debate has become a political hot potato .
in march , the german parliament voted to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67 as part of a reform programme aimed at tackling rapid population ageing and spiralling pension costs .
the government is hoping that by keeping people in jobs longer , it will reduce the burden on the state pension fund .
but the decision has been heavily criticised by trade unions and groups representing germany 's 20 million pensioners .
such was the level of public anger that many demonstrations were staged against the government 's plans in berlin and other german cities .
the head of the dgb trade union federation , michael sommer , said the new law was tantamount to lowering retirement benefits .
opposition politicians argued that the changes would lead to higher unemployment and increased pensioner poverty .
germany currently has one of the highest levels of public spending on pensions in the 30 countries of the oecd -lrb- organisation for economic co-operation and development -rrb- .
the system provides a high level of cover , but it is widely believed to be unaffordable in the long term .
most germans stop working on average at the age of 63 .
critics say it is still too easy for workers to take early retirement and they claim that many companies encourage early retirement schemes .
given growing concerns over the demographic time-bomb , some pensioner groups have argued that those people retiring now are receiving state pension benefits which are around 10 % less than they were in the past .
according to some surveys , one in three pensioners from 2030 will not be able to make ends meet if they rely on their normal pension scheme .
return to top ireland - james helm with ireland 's property prices having soared over the past decade -lrb- though they have cooled down in recent months -rrb- , many irish people have seen bricks and mortar as a smart way of investing for their retirement .
buying houses overseas has also been hugely popular , as ireland 's booming economy has left many people with larger disposable incomes and opportunities to invest .
while pension provision has not become the political issue it is in the uk , for example , there is debate here about future pension requirements and policies .
ireland 's workforce has grown rapidly over the past 10 years or so , as the economy has grown , although with a younger population than the eu average ireland may not have the immediate needs and worries of some european counterparts , where the workforce is closer to retirement .
at present the state pension for a worker who retires at 65 is about 200 euros -lrb- £ 135 -rrb- , though the current government says it will raise that significantly over the next parliament .
about half of the working population of two million people also have private or occupational pensions which will eventually top up what they are due from the state on retirement .
many of those are in public sector jobs .
in the private sector , one in three workers are putting something aside for later life in a private pension .
some here believe that figure needs to rise significantly to ensure people 's financial security .
return to top hungary - nick thorpe hungary 's population is ageing - and dying - fast .
parallel to low fertility rates , the country is set to lose 8 % of its population between 2000 and 2025 , according to the latest un figures .
only 60 % of working age hungarians actually work .
the pension funding crisis , already bad enough , would be far worse were it not for the poor health of the population - many men in particular die soon after , or even before , reaching retirement age .
the last major reform in 1997 established a system of private pension funds , parallel to that of the state .
they are especially aimed at new employees coming onto the labour market .
by the end of 1999 , two million people had joined one .
but private funds have not performed as well as many hoped .
experts calculated that over the past year , 150,000 employees would receive lower pensions than they would have with the state fund .
hardest hit are those in the army and police expecting to take early retirement .
the economy minister , janos veres , ruled out any compensation for them , saying the state was not responsible .
pension reforms have already been sketched out in the socialist-liberal government 's convergence programme , which aims to make it possible for hungary to introduce the euro by 2014 .
this allows for a gradual increase in retirement age until 2009 , and stricter conditions for early retirement .
an expert roundtable is seeking cross-party agreement on pensions .
its first conclusions are expected in september , but the final conclusions only at the end of the year .
a new pension reform is likely to be launched early in 2008 .
one option is to decouple pensions from wage increases , and link them solely to inflation - now running at nearly 9 % in hungary .
another is to boost private funds , at the cost of the state pension fund .
return to top spain - danny wood spain 's pension system has been in a state of almost continuous reform since the transition to democracy during the late 1970s .
radical change - for example privatisation - is off the current government 's agenda but reforming the existing public system is nothing new and is a hot topic .
spain is very aware of the urgent issues bearing down on europe 's pensions because these concerns are especially keenly felt here .
the country has one of the most rapidly ageing populations in europe as well as one of the lowest birth rates .
moreover , spaniards tend to live longer than most of their european counterparts .
a sharp rise in the number of women and immigrants in the workforce over the last 10 years is helping to pay the pensions of people who are retiring now .
but there are real concerns that the public system could run out of money during the next few decades , when the number of retirees is set to shoot upwards .
the current socialist government is committed to consolidating , rather than radically changing , the current pension system to defend it from future threats .
the publicly funded pension system based on employee and employer contributions is held dear by many spaniards and the thought of privatisation or forcing the retirement age up to keep the coffers full is very unpopular .
companies and employees can and do have separate private pension funds , but the government insists that these will continue to be complementary rather than an alternative to the public system .
as part of a current round of reforms , the government wants to create a large reserve fund to back up any future shortfalls in money .
incentives - rather than rules - to encourage people to work beyond the current retirement age of 65 are also on the agenda .
there are doubts , but spaniards will be hoping that reforms like this might be enough to safeguard their future pensions .
return to top denmark - thomas buch-andersen in denmark , there is broad political consensus that the retirement age must be raised .
an ageing danish population and the rise in life expectancy means there will be more elderly who need care and fewer hands to give it .
meanwhile , the strict danish immigration laws currently limit the number of foreign workers who come to denmark and join the labour market .
in 2006 , the so-called welfare agreement act was passed in the danish parliament , folketinget .
the agreement means the retirement age will increase from 65 to 67 .
in order not to create financial insecurity for those affected , this will happen gradually , with an increase by half a year in 2024 , 2025 , 2026 and 2027 .
but it is in principle open-ended .
thus , if life expectancy continues to rise , politicians have agreed to let the retirement age follow suit - again with a time buffer so those affected have time to prepare themselves financially .
even the social democrats - who have taken a leading role in building one of the world 's most generous welfare states - now agree that danes must spend more of their lives working .
while labour unions agree to these changes , the extreme left parties have opposed them .
the danish pension system is based on three pillars .
they are : the state pension , which serves as basic security for all citizens against poverty in old age ; the employment-based schemes which ensure a reasonable relationship between income while employed and in old age ; and private pension savings , which act as a supplement to the other two schemes .

shoppers in llandysilio , pembrokeshire , will no longer be offered the bags at either the post office or bakery and instead be expected to bring their own .
organisers , who say it will help recycling , will be handing out reusable canvas alternatives .
banning plastic bags was the winner when people were asked to vote earlier this year on policies they would like the welsh assembly government to adopt .
modbury in devon became one of the first places in the uk to introduce a voluntary ban on plastic bags when all 43 traders and shops in the market town agreed to stop stocking them .
pembrokeshire councillor huw george , who lives in llandysilio , said : " we only have a small number of shops but we want to show everyone can do a little bit .
" when you are just picking up a paper , loaf of bread and bottle of milk i think it will work .
" hopefully it will also encourage people to buy reusable bags for when they visit the supermarkets . "
he said he hoped the campaign would shortly be extended to the nearby village of maenclochog , which also has two shops as well as two garages .
earlier this year a bbc wales initiative called if i ruled wales invited people to submit ideas they wanted to be brought in as a law .
banning plastic bags was one of three ideas shortlisted and was backed by more than half the 500 people who then voted for their favourite .
to have a chance of becoming law the proposal will first go before the new assembly petitions committee , which will decide where it goes for further discussion at cardiff bay .

shoppers in llandysilio , pembrokeshire , will no longer be offered the bags at either the post office or bakery and instead be expected to bring their own .

banning plastic bags was the winner when people were asked to vote earlier this year on policies they would like the welsh assembly government to adopt .
modbury in devon became one of the first places in the uk to introduce a voluntary ban on plastic bags when all 43 traders and shops in the market town agreed to stop stocking them .
pembrokeshire councillor huw george , who lives in llandysilio , said : " we only have a small number of shops but we want to show everyone can do a little bit .
" when you are just picking up a paper , loaf of bread and bottle of milk i think it will work .
" hopefully it will also encourage people to buy reusable bags for when they visit the supermarkets . "
he said he hoped the campaign would shortly be extended to the nearby village of maenclochog , which also has two shops as well as two garages .
earlier this year a bbc wales initiative called if i ruled wales invited people to submit ideas they wanted to be brought in as a law .
banning plastic bags was one of three ideas shortlisted and was backed by more than half the 500 people who then voted for their favourite .
to have a chance of becoming law the proposal will first go before the new assembly petitions committee , which will decide where it goes for further discussion at cardiff bay .
