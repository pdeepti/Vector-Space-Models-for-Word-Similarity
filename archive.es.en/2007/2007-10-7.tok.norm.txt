müntefering drew up the law to increase the retirement age and helped devise schröder 's welfare changes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 07.10.2007 merkel ally backsliding on unpopular labor market reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some spd members want to reconfigure the unpopular package of welfare reforms germany 's social democrats , junior partners in merkel 's grand coalition , are split over reversing painful reforms introduced by former chancellor schröder which aimed to boost incentives to work by capping benefits . in a move that has caused alarm among reformists and economists in germany , kurt beck , chairman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has said he plans to throw his weight behind a drive to let older unemployed people draw jobless benefits for a longer time . the spd is the junior partner in angela merkel 's christian democrat-led grand coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beck has sparked a heated debate in his party with his proposals the move , which would amount to rolling back a key labor-market change introduced under former chancellor schröder , will mean extending unemployment benefits to 24 months for those over 50 years old and to 18 months for jobseekers older than 45 .
schröder had these cut from 32 months to 12 months . during this time , jobseekers are entitled to up 67 percent of their last salary , after which they become eligible for a flat-rate benefit of about 350 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- a month . campaign for social justice or clever ploy ? wolfgang thierse , vice president of the german parliament and a spd member , said there was " huge support " for beck 's proposals in the spd . " the expectation that there are enough jobs for older people simply has n't been fulfilled , " thierse said . hubertus heil , general secretary of the spd insisted that the changes did not mean the party was turning its back on the structural reforms started by schröder . " it 's about showing respect for the work of people who have become unemployed and who today , find it as difficult as ever to find work again , " heil wrote in a newspaper article . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of germans protested against former chancellor schröder 's reforms when they were introduced such a signal would raise acceptance for reforms because it would correspond to the sense of justice felt by the overwhelming majority of the population , heil wrote . a similar attempt is underway in some quarters of the spd to water down pension changes and review a law that raises the retirement age to 67 from 65 .
the pension law designed by merkel was approved by parliament earlier this year and is designed to stem further rises in pension contributions shared between companies and workers . the spd is expected to discuss the divisive topics at a party conference later this month . beck 's tactics are widely interpreted as an attempt to spur plummeting popularity ratings for his party and to appeal to disillusioned voters driven into the arms of a new opposition alliance of left-wing parties campaigning for more " social justice . " recent opinion polls show almost three-quarters of germans favor higher jobless benefits . " progress requires a step forward " though beck 's proposals have met with approval in parts of his own party as well as merkel 's conservatives , they are fiercely opposed by some as backsliding on crucial domestic reforms . franz müntefering , labor minister and vice-chancellor and a member of the spd is one of the strongest critics of tweaking agenda 2010 , the package of far-reaching labor-market and social reforms introduced by schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering has criticized his party 's drift to the left " i recommend my party to stick to the course , " he said , criticizing the leftward drift of his party . the spd should not try to lessen the pace of reforms , he said .
müntefering drew up the law to increase the retirement age and helped devise schröder 's welfare changes . " progress requires a step forward , not backwards , " he said . the issue has also sparked alarm among economists and business groups who fear that a rollback of key structural reforms could put a dent in germany 's resurgent economy .

beck is torpedoing the upward trend of getting work among those above 55 , " jutta allmendinger , a labor market expert and head of the wzb social science research center in berlin told german newspaper der tagesspiegel . wolfgang clement , economics minister under schröder and one of the architects of his structural reform program said undoing the labor-market reform would undermine efforts to raise the retirement age and destroy incentives for jobseekers to accept lower-paid jobs .

anything goes at the annual eurovision song contest - or not , as it happens .
the eastern europeans have been altogether too successful in recent years .
now the rules are being changed to smash their long-term reign . back in the good ol ' days , what you saw was what you got at the annual eurovision song contest .
but since the 21st century dawned , the event has been dominated by eastern europe - from estonia in 2001 to latvia in 2002 , ukraine in 2004 , through to serbia in 2007 . according to the conspiracy theorists , the whole thing is rigged .
the eastern europeans call in to vote for one another , they say , in a concerted effort to ostracize the west . old europe is sulking , and it does n't help that countries such as germany , france , spain and britain are those who foot the lion 's share of the event 's bill .
the whining reached unprecedented heights after the last contest , which saw marija serifovic from serbia sing her way to victory in helsinki .
moreover , eight of the top 10 were from eastern nations . a number of defeated countries , who shall remain nameless though they also have their own voting peculiarities , subsequently wasted no time calling on their broadcasters to boycott the event . the rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain does n't do well , desite picking up much of the tab although the controversies do nothing to detract from the contest 's popularity , with over 100 million tv viewers turning in for the annual schmaltz fest , fair play is apparently still a consideration . german public broadcaster ndr , which represents germany in the contest committee , this week said on its web site that the 42 participating countries have now agreed on new rules for the final in belgrade next may . according to the new guidelines , automatic entry to the final for the 10 best-placed nations of the previous year - usually eastern europeans - is to be abolished , excepting the first-place winner and , as before , the four big nations . in next year 's semi-finals , the first nine spots in each semi-final will be chosen by phone .
moreover , this year 's semi-final , two days before the final , is to be replaced next year by two semi-finals . a panel of judges will pick the 24th and last entrant to the final . " it 's an attempt to get a more balanced array in the final , " said manfred witt , the ndr official on the song contest committee . in a reference to last year 's debacle , witt said he hoped the former soviet and yugoslav republics would be scattered between the two semi-finals so that the shared tastes of those two blocs ' viewers no longer weighted the voting . who says politics and music do n't mix ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia has friends , but it also has enemies the eurovision is as famous for its highly charged voting system as it is for its music .
it can be hard to ignore the obvious political alliances dictating who gets " douze points " and who gets " nul . " the contest has long been perceived as a political institution , where judges and televoters award points based first and foremost on political affiliations . while greece likes to awards the maximum to cyprus , for example , turkey gives it the cold-shoulder .
but more to the point , countries such as estonia and latvia can always rely on their former soviet bloc neighbors - explaining the results of recent years . but now the goal posts have been moved , and it 's up to the music .

anything goes at the annual eurovision song contest - or not , as it happens .
the eastern europeans have been altogether too successful in recent years .
now the rules are being changed to smash their long-term reign . back in the good ol ' days , what you saw was what you got at the annual eurovision song contest .
but since the 21st century dawned , the event has been dominated by eastern europe - from estonia in 2001 to latvia in 2002 , ukraine in 2004 , through to serbia in 2007 . according to the conspiracy theorists , the whole thing is rigged .
the eastern europeans call in to vote for one another , they say , in a concerted effort to ostracize the west . old europe is sulking , and it does n't help that countries such as germany , france , spain and britain are those who foot the lion 's share of the event 's bill .
the whining reached unprecedented heights after the last contest , which saw marija serifovic from serbia sing her way to victory in helsinki .
moreover , eight of the top 10 were from eastern nations . a number of defeated countries , who shall remain nameless though they also have their own voting peculiarities , subsequently wasted no time calling on their broadcasters to boycott the event . the rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain does n't do well , desite picking up much of the tab although the controversies do nothing to detract from the contest 's popularity , with over 100 million tv viewers turning in for the annual schmaltz fest , fair play is apparently still a consideration . german public broadcaster ndr , which represents germany in the contest committee , this week said on its web site that the 42 participating countries have now agreed on new rules for the final in belgrade next may . according to the new guidelines , automatic entry to the final for the 10 best-placed nations of the previous year - usually eastern europeans - is to be abolished , excepting the first-place winner and , as before , the four big nations . in next year 's semi-finals , the first nine spots in each semi-final will be chosen by phone .
moreover , this year 's semi-final , two days before the final , is to be replaced next year by two semi-finals . a panel of judges will pick the 24th and last entrant to the final . " it 's an attempt to get a more balanced array in the final , " said manfred witt , the ndr official on the song contest committee . in a reference to last year 's debacle , witt said he hoped the former soviet and yugoslav republics would be scattered between the two semi-finals so that the shared tastes of those two blocs ' viewers no longer weighted the voting . who says politics and music do n't mix ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia has friends , but it also has enemies the eurovision is as famous for its highly charged voting system as it is for its music .
it can be hard to ignore the obvious political alliances dictating who gets " douze points " and who gets " nul . " the contest has long been perceived as a political institution , where judges and televoters award points based first and foremost on political affiliations . while greece likes to awards the maximum to cyprus , for example , turkey gives it the cold-shoulder .
but more to the point , countries such as estonia and latvia can always rely on their former soviet bloc neighbors - explaining the results of recent years . but now the goal posts have been moved , and it 's up to the music .
in 2008 , may the best band win . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de it happened once on the road to eurovision heaven it happened 25 years ago , germany won the eurovision song contest , which is why springtime is such a melancholy season for german music fans .
it evokes memories of a singular triumph and a tradition of failure .
-lrb- 24.04.2007 -rrb- nationalists , russia find ukraine 's eurovision song quite a drag ukraine 's eurovision song contest entry is causing friction at home and abroad .
verka serduchka is accused by nationalists of enforcing negative ukrainian stereotypes while the russians see her song as a political snub .

the failure to solve her murder shows that the country is still far from being a democracy with an independent judiciary , says dw 's cornelia rabitz . she denounced corruption and abuse of power .
she relentlessly reported on murders , kidnappings and torture in chechnya .
she was tough on kremlin politics .
she never shied away from personal risks .
she was incorruptible , investigative , courageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz anna politkovskaya unsettled and disturbed people .
through her reporting , she made friends and gained respect and recognition , but she also made bitter enemies .
she 's become a role model for all those who see journalism as having moral , democratic and educational qualities .
she became an enemy figure for all the people she criticized .
anna politkovskaya was murdered a year ago on oct .
7 and became a victim of her profession and her moral-political self-image .
no one knows to this day who was behind the murder , who commissioned it , and who fired the fatal shots in the end .
only few in putin 's empire were courageous enough to support the journalist during her lifetime .
only few really showed any interest in her work .
too few .
soon after the murder , the russian president - during a visit to germany , by the way - said that politkovskaya was an insignificant person without any influence .
still , she had obviously become a thorn in the side of official russia .
even if no one can prove an immediate complicity of the political leadership and especially vladimir putin himself - the murder of the incorruptible anna politkovskaya was only possible in an atmosphere of utter contempt for democratic principles , for fairness and open societal debates .
a critical journalist must prove prickly in an environment where democracy has degenerated into a superficial spectacle , where free media , parties and institutions are nothing but set design for the scheming of secret services and the intrigues of insular , elite circles .
on top of it all , her political enemies were additionally angered by the fact that her international reputation kept prompting the west to criticize russia .
that 's why today , one year later , the murder of the upright journalist still has a huge symbolic power .
it was an attack on basic democratic rights .
it was probably a decisive slap in the face of already curtailed freedoms of press and opinion .
it unveiled russia 's ugly side .
the fact that there 's still no real breakthrough in the investigation , but rather a hopeless mess of extenuations , spectacular arrests , judicial mistakes and dropped indictments shows only one thing : russia still has to prove that it is a democracy with an independent judiciary .

the failure to solve her murder shows that the country is still far from being a democracy with an independent judiciary , says dw 's cornelia rabitz . she denounced corruption and abuse of power .
she relentlessly reported on murders , kidnappings and torture in chechnya .
she was tough on kremlin politics .
she never shied away from personal risks .
she was incorruptible , investigative , courageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz anna politkovskaya unsettled and disturbed people .
through her reporting , she made friends and gained respect and recognition , but she also made bitter enemies .
she 's become a role model for all those who see journalism as having moral , democratic and educational qualities .
she became an enemy figure for all the people she criticized .
anna politkovskaya was murdered a year ago on oct .
7 and became a victim of her profession and her moral-political self-image .
no one knows to this day who was behind the murder , who commissioned it , and who fired the fatal shots in the end .
only few in putin 's empire were courageous enough to support the journalist during her lifetime .
only few really showed any interest in her work .
too few .
soon after the murder , the russian president - during a visit to germany , by the way - said that politkovskaya was an insignificant person without any influence .
still , she had obviously become a thorn in the side of official russia .
even if no one can prove an immediate complicity of the political leadership and especially vladimir putin himself - the murder of the incorruptible anna politkovskaya was only possible in an atmosphere of utter contempt for democratic principles , for fairness and open societal debates .
a critical journalist must prove prickly in an environment where democracy has degenerated into a superficial spectacle , where free media , parties and institutions are nothing but set design for the scheming of secret services and the intrigues of insular , elite circles .
on top of it all , her political enemies were additionally angered by the fact that her international reputation kept prompting the west to criticize russia .
that 's why today , one year later , the murder of the upright journalist still has a huge symbolic power .
it was an attack on basic democratic rights .
it was probably a decisive slap in the face of already curtailed freedoms of press and opinion .
it unveiled russia 's ugly side .
the fact that there 's still no real breakthrough in the investigation , but rather a hopeless mess of extenuations , spectacular arrests , judicial mistakes and dropped indictments shows only one thing : russia still has to prove that it is a democracy with an independent judiciary .

anything goes at the annual eurovision song contest - or not , as it happens .
the eastern europeans have been altogether too successful in recent years .
now the rules are being changed to smash their long-term reign . back in the good ol ' days , what you saw was what you got at the annual eurovision song contest .
but since the 21st century dawned , the event has been dominated by eastern europe - from estonia in 2001 to latvia in 2002 , ukraine in 2004 , through to serbia in 2007 . according to the conspiracy theorists , the whole thing is rigged .
the eastern europeans call in to vote for one another , they say , in a concerted effort to ostracize the west . old europe is sulking , and it does n't help that countries such as germany , france , spain and britain are those who foot the lion 's share of the event 's bill .
the whining reached unprecedented heights after the last contest , which saw marija serifovic from serbia sing her way to victory in helsinki .
moreover , eight of the top 10 were from eastern nations . a number of defeated countries , who shall remain nameless though they also have their own voting peculiarities , subsequently wasted no time calling on their broadcasters to boycott the event . the rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain does n't do well , desite picking up much of the tab although the controversies do nothing to detract from the contest 's popularity , with over 100 million tv viewers turning in for the annual schmaltz fest , fair play is apparently still a consideration . german public broadcaster ndr , which represents germany in the contest committee , this week said on its web site that the 42 participating countries have now agreed on new rules for the final in belgrade next may . according to the new guidelines , automatic entry to the final for the 10 best-placed nations of the previous year - usually eastern europeans - is to be abolished , excepting the first-place winner and , as before , the four big nations . in next year 's semi-finals , the first nine spots in each semi-final will be chosen by phone .
moreover , this year 's semi-final , two days before the final , is to be replaced next year by two semi-finals . a panel of judges will pick the 24th and last entrant to the final . " it 's an attempt to get a more balanced array in the final , " said manfred witt , the ndr official on the song contest committee . in a reference to last year 's debacle , witt said he hoped the former soviet and yugoslav republics would be scattered between the two semi-finals so that the shared tastes of those two blocs ' viewers no longer weighted the voting . who says politics and music do n't mix ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia has friends , but it also has enemies the eurovision is as famous for its highly charged voting system as it is for its music .
it can be hard to ignore the obvious political alliances dictating who gets " douze points " and who gets " nul . " the contest has long been perceived as a political institution , where judges and televoters award points based first and foremost on political affiliations . while greece likes to awards the maximum to cyprus , for example , turkey gives it the cold-shoulder .
but more to the point , countries such as estonia and latvia can always rely on their former soviet bloc neighbors - explaining the results of recent years . but now the goal posts have been moved , and it 's up to the music .

the failure to solve her murder shows that the country is still far from being a democracy with an independent judiciary , says dw 's cornelia rabitz . she denounced corruption and abuse of power .
she relentlessly reported on murders , kidnappings and torture in chechnya .
she was tough on kremlin politics .
she never shied away from personal risks .
she was incorruptible , investigative , courageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz anna politkovskaya unsettled and disturbed people .
through her reporting , she made friends and gained respect and recognition , but she also made bitter enemies .
she 's become a role model for all those who see journalism as having moral , democratic and educational qualities .
she became an enemy figure for all the people she criticized .
anna politkovskaya was murdered a year ago on oct .
7 and became a victim of her profession and her moral-political self-image .
no one knows to this day who was behind the murder , who commissioned it , and who fired the fatal shots in the end .
only few in putin 's empire were courageous enough to support the journalist during her lifetime .
only few really showed any interest in her work .
too few .
soon after the murder , the russian president - during a visit to germany , by the way - said that politkovskaya was an insignificant person without any influence .
still , she had obviously become a thorn in the side of official russia .
even if no one can prove an immediate complicity of the political leadership and especially vladimir putin himself - the murder of the incorruptible anna politkovskaya was only possible in an atmosphere of utter contempt for democratic principles , for fairness and open societal debates .
a critical journalist must prove prickly in an environment where democracy has degenerated into a superficial spectacle , where free media , parties and institutions are nothing but set design for the scheming of secret services and the intrigues of insular , elite circles .
on top of it all , her political enemies were additionally angered by the fact that her international reputation kept prompting the west to criticize russia .
that 's why today , one year later , the murder of the upright journalist still has a huge symbolic power .
it was an attack on basic democratic rights .
it was probably a decisive slap in the face of already curtailed freedoms of press and opinion .
it unveiled russia 's ugly side .
the fact that there 's still no real breakthrough in the investigation , but rather a hopeless mess of extenuations , spectacular arrests , judicial mistakes and dropped indictments shows only one thing : russia still has to prove that it is a democracy with an independent judiciary .

anything goes at the annual eurovision song contest - or not , as it happens .
the eastern europeans have been altogether too successful in recent years .
now the rules are being changed to smash their long-term reign . back in the good ol ' days , what you saw was what you got at the annual eurovision song contest .
but since the 21st century dawned , the event has been dominated by eastern europe - from estonia in 2001 to latvia in 2002 , ukraine in 2004 , through to serbia in 2007 . according to the conspiracy theorists , the whole thing is rigged .
the eastern europeans call in to vote for one another , they say , in a concerted effort to ostracize the west . old europe is sulking , and it does n't help that countries such as germany , france , spain and britain are those who foot the lion 's share of the event 's bill .
the whining reached unprecedented heights after the last contest , which saw marija serifovic from serbia sing her way to victory in helsinki .
moreover , eight of the top 10 were from eastern nations . a number of defeated countries , who shall remain nameless though they also have their own voting peculiarities , subsequently wasted no time calling on their broadcasters to boycott the event . the rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain does n't do well , desite picking up much of the tab although the controversies do nothing to detract from the contest 's popularity , with over 100 million tv viewers turning in for the annual schmaltz fest , fair play is apparently still a consideration . german public broadcaster ndr , which represents germany in the contest committee , this week said on its web site that the 42 participating countries have now agreed on new rules for the final in belgrade next may . according to the new guidelines , automatic entry to the final for the 10 best-placed nations of the previous year - usually eastern europeans - is to be abolished , excepting the first-place winner and , as before , the four big nations . in next year 's semi-finals , the first nine spots in each semi-final will be chosen by phone .
moreover , this year 's semi-final , two days before the final , is to be replaced next year by two semi-finals . a panel of judges will pick the 24th and last entrant to the final . " it 's an attempt to get a more balanced array in the final , " said manfred witt , the ndr official on the song contest committee . in a reference to last year 's debacle , witt said he hoped the former soviet and yugoslav republics would be scattered between the two semi-finals so that the shared tastes of those two blocs ' viewers no longer weighted the voting . who says politics and music do n't mix ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia has friends , but it also has enemies the eurovision is as famous for its highly charged voting system as it is for its music .
it can be hard to ignore the obvious political alliances dictating who gets " douze points " and who gets " nul . " the contest has long been perceived as a political institution , where judges and televoters award points based first and foremost on political affiliations . while greece likes to awards the maximum to cyprus , for example , turkey gives it the cold-shoulder .
but more to the point , countries such as estonia and latvia can always rely on their former soviet bloc neighbors - explaining the results of recent years . but now the goal posts have been moved , and it 's up to the music .
in 2008 , may the best band win . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 07.10.2007 opinion : an attack on basic democratic rights in russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian journalist anna politkovskaya was shot one year ago .
the failure to solve her murder shows that the country is still far from being a democracy with an independent judiciary , says dw 's cornelia rabitz . she denounced corruption and abuse of power .
she relentlessly reported on murders , kidnappings and torture in chechnya .
she was tough on kremlin politics .
she never shied away from personal risks .
she was incorruptible , investigative , courageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz anna politkovskaya unsettled and disturbed people .
through her reporting , she made friends and gained respect and recognition , but she also made bitter enemies .
she 's become a role model for all those who see journalism as having moral , democratic and educational qualities .
she became an enemy figure for all the people she criticized .
anna politkovskaya was murdered a year ago on oct .
7 and became a victim of her profession and her moral-political self-image .
no one knows to this day who was behind the murder , who commissioned it , and who fired the fatal shots in the end .
only few in putin 's empire were courageous enough to support the journalist during her lifetime .
only few really showed any interest in her work .
too few .
soon after the murder , the russian president - during a visit to germany , by the way - said that politkovskaya was an insignificant person without any influence .
still , she had obviously become a thorn in the side of official russia .
even if no one can prove an immediate complicity of the political leadership and especially vladimir putin himself - the murder of the incorruptible anna politkovskaya was only possible in an atmosphere of utter contempt for democratic principles , for fairness and open societal debates .
a critical journalist must prove prickly in an environment where democracy has degenerated into a superficial spectacle , where free media , parties and institutions are nothing but set design for the scheming of secret services and the intrigues of insular , elite circles .
on top of it all , her political enemies were additionally angered by the fact that her international reputation kept prompting the west to criticize russia .
that 's why today , one year later , the murder of the upright journalist still has a huge symbolic power .
it was an attack on basic democratic rights .
it was probably a decisive slap in the face of already curtailed freedoms of press and opinion .
it unveiled russia 's ugly side .
the fact that there 's still no real breakthrough in the investigation , but rather a hopeless mess of extenuations , spectacular arrests , judicial mistakes and dropped indictments shows only one thing : russia still has to prove that it is a democracy with an independent judiciary .

schröder had these cut from 32 months to 12 months . during this time , jobseekers are entitled to up 67 percent of their last salary , after which they become eligible for a flat-rate benefit of about 350 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- a month . campaign for social justice or clever ploy ? wolfgang thierse , vice president of the german parliament and a spd member , said there was " huge support " for beck 's proposals in the spd . " the expectation that there are enough jobs for older people simply has n't been fulfilled , " thierse said . hubertus heil , general secretary of the spd insisted that the changes did not mean the party was turning its back on the structural reforms started by schröder . " it 's about showing respect for the work of people who have become unemployed and who today , find it as difficult as ever to find work again , " heil wrote in a newspaper article . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of germans protested against former chancellor schröder 's reforms when they were introduced such a signal would raise acceptance for reforms because it would correspond to the sense of justice felt by the overwhelming majority of the population , heil wrote . a similar attempt is underway in some quarters of the spd to water down pension changes and review a law that raises the retirement age to 67 from 65 .
the pension law designed by merkel was approved by parliament earlier this year and is designed to stem further rises in pension contributions shared between companies and workers . the spd is expected to discuss the divisive topics at a party conference later this month . beck 's tactics are widely interpreted as an attempt to spur plummeting popularity ratings for his party and to appeal to disillusioned voters driven into the arms of a new opposition alliance of left-wing parties campaigning for more " social justice . " recent opinion polls show almost three-quarters of germans favor higher jobless benefits . " progress requires a step forward " though beck 's proposals have met with approval in parts of his own party as well as merkel 's conservatives , they are fiercely opposed by some as backsliding on crucial domestic reforms . franz müntefering , labor minister and vice-chancellor and a member of the spd is one of the strongest critics of tweaking agenda 2010 , the package of far-reaching labor-market and social reforms introduced by schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering has criticized his party 's drift to the left " i recommend my party to stick to the course , " he said , criticizing the leftward drift of his party . the spd should not try to lessen the pace of reforms , he said .
müntefering drew up the law to increase the retirement age and helped devise schröder 's welfare changes . " progress requires a step forward , not backwards , " he said . the issue has also sparked alarm among economists and business groups who fear that a rollback of key structural reforms could put a dent in germany 's resurgent economy .

the failure to solve her murder shows that the country is still far from being a democracy with an independent judiciary , says dw 's cornelia rabitz . she denounced corruption and abuse of power .
she relentlessly reported on murders , kidnappings and torture in chechnya .
she was tough on kremlin politics .
she never shied away from personal risks .
she was incorruptible , investigative , courageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz anna politkovskaya unsettled and disturbed people .
through her reporting , she made friends and gained respect and recognition , but she also made bitter enemies .
she 's become a role model for all those who see journalism as having moral , democratic and educational qualities .
she became an enemy figure for all the people she criticized .
anna politkovskaya was murdered a year ago on oct .
7 and became a victim of her profession and her moral-political self-image .
no one knows to this day who was behind the murder , who commissioned it , and who fired the fatal shots in the end .
only few in putin 's empire were courageous enough to support the journalist during her lifetime .
only few really showed any interest in her work .
too few .
soon after the murder , the russian president - during a visit to germany , by the way - said that politkovskaya was an insignificant person without any influence .
still , she had obviously become a thorn in the side of official russia .
even if no one can prove an immediate complicity of the political leadership and especially vladimir putin himself - the murder of the incorruptible anna politkovskaya was only possible in an atmosphere of utter contempt for democratic principles , for fairness and open societal debates .
a critical journalist must prove prickly in an environment where democracy has degenerated into a superficial spectacle , where free media , parties and institutions are nothing but set design for the scheming of secret services and the intrigues of insular , elite circles .
on top of it all , her political enemies were additionally angered by the fact that her international reputation kept prompting the west to criticize russia .
that 's why today , one year later , the murder of the upright journalist still has a huge symbolic power .
it was an attack on basic democratic rights .
it was probably a decisive slap in the face of already curtailed freedoms of press and opinion .
it unveiled russia 's ugly side .
the fact that there 's still no real breakthrough in the investigation , but rather a hopeless mess of extenuations , spectacular arrests , judicial mistakes and dropped indictments shows only one thing : russia still has to prove that it is a democracy with an independent judiciary .

anything goes at the annual eurovision song contest - or not , as it happens .
the eastern europeans have been altogether too successful in recent years .
now the rules are being changed to smash their long-term reign . back in the good ol ' days , what you saw was what you got at the annual eurovision song contest .
but since the 21st century dawned , the event has been dominated by eastern europe - from estonia in 2001 to latvia in 2002 , ukraine in 2004 , through to serbia in 2007 . according to the conspiracy theorists , the whole thing is rigged .
the eastern europeans call in to vote for one another , they say , in a concerted effort to ostracize the west . old europe is sulking , and it does n't help that countries such as germany , france , spain and britain are those who foot the lion 's share of the event 's bill .
the whining reached unprecedented heights after the last contest , which saw marija serifovic from serbia sing her way to victory in helsinki .
moreover , eight of the top 10 were from eastern nations . a number of defeated countries , who shall remain nameless though they also have their own voting peculiarities , subsequently wasted no time calling on their broadcasters to boycott the event . the rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain does n't do well , desite picking up much of the tab although the controversies do nothing to detract from the contest 's popularity , with over 100 million tv viewers turning in for the annual schmaltz fest , fair play is apparently still a consideration . german public broadcaster ndr , which represents germany in the contest committee , this week said on its web site that the 42 participating countries have now agreed on new rules for the final in belgrade next may . according to the new guidelines , automatic entry to the final for the 10 best-placed nations of the previous year - usually eastern europeans - is to be abolished , excepting the first-place winner and , as before , the four big nations . in next year 's semi-finals , the first nine spots in each semi-final will be chosen by phone .
moreover , this year 's semi-final , two days before the final , is to be replaced next year by two semi-finals . a panel of judges will pick the 24th and last entrant to the final . " it 's an attempt to get a more balanced array in the final , " said manfred witt , the ndr official on the song contest committee . in a reference to last year 's debacle , witt said he hoped the former soviet and yugoslav republics would be scattered between the two semi-finals so that the shared tastes of those two blocs ' viewers no longer weighted the voting . who says politics and music do n't mix ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia has friends , but it also has enemies the eurovision is as famous for its highly charged voting system as it is for its music .
it can be hard to ignore the obvious political alliances dictating who gets " douze points " and who gets " nul . " the contest has long been perceived as a political institution , where judges and televoters award points based first and foremost on political affiliations . while greece likes to awards the maximum to cyprus , for example , turkey gives it the cold-shoulder .
but more to the point , countries such as estonia and latvia can always rely on their former soviet bloc neighbors - explaining the results of recent years . but now the goal posts have been moved , and it 's up to the music .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 07.10.2007 eurovision rewrites the rule book großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the best song win - or is the voting biased ?
anything goes at the annual eurovision song contest - or not , as it happens .
the eastern europeans have been altogether too successful in recent years .
now the rules are being changed to smash their long-term reign . back in the good ol ' days , what you saw was what you got at the annual eurovision song contest .
but since the 21st century dawned , the event has been dominated by eastern europe - from estonia in 2001 to latvia in 2002 , ukraine in 2004 , through to serbia in 2007 . according to the conspiracy theorists , the whole thing is rigged .
the eastern europeans call in to vote for one another , they say , in a concerted effort to ostracize the west . old europe is sulking , and it does n't help that countries such as germany , france , spain and britain are those who foot the lion 's share of the event 's bill .
the whining reached unprecedented heights after the last contest , which saw marija serifovic from serbia sing her way to victory in helsinki .
moreover , eight of the top 10 were from eastern nations . a number of defeated countries , who shall remain nameless though they also have their own voting peculiarities , subsequently wasted no time calling on their broadcasters to boycott the event . the rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain does n't do well , desite picking up much of the tab although the controversies do nothing to detract from the contest 's popularity , with over 100 million tv viewers turning in for the annual schmaltz fest , fair play is apparently still a consideration . german public broadcaster ndr , which represents germany in the contest committee , this week said on its web site that the 42 participating countries have now agreed on new rules for the final in belgrade next may . according to the new guidelines , automatic entry to the final for the 10 best-placed nations of the previous year - usually eastern europeans - is to be abolished , excepting the first-place winner and , as before , the four big nations . in next year 's semi-finals , the first nine spots in each semi-final will be chosen by phone .
moreover , this year 's semi-final , two days before the final , is to be replaced next year by two semi-finals . a panel of judges will pick the 24th and last entrant to the final . " it 's an attempt to get a more balanced array in the final , " said manfred witt , the ndr official on the song contest committee . in a reference to last year 's debacle , witt said he hoped the former soviet and yugoslav republics would be scattered between the two semi-finals so that the shared tastes of those two blocs ' viewers no longer weighted the voting . who says politics and music do n't mix ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia has friends , but it also has enemies the eurovision is as famous for its highly charged voting system as it is for its music .
it can be hard to ignore the obvious political alliances dictating who gets " douze points " and who gets " nul . " the contest has long been perceived as a political institution , where judges and televoters award points based first and foremost on political affiliations . while greece likes to awards the maximum to cyprus , for example , turkey gives it the cold-shoulder .
but more to the point , countries such as estonia and latvia can always rely on their former soviet bloc neighbors - explaining the results of recent years . but now the goal posts have been moved , and it 's up to the music .
in 2008 , may the best band win . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

anything goes at the annual eurovision song contest - or not , as it happens .
the eastern europeans have been altogether too successful in recent years .
now the rules are being changed to smash their long-term reign . back in the good ol ' days , what you saw was what you got at the annual eurovision song contest .
but since the 21st century dawned , the event has been dominated by eastern europe - from estonia in 2001 to latvia in 2002 , ukraine in 2004 , through to serbia in 2007 . according to the conspiracy theorists , the whole thing is rigged .
the eastern europeans call in to vote for one another , they say , in a concerted effort to ostracize the west . old europe is sulking , and it does n't help that countries such as germany , france , spain and britain are those who foot the lion 's share of the event 's bill .
the whining reached unprecedented heights after the last contest , which saw marija serifovic from serbia sing her way to victory in helsinki .
moreover , eight of the top 10 were from eastern nations . a number of defeated countries , who shall remain nameless though they also have their own voting peculiarities , subsequently wasted no time calling on their broadcasters to boycott the event . the rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain does n't do well , desite picking up much of the tab although the controversies do nothing to detract from the contest 's popularity , with over 100 million tv viewers turning in for the annual schmaltz fest , fair play is apparently still a consideration . german public broadcaster ndr , which represents germany in the contest committee , this week said on its web site that the 42 participating countries have now agreed on new rules for the final in belgrade next may . according to the new guidelines , automatic entry to the final for the 10 best-placed nations of the previous year - usually eastern europeans - is to be abolished , excepting the first-place winner and , as before , the four big nations . in next year 's semi-finals , the first nine spots in each semi-final will be chosen by phone .
moreover , this year 's semi-final , two days before the final , is to be replaced next year by two semi-finals . a panel of judges will pick the 24th and last entrant to the final . " it 's an attempt to get a more balanced array in the final , " said manfred witt , the ndr official on the song contest committee . in a reference to last year 's debacle , witt said he hoped the former soviet and yugoslav republics would be scattered between the two semi-finals so that the shared tastes of those two blocs ' viewers no longer weighted the voting . who says politics and music do n't mix ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia has friends , but it also has enemies the eurovision is as famous for its highly charged voting system as it is for its music .
it can be hard to ignore the obvious political alliances dictating who gets " douze points " and who gets " nul . " the contest has long been perceived as a political institution , where judges and televoters award points based first and foremost on political affiliations . while greece likes to awards the maximum to cyprus , for example , turkey gives it the cold-shoulder .
but more to the point , countries such as estonia and latvia can always rely on their former soviet bloc neighbors - explaining the results of recent years . but now the goal posts have been moved , and it 's up to the music .
in 2008 , may the best band win . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 07.10.2007 eu says turkey must improve freedom of speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has inched closer to the eu but still needs to pass a key reform brussels has stepped up pressure on eu candidate turkey to speed up its reform process and in particular move ahead with laws ensuring freedoms of religion and expression . four weeks before the eu commission issues a progress report on turkey , eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn called on recently-elected turkish president abdullah gül to keep his country firmly on the reform track . " i expect that he -lrb- gül -rrb- leads the transformation process and ensures that fundamental freedoms exist in all aspects of life and in all corners of turkey , " rehn told german newspaper bild am sonntag on sunday , oct .
7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn wants turkey to step up the pace of its reform drive he assured ankara that the eu 's upcoming progress report on turkey would be " fair and balanced . " turkey implemented several reforms to win the green light for eu accession talks in october 2005 .
the country has said it remains fully committed to joining the european union . but the country 's eu bid has been marred by ankara 's refusal last year to grant trade privileges to cyprus as well as flagging efforts to push laws guaranteeing freedom of expression . the latter is expected to take center stage in november 's eu progress report with little sign that turkey is pursuing an amendment or withdrawal of article 301 , which can be used to prosecute writers for " insulting turkishness . " prosecution of writers " not acceptable " " it is a human and moral issue .
it is not acceptable that writers like orhan pamuk and elif safak are prosecuted based on this article , " rehn told turkish television station , ntvmsnbc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried for speaking about the armenian massacre before the case against him was dropped , pamuk was tried in turkey last year for telling a swiss newspaper that 1 million armenians had died in turkey during world war one and 30,000 kurds had died in recent decades . critics of the controversial article also say that turkish armenian editor and journalist hrant dink was murdered last year after being singled out because of his prosecution under the law . recent efforts by turkey 's ruling party to change the country 's constitution also should not delay reforms in expanding freedoms of expression and religion , rehn added . " the changes -lrb- to the constitution -rrb- can be a method for expanding fundamental rights and freedoms .
but the preparations should not delay the realization of freedoms of expression or religion , " he said . turkey 's prime minister tayyip erdogan has previously said the constitution will strengthen individual rights and freedoms , but turkish officials say article 301 will not be revised or overwritten in the new document . brussels softening stance towards turkey ? despite turkey 's faltering reform drive last year , there are signs that brussels is softening its attitude towards the large eu candidate and its new political leadership . this week , a draft resolution on turkey 's reform process was passed in the european parliament without much criticism . last week , eu parliamentarians were also confronted with a study released by the italian institute for international affairs and a turkish foundation which concluded that the debate over turkey 's eu membership was often marked by prejudices . since sept .
11 , 2001 , turkey has largely been perceived as a country influenced by islam , an attitude that has ignored the nation 's secular traditions , the study 's authors said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the failure to solve her murder shows that the country is still far from being a democracy with an independent judiciary , says dw 's cornelia rabitz . she denounced corruption and abuse of power .
she relentlessly reported on murders , kidnappings and torture in chechnya .
she was tough on kremlin politics .
she never shied away from personal risks .
she was incorruptible , investigative , courageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz anna politkovskaya unsettled and disturbed people .
through her reporting , she made friends and gained respect and recognition , but she also made bitter enemies .
she 's become a role model for all those who see journalism as having moral , democratic and educational qualities .
she became an enemy figure for all the people she criticized .
anna politkovskaya was murdered a year ago on oct .
7 and became a victim of her profession and her moral-political self-image .
no one knows to this day who was behind the murder , who commissioned it , and who fired the fatal shots in the end .
only few in putin 's empire were courageous enough to support the journalist during her lifetime .
only few really showed any interest in her work .
too few .
soon after the murder , the russian president - during a visit to germany , by the way - said that politkovskaya was an insignificant person without any influence .
still , she had obviously become a thorn in the side of official russia .
even if no one can prove an immediate complicity of the political leadership and especially vladimir putin himself - the murder of the incorruptible anna politkovskaya was only possible in an atmosphere of utter contempt for democratic principles , for fairness and open societal debates .
a critical journalist must prove prickly in an environment where democracy has degenerated into a superficial spectacle , where free media , parties and institutions are nothing but set design for the scheming of secret services and the intrigues of insular , elite circles .
on top of it all , her political enemies were additionally angered by the fact that her international reputation kept prompting the west to criticize russia .
that 's why today , one year later , the murder of the upright journalist still has a huge symbolic power .
it was an attack on basic democratic rights .
it was probably a decisive slap in the face of already curtailed freedoms of press and opinion .
it unveiled russia 's ugly side .
the fact that there 's still no real breakthrough in the investigation , but rather a hopeless mess of extenuations , spectacular arrests , judicial mistakes and dropped indictments shows only one thing : russia still has to prove that it is a democracy with an independent judiciary .

anything goes at the annual eurovision song contest - or not , as it happens .
the eastern europeans have been altogether too successful in recent years .
now the rules are being changed to smash their long-term reign . back in the good ol ' days , what you saw was what you got at the annual eurovision song contest .
but since the 21st century dawned , the event has been dominated by eastern europe - from estonia in 2001 to latvia in 2002 , ukraine in 2004 , through to serbia in 2007 . according to the conspiracy theorists , the whole thing is rigged .
the eastern europeans call in to vote for one another , they say , in a concerted effort to ostracize the west . old europe is sulking , and it does n't help that countries such as germany , france , spain and britain are those who foot the lion 's share of the event 's bill .
the whining reached unprecedented heights after the last contest , which saw marija serifovic from serbia sing her way to victory in helsinki .
moreover , eight of the top 10 were from eastern nations . a number of defeated countries , who shall remain nameless though they also have their own voting peculiarities , subsequently wasted no time calling on their broadcasters to boycott the event . the rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain does n't do well , desite picking up much of the tab although the controversies do nothing to detract from the contest 's popularity , with over 100 million tv viewers turning in for the annual schmaltz fest , fair play is apparently still a consideration . german public broadcaster ndr , which represents germany in the contest committee , this week said on its web site that the 42 participating countries have now agreed on new rules for the final in belgrade next may . according to the new guidelines , automatic entry to the final for the 10 best-placed nations of the previous year - usually eastern europeans - is to be abolished , excepting the first-place winner and , as before , the four big nations . in next year 's semi-finals , the first nine spots in each semi-final will be chosen by phone .
moreover , this year 's semi-final , two days before the final , is to be replaced next year by two semi-finals . a panel of judges will pick the 24th and last entrant to the final . " it 's an attempt to get a more balanced array in the final , " said manfred witt , the ndr official on the song contest committee . in a reference to last year 's debacle , witt said he hoped the former soviet and yugoslav republics would be scattered between the two semi-finals so that the shared tastes of those two blocs ' viewers no longer weighted the voting . who says politics and music do n't mix ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia has friends , but it also has enemies the eurovision is as famous for its highly charged voting system as it is for its music .
it can be hard to ignore the obvious political alliances dictating who gets " douze points " and who gets " nul . " the contest has long been perceived as a political institution , where judges and televoters award points based first and foremost on political affiliations . while greece likes to awards the maximum to cyprus , for example , turkey gives it the cold-shoulder .
but more to the point , countries such as estonia and latvia can always rely on their former soviet bloc neighbors - explaining the results of recent years . but now the goal posts have been moved , and it 's up to the music .

schröder had these cut from 32 months to 12 months . during this time , jobseekers are entitled to up 67 percent of their last salary , after which they become eligible for a flat-rate benefit of about 350 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- a month . campaign for social justice or clever ploy ? wolfgang thierse , vice president of the german parliament and a spd member , said there was " huge support " for beck 's proposals in the spd . " the expectation that there are enough jobs for older people simply has n't been fulfilled , " thierse said . hubertus heil , general secretary of the spd insisted that the changes did not mean the party was turning its back on the structural reforms started by schröder . " it 's about showing respect for the work of people who have become unemployed and who today , find it as difficult as ever to find work again , " heil wrote in a newspaper article . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of germans protested against former chancellor schröder 's reforms when they were introduced such a signal would raise acceptance for reforms because it would correspond to the sense of justice felt by the overwhelming majority of the population , heil wrote . a similar attempt is underway in some quarters of the spd to water down pension changes and review a law that raises the retirement age to 67 from 65 .
the pension law designed by merkel was approved by parliament earlier this year and is designed to stem further rises in pension contributions shared between companies and workers . the spd is expected to discuss the divisive topics at a party conference later this month . beck 's tactics are widely interpreted as an attempt to spur plummeting popularity ratings for his party and to appeal to disillusioned voters driven into the arms of a new opposition alliance of left-wing parties campaigning for more " social justice . " recent opinion polls show almost three-quarters of germans favor higher jobless benefits . " progress requires a step forward " though beck 's proposals have met with approval in parts of his own party as well as merkel 's conservatives , they are fiercely opposed by some as backsliding on crucial domestic reforms . franz müntefering , labor minister and vice-chancellor and a member of the spd is one of the strongest critics of tweaking agenda 2010 , the package of far-reaching labor-market and social reforms introduced by schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering has criticized his party 's drift to the left " i recommend my party to stick to the course , " he said , criticizing the leftward drift of his party . the spd should not try to lessen the pace of reforms , he said .
müntefering drew up the law to increase the retirement age and helped devise schröder 's welfare changes . " progress requires a step forward , not backwards , " he said . the issue has also sparked alarm among economists and business groups who fear that a rollback of key structural reforms could put a dent in germany 's resurgent economy . " the opposite of what we need " " it goes in the totally wrong direction .

schröder had these cut from 32 months to 12 months . during this time , jobseekers are entitled to up 67 percent of their last salary , after which they become eligible for a flat-rate benefit of about 350 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- a month . campaign for social justice or clever ploy ? wolfgang thierse , vice president of the german parliament and a spd member , said there was " huge support " for beck 's proposals in the spd . " the expectation that there are enough jobs for older people simply has n't been fulfilled , " thierse said . hubertus heil , general secretary of the spd insisted that the changes did not mean the party was turning its back on the structural reforms started by schröder . " it 's about showing respect for the work of people who have become unemployed and who today , find it as difficult as ever to find work again , " heil wrote in a newspaper article . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of germans protested against former chancellor schröder 's reforms when they were introduced such a signal would raise acceptance for reforms because it would correspond to the sense of justice felt by the overwhelming majority of the population , heil wrote . a similar attempt is underway in some quarters of the spd to water down pension changes and review a law that raises the retirement age to 67 from 65 .
the pension law designed by merkel was approved by parliament earlier this year and is designed to stem further rises in pension contributions shared between companies and workers . the spd is expected to discuss the divisive topics at a party conference later this month . beck 's tactics are widely interpreted as an attempt to spur plummeting popularity ratings for his party and to appeal to disillusioned voters driven into the arms of a new opposition alliance of left-wing parties campaigning for more " social justice . " recent opinion polls show almost three-quarters of germans favor higher jobless benefits . " progress requires a step forward " though beck 's proposals have met with approval in parts of his own party as well as merkel 's conservatives , they are fiercely opposed by some as backsliding on crucial domestic reforms . franz müntefering , labor minister and vice-chancellor and a member of the spd is one of the strongest critics of tweaking agenda 2010 , the package of far-reaching labor-market and social reforms introduced by schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering has criticized his party 's drift to the left " i recommend my party to stick to the course , " he said , criticizing the leftward drift of his party . the spd should not try to lessen the pace of reforms , he said .
müntefering drew up the law to increase the retirement age and helped devise schröder 's welfare changes . " progress requires a step forward , not backwards , " he said . the issue has also sparked alarm among economists and business groups who fear that a rollback of key structural reforms could put a dent in germany 's resurgent economy . " the opposite of what we need " " it goes in the totally wrong direction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 07.10.2007 eu says turkey must improve freedom of speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has inched closer to the eu but still needs to pass a key reform brussels has stepped up pressure on eu candidate turkey to speed up its reform process and in particular move ahead with laws ensuring freedoms of religion and expression . four weeks before the eu commission issues a progress report on turkey , eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn called on recently-elected turkish president abdullah gül to keep his country firmly on the reform track . " i expect that he -lrb- gül -rrb- leads the transformation process and ensures that fundamental freedoms exist in all aspects of life and in all corners of turkey , " rehn told german newspaper bild am sonntag on sunday , oct .
7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn wants turkey to step up the pace of its reform drive he assured ankara that the eu 's upcoming progress report on turkey would be " fair and balanced . " turkey implemented several reforms to win the green light for eu accession talks in october 2005 .
the country has said it remains fully committed to joining the european union . but the country 's eu bid has been marred by ankara 's refusal last year to grant trade privileges to cyprus as well as flagging efforts to push laws guaranteeing freedom of expression . the latter is expected to take center stage in november 's eu progress report with little sign that turkey is pursuing an amendment or withdrawal of article 301 , which can be used to prosecute writers for " insulting turkishness . " prosecution of writers " not acceptable " " it is a human and moral issue .
it is not acceptable that writers like orhan pamuk and elif safak are prosecuted based on this article , " rehn told turkish television station , ntvmsnbc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried for speaking about the armenian massacre before the case against him was dropped , pamuk was tried in turkey last year for telling a swiss newspaper that 1 million armenians had died in turkey during world war one and 30,000 kurds had died in recent decades . critics of the controversial article also say that turkish armenian editor and journalist hrant dink was murdered last year after being singled out because of his prosecution under the law . recent efforts by turkey 's ruling party to change the country 's constitution also should not delay reforms in expanding freedoms of expression and religion , rehn added . " the changes -lrb- to the constitution -rrb- can be a method for expanding fundamental rights and freedoms .
but the preparations should not delay the realization of freedoms of expression or religion , " he said . turkey 's prime minister tayyip erdogan has previously said the constitution will strengthen individual rights and freedoms , but turkish officials say article 301 will not be revised or overwritten in the new document . brussels softening stance towards turkey ? despite turkey 's faltering reform drive last year , there are signs that brussels is softening its attitude towards the large eu candidate and its new political leadership . this week , a draft resolution on turkey 's reform process was passed in the european parliament without much criticism . last week , eu parliamentarians were also confronted with a study released by the italian institute for international affairs and a turkish foundation which concluded that the debate over turkey 's eu membership was often marked by prejudices . since sept .
11 , 2001 , turkey has largely been perceived as a country influenced by islam , an attitude that has ignored the nation 's secular traditions , the study 's authors said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schröder had these cut from 32 months to 12 months . during this time , jobseekers are entitled to up 67 percent of their last salary , after which they become eligible for a flat-rate benefit of about 350 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- a month . campaign for social justice or clever ploy ? wolfgang thierse , vice president of the german parliament and a spd member , said there was " huge support " for beck 's proposals in the spd . " the expectation that there are enough jobs for older people simply has n't been fulfilled , " thierse said . hubertus heil , general secretary of the spd insisted that the changes did not mean the party was turning its back on the structural reforms started by schröder . " it 's about showing respect for the work of people who have become unemployed and who today , find it as difficult as ever to find work again , " heil wrote in a newspaper article . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of germans protested against former chancellor schröder 's reforms when they were introduced such a signal would raise acceptance for reforms because it would correspond to the sense of justice felt by the overwhelming majority of the population , heil wrote . a similar attempt is underway in some quarters of the spd to water down pension changes and review a law that raises the retirement age to 67 from 65 .
the pension law designed by merkel was approved by parliament earlier this year and is designed to stem further rises in pension contributions shared between companies and workers . the spd is expected to discuss the divisive topics at a party conference later this month . beck 's tactics are widely interpreted as an attempt to spur plummeting popularity ratings for his party and to appeal to disillusioned voters driven into the arms of a new opposition alliance of left-wing parties campaigning for more " social justice . " recent opinion polls show almost three-quarters of germans favor higher jobless benefits . " progress requires a step forward " though beck 's proposals have met with approval in parts of his own party as well as merkel 's conservatives , they are fiercely opposed by some as backsliding on crucial domestic reforms . franz müntefering , labor minister and vice-chancellor and a member of the spd is one of the strongest critics of tweaking agenda 2010 , the package of far-reaching labor-market and social reforms introduced by schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering has criticized his party 's drift to the left " i recommend my party to stick to the course , " he said , criticizing the leftward drift of his party . the spd should not try to lessen the pace of reforms , he said .
müntefering drew up the law to increase the retirement age and helped devise schröder 's welfare changes . " progress requires a step forward , not backwards , " he said . the issue has also sparked alarm among economists and business groups who fear that a rollback of key structural reforms could put a dent in germany 's resurgent economy . " the opposite of what we need " " it goes in the totally wrong direction .
beck is torpedoing the upward trend of getting work among those above 55 , " jutta allmendinger , a labor market expert and head of the wzb social science research center in berlin told german newspaper der tagesspiegel . wolfgang clement , economics minister under schröder and one of the architects of his structural reform program said undoing the labor-market reform would undermine efforts to raise the retirement age and destroy incentives for jobseekers to accept lower-paid jobs . " this is exactly the opposite of what we need at this juncture , which is to encourage people to work longer in law and in practice , " clement told financial times deutschland . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i expect that he -lrb- gül -rrb- leads the transformation process and ensures that fundamental freedoms exist in all aspects of life and in all corners of turkey , " rehn told german newspaper bild am sonntag on sunday , oct .
7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn wants turkey to step up the pace of its reform drive he assured ankara that the eu 's upcoming progress report on turkey would be " fair and balanced . " turkey implemented several reforms to win the green light for eu accession talks in october 2005 .
the country has said it remains fully committed to joining the european union . but the country 's eu bid has been marred by ankara 's refusal last year to grant trade privileges to cyprus as well as flagging efforts to push laws guaranteeing freedom of expression . the latter is expected to take center stage in november 's eu progress report with little sign that turkey is pursuing an amendment or withdrawal of article 301 , which can be used to prosecute writers for " insulting turkishness . " prosecution of writers " not acceptable " " it is a human and moral issue .
it is not acceptable that writers like orhan pamuk and elif safak are prosecuted based on this article , " rehn told turkish television station , ntvmsnbc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried for speaking about the armenian massacre before the case against him was dropped , pamuk was tried in turkey last year for telling a swiss newspaper that 1 million armenians had died in turkey during world war one and 30,000 kurds had died in recent decades . critics of the controversial article also say that turkish armenian editor and journalist hrant dink was murdered last year after being singled out because of his prosecution under the law . recent efforts by turkey 's ruling party to change the country 's constitution also should not delay reforms in expanding freedoms of expression and religion , rehn added . " the changes -lrb- to the constitution -rrb- can be a method for expanding fundamental rights and freedoms .
but the preparations should not delay the realization of freedoms of expression or religion , " he said . turkey 's prime minister tayyip erdogan has previously said the constitution will strengthen individual rights and freedoms , but turkish officials say article 301 will not be revised or overwritten in the new document . brussels softening stance towards turkey ? despite turkey 's faltering reform drive last year , there are signs that brussels is softening its attitude towards the large eu candidate and its new political leadership . this week , a draft resolution on turkey 's reform process was passed in the european parliament without much criticism . last week , eu parliamentarians were also confronted with a study released by the italian institute for international affairs and a turkish foundation which concluded that the debate over turkey 's eu membership was often marked by prejudices . since sept .
11 , 2001 , turkey has largely been perceived as a country influenced by islam , an attitude that has ignored the nation 's secular traditions , the study 's authors said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schröder had these cut from 32 months to 12 months . during this time , jobseekers are entitled to up 67 percent of their last salary , after which they become eligible for a flat-rate benefit of about 350 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- a month . campaign for social justice or clever ploy ? wolfgang thierse , vice president of the german parliament and a spd member , said there was " huge support " for beck 's proposals in the spd . " the expectation that there are enough jobs for older people simply has n't been fulfilled , " thierse said . hubertus heil , general secretary of the spd insisted that the changes did not mean the party was turning its back on the structural reforms started by schröder . " it 's about showing respect for the work of people who have become unemployed and who today , find it as difficult as ever to find work again , " heil wrote in a newspaper article . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of germans protested against former chancellor schröder 's reforms when they were introduced such a signal would raise acceptance for reforms because it would correspond to the sense of justice felt by the overwhelming majority of the population , heil wrote . a similar attempt is underway in some quarters of the spd to water down pension changes and review a law that raises the retirement age to 67 from 65 .
the pension law designed by merkel was approved by parliament earlier this year and is designed to stem further rises in pension contributions shared between companies and workers . the spd is expected to discuss the divisive topics at a party conference later this month . beck 's tactics are widely interpreted as an attempt to spur plummeting popularity ratings for his party and to appeal to disillusioned voters driven into the arms of a new opposition alliance of left-wing parties campaigning for more " social justice . " recent opinion polls show almost three-quarters of germans favor higher jobless benefits . " progress requires a step forward " though beck 's proposals have met with approval in parts of his own party as well as merkel 's conservatives , they are fiercely opposed by some as backsliding on crucial domestic reforms . franz müntefering , labor minister and vice-chancellor and a member of the spd is one of the strongest critics of tweaking agenda 2010 , the package of far-reaching labor-market and social reforms introduced by schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering has criticized his party 's drift to the left " i recommend my party to stick to the course , " he said , criticizing the leftward drift of his party . the spd should not try to lessen the pace of reforms , he said .
müntefering drew up the law to increase the retirement age and helped devise schröder 's welfare changes . " progress requires a step forward , not backwards , " he said . the issue has also sparked alarm among economists and business groups who fear that a rollback of key structural reforms could put a dent in germany 's resurgent economy . " the opposite of what we need " " it goes in the totally wrong direction .
beck is torpedoing the upward trend of getting work among those above 55 , " jutta allmendinger , a labor market expert and head of the wzb social science research center in berlin told german newspaper der tagesspiegel . wolfgang clement , economics minister under schröder and one of the architects of his structural reform program said undoing the labor-market reform would undermine efforts to raise the retirement age and destroy incentives for jobseekers to accept lower-paid jobs .

schröder had these cut from 32 months to 12 months . during this time , jobseekers are entitled to up 67 percent of their last salary , after which they become eligible for a flat-rate benefit of about 350 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- a month . campaign for social justice or clever ploy ? wolfgang thierse , vice president of the german parliament and a spd member , said there was " huge support " for beck 's proposals in the spd . " the expectation that there are enough jobs for older people simply has n't been fulfilled , " thierse said . hubertus heil , general secretary of the spd insisted that the changes did not mean the party was turning its back on the structural reforms started by schröder .

the pension law designed by merkel was approved by parliament earlier this year and is designed to stem further rises in pension contributions shared between companies and workers . the spd is expected to discuss the divisive topics at a party conference later this month . beck 's tactics are widely interpreted as an attempt to spur plummeting popularity ratings for his party and to appeal to disillusioned voters driven into the arms of a new opposition alliance of left-wing parties campaigning for more " social justice .

müntefering drew up the law to increase the retirement age and helped devise schröder 's welfare changes .

" i expect that he -lrb- gül -rrb- leads the transformation process and ensures that fundamental freedoms exist in all aspects of life and in all corners of turkey , " rehn told german newspaper bild am sonntag on sunday , oct .

" turkey implemented several reforms to win the green light for eu accession talks in october 2005 .
the country has said it remains fully committed to joining the european union . but the country 's eu bid has been marred by ankara 's refusal last year to grant trade privileges to cyprus as well as flagging efforts to push laws guaranteeing freedom of expression . the latter is expected to take center stage in november 's eu progress report with little sign that turkey is pursuing an amendment or withdrawal of article 301 , which can be used to prosecute writers for " insulting turkishness . " prosecution of writers " not acceptable " " it is a human and moral issue .
it is not acceptable that writers like orhan pamuk and elif safak are prosecuted based on this article , " rehn told turkish television station , ntvmsnbc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried for speaking about the armenian massacre before the case against him was dropped , pamuk was tried in turkey last year for telling a swiss newspaper that 1 million armenians had died in turkey during world war one and 30,000 kurds had died in recent decades . critics of the controversial article also say that turkish armenian editor and journalist hrant dink was murdered last year after being singled out because of his prosecution under the law . recent efforts by turkey 's ruling party to change the country 's constitution also should not delay reforms in expanding freedoms of expression and religion , rehn added . " the changes -lrb- to the constitution -rrb- can be a method for expanding fundamental rights and freedoms .
but the preparations should not delay the realization of freedoms of expression or religion , " he said . turkey 's prime minister tayyip erdogan has previously said the constitution will strengthen individual rights and freedoms , but turkish officials say article 301 will not be revised or overwritten in the new document . brussels softening stance towards turkey ? despite turkey 's faltering reform drive last year , there are signs that brussels is softening its attitude towards the large eu candidate and its new political leadership . this week , a draft resolution on turkey 's reform process was passed in the european parliament without much criticism . last week , eu parliamentarians were also confronted with a study released by the italian institute for international affairs and a turkish foundation which concluded that the debate over turkey 's eu membership was often marked by prejudices . since sept .
11 , 2001 , turkey has largely been perceived as a country influenced by islam , an attitude that has ignored the nation 's secular traditions , the study 's authors said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i expect that he -lrb- gül -rrb- leads the transformation process and ensures that fundamental freedoms exist in all aspects of life and in all corners of turkey , " rehn told german newspaper bild am sonntag on sunday , oct .
7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn wants turkey to step up the pace of its reform drive he assured ankara that the eu 's upcoming progress report on turkey would be " fair and balanced . " turkey implemented several reforms to win the green light for eu accession talks in october 2005 .
the country has said it remains fully committed to joining the european union . but the country 's eu bid has been marred by ankara 's refusal last year to grant trade privileges to cyprus as well as flagging efforts to push laws guaranteeing freedom of expression . the latter is expected to take center stage in november 's eu progress report with little sign that turkey is pursuing an amendment or withdrawal of article 301 , which can be used to prosecute writers for " insulting turkishness . " prosecution of writers " not acceptable " " it is a human and moral issue .
it is not acceptable that writers like orhan pamuk and elif safak are prosecuted based on this article , " rehn told turkish television station , ntvmsnbc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried for speaking about the armenian massacre before the case against him was dropped , pamuk was tried in turkey last year for telling a swiss newspaper that 1 million armenians had died in turkey during world war one and 30,000 kurds had died in recent decades . critics of the controversial article also say that turkish armenian editor and journalist hrant dink was murdered last year after being singled out because of his prosecution under the law . recent efforts by turkey 's ruling party to change the country 's constitution also should not delay reforms in expanding freedoms of expression and religion , rehn added . " the changes -lrb- to the constitution -rrb- can be a method for expanding fundamental rights and freedoms .
but the preparations should not delay the realization of freedoms of expression or religion , " he said . turkey 's prime minister tayyip erdogan has previously said the constitution will strengthen individual rights and freedoms , but turkish officials say article 301 will not be revised or overwritten in the new document . brussels softening stance towards turkey ? despite turkey 's faltering reform drive last year , there are signs that brussels is softening its attitude towards the large eu candidate and its new political leadership . this week , a draft resolution on turkey 's reform process was passed in the european parliament without much criticism . last week , eu parliamentarians were also confronted with a study released by the italian institute for international affairs and a turkish foundation which concluded that the debate over turkey 's eu membership was often marked by prejudices . since sept .
11 , 2001 , turkey has largely been perceived as a country influenced by islam , an attitude that has ignored the nation 's secular traditions , the study 's authors said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schröder had these cut from 32 months to 12 months . during this time , jobseekers are entitled to up 67 percent of their last salary , after which they become eligible for a flat-rate benefit of about 350 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- a month . campaign for social justice or clever ploy ? wolfgang thierse , vice president of the german parliament and a spd member , said there was " huge support " for beck 's proposals in the spd . " the expectation that there are enough jobs for older people simply has n't been fulfilled , " thierse said . hubertus heil , general secretary of the spd insisted that the changes did not mean the party was turning its back on the structural reforms started by schröder . " it 's about showing respect for the work of people who have become unemployed and who today , find it as difficult as ever to find work again , " heil wrote in a newspaper article . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of germans protested against former chancellor schröder 's reforms when they were introduced such a signal would raise acceptance for reforms because it would correspond to the sense of justice felt by the overwhelming majority of the population , heil wrote . a similar attempt is underway in some quarters of the spd to water down pension changes and review a law that raises the retirement age to 67 from 65 .
the pension law designed by merkel was approved by parliament earlier this year and is designed to stem further rises in pension contributions shared between companies and workers . the spd is expected to discuss the divisive topics at a party conference later this month . beck 's tactics are widely interpreted as an attempt to spur plummeting popularity ratings for his party and to appeal to disillusioned voters driven into the arms of a new opposition alliance of left-wing parties campaigning for more " social justice . " recent opinion polls show almost three-quarters of germans favor higher jobless benefits . " progress requires a step forward " though beck 's proposals have met with approval in parts of his own party as well as merkel 's conservatives , they are fiercely opposed by some as backsliding on crucial domestic reforms . franz müntefering , labor minister and vice-chancellor and a member of the spd is one of the strongest critics of tweaking agenda 2010 , the package of far-reaching labor-market and social reforms introduced by schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering has criticized his party 's drift to the left " i recommend my party to stick to the course , " he said , criticizing the leftward drift of his party . the spd should not try to lessen the pace of reforms , he said .
müntefering drew up the law to increase the retirement age and helped devise schröder 's welfare changes . " progress requires a step forward , not backwards , " he said . the issue has also sparked alarm among economists and business groups who fear that a rollback of key structural reforms could put a dent in germany 's resurgent economy . " the opposite of what we need " " it goes in the totally wrong direction .
beck is torpedoing the upward trend of getting work among those above 55 , " jutta allmendinger , a labor market expert and head of the wzb social science research center in berlin told german newspaper der tagesspiegel . wolfgang clement , economics minister under schröder and one of the architects of his structural reform program said undoing the labor-market reform would undermine efforts to raise the retirement age and destroy incentives for jobseekers to accept lower-paid jobs .

the pension law designed by merkel was approved by parliament earlier this year and is designed to stem further rises in pension contributions shared between companies and workers . the spd is expected to discuss the divisive topics at a party conference later this month . beck 's tactics are widely interpreted as an attempt to spur plummeting popularity ratings for his party and to appeal to disillusioned voters driven into the arms of a new opposition alliance of left-wing parties campaigning for more " social justice . " recent opinion polls show almost three-quarters of germans favor higher jobless benefits . " progress requires a step forward " though beck 's proposals have met with approval in parts of his own party as well as merkel 's conservatives , they are fiercely opposed by some as backsliding on crucial domestic reforms . franz müntefering , labor minister and vice-chancellor and a member of the spd is one of the strongest critics of tweaking agenda 2010 , the package of far-reaching labor-market and social reforms introduced by schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering has criticized his party 's drift to the left " i recommend my party to stick to the course , " he said , criticizing the leftward drift of his party . the spd should not try to lessen the pace of reforms , he said .
müntefering drew up the law to increase the retirement age and helped devise schröder 's welfare changes . " progress requires a step forward , not backwards , " he said . the issue has also sparked alarm among economists and business groups who fear that a rollback of key structural reforms could put a dent in germany 's resurgent economy . " the opposite of what we need " " it goes in the totally wrong direction .
beck is torpedoing the upward trend of getting work among those above 55 , " jutta allmendinger , a labor market expert and head of the wzb social science research center in berlin told german newspaper der tagesspiegel . wolfgang clement , economics minister under schröder and one of the architects of his structural reform program said undoing the labor-market reform would undermine efforts to raise the retirement age and destroy incentives for jobseekers to accept lower-paid jobs .

" turkey implemented several reforms to win the green light for eu accession talks in october 2005 .
the country has said it remains fully committed to joining the european union . but the country 's eu bid has been marred by ankara 's refusal last year to grant trade privileges to cyprus as well as flagging efforts to push laws guaranteeing freedom of expression . the latter is expected to take center stage in november 's eu progress report with little sign that turkey is pursuing an amendment or withdrawal of article 301 , which can be used to prosecute writers for " insulting turkishness .

" the changes -lrb- to the constitution -rrb- can be a method for expanding fundamental rights and freedoms .
but the preparations should not delay the realization of freedoms of expression or religion , " he said . turkey 's prime minister tayyip erdogan has previously said the constitution will strengthen individual rights and freedoms , but turkish officials say article 301 will not be revised or overwritten in the new document . brussels softening stance towards turkey ? despite turkey 's faltering reform drive last year , there are signs that brussels is softening its attitude towards the large eu candidate and its new political leadership . this week , a draft resolution on turkey 's reform process was passed in the european parliament without much criticism . last week , eu parliamentarians were also confronted with a study released by the italian institute for international affairs and a turkish foundation which concluded that the debate over turkey 's eu membership was often marked by prejudices . since sept .

schröder had these cut from 32 months to 12 months . during this time , jobseekers are entitled to up 67 percent of their last salary , after which they become eligible for a flat-rate benefit of about 350 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- a month . campaign for social justice or clever ploy ? wolfgang thierse , vice president of the german parliament and a spd member , said there was " huge support " for beck 's proposals in the spd . " the expectation that there are enough jobs for older people simply has n't been fulfilled , " thierse said . hubertus heil , general secretary of the spd insisted that the changes did not mean the party was turning its back on the structural reforms started by schröder . " it 's about showing respect for the work of people who have become unemployed and who today , find it as difficult as ever to find work again , " heil wrote in a newspaper article . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of germans protested against former chancellor schröder 's reforms when they were introduced such a signal would raise acceptance for reforms because it would correspond to the sense of justice felt by the overwhelming majority of the population , heil wrote . a similar attempt is underway in some quarters of the spd to water down pension changes and review a law that raises the retirement age to 67 from 65 .
the pension law designed by merkel was approved by parliament earlier this year and is designed to stem further rises in pension contributions shared between companies and workers . the spd is expected to discuss the divisive topics at a party conference later this month . beck 's tactics are widely interpreted as an attempt to spur plummeting popularity ratings for his party and to appeal to disillusioned voters driven into the arms of a new opposition alliance of left-wing parties campaigning for more " social justice . " recent opinion polls show almost three-quarters of germans favor higher jobless benefits . " progress requires a step forward " though beck 's proposals have met with approval in parts of his own party as well as merkel 's conservatives , they are fiercely opposed by some as backsliding on crucial domestic reforms . franz müntefering , labor minister and vice-chancellor and a member of the spd is one of the strongest critics of tweaking agenda 2010 , the package of far-reaching labor-market and social reforms introduced by schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering has criticized his party 's drift to the left " i recommend my party to stick to the course , " he said , criticizing the leftward drift of his party . the spd should not try to lessen the pace of reforms , he said .
müntefering drew up the law to increase the retirement age and helped devise schröder 's welfare changes . " progress requires a step forward , not backwards , " he said . the issue has also sparked alarm among economists and business groups who fear that a rollback of key structural reforms could put a dent in germany 's resurgent economy . " the opposite of what we need " " it goes in the totally wrong direction .

it is not acceptable that writers like orhan pamuk and elif safak are prosecuted based on this article , " rehn told turkish television station , ntvmsnbc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried for speaking about the armenian massacre before the case against him was dropped , pamuk was tried in turkey last year for telling a swiss newspaper that 1 million armenians had died in turkey during world war one and 30,000 kurds had died in recent decades . critics of the controversial article also say that turkish armenian editor and journalist hrant dink was murdered last year after being singled out because of his prosecution under the law . recent efforts by turkey 's ruling party to change the country 's constitution also should not delay reforms in expanding freedoms of expression and religion , rehn added . " the changes -lrb- to the constitution -rrb- can be a method for expanding fundamental rights and freedoms .
but the preparations should not delay the realization of freedoms of expression or religion , " he said . turkey 's prime minister tayyip erdogan has previously said the constitution will strengthen individual rights and freedoms , but turkish officials say article 301 will not be revised or overwritten in the new document . brussels softening stance towards turkey ? despite turkey 's faltering reform drive last year , there are signs that brussels is softening its attitude towards the large eu candidate and its new political leadership . this week , a draft resolution on turkey 's reform process was passed in the european parliament without much criticism . last week , eu parliamentarians were also confronted with a study released by the italian institute for international affairs and a turkish foundation which concluded that the debate over turkey 's eu membership was often marked by prejudices . since sept .
11 , 2001 , turkey has largely been perceived as a country influenced by islam , an attitude that has ignored the nation 's secular traditions , the study 's authors said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schröder had these cut from 32 months to 12 months . during this time , jobseekers are entitled to up 67 percent of their last salary , after which they become eligible for a flat-rate benefit of about 350 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- a month . campaign for social justice or clever ploy ? wolfgang thierse , vice president of the german parliament and a spd member , said there was " huge support " for beck 's proposals in the spd . " the expectation that there are enough jobs for older people simply has n't been fulfilled , " thierse said . hubertus heil , general secretary of the spd insisted that the changes did not mean the party was turning its back on the structural reforms started by schröder . " it 's about showing respect for the work of people who have become unemployed and who today , find it as difficult as ever to find work again , " heil wrote in a newspaper article . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of germans protested against former chancellor schröder 's reforms when they were introduced such a signal would raise acceptance for reforms because it would correspond to the sense of justice felt by the overwhelming majority of the population , heil wrote . a similar attempt is underway in some quarters of the spd to water down pension changes and review a law that raises the retirement age to 67 from 65 .
the pension law designed by merkel was approved by parliament earlier this year and is designed to stem further rises in pension contributions shared between companies and workers . the spd is expected to discuss the divisive topics at a party conference later this month . beck 's tactics are widely interpreted as an attempt to spur plummeting popularity ratings for his party and to appeal to disillusioned voters driven into the arms of a new opposition alliance of left-wing parties campaigning for more " social justice . " recent opinion polls show almost three-quarters of germans favor higher jobless benefits . " progress requires a step forward " though beck 's proposals have met with approval in parts of his own party as well as merkel 's conservatives , they are fiercely opposed by some as backsliding on crucial domestic reforms . franz müntefering , labor minister and vice-chancellor and a member of the spd is one of the strongest critics of tweaking agenda 2010 , the package of far-reaching labor-market and social reforms introduced by schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering has criticized his party 's drift to the left " i recommend my party to stick to the course , " he said , criticizing the leftward drift of his party . the spd should not try to lessen the pace of reforms , he said .
müntefering drew up the law to increase the retirement age and helped devise schröder 's welfare changes . " progress requires a step forward , not backwards , " he said . the issue has also sparked alarm among economists and business groups who fear that a rollback of key structural reforms could put a dent in germany 's resurgent economy . " the opposite of what we need " " it goes in the totally wrong direction .
beck is torpedoing the upward trend of getting work among those above 55 , " jutta allmendinger , a labor market expert and head of the wzb social science research center in berlin told german newspaper der tagesspiegel . wolfgang clement , economics minister under schröder and one of the architects of his structural reform program said undoing the labor-market reform would undermine efforts to raise the retirement age and destroy incentives for jobseekers to accept lower-paid jobs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 07.10.2007 opinion : an attack on basic democratic rights in russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian journalist anna politkovskaya was shot one year ago .
the failure to solve her murder shows that the country is still far from being a democracy with an independent judiciary , says dw 's cornelia rabitz . she denounced corruption and abuse of power .
she relentlessly reported on murders , kidnappings and torture in chechnya .
she was tough on kremlin politics .
she never shied away from personal risks .
she was incorruptible , investigative , courageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz anna politkovskaya unsettled and disturbed people .
through her reporting , she made friends and gained respect and recognition , but she also made bitter enemies .
she 's become a role model for all those who see journalism as having moral , democratic and educational qualities .
she became an enemy figure for all the people she criticized .
anna politkovskaya was murdered a year ago on oct .
7 and became a victim of her profession and her moral-political self-image .
no one knows to this day who was behind the murder , who commissioned it , and who fired the fatal shots in the end .
only few in putin 's empire were courageous enough to support the journalist during her lifetime .
only few really showed any interest in her work .
too few .
soon after the murder , the russian president - during a visit to germany , by the way - said that politkovskaya was an insignificant person without any influence .
still , she had obviously become a thorn in the side of official russia .
even if no one can prove an immediate complicity of the political leadership and especially vladimir putin himself - the murder of the incorruptible anna politkovskaya was only possible in an atmosphere of utter contempt for democratic principles , for fairness and open societal debates .
a critical journalist must prove prickly in an environment where democracy has degenerated into a superficial spectacle , where free media , parties and institutions are nothing but set design for the scheming of secret services and the intrigues of insular , elite circles .
on top of it all , her political enemies were additionally angered by the fact that her international reputation kept prompting the west to criticize russia .
that 's why today , one year later , the murder of the upright journalist still has a huge symbolic power .
it was an attack on basic democratic rights .
it was probably a decisive slap in the face of already curtailed freedoms of press and opinion .
it unveiled russia 's ugly side .
the fact that there 's still no real breakthrough in the investigation , but rather a hopeless mess of extenuations , spectacular arrests , judicial mistakes and dropped indictments shows only one thing : russia still has to prove that it is a democracy with an independent judiciary .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 07.10.2007 opinion : an attack on basic democratic rights in russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian journalist anna politkovskaya was shot one year ago .
the failure to solve her murder shows that the country is still far from being a democracy with an independent judiciary , says dw 's cornelia rabitz . she denounced corruption and abuse of power .
she relentlessly reported on murders , kidnappings and torture in chechnya .
she was tough on kremlin politics .
she never shied away from personal risks .
she was incorruptible , investigative , courageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz anna politkovskaya unsettled and disturbed people .
through her reporting , she made friends and gained respect and recognition , but she also made bitter enemies .
she 's become a role model for all those who see journalism as having moral , democratic and educational qualities .
she became an enemy figure for all the people she criticized .
anna politkovskaya was murdered a year ago on oct .
7 and became a victim of her profession and her moral-political self-image .
no one knows to this day who was behind the murder , who commissioned it , and who fired the fatal shots in the end .
only few in putin 's empire were courageous enough to support the journalist during her lifetime .
only few really showed any interest in her work .
too few .
soon after the murder , the russian president - during a visit to germany , by the way - said that politkovskaya was an insignificant person without any influence .
still , she had obviously become a thorn in the side of official russia .
even if no one can prove an immediate complicity of the political leadership and especially vladimir putin himself - the murder of the incorruptible anna politkovskaya was only possible in an atmosphere of utter contempt for democratic principles , for fairness and open societal debates .
a critical journalist must prove prickly in an environment where democracy has degenerated into a superficial spectacle , where free media , parties and institutions are nothing but set design for the scheming of secret services and the intrigues of insular , elite circles .
on top of it all , her political enemies were additionally angered by the fact that her international reputation kept prompting the west to criticize russia .
that 's why today , one year later , the murder of the upright journalist still has a huge symbolic power .
it was an attack on basic democratic rights .
it was probably a decisive slap in the face of already curtailed freedoms of press and opinion .
it unveiled russia 's ugly side .
the fact that there 's still no real breakthrough in the investigation , but rather a hopeless mess of extenuations , spectacular arrests , judicial mistakes and dropped indictments shows only one thing : russia still has to prove that it is a democracy with an independent judiciary .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 07.10.2007 eu says turkey must improve freedom of speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has inched closer to the eu but still needs to pass a key reform brussels has stepped up pressure on eu candidate turkey to speed up its reform process and in particular move ahead with laws ensuring freedoms of religion and expression . four weeks before the eu commission issues a progress report on turkey , eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn called on recently-elected turkish president abdullah gül to keep his country firmly on the reform track . " i expect that he -lrb- gül -rrb- leads the transformation process and ensures that fundamental freedoms exist in all aspects of life and in all corners of turkey , " rehn told german newspaper bild am sonntag on sunday , oct .
7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn wants turkey to step up the pace of its reform drive he assured ankara that the eu 's upcoming progress report on turkey would be " fair and balanced . " turkey implemented several reforms to win the green light for eu accession talks in october 2005 .
the country has said it remains fully committed to joining the european union . but the country 's eu bid has been marred by ankara 's refusal last year to grant trade privileges to cyprus as well as flagging efforts to push laws guaranteeing freedom of expression . the latter is expected to take center stage in november 's eu progress report with little sign that turkey is pursuing an amendment or withdrawal of article 301 , which can be used to prosecute writers for " insulting turkishness . " prosecution of writers " not acceptable " " it is a human and moral issue .
it is not acceptable that writers like orhan pamuk and elif safak are prosecuted based on this article , " rehn told turkish television station , ntvmsnbc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pamuk was tried for speaking about the armenian massacre before the case against him was dropped , pamuk was tried in turkey last year for telling a swiss newspaper that 1 million armenians had died in turkey during world war one and 30,000 kurds had died in recent decades . critics of the controversial article also say that turkish armenian editor and journalist hrant dink was murdered last year after being singled out because of his prosecution under the law . recent efforts by turkey 's ruling party to change the country 's constitution also should not delay reforms in expanding freedoms of expression and religion , rehn added . " the changes -lrb- to the constitution -rrb- can be a method for expanding fundamental rights and freedoms .
but the preparations should not delay the realization of freedoms of expression or religion , " he said . turkey 's prime minister tayyip erdogan has previously said the constitution will strengthen individual rights and freedoms , but turkish officials say article 301 will not be revised or overwritten in the new document . brussels softening stance towards turkey ? despite turkey 's faltering reform drive last year , there are signs that brussels is softening its attitude towards the large eu candidate and its new political leadership . this week , a draft resolution on turkey 's reform process was passed in the european parliament without much criticism . last week , eu parliamentarians were also confronted with a study released by the italian institute for international affairs and a turkish foundation which concluded that the debate over turkey 's eu membership was often marked by prejudices . since sept .
11 , 2001 , turkey has largely been perceived as a country influenced by islam , an attitude that has ignored the nation 's secular traditions , the study 's authors said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schröder had these cut from 32 months to 12 months . during this time , jobseekers are entitled to up 67 percent of their last salary , after which they become eligible for a flat-rate benefit of about 350 euros -lrb- $ 500 -rrb- a month . campaign for social justice or clever ploy ? wolfgang thierse , vice president of the german parliament and a spd member , said there was " huge support " for beck 's proposals in the spd . " the expectation that there are enough jobs for older people simply has n't been fulfilled , " thierse said . hubertus heil , general secretary of the spd insisted that the changes did not mean the party was turning its back on the structural reforms started by schröder . " it 's about showing respect for the work of people who have become unemployed and who today , find it as difficult as ever to find work again , " heil wrote in a newspaper article . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of germans protested against former chancellor schröder 's reforms when they were introduced such a signal would raise acceptance for reforms because it would correspond to the sense of justice felt by the overwhelming majority of the population , heil wrote . a similar attempt is underway in some quarters of the spd to water down pension changes and review a law that raises the retirement age to 67 from 65 .
the pension law designed by merkel was approved by parliament earlier this year and is designed to stem further rises in pension contributions shared between companies and workers . the spd is expected to discuss the divisive topics at a party conference later this month . beck 's tactics are widely interpreted as an attempt to spur plummeting popularity ratings for his party and to appeal to disillusioned voters driven into the arms of a new opposition alliance of left-wing parties campaigning for more " social justice . " recent opinion polls show almost three-quarters of germans favor higher jobless benefits . " progress requires a step forward " though beck 's proposals have met with approval in parts of his own party as well as merkel 's conservatives , they are fiercely opposed by some as backsliding on crucial domestic reforms . franz müntefering , labor minister and vice-chancellor and a member of the spd is one of the strongest critics of tweaking agenda 2010 , the package of far-reaching labor-market and social reforms introduced by schröder . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering has criticized his party 's drift to the left " i recommend my party to stick to the course , " he said , criticizing the leftward drift of his party . the spd should not try to lessen the pace of reforms , he said .
müntefering drew up the law to increase the retirement age and helped devise schröder 's welfare changes . " progress requires a step forward , not backwards , " he said . the issue has also sparked alarm among economists and business groups who fear that a rollback of key structural reforms could put a dent in germany 's resurgent economy . " the opposite of what we need " " it goes in the totally wrong direction .
beck is torpedoing the upward trend of getting work among those above 55 , " jutta allmendinger , a labor market expert and head of the wzb social science research center in berlin told german newspaper der tagesspiegel . wolfgang clement , economics minister under schröder and one of the architects of his structural reform program said undoing the labor-market reform would undermine efforts to raise the retirement age and destroy incentives for jobseekers to accept lower-paid jobs .

the failure to solve her murder shows that the country is still far from being a democracy with an independent judiciary , says dw 's cornelia rabitz . she denounced corruption and abuse of power .
she relentlessly reported on murders , kidnappings and torture in chechnya .
she was tough on kremlin politics .
she never shied away from personal risks .
she was incorruptible , investigative , courageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz anna politkovskaya unsettled and disturbed people .
through her reporting , she made friends and gained respect and recognition , but she also made bitter enemies .
she 's become a role model for all those who see journalism as having moral , democratic and educational qualities .
she became an enemy figure for all the people she criticized .
anna politkovskaya was murdered a year ago on oct .
7 and became a victim of her profession and her moral-political self-image .
no one knows to this day who was behind the murder , who commissioned it , and who fired the fatal shots in the end .
only few in putin 's empire were courageous enough to support the journalist during her lifetime .
only few really showed any interest in her work .
too few .
soon after the murder , the russian president - during a visit to germany , by the way - said that politkovskaya was an insignificant person without any influence .
still , she had obviously become a thorn in the side of official russia .
even if no one can prove an immediate complicity of the political leadership and especially vladimir putin himself - the murder of the incorruptible anna politkovskaya was only possible in an atmosphere of utter contempt for democratic principles , for fairness and open societal debates .
a critical journalist must prove prickly in an environment where democracy has degenerated into a superficial spectacle , where free media , parties and institutions are nothing but set design for the scheming of secret services and the intrigues of insular , elite circles .
on top of it all , her political enemies were additionally angered by the fact that her international reputation kept prompting the west to criticize russia .
that 's why today , one year later , the murder of the upright journalist still has a huge symbolic power .
it was an attack on basic democratic rights .
it was probably a decisive slap in the face of already curtailed freedoms of press and opinion .
it unveiled russia 's ugly side .
the fact that there 's still no real breakthrough in the investigation , but rather a hopeless mess of extenuations , spectacular arrests , judicial mistakes and dropped indictments shows only one thing : russia still has to prove that it is a democracy with an independent judiciary .

the failure to solve her murder shows that the country is still far from being a democracy with an independent judiciary , says dw 's cornelia rabitz . she denounced corruption and abuse of power .
she relentlessly reported on murders , kidnappings and torture in chechnya .
she was tough on kremlin politics .
she never shied away from personal risks .
she was incorruptible , investigative , courageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz anna politkovskaya unsettled and disturbed people .
through her reporting , she made friends and gained respect and recognition , but she also made bitter enemies .
she 's become a role model for all those who see journalism as having moral , democratic and educational qualities .
she became an enemy figure for all the people she criticized .
anna politkovskaya was murdered a year ago on oct .
7 and became a victim of her profession and her moral-political self-image .
no one knows to this day who was behind the murder , who commissioned it , and who fired the fatal shots in the end .
only few in putin 's empire were courageous enough to support the journalist during her lifetime .
only few really showed any interest in her work .
too few .
soon after the murder , the russian president - during a visit to germany , by the way - said that politkovskaya was an insignificant person without any influence .
still , she had obviously become a thorn in the side of official russia .
even if no one can prove an immediate complicity of the political leadership and especially vladimir putin himself - the murder of the incorruptible anna politkovskaya was only possible in an atmosphere of utter contempt for democratic principles , for fairness and open societal debates .
a critical journalist must prove prickly in an environment where democracy has degenerated into a superficial spectacle , where free media , parties and institutions are nothing but set design for the scheming of secret services and the intrigues of insular , elite circles .
on top of it all , her political enemies were additionally angered by the fact that her international reputation kept prompting the west to criticize russia .
that 's why today , one year later , the murder of the upright journalist still has a huge symbolic power .
it was an attack on basic democratic rights .
it was probably a decisive slap in the face of already curtailed freedoms of press and opinion .
it unveiled russia 's ugly side .
the fact that there 's still no real breakthrough in the investigation , but rather a hopeless mess of extenuations , spectacular arrests , judicial mistakes and dropped indictments shows only one thing : russia still has to prove that it is a democracy with an independent judiciary .

anything goes at the annual eurovision song contest - or not , as it happens .
the eastern europeans have been altogether too successful in recent years .
now the rules are being changed to smash their long-term reign . back in the good ol ' days , what you saw was what you got at the annual eurovision song contest .
but since the 21st century dawned , the event has been dominated by eastern europe - from estonia in 2001 to latvia in 2002 , ukraine in 2004 , through to serbia in 2007 . according to the conspiracy theorists , the whole thing is rigged .
the eastern europeans call in to vote for one another , they say , in a concerted effort to ostracize the west . old europe is sulking , and it does n't help that countries such as germany , france , spain and britain are those who foot the lion 's share of the event 's bill .
the whining reached unprecedented heights after the last contest , which saw marija serifovic from serbia sing her way to victory in helsinki .
moreover , eight of the top 10 were from eastern nations . a number of defeated countries , who shall remain nameless though they also have their own voting peculiarities , subsequently wasted no time calling on their broadcasters to boycott the event . the rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain does n't do well , desite picking up much of the tab although the controversies do nothing to detract from the contest 's popularity , with over 100 million tv viewers turning in for the annual schmaltz fest , fair play is apparently still a consideration . german public broadcaster ndr , which represents germany in the contest committee , this week said on its web site that the 42 participating countries have now agreed on new rules for the final in belgrade next may . according to the new guidelines , automatic entry to the final for the 10 best-placed nations of the previous year - usually eastern europeans - is to be abolished , excepting the first-place winner and , as before , the four big nations . in next year 's semi-finals , the first nine spots in each semi-final will be chosen by phone .
moreover , this year 's semi-final , two days before the final , is to be replaced next year by two semi-finals . a panel of judges will pick the 24th and last entrant to the final . " it 's an attempt to get a more balanced array in the final , " said manfred witt , the ndr official on the song contest committee . in a reference to last year 's debacle , witt said he hoped the former soviet and yugoslav republics would be scattered between the two semi-finals so that the shared tastes of those two blocs ' viewers no longer weighted the voting . who says politics and music do n't mix ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia has friends , but it also has enemies the eurovision is as famous for its highly charged voting system as it is for its music .
it can be hard to ignore the obvious political alliances dictating who gets " douze points " and who gets " nul . " the contest has long been perceived as a political institution , where judges and televoters award points based first and foremost on political affiliations . while greece likes to awards the maximum to cyprus , for example , turkey gives it the cold-shoulder .
but more to the point , countries such as estonia and latvia can always rely on their former soviet bloc neighbors - explaining the results of recent years . but now the goal posts have been moved , and it 's up to the music .

anything goes at the annual eurovision song contest - or not , as it happens .
the eastern europeans have been altogether too successful in recent years .
now the rules are being changed to smash their long-term reign . back in the good ol ' days , what you saw was what you got at the annual eurovision song contest .
but since the 21st century dawned , the event has been dominated by eastern europe - from estonia in 2001 to latvia in 2002 , ukraine in 2004 , through to serbia in 2007 . according to the conspiracy theorists , the whole thing is rigged .
the eastern europeans call in to vote for one another , they say , in a concerted effort to ostracize the west . old europe is sulking , and it does n't help that countries such as germany , france , spain and britain are those who foot the lion 's share of the event 's bill .
the whining reached unprecedented heights after the last contest , which saw marija serifovic from serbia sing her way to victory in helsinki .
moreover , eight of the top 10 were from eastern nations . a number of defeated countries , who shall remain nameless though they also have their own voting peculiarities , subsequently wasted no time calling on their broadcasters to boycott the event . the rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain does n't do well , desite picking up much of the tab although the controversies do nothing to detract from the contest 's popularity , with over 100 million tv viewers turning in for the annual schmaltz fest , fair play is apparently still a consideration . german public broadcaster ndr , which represents germany in the contest committee , this week said on its web site that the 42 participating countries have now agreed on new rules for the final in belgrade next may . according to the new guidelines , automatic entry to the final for the 10 best-placed nations of the previous year - usually eastern europeans - is to be abolished , excepting the first-place winner and , as before , the four big nations . in next year 's semi-finals , the first nine spots in each semi-final will be chosen by phone .
moreover , this year 's semi-final , two days before the final , is to be replaced next year by two semi-finals . a panel of judges will pick the 24th and last entrant to the final . " it 's an attempt to get a more balanced array in the final , " said manfred witt , the ndr official on the song contest committee . in a reference to last year 's debacle , witt said he hoped the former soviet and yugoslav republics would be scattered between the two semi-finals so that the shared tastes of those two blocs ' viewers no longer weighted the voting . who says politics and music do n't mix ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia has friends , but it also has enemies the eurovision is as famous for its highly charged voting system as it is for its music .
it can be hard to ignore the obvious political alliances dictating who gets " douze points " and who gets " nul . " the contest has long been perceived as a political institution , where judges and televoters award points based first and foremost on political affiliations . while greece likes to awards the maximum to cyprus , for example , turkey gives it the cold-shoulder .
but more to the point , countries such as estonia and latvia can always rely on their former soviet bloc neighbors - explaining the results of recent years . but now the goal posts have been moved , and it 's up to the music .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 07.10.2007 opinion : an attack on basic democratic rights in russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian journalist anna politkovskaya was shot one year ago .
the failure to solve her murder shows that the country is still far from being a democracy with an independent judiciary , says dw 's cornelia rabitz . she denounced corruption and abuse of power .
she relentlessly reported on murders , kidnappings and torture in chechnya .
she was tough on kremlin politics .
she never shied away from personal risks .
she was incorruptible , investigative , courageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz anna politkovskaya unsettled and disturbed people .
through her reporting , she made friends and gained respect and recognition , but she also made bitter enemies .
she 's become a role model for all those who see journalism as having moral , democratic and educational qualities .
she became an enemy figure for all the people she criticized .
anna politkovskaya was murdered a year ago on oct .
7 and became a victim of her profession and her moral-political self-image .
no one knows to this day who was behind the murder , who commissioned it , and who fired the fatal shots in the end .
only few in putin 's empire were courageous enough to support the journalist during her lifetime .
only few really showed any interest in her work .
too few .
soon after the murder , the russian president - during a visit to germany , by the way - said that politkovskaya was an insignificant person without any influence .
still , she had obviously become a thorn in the side of official russia .
even if no one can prove an immediate complicity of the political leadership and especially vladimir putin himself - the murder of the incorruptible anna politkovskaya was only possible in an atmosphere of utter contempt for democratic principles , for fairness and open societal debates .
a critical journalist must prove prickly in an environment where democracy has degenerated into a superficial spectacle , where free media , parties and institutions are nothing but set design for the scheming of secret services and the intrigues of insular , elite circles .
on top of it all , her political enemies were additionally angered by the fact that her international reputation kept prompting the west to criticize russia .
that 's why today , one year later , the murder of the upright journalist still has a huge symbolic power .
it was an attack on basic democratic rights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 07.10.2007 eurovision rewrites the rule book großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the best song win - or is the voting biased ?
anything goes at the annual eurovision song contest - or not , as it happens .
the eastern europeans have been altogether too successful in recent years .
now the rules are being changed to smash their long-term reign . back in the good ol ' days , what you saw was what you got at the annual eurovision song contest .
but since the 21st century dawned , the event has been dominated by eastern europe - from estonia in 2001 to latvia in 2002 , ukraine in 2004 , through to serbia in 2007 . according to the conspiracy theorists , the whole thing is rigged .
the eastern europeans call in to vote for one another , they say , in a concerted effort to ostracize the west . old europe is sulking , and it does n't help that countries such as germany , france , spain and britain are those who foot the lion 's share of the event 's bill .
the whining reached unprecedented heights after the last contest , which saw marija serifovic from serbia sing her way to victory in helsinki .
moreover , eight of the top 10 were from eastern nations . a number of defeated countries , who shall remain nameless though they also have their own voting peculiarities , subsequently wasted no time calling on their broadcasters to boycott the event . the rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain does n't do well , desite picking up much of the tab although the controversies do nothing to detract from the contest 's popularity , with over 100 million tv viewers turning in for the annual schmaltz fest , fair play is apparently still a consideration . german public broadcaster ndr , which represents germany in the contest committee , this week said on its web site that the 42 participating countries have now agreed on new rules for the final in belgrade next may . according to the new guidelines , automatic entry to the final for the 10 best-placed nations of the previous year - usually eastern europeans - is to be abolished , excepting the first-place winner and , as before , the four big nations . in next year 's semi-finals , the first nine spots in each semi-final will be chosen by phone .
moreover , this year 's semi-final , two days before the final , is to be replaced next year by two semi-finals . a panel of judges will pick the 24th and last entrant to the final . " it 's an attempt to get a more balanced array in the final , " said manfred witt , the ndr official on the song contest committee . in a reference to last year 's debacle , witt said he hoped the former soviet and yugoslav republics would be scattered between the two semi-finals so that the shared tastes of those two blocs ' viewers no longer weighted the voting . who says politics and music do n't mix ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia has friends , but it also has enemies the eurovision is as famous for its highly charged voting system as it is for its music .
it can be hard to ignore the obvious political alliances dictating who gets " douze points " and who gets " nul . " the contest has long been perceived as a political institution , where judges and televoters award points based first and foremost on political affiliations . while greece likes to awards the maximum to cyprus , for example , turkey gives it the cold-shoulder .
but more to the point , countries such as estonia and latvia can always rely on their former soviet bloc neighbors - explaining the results of recent years . but now the goal posts have been moved , and it 's up to the music .
in 2008 , may the best band win . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de it happened once on the road to eurovision heaven it happened 25 years ago , germany won the eurovision song contest , which is why springtime is such a melancholy season for german music fans .
it evokes memories of a singular triumph and a tradition of failure .
-lrb- 24.04.2007 -rrb- nationalists , russia find ukraine 's eurovision song quite a drag ukraine 's eurovision song contest entry is causing friction at home and abroad .

the failure to solve her murder shows that the country is still far from being a democracy with an independent judiciary , says dw 's cornelia rabitz . she denounced corruption and abuse of power .
she relentlessly reported on murders , kidnappings and torture in chechnya .
she was tough on kremlin politics .
she never shied away from personal risks .
she was incorruptible , investigative , courageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz anna politkovskaya unsettled and disturbed people .
through her reporting , she made friends and gained respect and recognition , but she also made bitter enemies .
she 's become a role model for all those who see journalism as having moral , democratic and educational qualities .
she became an enemy figure for all the people she criticized .
anna politkovskaya was murdered a year ago on oct .
7 and became a victim of her profession and her moral-political self-image .
no one knows to this day who was behind the murder , who commissioned it , and who fired the fatal shots in the end .
only few in putin 's empire were courageous enough to support the journalist during her lifetime .
only few really showed any interest in her work .
too few .
soon after the murder , the russian president - during a visit to germany , by the way - said that politkovskaya was an insignificant person without any influence .
still , she had obviously become a thorn in the side of official russia .
even if no one can prove an immediate complicity of the political leadership and especially vladimir putin himself - the murder of the incorruptible anna politkovskaya was only possible in an atmosphere of utter contempt for democratic principles , for fairness and open societal debates .
a critical journalist must prove prickly in an environment where democracy has degenerated into a superficial spectacle , where free media , parties and institutions are nothing but set design for the scheming of secret services and the intrigues of insular , elite circles .
on top of it all , her political enemies were additionally angered by the fact that her international reputation kept prompting the west to criticize russia .
that 's why today , one year later , the murder of the upright journalist still has a huge symbolic power .
it was an attack on basic democratic rights .
it was probably a decisive slap in the face of already curtailed freedoms of press and opinion .
it unveiled russia 's ugly side .
the fact that there 's still no real breakthrough in the investigation , but rather a hopeless mess of extenuations , spectacular arrests , judicial mistakes and dropped indictments shows only one thing : russia still has to prove that it is a democracy with an independent judiciary .

anything goes at the annual eurovision song contest - or not , as it happens .
the eastern europeans have been altogether too successful in recent years .
now the rules are being changed to smash their long-term reign . back in the good ol ' days , what you saw was what you got at the annual eurovision song contest .
but since the 21st century dawned , the event has been dominated by eastern europe - from estonia in 2001 to latvia in 2002 , ukraine in 2004 , through to serbia in 2007 . according to the conspiracy theorists , the whole thing is rigged .
the eastern europeans call in to vote for one another , they say , in a concerted effort to ostracize the west . old europe is sulking , and it does n't help that countries such as germany , france , spain and britain are those who foot the lion 's share of the event 's bill .
the whining reached unprecedented heights after the last contest , which saw marija serifovic from serbia sing her way to victory in helsinki .
moreover , eight of the top 10 were from eastern nations . a number of defeated countries , who shall remain nameless though they also have their own voting peculiarities , subsequently wasted no time calling on their broadcasters to boycott the event . the rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain does n't do well , desite picking up much of the tab although the controversies do nothing to detract from the contest 's popularity , with over 100 million tv viewers turning in for the annual schmaltz fest , fair play is apparently still a consideration . german public broadcaster ndr , which represents germany in the contest committee , this week said on its web site that the 42 participating countries have now agreed on new rules for the final in belgrade next may . according to the new guidelines , automatic entry to the final for the 10 best-placed nations of the previous year - usually eastern europeans - is to be abolished , excepting the first-place winner and , as before , the four big nations . in next year 's semi-finals , the first nine spots in each semi-final will be chosen by phone .
moreover , this year 's semi-final , two days before the final , is to be replaced next year by two semi-finals . a panel of judges will pick the 24th and last entrant to the final . " it 's an attempt to get a more balanced array in the final , " said manfred witt , the ndr official on the song contest committee . in a reference to last year 's debacle , witt said he hoped the former soviet and yugoslav republics would be scattered between the two semi-finals so that the shared tastes of those two blocs ' viewers no longer weighted the voting . who says politics and music do n't mix ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia has friends , but it also has enemies the eurovision is as famous for its highly charged voting system as it is for its music .
it can be hard to ignore the obvious political alliances dictating who gets " douze points " and who gets " nul . " the contest has long been perceived as a political institution , where judges and televoters award points based first and foremost on political affiliations . while greece likes to awards the maximum to cyprus , for example , turkey gives it the cold-shoulder .
but more to the point , countries such as estonia and latvia can always rely on their former soviet bloc neighbors - explaining the results of recent years . but now the goal posts have been moved , and it 's up to the music .

anything goes at the annual eurovision song contest - or not , as it happens .
the eastern europeans have been altogether too successful in recent years .
now the rules are being changed to smash their long-term reign . back in the good ol ' days , what you saw was what you got at the annual eurovision song contest .
but since the 21st century dawned , the event has been dominated by eastern europe - from estonia in 2001 to latvia in 2002 , ukraine in 2004 , through to serbia in 2007 . according to the conspiracy theorists , the whole thing is rigged .
the eastern europeans call in to vote for one another , they say , in a concerted effort to ostracize the west . old europe is sulking , and it does n't help that countries such as germany , france , spain and britain are those who foot the lion 's share of the event 's bill .
the whining reached unprecedented heights after the last contest , which saw marija serifovic from serbia sing her way to victory in helsinki .
moreover , eight of the top 10 were from eastern nations . a number of defeated countries , who shall remain nameless though they also have their own voting peculiarities , subsequently wasted no time calling on their broadcasters to boycott the event . the rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain does n't do well , desite picking up much of the tab although the controversies do nothing to detract from the contest 's popularity , with over 100 million tv viewers turning in for the annual schmaltz fest , fair play is apparently still a consideration . german public broadcaster ndr , which represents germany in the contest committee , this week said on its web site that the 42 participating countries have now agreed on new rules for the final in belgrade next may . according to the new guidelines , automatic entry to the final for the 10 best-placed nations of the previous year - usually eastern europeans - is to be abolished , excepting the first-place winner and , as before , the four big nations . in next year 's semi-finals , the first nine spots in each semi-final will be chosen by phone .
moreover , this year 's semi-final , two days before the final , is to be replaced next year by two semi-finals . a panel of judges will pick the 24th and last entrant to the final . " it 's an attempt to get a more balanced array in the final , " said manfred witt , the ndr official on the song contest committee . in a reference to last year 's debacle , witt said he hoped the former soviet and yugoslav republics would be scattered between the two semi-finals so that the shared tastes of those two blocs ' viewers no longer weighted the voting . who says politics and music do n't mix ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia has friends , but it also has enemies the eurovision is as famous for its highly charged voting system as it is for its music .
it can be hard to ignore the obvious political alliances dictating who gets " douze points " and who gets " nul . " the contest has long been perceived as a political institution , where judges and televoters award points based first and foremost on political affiliations . while greece likes to awards the maximum to cyprus , for example , turkey gives it the cold-shoulder .
but more to the point , countries such as estonia and latvia can always rely on their former soviet bloc neighbors - explaining the results of recent years . but now the goal posts have been moved , and it 's up to the music .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 07.10.2007 opinion : an attack on basic democratic rights in russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian journalist anna politkovskaya was shot one year ago .
the failure to solve her murder shows that the country is still far from being a democracy with an independent judiciary , says dw 's cornelia rabitz . she denounced corruption and abuse of power .
she relentlessly reported on murders , kidnappings and torture in chechnya .
she was tough on kremlin politics .
she never shied away from personal risks .
she was incorruptible , investigative , courageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz anna politkovskaya unsettled and disturbed people .
through her reporting , she made friends and gained respect and recognition , but she also made bitter enemies .
she 's become a role model for all those who see journalism as having moral , democratic and educational qualities .
she became an enemy figure for all the people she criticized .
anna politkovskaya was murdered a year ago on oct .
7 and became a victim of her profession and her moral-political self-image .
no one knows to this day who was behind the murder , who commissioned it , and who fired the fatal shots in the end .
only few in putin 's empire were courageous enough to support the journalist during her lifetime .
only few really showed any interest in her work .
too few .
soon after the murder , the russian president - during a visit to germany , by the way - said that politkovskaya was an insignificant person without any influence .
still , she had obviously become a thorn in the side of official russia .
even if no one can prove an immediate complicity of the political leadership and especially vladimir putin himself - the murder of the incorruptible anna politkovskaya was only possible in an atmosphere of utter contempt for democratic principles , for fairness and open societal debates .
a critical journalist must prove prickly in an environment where democracy has degenerated into a superficial spectacle , where free media , parties and institutions are nothing but set design for the scheming of secret services and the intrigues of insular , elite circles .
on top of it all , her political enemies were additionally angered by the fact that her international reputation kept prompting the west to criticize russia .
that 's why today , one year later , the murder of the upright journalist still has a huge symbolic power .
it was an attack on basic democratic rights .
it was probably a decisive slap in the face of already curtailed freedoms of press and opinion .
it unveiled russia 's ugly side .
the fact that there 's still no real breakthrough in the investigation , but rather a hopeless mess of extenuations , spectacular arrests , judicial mistakes and dropped indictments shows only one thing : russia still has to prove that it is a democracy with an independent judiciary .

even if no one can prove an immediate complicity of the political leadership and especially vladimir putin himself - the murder of the incorruptible anna politkovskaya was only possible in an atmosphere of utter contempt for democratic principles , for fairness and open societal debates .
a critical journalist must prove prickly in an environment where democracy has degenerated into a superficial spectacle , where free media , parties and institutions are nothing but set design for the scheming of secret services and the intrigues of insular , elite circles .
on top of it all , her political enemies were additionally angered by the fact that her international reputation kept prompting the west to criticize russia .
that 's why today , one year later , the murder of the upright journalist still has a huge symbolic power .
it was an attack on basic democratic rights .
it was probably a decisive slap in the face of already curtailed freedoms of press and opinion .
it unveiled russia 's ugly side .
the fact that there 's still no real breakthrough in the investigation , but rather a hopeless mess of extenuations , spectacular arrests , judicial mistakes and dropped indictments shows only one thing : russia still has to prove that it is a democracy with an independent judiciary .

the failure to solve her murder shows that the country is still far from being a democracy with an independent judiciary , says dw 's cornelia rabitz . she denounced corruption and abuse of power .
she relentlessly reported on murders , kidnappings and torture in chechnya .
she was tough on kremlin politics .
she never shied away from personal risks .
she was incorruptible , investigative , courageous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cornelia rabitz anna politkovskaya unsettled and disturbed people .
through her reporting , she made friends and gained respect and recognition , but she also made bitter enemies .
she 's become a role model for all those who see journalism as having moral , democratic and educational qualities .
she became an enemy figure for all the people she criticized .
anna politkovskaya was murdered a year ago on oct .
7 and became a victim of her profession and her moral-political self-image .
no one knows to this day who was behind the murder , who commissioned it , and who fired the fatal shots in the end .
only few in putin 's empire were courageous enough to support the journalist during her lifetime .
only few really showed any interest in her work .
too few .
soon after the murder , the russian president - during a visit to germany , by the way - said that politkovskaya was an insignificant person without any influence .
still , she had obviously become a thorn in the side of official russia .

15 july : within weeks of taking over from tony blair , mr brown appoints cabinet office minister ed miliband to work on labour 's manifesto for the next general election .
25 july : liberal democrat leader sir menzies campbell says he believes there is a one-in-six chance of a general election being held in october this year , with his party on standby .
1 august : labour vice-chairman martin salter says the party is " ready for an election whenever the pm calls one " , and on an " election footing " - but denies there is a timetable in place 22 september : the guessing game starts in earnest when douglas alexander , labour 's election co-ordinator , declares that labour is ready for a general election , whenever mr brown chooses to call one .
his comments come as mr brown arrives at bournemouth for his first party conference as pm .
meanwhile , housing minister yvette cooper says : " i think everybody is ready whenever gordon decides to have an election .
" i 'm sure he will give this a lot of serious consideration , that 's the way he approaches things . " 23 september : the prime minister repeatedly refuses to rule out an early election during a " curtain raiser " interview with andrew marr as the conference gets under way .
he declines to give a " running commentary " on his deliberations but also declines to rule out an autumn poll , insisting merely : " i think you 'll find that i 'm getting on with the job . "
in an observer interview the same day , foreign secretary david miliband suggests that labour is now looking forward to a second decade in power .
" we did n't solve all the problems of the world in 10 years in government .
well , this is a party that is planning how it is going to use the next 10 years to go further towards solving them , " he says .
26 september : election fever soars further when mr brown 's closest cabinet ally , ed balls , is asked on bbc radio 4 's today programme whether the bigger gamble was going to the country with labour riding high in the polls or waiting until next year or beyond .
mr balls , the children , schools and families secretary , says : " it 's a very interesting question as to where the gamble really lies . "
but he adds : " i think the priority for him is that the country knows that his priority is delivering on their priorities . "
later that day universities secretary john denham tells the bbc an early election looks " more likely than not " .
he says it would be tempting to hold an election if it means that rather than having the current 60-odd labour majority for two years the party could have a 100 majority in parliament for five years .
and at a conference fringe meeting that night , women 's minister barbara follett goes a step further , claiming there was an " 80 % chance " of an autumn election , suggesting 25 october , 1 or 8 november as possible dates .
meanwhile , on the same day , sources close to leader david cameron say the tories have a £ 10m war chest , a draft manifesto and candidates selected in their top 200 target seats .
27 september : any doubts that there is a real chance of a snap election being called are blown away as labour tells those who will work for it in an election campaign to come and work for them .
the conference week ends with labour enjoying opinion polls leads of up to 11 points , further fuelling the expectation of an early election .
2 october : gordon brown flies out to iraq - and announces a cut in troop numbers a week before his long-planned statement to parliament on iraq .
the opposition says this broke with the convention of not trying to upstage party conferences .
3 october : conservative leader david cameron , in his address at his party conference , challenges mr brown to call an election .
" let people decide who can make the changes that we really need in our country .
call that election .
we will fight .
britain will win . " 4 october : in a financial times interview , chancellor alistair darling says the election date is " the prime minister 's call " .
but he adds : " i did n't see anything in the last three or four days in blackpool that makes me think that the tories have resolved some of their ideological contradictions . "
transport secretary ruth kelly suggests on bbc1 's question time that the cabinet remains confident of beating the tories .
" when i heard david cameron say ' bring it on ' , i had one thought : ' be careful what you wish for ' , " she says .
5 october : the government announces it will tell parliament about its comprehensive spending review - which sets long-term spending plans - and pre-budget report on october 9 rather than later in the month .

15 july : within weeks of taking over from tony blair , mr brown appoints cabinet office minister ed miliband to work on labour 's manifesto for the next general election .
25 july : liberal democrat leader sir menzies campbell says he believes there is a one-in-six chance of a general election being held in october this year , with his party on standby .
1 august : labour vice-chairman martin salter says the party is " ready for an election whenever the pm calls one " , and on an " election footing " - but denies there is a timetable in place 22 september : the guessing game starts in earnest when douglas alexander , labour 's election co-ordinator , declares that labour is ready for a general election , whenever mr brown chooses to call one .
his comments come as mr brown arrives at bournemouth for his first party conference as pm .
meanwhile , housing minister yvette cooper says : " i think everybody is ready whenever gordon decides to have an election .
" i 'm sure he will give this a lot of serious consideration , that 's the way he approaches things . " 23 september : the prime minister repeatedly refuses to rule out an early election during a " curtain raiser " interview with andrew marr as the conference gets under way .
he declines to give a " running commentary " on his deliberations but also declines to rule out an autumn poll , insisting merely : " i think you 'll find that i 'm getting on with the job . "
in an observer interview the same day , foreign secretary david miliband suggests that labour is now looking forward to a second decade in power .
" we did n't solve all the problems of the world in 10 years in government .
well , this is a party that is planning how it is going to use the next 10 years to go further towards solving them , " he says .
26 september : election fever soars further when mr brown 's closest cabinet ally , ed balls , is asked on bbc radio 4 's today programme whether the bigger gamble was going to the country with labour riding high in the polls or waiting until next year or beyond .
mr balls , the children , schools and families secretary , says : " it 's a very interesting question as to where the gamble really lies . "
but he adds : " i think the priority for him is that the country knows that his priority is delivering on their priorities . "
later that day universities secretary john denham tells the bbc an early election looks " more likely than not " .
he says it would be tempting to hold an election if it means that rather than having the current 60-odd labour majority for two years the party could have a 100 majority in parliament for five years .
and at a conference fringe meeting that night , women 's minister barbara follett goes a step further , claiming there was an " 80 % chance " of an autumn election , suggesting 25 october , 1 or 8 november as possible dates .
meanwhile , on the same day , sources close to leader david cameron say the tories have a £ 10m war chest , a draft manifesto and candidates selected in their top 200 target seats .
27 september : any doubts that there is a real chance of a snap election being called are blown away as labour tells those who will work for it in an election campaign to come and work for them .
the conference week ends with labour enjoying opinion polls leads of up to 11 points , further fuelling the expectation of an early election .
2 october : gordon brown flies out to iraq - and announces a cut in troop numbers a week before his long-planned statement to parliament on iraq .
the opposition says this broke with the convention of not trying to upstage party conferences .
3 october : conservative leader david cameron , in his address at his party conference , challenges mr brown to call an election .
" let people decide who can make the changes that we really need in our country .
call that election .
we will fight .
britain will win . " 4 october : in a financial times interview , chancellor alistair darling says the election date is " the prime minister 's call " .
but he adds : " i did n't see anything in the last three or four days in blackpool that makes me think that the tories have resolved some of their ideological contradictions . "
transport secretary ruth kelly suggests on bbc1 's question time that the cabinet remains confident of beating the tories .
" when i heard david cameron say ' bring it on ' , i had one thought : ' be careful what you wish for ' , " she says .
5 october : the government announces it will tell parliament about its comprehensive spending review - which sets long-term spending plans - and pre-budget report on october 9 rather than later in the month .
5/6 october : a flurry of opinion polls taken after mr cameron 's speech at the end of the conservative conference suggest a much improved position for the party - with one putting it 6 points ahead of labour in the key marginal seats .

15 july : within weeks of taking over from tony blair , mr brown appoints cabinet office minister ed miliband to work on labour 's manifesto for the next general election .
25 july : liberal democrat leader sir menzies campbell says he believes there is a one-in-six chance of a general election being held in october this year , with his party on standby .
1 august : labour vice-chairman martin salter says the party is " ready for an election whenever the pm calls one " , and on an " election footing " - but denies there is a timetable in place 22 september : the guessing game starts in earnest when douglas alexander , labour 's election co-ordinator , declares that labour is ready for a general election , whenever mr brown chooses to call one .
his comments come as mr brown arrives at bournemouth for his first party conference as pm .
meanwhile , housing minister yvette cooper says : " i think everybody is ready whenever gordon decides to have an election .
" i 'm sure he will give this a lot of serious consideration , that 's the way he approaches things . " 23 september : the prime minister repeatedly refuses to rule out an early election during a " curtain raiser " interview with andrew marr as the conference gets under way .
he declines to give a " running commentary " on his deliberations but also declines to rule out an autumn poll , insisting merely : " i think you 'll find that i 'm getting on with the job . "
in an observer interview the same day , foreign secretary david miliband suggests that labour is now looking forward to a second decade in power .
" we did n't solve all the problems of the world in 10 years in government .
well , this is a party that is planning how it is going to use the next 10 years to go further towards solving them , " he says .
26 september : election fever soars further when mr brown 's closest cabinet ally , ed balls , is asked on bbc radio 4 's today programme whether the bigger gamble was going to the country with labour riding high in the polls or waiting until next year or beyond .
mr balls , the children , schools and families secretary , says : " it 's a very interesting question as to where the gamble really lies . "
but he adds : " i think the priority for him is that the country knows that his priority is delivering on their priorities . "
later that day universities secretary john denham tells the bbc an early election looks " more likely than not " .
he says it would be tempting to hold an election if it means that rather than having the current 60-odd labour majority for two years the party could have a 100 majority in parliament for five years .
and at a conference fringe meeting that night , women 's minister barbara follett goes a step further , claiming there was an " 80 % chance " of an autumn election , suggesting 25 october , 1 or 8 november as possible dates .
meanwhile , on the same day , sources close to leader david cameron say the tories have a £ 10m war chest , a draft manifesto and candidates selected in their top 200 target seats .
27 september : any doubts that there is a real chance of a snap election being called are blown away as labour tells those who will work for it in an election campaign to come and work for them .
the conference week ends with labour enjoying opinion polls leads of up to 11 points , further fuelling the expectation of an early election .
2 october : gordon brown flies out to iraq - and announces a cut in troop numbers a week before his long-planned statement to parliament on iraq .
the opposition says this broke with the convention of not trying to upstage party conferences .
3 october : conservative leader david cameron , in his address at his party conference , challenges mr brown to call an election .
" let people decide who can make the changes that we really need in our country .
call that election .
we will fight .
britain will win . " 4 october : in a financial times interview , chancellor alistair darling says the election date is " the prime minister 's call " .
but he adds : " i did n't see anything in the last three or four days in blackpool that makes me think that the tories have resolved some of their ideological contradictions . "
transport secretary ruth kelly suggests on bbc1 's question time that the cabinet remains confident of beating the tories .
" when i heard david cameron say ' bring it on ' , i had one thought : ' be careful what you wish for ' , " she says .
5 october : the government announces it will tell parliament about its comprehensive spending review - which sets long-term spending plans - and pre-budget report on october 9 rather than later in the month .
5/6 october : a flurry of opinion polls taken after mr cameron 's speech at the end of the conservative conference suggest a much improved position for the party - with one putting it 6 points ahead of labour in the key marginal seats .
6 october : prime minister gordon brown says he will not hold an autumn election as he wants a chance to implement his " vision " for the country .
