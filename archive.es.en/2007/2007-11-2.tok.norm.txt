almost one year after the eu partially froze turkey 's membership talks , the report - due to be released next week - urges turkey " to renew the momentum of political reforms " and states that " significant further efforts are needed in particular on freedom of expression , on civilian control of the military , and on the rights of non-muslim communities . "
turkey chastized on freedom of speech the eu suspended eight chapters of turkey 's 35-chapter eu negotiations package last year , citing ankara 's continuing blockade on traffic from eu member state cyprus - which is illegal under an eu-turkey customs agreement – as its main reason .
turkey has made " no progress on normalizing bilateral relations " with nicosia since then , the draft report states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu accession bid is one of the most controversial the eu is also concerned about the continued restrictions in freedom of speech and concludes that " the turkish legal system does not fully guarantee freedom of expression in line with european standards " .
the number of prosecutions of journalists , intellectuals and human rights activists for expressing non-violent opinions is on the rise .
the number of people prosecuted almost doubled in 2006 from 2005 and there were further increases in 2007 .
more than half of these cases were brought under the turkish penal code and many of those under article 301 which makes it an offense to insult " turkishness . "

eu worries about turkish military brussels is also unhappy about the fact that " the armed forces continue to exercise significant political influence , " in turkey and that " no progress " had been seen in the area of protection of minorities and ensuring cultural diversity in line with eu principles .

however it notes that the pkk separatist group is on the eu 's terrorist list and talks of a " further deterioration of the situation in terms of attacks by the pkk and other terrorist groups . "
public opinion across the eu is hardening against turkey 's eu membership bid and president nicolas sarkozy of france leads a group of countries opposed to full eu membership for turkey , preferring a looser association with ankara instead .
macedonia not on track either the report , which covers the whole enlargement process , also said eu accession talks with macedonia are unlikely to begin before 2009 at the earliest , dashing skopje 's hopes of them starting next year , due to political problems in the former yugoslav republic , an eu source said on tuesday .

macedonia was officially made a candidate for membership in 2005 , four years after an accord brokered by the eu and nato ended a stand-off between the majority macedonian and minority albanian communities which threatened to plunge the country into civil war .
the eu insisted that entry talks could only begin when it was satisfied with macedonia 's progress on the rule of law , the rights of the albanian minority and the fight against organized crime and corruption .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 02.11.2007 germany reports pkk funding as tensions rise on iraq border großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tensions have been rising on the turkish-iraqi border while the tensions between turkey and kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- rebels continue , reports in germany suggest that kurds living in the country are forced to hand over millions of euros to the group . experts believe that while some of germany 's 600,000 kurdish immigrants give the money willingly to fund its separatist campaign in southeastern turkey , others are pressured into contributing under duress .
the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
a spokesman for germany 's bfv domestic intelligence services , commenting on the reports , said that the kongra-gel , the pkk 's political wing , is blackmailing kurdish immigrants with mafia-like demands for protection money of one month 's salary a year or much more in the case of wealthy businessmen .
" in this way they collect millions of euros in germany every year , " the spokesperson stated .
the reports came to light in the wake of violent clashes between kurds and turkish nationalists in berlin , heilbronn and mülheim at last weekend .
in berlin , 18 policemen were injured trying to break up fighting between the two sides , after turkish nationalists held a march in support of ankara 's threat to launch strikes on pkk bases in northern iraq .
the german intelligence services have since stepped up their surveillance of pkk activists in germany .
they estimate that there are 11,500 pkk members in germany , of whom 1,000 live in berlin .
germany banned the pkk in 1993 after it carried out a campaign of fire-bombings on turkish and german institutions in berlin .
pkk activity in germany intensifies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german kurds are pressured to contribute to the pkk cause experts have been monitoring an intensification of pkk activities in germany , which is home to 2.5 million turks - the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
pkk activity slowed down in 2003 but has gradually been picking up in the four years since , according to reports .
according to german police sources , the pkk is also involved in drug trafficking in germany and uses the spoils to fund its separatist struggle .
police have confirmed that several investigations have revealed a link between the pkk and drug dealers .
turkish intelligence services believe that the pkk raises 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- a year and last year spent 15 million euros on arms , notably in iraq .
in april , police confiscated 16,000 euros in banknotes in a raid on 32 suspected members of the pkk in bavaria in southern germany .
in recent years , a number of pkk members have been arrested in germany for securing financing for the group , which has been branded a terrorist organization by turkey , the united states and the european union .
last year german police arrested a turk of kurdish origin suspected of being the leader of the pkk and kongra-gel in germany and heading its fundraising and propaganda activities here .
turkey slams germany for playing down pkk however , the turkish community in germany has recently accused the country 's media of playing down the threat posed by the pkk .
germany 's largest turkish-language newspaper , hürriyet wrote last week that " the german media have a blind spot when it comes to the pkk , referring to repeated descriptions of the organization as " kurdish rebels , " " pkk members " , " separatists " and " radical kurds . "
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also criticized european countries recently for failing to arrest and extradite wanted kurdish militants to turkey .
istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said at a symposium in istanbul last weekend .
" the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad , " he said .
rice in turkey as fears of cross-border strikes mount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice wants to avoid a turkish incursion into iraq meanwhile , turkey refused to rule out cross-border attacks on pkk positions in iraq but tried to ally fears by saying such an attack would target guerrilla bases and not amount to an " invasion . "
us secretary of state condoleezza rice arrived in ankara on friday to urge turkey not to destabilize northern iraq by launching any cross-border military strike .
rice is to meet turkish president abdullah gul , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minister ali babacan on friday afternoon .
" anything that would destabilize the north of iraq is not going to be in turkey 's interest , " rice said before arriving for the talks .
" it is not going to be in our interest .
it is not going to be in iraq 's interest .
so that has been the reason for urging restraint .
" the first point that we have to underscore is that turkey , the united states and iraq have a common enemy in the pkk , " she added .
" we want to develop a very effective strategy for dealing with this threat but we are not going to be able to do this without coordination of the three nations . "
bush , erdogan to discuss pkk strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush sees the pkk as a common enemy both baghdad and washington strongly oppose any unilateral turkish action in northern iraq on the grounds that it would destabilize the only relatively calm region of the war-torn country .
us president george w. bush will meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in washington next week to discuss cooperation against the iraq-based kurdish fighters .
" i look forward to visiting with prime minister erdogan on this important subject as to how we can work together to prevent people from coming out of mountain ranges to do harm to turkish troops , " bush told reporters on thursday .
" we will have a good , substantive discussion , as you would expect allies to do .
and i 'm looking forward to seeing him here in the oval office . "
the pkk uses bases in the mountainous region for cross-border attacks as part of its 23-year campaign for self-rule in turkey 's mainly kurdish southeast .
turkey has reportedly massed up to 100,000 troops on the border with iraq and has threatened a military incursion to strike at the pkk bases unless baghdad and washington make good on promises to crack down on the rebels .
turkish troops have been engaged in major operations targeting the pkk since october 21 when a group of rebels , who ankara says infiltrated from northern iraq , ambushed a military unit , killing 12 soldiers and capturing eight .
the army says it has since killed 80 rebels on turkish territory .
pkk calls for peace plan as ankara announces sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments and sanctions put pressure on the pkk a top pkk commander on thursday called on ankara to present a peace plan that could end the group 's rebellion , which has claimed more than 37,000 lives since it began in 1984 .
ankara categorically refuses to have any contact with or make any concessions to the pkk .
turkey increased the pressure on northern iraq thursday by imposing economic sanctions that specifically target the pkk and its supporters .
foreign minister ali babacan said that a list of measures had been drawn up and that some had already been put in place but said turkey would not be announcing what these measures were .
the foreign minister said the sanctions were not aimed at the people of iraq but were specifically targeted at the pkk and those who support them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
a spokesman for germany 's bfv domestic intelligence services , commenting on the reports , said that the kongra-gel , the pkk 's political wing , is blackmailing kurdish immigrants with mafia-like demands for protection money of one month 's salary a year or much more in the case of wealthy businessmen .
" in this way they collect millions of euros in germany every year , " the spokesperson stated .
the reports came to light in the wake of violent clashes between kurds and turkish nationalists in berlin , heilbronn and mülheim at last weekend .
in berlin , 18 policemen were injured trying to break up fighting between the two sides , after turkish nationalists held a march in support of ankara 's threat to launch strikes on pkk bases in northern iraq .
the german intelligence services have since stepped up their surveillance of pkk activists in germany .
they estimate that there are 11,500 pkk members in germany , of whom 1,000 live in berlin .
germany banned the pkk in 1993 after it carried out a campaign of fire-bombings on turkish and german institutions in berlin .
pkk activity in germany intensifies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german kurds are pressured to contribute to the pkk cause experts have been monitoring an intensification of pkk activities in germany , which is home to 2.5 million turks - the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
pkk activity slowed down in 2003 but has gradually been picking up in the four years since , according to reports .
according to german police sources , the pkk is also involved in drug trafficking in germany and uses the spoils to fund its separatist struggle .
police have confirmed that several investigations have revealed a link between the pkk and drug dealers .
turkish intelligence services believe that the pkk raises 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- a year and last year spent 15 million euros on arms , notably in iraq .
in april , police confiscated 16,000 euros in banknotes in a raid on 32 suspected members of the pkk in bavaria in southern germany .
in recent years , a number of pkk members have been arrested in germany for securing financing for the group , which has been branded a terrorist organization by turkey , the united states and the european union .
last year german police arrested a turk of kurdish origin suspected of being the leader of the pkk and kongra-gel in germany and heading its fundraising and propaganda activities here .
turkey slams germany for playing down pkk however , the turkish community in germany has recently accused the country 's media of playing down the threat posed by the pkk .
germany 's largest turkish-language newspaper , hürriyet wrote last week that " the german media have a blind spot when it comes to the pkk , referring to repeated descriptions of the organization as " kurdish rebels , " " pkk members " , " separatists " and " radical kurds . "
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also criticized european countries recently for failing to arrest and extradite wanted kurdish militants to turkey .
istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said at a symposium in istanbul last weekend .
" the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad , " he said .
rice in turkey as fears of cross-border strikes mount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice wants to avoid a turkish incursion into iraq meanwhile , turkey refused to rule out cross-border attacks on pkk positions in iraq but tried to ally fears by saying such an attack would target guerrilla bases and not amount to an " invasion . "
us secretary of state condoleezza rice arrived in ankara on friday to urge turkey not to destabilize northern iraq by launching any cross-border military strike .
rice is to meet turkish president abdullah gul , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minister ali babacan on friday afternoon .
" anything that would destabilize the north of iraq is not going to be in turkey 's interest , " rice said before arriving for the talks .
" it is not going to be in our interest .
it is not going to be in iraq 's interest .
so that has been the reason for urging restraint .
" the first point that we have to underscore is that turkey , the united states and iraq have a common enemy in the pkk , " she added .
" we want to develop a very effective strategy for dealing with this threat but we are not going to be able to do this without coordination of the three nations . "
bush , erdogan to discuss pkk strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush sees the pkk as a common enemy both baghdad and washington strongly oppose any unilateral turkish action in northern iraq on the grounds that it would destabilize the only relatively calm region of the war-torn country .
us president george w. bush will meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in washington next week to discuss cooperation against the iraq-based kurdish fighters .
" i look forward to visiting with prime minister erdogan on this important subject as to how we can work together to prevent people from coming out of mountain ranges to do harm to turkish troops , " bush told reporters on thursday .
" we will have a good , substantive discussion , as you would expect allies to do .
and i 'm looking forward to seeing him here in the oval office . "
the pkk uses bases in the mountainous region for cross-border attacks as part of its 23-year campaign for self-rule in turkey 's mainly kurdish southeast .
turkey has reportedly massed up to 100,000 troops on the border with iraq and has threatened a military incursion to strike at the pkk bases unless baghdad and washington make good on promises to crack down on the rebels .
turkish troops have been engaged in major operations targeting the pkk since october 21 when a group of rebels , who ankara says infiltrated from northern iraq , ambushed a military unit , killing 12 soldiers and capturing eight .
the army says it has since killed 80 rebels on turkish territory .
pkk calls for peace plan as ankara announces sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments and sanctions put pressure on the pkk a top pkk commander on thursday called on ankara to present a peace plan that could end the group 's rebellion , which has claimed more than 37,000 lives since it began in 1984 .
ankara categorically refuses to have any contact with or make any concessions to the pkk .
turkey increased the pressure on northern iraq thursday by imposing economic sanctions that specifically target the pkk and its supporters .
foreign minister ali babacan said that a list of measures had been drawn up and that some had already been put in place but said turkey would not be announcing what these measures were .
the foreign minister said the sanctions were not aimed at the people of iraq but were specifically targeted at the pkk and those who support them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
a spokesman for germany 's bfv domestic intelligence services , commenting on the reports , said that the kongra-gel , the pkk 's political wing , is blackmailing kurdish immigrants with mafia-like demands for protection money of one month 's salary a year or much more in the case of wealthy businessmen .
" in this way they collect millions of euros in germany every year , " the spokesperson stated .
the reports came to light in the wake of violent clashes between kurds and turkish nationalists in berlin , heilbronn and mülheim at last weekend .
in berlin , 18 policemen were injured trying to break up fighting between the two sides , after turkish nationalists held a march in support of ankara 's threat to launch strikes on pkk bases in northern iraq .
the german intelligence services have since stepped up their surveillance of pkk activists in germany .
they estimate that there are 11,500 pkk members in germany , of whom 1,000 live in berlin .
germany banned the pkk in 1993 after it carried out a campaign of fire-bombings on turkish and german institutions in berlin .
pkk activity in germany intensifies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german kurds are pressured to contribute to the pkk cause experts have been monitoring an intensification of pkk activities in germany , which is home to 2.5 million turks - the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
pkk activity slowed down in 2003 but has gradually been picking up in the four years since , according to reports .
according to german police sources , the pkk is also involved in drug trafficking in germany and uses the spoils to fund its separatist struggle .
police have confirmed that several investigations have revealed a link between the pkk and drug dealers .
turkish intelligence services believe that the pkk raises 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- a year and last year spent 15 million euros on arms , notably in iraq .
in april , police confiscated 16,000 euros in banknotes in a raid on 32 suspected members of the pkk in bavaria in southern germany .
in recent years , a number of pkk members have been arrested in germany for securing financing for the group , which has been branded a terrorist organization by turkey , the united states and the european union .
last year german police arrested a turk of kurdish origin suspected of being the leader of the pkk and kongra-gel in germany and heading its fundraising and propaganda activities here .
turkey slams germany for playing down pkk however , the turkish community in germany has recently accused the country 's media of playing down the threat posed by the pkk .
germany 's largest turkish-language newspaper , hürriyet wrote last week that " the german media have a blind spot when it comes to the pkk , referring to repeated descriptions of the organization as " kurdish rebels , " " pkk members " , " separatists " and " radical kurds . "
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also criticized european countries recently for failing to arrest and extradite wanted kurdish militants to turkey .
istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said at a symposium in istanbul last weekend .
" the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad , " he said .
rice in turkey as fears of cross-border strikes mount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice wants to avoid a turkish incursion into iraq meanwhile , turkey refused to rule out cross-border attacks on pkk positions in iraq but tried to ally fears by saying such an attack would target guerrilla bases and not amount to an " invasion . "
us secretary of state condoleezza rice arrived in ankara on friday to urge turkey not to destabilize northern iraq by launching any cross-border military strike .
rice is to meet turkish president abdullah gul , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minister ali babacan on friday afternoon .
" anything that would destabilize the north of iraq is not going to be in turkey 's interest , " rice said before arriving for the talks .
" it is not going to be in our interest .
it is not going to be in iraq 's interest .
so that has been the reason for urging restraint .
" the first point that we have to underscore is that turkey , the united states and iraq have a common enemy in the pkk , " she added .
" we want to develop a very effective strategy for dealing with this threat but we are not going to be able to do this without coordination of the three nations . "
bush , erdogan to discuss pkk strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush sees the pkk as a common enemy both baghdad and washington strongly oppose any unilateral turkish action in northern iraq on the grounds that it would destabilize the only relatively calm region of the war-torn country .
us president george w. bush will meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in washington next week to discuss cooperation against the iraq-based kurdish fighters .
" i look forward to visiting with prime minister erdogan on this important subject as to how we can work together to prevent people from coming out of mountain ranges to do harm to turkish troops , " bush told reporters on thursday .
" we will have a good , substantive discussion , as you would expect allies to do .
and i 'm looking forward to seeing him here in the oval office . "
the pkk uses bases in the mountainous region for cross-border attacks as part of its 23-year campaign for self-rule in turkey 's mainly kurdish southeast .
turkey has reportedly massed up to 100,000 troops on the border with iraq and has threatened a military incursion to strike at the pkk bases unless baghdad and washington make good on promises to crack down on the rebels .
turkish troops have been engaged in major operations targeting the pkk since october 21 when a group of rebels , who ankara says infiltrated from northern iraq , ambushed a military unit , killing 12 soldiers and capturing eight .
the army says it has since killed 80 rebels on turkish territory .
pkk calls for peace plan as ankara announces sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments and sanctions put pressure on the pkk a top pkk commander on thursday called on ankara to present a peace plan that could end the group 's rebellion , which has claimed more than 37,000 lives since it began in 1984 .
ankara categorically refuses to have any contact with or make any concessions to the pkk .
turkey increased the pressure on northern iraq thursday by imposing economic sanctions that specifically target the pkk and its supporters .
foreign minister ali babacan said that a list of measures had been drawn up and that some had already been put in place but said turkey would not be announcing what these measures were .
the foreign minister said the sanctions were not aimed at the people of iraq but were specifically targeted at the pkk and those who support them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 02.11.2007 turkey , balkan states lagging on reforms , eu report says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu project continues but those wanting to join must fulfil its strict criteria a key annual progress report by the european commission says reforms are slowing down both in turkey and the western balkans , indicating that eu membership is still a distant dream for the countries . amid preparations for a new committee on the future of the eu which may try to determine where europe 's frontiers should lie and how much further the bloc should expand , the eu commission 's annual progress report is set to chide ankara for its lack of progress on reforms .
almost one year after the eu partially froze turkey 's membership talks , the report - due to be released next week - urges turkey " to renew the momentum of political reforms " and states that " significant further efforts are needed in particular on freedom of expression , on civilian control of the military , and on the rights of non-muslim communities . "
turkey chastized on freedom of speech the eu suspended eight chapters of turkey 's 35-chapter eu negotiations package last year , citing ankara 's continuing blockade on traffic from eu member state cyprus - which is illegal under an eu-turkey customs agreement – as its main reason .
turkey has made " no progress on normalizing bilateral relations " with nicosia since then , the draft report states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu accession bid is one of the most controversial the eu is also concerned about the continued restrictions in freedom of speech and concludes that " the turkish legal system does not fully guarantee freedom of expression in line with european standards " .
the number of prosecutions of journalists , intellectuals and human rights activists for expressing non-violent opinions is on the rise .
the number of people prosecuted almost doubled in 2006 from 2005 and there were further increases in 2007 .
more than half of these cases were brought under the turkish penal code and many of those under article 301 which makes it an offense to insult " turkishness . "
together with the murder of a journalist , hrant dink , this has helped create a climate of self-censorship the draft document says .
eu worries about turkish military brussels is also unhappy about the fact that " the armed forces continue to exercise significant political influence , " in turkey and that " no progress " had been seen in the area of protection of minorities and ensuring cultural diversity in line with eu principles .
the draft takes an even-handed approach on the kurdish issue saying that turkey made " no progress in the area of cultural rights . "
however it notes that the pkk separatist group is on the eu 's terrorist list and talks of a " further deterioration of the situation in terms of attacks by the pkk and other terrorist groups . "
public opinion across the eu is hardening against turkey 's eu membership bid and president nicolas sarkozy of france leads a group of countries opposed to full eu membership for turkey , preferring a looser association with ankara instead .
macedonia not on track either the report , which covers the whole enlargement process , also said eu accession talks with macedonia are unlikely to begin before 2009 at the earliest , dashing skopje 's hopes of them starting next year , due to political problems in the former yugoslav republic , an eu source said on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enlargement commissioner rehn with ex-macedonian prime minister buckovski " they lost a lot of time this year when -lrb- the main ethnic albanian party -rrb- was out of parliament .
they still need to work better on political dialogue to have a climate conducive for reforms , " the source told reuters , speaking on condition of anonymity .
macedonia was officially made a candidate for membership in 2005 , four years after an accord brokered by the eu and nato ended a stand-off between the majority macedonian and minority albanian communities which threatened to plunge the country into civil war .
the eu insisted that entry talks could only begin when it was satisfied with macedonia 's progress on the rule of law , the rights of the albanian minority and the fight against organized crime and corruption .
the commission report is expected to cite the absence of dialogue with the albanian community , the politicization of the civil service and the blockage of key judicial reforms as its reasons for halting the talks .
eu cites corruption , slow progress on law reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia has made progress but more is needed a report in macedonia 's leading newspaper , dnevnik , quoted the draft european commission report as saying that " several laws are still blocked , especially judicial reform " and that " corruption is widespread and a serious problem " .
the continued quarreling between the government and the opposition party representing the country 's large ethnic albanian minority , the mass sackings of civil servants after the change of government in 2006 and the divisions between macedonia 's president and prime minister are also cited by the draft report as being problematic , the paper wrote .
there was also a reference to the dispute between macedonia and greece over the country 's name .
according to dnevnik , the eu report urged to renew the two countries to resolve their differences which arise from greece 's opposition over the use of the name " macedonia " , which is also the name of greece 's northern province .
athens considers its use a sign of territorial ambition .
the neighbors have been involved in un-led talks for a compromise since 1993 , with little progress .
croatia 's eu future in its own hands accession negotiations with croatia have reached full cruising speed , with talks under way on 14 of the 35 chapters but the commission draft warns zagreb that the progress of its membership bid is entirely in its own hands .
the reports states that croatia needs to move faster on reforming its judiciary and fighting corruption while the continuing problem of state aid to industry remains an issue .
however , the report says that democracy and the rule of law have been strengthened and macroeconomic stability maintained .
croatia started eu accession talks in 2005 along with turkey but has forged ahead and is the only candidate likely to make it to the 27-nation bloc in the next five years , according to eu sources . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rice in turkey as fears of cross-border strikes mount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice wants to avoid a turkish incursion into iraq meanwhile , turkey refused to rule out cross-border attacks on pkk positions in iraq but tried to ally fears by saying such an attack would target guerrilla bases and not amount to an " invasion . "
us secretary of state condoleezza rice arrived in ankara on friday to urge turkey not to destabilize northern iraq by launching any cross-border military strike .
rice is to meet turkish president abdullah gul , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minister ali babacan on friday afternoon .
" anything that would destabilize the north of iraq is not going to be in turkey 's interest , " rice said before arriving for the talks .
" it is not going to be in our interest .
it is not going to be in iraq 's interest .
so that has been the reason for urging restraint .
" the first point that we have to underscore is that turkey , the united states and iraq have a common enemy in the pkk , " she added .
" we want to develop a very effective strategy for dealing with this threat but we are not going to be able to do this without coordination of the three nations . "
bush , erdogan to discuss pkk strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush sees the pkk as a common enemy both baghdad and washington strongly oppose any unilateral turkish action in northern iraq on the grounds that it would destabilize the only relatively calm region of the war-torn country .
us president george w. bush will meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in washington next week to discuss cooperation against the iraq-based kurdish fighters .
" i look forward to visiting with prime minister erdogan on this important subject as to how we can work together to prevent people from coming out of mountain ranges to do harm to turkish troops , " bush told reporters on thursday .
" we will have a good , substantive discussion , as you would expect allies to do .
and i 'm looking forward to seeing him here in the oval office . "
the pkk uses bases in the mountainous region for cross-border attacks as part of its 23-year campaign for self-rule in turkey 's mainly kurdish southeast .
turkey has reportedly massed up to 100,000 troops on the border with iraq and has threatened a military incursion to strike at the pkk bases unless baghdad and washington make good on promises to crack down on the rebels .
turkish troops have been engaged in major operations targeting the pkk since october 21 when a group of rebels , who ankara says infiltrated from northern iraq , ambushed a military unit , killing 12 soldiers and capturing eight .
the army says it has since killed 80 rebels on turkish territory .
pkk calls for peace plan as ankara announces sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments and sanctions put pressure on the pkk a top pkk commander on thursday called on ankara to present a peace plan that could end the group 's rebellion , which has claimed more than 37,000 lives since it began in 1984 .
ankara categorically refuses to have any contact with or make any concessions to the pkk .
turkey increased the pressure on northern iraq thursday by imposing economic sanctions that specifically target the pkk and its supporters .
foreign minister ali babacan said that a list of measures had been drawn up and that some had already been put in place but said turkey would not be announcing what these measures were .
the foreign minister said the sanctions were not aimed at the people of iraq but were specifically targeted at the pkk and those who support them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

work on a new exhibition space at former gestapo headquarters began on friday . a 200-meter -lrb- 656-foot -rrb- strip of the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse marks part of the boundary between the famous kreuzberg district and a neighborhood that was once in the eastern part of the german capital .
it is one of the few remaining vestiges of the one-time symbol of a divided europe .
but besides being the very focal point of the cold war , it was also here that adolf hitler 's secret police masterminded the 12-year reign of terror from 1933 to 1945 that led to the extermination of six million european jews and countless other victims .
this was the location of the headquarters of the much-feared gestapo . since 1987 , black-and-white photo reproductions documenting the nazi terror have been posted in a temporary outdoor exhibit near the ruins of the former gestapo and reich security offices , which were destroyed during the war by allied bombs . while the exhibit , called the " topography of terror , " draws roughly 400,000 visitors a year , for two decades now efforts have been underway to create a more permanent exhibition , but the project has been plagued by expensive false starts . on friday , nov .
2 , a ground-breaking ceremony took place attended by berlin mayor klaus wowereit and german culture minister bernd neumann for a new " remembrance and documentation center " in the german capital for victims of wartime gestapo terror . " it 's true .
we are going to build the remembrance and documentation center - finally , perhaps , some people will say , " wowereit said . focus on nazi perpetrators , not victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other exhibits devoted to nazi era focus on victims of holocaust although berlin is already home to exhibitions that look at the nazi genocide , such as daniel libeskind 's jewish museum and peter eisenman 's holocaust memorial , the focus of the topography of terror foundation is different , said executive director andreas nachema .
" this is not a memorial and the focus is not on jews and other victims , such as gypsies or communists .
we focus on the nazi perpetrators , the secret police and the ordinary germans who supported them , " he said .
" visitors can come to this historical site in berlin , which was once the artery of the third reich , and they should walk away with a feel for the dimension of what happened , " added nachema , who pointed out that the architectural design of the building should not get in the way of , but serve the exhibits .
in 1993 , swiss architect peter zumthor was commissioned to design a permanent home for the " topography of terror " exhibition on the vacant lot between the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse and wilhelmstrasse in the heart of the city . but serious technical flaws in the design became apparent and the design itself came under fire for , for example , letting in too much natural sunlight that would make it difficult to read the text accompanying the exhibits . " zumthor 's design concept was impossible to build , " said stefanie endlich , the foundation 's publicist and a member of the board . in addition , there were concerns that a building and exhibit focusing on the nazi perpetrators could lead to the site becoming a place of pilgrimage for neo-nazis , long a quandary that urban planners in germany have faced .
technical and budgetary problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 200-meter stretch of the berlin wall will remain at the site by 1999 the project , for which the city had earmarked 37 million deutschmarks -lrb- € 19 million or $ 27.5 million -rrb- , had all but collapsed .
although about two-thirds of the budget had been spent , only the foundation and a few supports had been built .
several construction companies working on the project went bankrupt .
new estimates found that another 28 million euros would be needed to complete the building and berlin , already facing a huge budget deficit , decided in 2000 to scrap the project .
the structures on the site were razed in 2004 .
the next year , the city held a competition for another concept and in january 2006 , a more modest design by local architect ursula wilms was chosen .
there has been no shortage of critics of how berlin 's urban planners handled the project .
at the center of the controversy was hans stimmann , berlin 's building director from 1991 until 2006 .
he was a powerful advocate of the zumthor design , even though it became clear early on that it was technically flawed , said nachema .
" stimmann was fixated on the idea that the city of berlin had to have a building designed by zumthor and no one dared challenge him , " he said .
new building to open in 2009 reunification in 1990 and the german parliament 's decision to move the capital from bonn to berlin the following year became the impetus for redesigning the city on a grand scale .
big-name architects , such as sir norman foster , renzo piano and helmut jahn flocked to berlin to reinvent prominent buildings such as the reichstag and thoroughfares such as potsdamer platz .
it had been leveled during world war ii and remained a barren no man 's land during the cold war . bildunterschrift : berlin architect ursula wilms won new competition for a less costly design today potsdamer platz is a gleaming group of high-rises and modern architecture , while the " topography of terror " is still basically a collection of posters amid the ruins of a cellar . wilms design for the topography of terror , a simple rectangular structure sheathed inside a metallic mesh , is now budgeted at 19 million euros . the section of the berlin wall now there will remain as part of the site 's landscape and a small section of the documentation center , which looks out onto niederkirchnerstrasse , will be devoted to the individuals who , according to andreas nachema , " tried to scale the wall of inhumanity .

there are fears that more strikes could hit the economy hard . the court on friday , nov .
2 , overturned a ruling last month that imposed a ban on strikes affecting the long-distance and freight services of deutsche bahn , germany 's national railway . " the decision opens the door to strikes that will cause major disruptions to freight and passenger traffic , " deutsche bahn negotiator werner bayreuther said after the ruling .
" this is not a good day for our clients . manfred schell , head of the gdl union which represents about 34,000 drivers , applauded the ruling and urged deutsche bahn to come up with another offer or face more strike action . drivers with the gdl union , which represents about 34,000 deutsche bahn employees , says its workers are underpaid in comparison with those elsewhere in europe and wants pay raises of up to 31 percent .
it has rejected a deal for a 4.5 percent wage hike struck between the rail company and two other unions .
it also refused a separate offer made by deutsche bahn . gdl , which has brought much of germany 's local commuter traffic to a halt repeatedly over recent weeks , said it aimed to target goods traffic , if the regional labor court sitting in the city of chemnitz upheld its appeal . analysts have said a strike that includes freight services could have a serious impact on europe 's largest economy .
the reach of deutsche bahn , a transport and logistics giant , spreads across europe and into asia and the middle east . freight fears a freight strike would seriously affect germany 's key carmaking , steel and chemicals sectors , with analysts putting the total costs at up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 75 million -rrb- a day , according to estimates from the german institute for economic research in berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goods deliveries by rail could be halted " when freight traffic is included the economic damages naturally occur quickly , " the institutes claudia kemfert told deutsche welle . many german companies have cut standing stocks in favor of punctual delivery , meaning a break in deliveries could lead some firms to stop their production lines , she added . german automaker daimler , however , said a freight strike would have little effect on its production . " we have been preparing for a possible strike for a long time , " a company spokesman said on friday , adding that the company would meet its transportation requirement through additional road service . harbors rely on rail deliveries harbor operators in the german port cities of bremen and hamburg also rely heavily on db to deliver freight containers .
nearly 70 percent of the containers that pass through the two harbors are loaded onto trains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for an agreement between the railway and the gdl union a deutsche bahn spokesman said thursday that an additional 100,000 trailer trucks would be required to transport the goods currently conveyed by rail .
experts , however , said road transportation would not match the scale of rail transport ant that harbor storage facilities would fill within two days . " every freight car , every locomotive and every locomotive conductor is desperately needed , " according to a statement from the germany steel economic association . the train conductors ' union , gdl , pledged before the ruling that there would be no strikes over the weekend .
" strikes will start at the earliest on monday , " a union spokesman said in frankfurt , adding that strikes would be expanded to long-distance passenger trains if the freight strikes did not elicit an improved offer from the bahn . government wants more talks german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee expressed alarm at plans to target goods traffic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transportation minister tiefensee says the economy could be seriously damaged " it 's not unlikely that if goods traffic is negatively affected over days or weeks , or even months , that this would cause serious damage to the economy , " he told ard national television friday .
" we must stop that . " tiefensee also said the federal government was working to get bahn and union officials to return to the negotiation table . the drivers seriously disrupted commuter and regional passenger services with a 30-hour strike at the end of october .
the chemnitz court on oct .
5 banned strikes targeting freight and long-distance trains that runs daily on its 34,000 kilometers of track . europe 's biggest rail operator , deutsche bahn carries more than 5 million passengers daily , 4.8 million of them using its regional and commuter services . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de third reich -pipe- 02.11.2007 nazi secret police museum finally gets off the ground in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the open-air exhibit will remain until the museum to house it is built building a permanent home for the popular open-air nazi secret police exhibit has taken 20 years due to design and budget problems .
work on a new exhibition space at former gestapo headquarters began on friday . a 200-meter -lrb- 656-foot -rrb- strip of the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse marks part of the boundary between the famous kreuzberg district and a neighborhood that was once in the eastern part of the german capital .
it is one of the few remaining vestiges of the one-time symbol of a divided europe .
but besides being the very focal point of the cold war , it was also here that adolf hitler 's secret police masterminded the 12-year reign of terror from 1933 to 1945 that led to the extermination of six million european jews and countless other victims .
this was the location of the headquarters of the much-feared gestapo . since 1987 , black-and-white photo reproductions documenting the nazi terror have been posted in a temporary outdoor exhibit near the ruins of the former gestapo and reich security offices , which were destroyed during the war by allied bombs . while the exhibit , called the " topography of terror , " draws roughly 400,000 visitors a year , for two decades now efforts have been underway to create a more permanent exhibition , but the project has been plagued by expensive false starts . on friday , nov .
2 , a ground-breaking ceremony took place attended by berlin mayor klaus wowereit and german culture minister bernd neumann for a new " remembrance and documentation center " in the german capital for victims of wartime gestapo terror . " it 's true .
we are going to build the remembrance and documentation center - finally , perhaps , some people will say , " wowereit said . focus on nazi perpetrators , not victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other exhibits devoted to nazi era focus on victims of holocaust although berlin is already home to exhibitions that look at the nazi genocide , such as daniel libeskind 's jewish museum and peter eisenman 's holocaust memorial , the focus of the topography of terror foundation is different , said executive director andreas nachema .
" this is not a memorial and the focus is not on jews and other victims , such as gypsies or communists .
we focus on the nazi perpetrators , the secret police and the ordinary germans who supported them , " he said .

work on a new exhibition space at former gestapo headquarters began on friday . a 200-meter -lrb- 656-foot -rrb- strip of the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse marks part of the boundary between the famous kreuzberg district and a neighborhood that was once in the eastern part of the german capital .
it is one of the few remaining vestiges of the one-time symbol of a divided europe .
but besides being the very focal point of the cold war , it was also here that adolf hitler 's secret police masterminded the 12-year reign of terror from 1933 to 1945 that led to the extermination of six million european jews and countless other victims .
this was the location of the headquarters of the much-feared gestapo . since 1987 , black-and-white photo reproductions documenting the nazi terror have been posted in a temporary outdoor exhibit near the ruins of the former gestapo and reich security offices , which were destroyed during the war by allied bombs . while the exhibit , called the " topography of terror , " draws roughly 400,000 visitors a year , for two decades now efforts have been underway to create a more permanent exhibition , but the project has been plagued by expensive false starts . on friday , nov .

" this is not a memorial and the focus is not on jews and other victims , such as gypsies or communists .
we focus on the nazi perpetrators , the secret police and the ordinary germans who supported them , " he said .
" visitors can come to this historical site in berlin , which was once the artery of the third reich , and they should walk away with a feel for the dimension of what happened , " added nachema , who pointed out that the architectural design of the building should not get in the way of , but serve the exhibits .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as a frequent visitor from india to germany , i feel that german impressions of india are very dated .
india is changing rapidly nowadays and a decade makes a lot of difference .
india is already an economic and technological power in many areas .
yes , it has many poor people but that is bound to happen with a population of 1.1 billion .
i doubt india will achieve the living standards of germany for many decades .
but a simple doubling of gdp , which is possible in the next 10 years , can wipe out the widespread poverty which was the source of buddha 's awakening even 2500 years ago .
germany should open up to india in trade and people movement and take advantage of our 700 million young people under the age of 30 . - ranjan ganguli , india i 'd like to praise angela markel , who made a slight shift from china to see india .
i regret previous german politicians ' inability to see india as nothing more than a multifaceted , poor country .
if germany wants to make its presence felt in india it needs to correct its outlook towards india and not judge it in figures but by its possibilities . - minakshi , india bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with indian prime minister singh on tuesday while the policy of the government is to attract investments and skilled professionals from india , the conduct of the foreign office employees is becoming increasingly hostile .
and let 's not talk about the new spouse visa rules and restrictions on starting a business for non-eu nationals . - anand , india emerging and existing entrepreneurs in india are very responsible people .
share with them green technology - an easy trade without politics . - venkat , india compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : pushing for greater awareness of india chancellor angela merkel 's successful visit with her indian counterpart has shifted attention from china to india , giving the democracy recognition that has been long overdue .

work on a new exhibition space at former gestapo headquarters began on friday . a 200-meter -lrb- 656-foot -rrb- strip of the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse marks part of the boundary between the famous kreuzberg district and a neighborhood that was once in the eastern part of the german capital .
it is one of the few remaining vestiges of the one-time symbol of a divided europe .
but besides being the very focal point of the cold war , it was also here that adolf hitler 's secret police masterminded the 12-year reign of terror from 1933 to 1945 that led to the extermination of six million european jews and countless other victims .
this was the location of the headquarters of the much-feared gestapo . since 1987 , black-and-white photo reproductions documenting the nazi terror have been posted in a temporary outdoor exhibit near the ruins of the former gestapo and reich security offices , which were destroyed during the war by allied bombs . while the exhibit , called the " topography of terror , " draws roughly 400,000 visitors a year , for two decades now efforts have been underway to create a more permanent exhibition , but the project has been plagued by expensive false starts . on friday , nov .
2 , a ground-breaking ceremony took place attended by berlin mayor klaus wowereit and german culture minister bernd neumann for a new " remembrance and documentation center " in the german capital for victims of wartime gestapo terror . " it 's true .
we are going to build the remembrance and documentation center - finally , perhaps , some people will say , " wowereit said . focus on nazi perpetrators , not victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other exhibits devoted to nazi era focus on victims of holocaust although berlin is already home to exhibitions that look at the nazi genocide , such as daniel libeskind 's jewish museum and peter eisenman 's holocaust memorial , the focus of the topography of terror foundation is different , said executive director andreas nachema .
" this is not a memorial and the focus is not on jews and other victims , such as gypsies or communists .
we focus on the nazi perpetrators , the secret police and the ordinary germans who supported them , " he said .
" visitors can come to this historical site in berlin , which was once the artery of the third reich , and they should walk away with a feel for the dimension of what happened , " added nachema , who pointed out that the architectural design of the building should not get in the way of , but serve the exhibits .
in 1993 , swiss architect peter zumthor was commissioned to design a permanent home for the " topography of terror " exhibition on the vacant lot between the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse and wilhelmstrasse in the heart of the city . but serious technical flaws in the design became apparent and the design itself came under fire for , for example , letting in too much natural sunlight that would make it difficult to read the text accompanying the exhibits . " zumthor 's design concept was impossible to build , " said stefanie endlich , the foundation 's publicist and a member of the board . in addition , there were concerns that a building and exhibit focusing on the nazi perpetrators could lead to the site becoming a place of pilgrimage for neo-nazis , long a quandary that urban planners in germany have faced .
technical and budgetary problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 200-meter stretch of the berlin wall will remain at the site by 1999 the project , for which the city had earmarked 37 million deutschmarks -lrb- € 19 million or $ 27.5 million -rrb- , had all but collapsed .
although about two-thirds of the budget had been spent , only the foundation and a few supports had been built .
several construction companies working on the project went bankrupt .
new estimates found that another 28 million euros would be needed to complete the building and berlin , already facing a huge budget deficit , decided in 2000 to scrap the project .
the structures on the site were razed in 2004 .
the next year , the city held a competition for another concept and in january 2006 , a more modest design by local architect ursula wilms was chosen .
there has been no shortage of critics of how berlin 's urban planners handled the project .
at the center of the controversy was hans stimmann , berlin 's building director from 1991 until 2006 .
he was a powerful advocate of the zumthor design , even though it became clear early on that it was technically flawed , said nachema .
" stimmann was fixated on the idea that the city of berlin had to have a building designed by zumthor and no one dared challenge him , " he said .
new building to open in 2009 reunification in 1990 and the german parliament 's decision to move the capital from bonn to berlin the following year became the impetus for redesigning the city on a grand scale .
big-name architects , such as sir norman foster , renzo piano and helmut jahn flocked to berlin to reinvent prominent buildings such as the reichstag and thoroughfares such as potsdamer platz .
it had been leveled during world war ii and remained a barren no man 's land during the cold war . bildunterschrift : berlin architect ursula wilms won new competition for a less costly design today potsdamer platz is a gleaming group of high-rises and modern architecture , while the " topography of terror " is still basically a collection of posters amid the ruins of a cellar . wilms design for the topography of terror , a simple rectangular structure sheathed inside a metallic mesh , is now budgeted at 19 million euros . the section of the berlin wall now there will remain as part of the site 's landscape and a small section of the documentation center , which looks out onto niederkirchnerstrasse , will be devoted to the individuals who , according to andreas nachema , " tried to scale the wall of inhumanity .

work on a new exhibition space at former gestapo headquarters began on friday . a 200-meter -lrb- 656-foot -rrb- strip of the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse marks part of the boundary between the famous kreuzberg district and a neighborhood that was once in the eastern part of the german capital .
it is one of the few remaining vestiges of the one-time symbol of a divided europe .
but besides being the very focal point of the cold war , it was also here that adolf hitler 's secret police masterminded the 12-year reign of terror from 1933 to 1945 that led to the extermination of six million european jews and countless other victims .
this was the location of the headquarters of the much-feared gestapo . since 1987 , black-and-white photo reproductions documenting the nazi terror have been posted in a temporary outdoor exhibit near the ruins of the former gestapo and reich security offices , which were destroyed during the war by allied bombs . while the exhibit , called the " topography of terror , " draws roughly 400,000 visitors a year , for two decades now efforts have been underway to create a more permanent exhibition , but the project has been plagued by expensive false starts . on friday , nov .
2 , a ground-breaking ceremony took place attended by berlin mayor klaus wowereit and german culture minister bernd neumann for a new " remembrance and documentation center " in the german capital for victims of wartime gestapo terror . " it 's true .
we are going to build the remembrance and documentation center - finally , perhaps , some people will say , " wowereit said . focus on nazi perpetrators , not victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other exhibits devoted to nazi era focus on victims of holocaust although berlin is already home to exhibitions that look at the nazi genocide , such as daniel libeskind 's jewish museum and peter eisenman 's holocaust memorial , the focus of the topography of terror foundation is different , said executive director andreas nachema .
" this is not a memorial and the focus is not on jews and other victims , such as gypsies or communists .
we focus on the nazi perpetrators , the secret police and the ordinary germans who supported them , " he said .
" visitors can come to this historical site in berlin , which was once the artery of the third reich , and they should walk away with a feel for the dimension of what happened , " added nachema , who pointed out that the architectural design of the building should not get in the way of , but serve the exhibits .
in 1993 , swiss architect peter zumthor was commissioned to design a permanent home for the " topography of terror " exhibition on the vacant lot between the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse and wilhelmstrasse in the heart of the city . but serious technical flaws in the design became apparent and the design itself came under fire for , for example , letting in too much natural sunlight that would make it difficult to read the text accompanying the exhibits . " zumthor 's design concept was impossible to build , " said stefanie endlich , the foundation 's publicist and a member of the board . in addition , there were concerns that a building and exhibit focusing on the nazi perpetrators could lead to the site becoming a place of pilgrimage for neo-nazis , long a quandary that urban planners in germany have faced .
technical and budgetary problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 200-meter stretch of the berlin wall will remain at the site by 1999 the project , for which the city had earmarked 37 million deutschmarks -lrb- € 19 million or $ 27.5 million -rrb- , had all but collapsed .
although about two-thirds of the budget had been spent , only the foundation and a few supports had been built .
several construction companies working on the project went bankrupt .
new estimates found that another 28 million euros would be needed to complete the building and berlin , already facing a huge budget deficit , decided in 2000 to scrap the project .
the structures on the site were razed in 2004 .
the next year , the city held a competition for another concept and in january 2006 , a more modest design by local architect ursula wilms was chosen .
there has been no shortage of critics of how berlin 's urban planners handled the project .
at the center of the controversy was hans stimmann , berlin 's building director from 1991 until 2006 .
he was a powerful advocate of the zumthor design , even though it became clear early on that it was technically flawed , said nachema .
" stimmann was fixated on the idea that the city of berlin had to have a building designed by zumthor and no one dared challenge him , " he said .
new building to open in 2009 reunification in 1990 and the german parliament 's decision to move the capital from bonn to berlin the following year became the impetus for redesigning the city on a grand scale .
big-name architects , such as sir norman foster , renzo piano and helmut jahn flocked to berlin to reinvent prominent buildings such as the reichstag and thoroughfares such as potsdamer platz .
it had been leveled during world war ii and remained a barren no man 's land during the cold war . bildunterschrift : berlin architect ursula wilms won new competition for a less costly design today potsdamer platz is a gleaming group of high-rises and modern architecture , while the " topography of terror " is still basically a collection of posters amid the ruins of a cellar . wilms design for the topography of terror , a simple rectangular structure sheathed inside a metallic mesh , is now budgeted at 19 million euros . the section of the berlin wall now there will remain as part of the site 's landscape and a small section of the documentation center , which looks out onto niederkirchnerstrasse , will be devoted to the individuals who , according to andreas nachema , " tried to scale the wall of inhumanity .

new estimates found that another 28 million euros would be needed to complete the building and berlin , already facing a huge budget deficit , decided in 2000 to scrap the project .
the structures on the site were razed in 2004 .
the next year , the city held a competition for another concept and in january 2006 , a more modest design by local architect ursula wilms was chosen .
there has been no shortage of critics of how berlin 's urban planners handled the project .
at the center of the controversy was hans stimmann , berlin 's building director from 1991 until 2006 .
he was a powerful advocate of the zumthor design , even though it became clear early on that it was technically flawed , said nachema .
" stimmann was fixated on the idea that the city of berlin had to have a building designed by zumthor and no one dared challenge him , " he said .
new building to open in 2009 reunification in 1990 and the german parliament 's decision to move the capital from bonn to berlin the following year became the impetus for redesigning the city on a grand scale .
big-name architects , such as sir norman foster , renzo piano and helmut jahn flocked to berlin to reinvent prominent buildings such as the reichstag and thoroughfares such as potsdamer platz .
it had been leveled during world war ii and remained a barren no man 's land during the cold war . bildunterschrift : berlin architect ursula wilms won new competition for a less costly design today potsdamer platz is a gleaming group of high-rises and modern architecture , while the " topography of terror " is still basically a collection of posters amid the ruins of a cellar . wilms design for the topography of terror , a simple rectangular structure sheathed inside a metallic mesh , is now budgeted at 19 million euros . the section of the berlin wall now there will remain as part of the site 's landscape and a small section of the documentation center , which looks out onto niederkirchnerstrasse , will be devoted to the individuals who , according to andreas nachema , " tried to scale the wall of inhumanity .

the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
a spokesman for germany 's bfv domestic intelligence services , commenting on the reports , said that the kongra-gel , the pkk 's political wing , is blackmailing kurdish immigrants with mafia-like demands for protection money of one month 's salary a year or much more in the case of wealthy businessmen .
" in this way they collect millions of euros in germany every year , " the spokesperson stated .
the reports came to light in the wake of violent clashes between kurds and turkish nationalists in berlin , heilbronn and mülheim at last weekend .
in berlin , 18 policemen were injured trying to break up fighting between the two sides , after turkish nationalists held a march in support of ankara 's threat to launch strikes on pkk bases in northern iraq .
the german intelligence services have since stepped up their surveillance of pkk activists in germany .
they estimate that there are 11,500 pkk members in germany , of whom 1,000 live in berlin .
germany banned the pkk in 1993 after it carried out a campaign of fire-bombings on turkish and german institutions in berlin .
pkk activity in germany intensifies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german kurds are pressured to contribute to the pkk cause experts have been monitoring an intensification of pkk activities in germany , which is home to 2.5 million turks - the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
pkk activity slowed down in 2003 but has gradually been picking up in the four years since , according to reports .
according to german police sources , the pkk is also involved in drug trafficking in germany and uses the spoils to fund its separatist struggle .
police have confirmed that several investigations have revealed a link between the pkk and drug dealers .
turkish intelligence services believe that the pkk raises 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- a year and last year spent 15 million euros on arms , notably in iraq .
in april , police confiscated 16,000 euros in banknotes in a raid on 32 suspected members of the pkk in bavaria in southern germany .
in recent years , a number of pkk members have been arrested in germany for securing financing for the group , which has been branded a terrorist organization by turkey , the united states and the european union .
last year german police arrested a turk of kurdish origin suspected of being the leader of the pkk and kongra-gel in germany and heading its fundraising and propaganda activities here .
turkey slams germany for playing down pkk however , the turkish community in germany has recently accused the country 's media of playing down the threat posed by the pkk .
germany 's largest turkish-language newspaper , hürriyet wrote last week that " the german media have a blind spot when it comes to the pkk , referring to repeated descriptions of the organization as " kurdish rebels , " " pkk members " , " separatists " and " radical kurds . "
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also criticized european countries recently for failing to arrest and extradite wanted kurdish militants to turkey .
istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said at a symposium in istanbul last weekend .
" the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad , " he said .
rice in turkey as fears of cross-border strikes mount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice wants to avoid a turkish incursion into iraq meanwhile , turkey refused to rule out cross-border attacks on pkk positions in iraq but tried to ally fears by saying such an attack would target guerrilla bases and not amount to an " invasion . "
us secretary of state condoleezza rice arrived in ankara on friday to urge turkey not to destabilize northern iraq by launching any cross-border military strike .
rice is to meet turkish president abdullah gul , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minister ali babacan on friday afternoon .
" anything that would destabilize the north of iraq is not going to be in turkey 's interest , " rice said before arriving for the talks .
" it is not going to be in our interest .
it is not going to be in iraq 's interest .
so that has been the reason for urging restraint .
" the first point that we have to underscore is that turkey , the united states and iraq have a common enemy in the pkk , " she added .
" we want to develop a very effective strategy for dealing with this threat but we are not going to be able to do this without coordination of the three nations . "
bush , erdogan to discuss pkk strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush sees the pkk as a common enemy both baghdad and washington strongly oppose any unilateral turkish action in northern iraq on the grounds that it would destabilize the only relatively calm region of the war-torn country .
us president george w. bush will meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in washington next week to discuss cooperation against the iraq-based kurdish fighters .
" i look forward to visiting with prime minister erdogan on this important subject as to how we can work together to prevent people from coming out of mountain ranges to do harm to turkish troops , " bush told reporters on thursday .
" we will have a good , substantive discussion , as you would expect allies to do .
and i 'm looking forward to seeing him here in the oval office . "
the pkk uses bases in the mountainous region for cross-border attacks as part of its 23-year campaign for self-rule in turkey 's mainly kurdish southeast .
turkey has reportedly massed up to 100,000 troops on the border with iraq and has threatened a military incursion to strike at the pkk bases unless baghdad and washington make good on promises to crack down on the rebels .
turkish troops have been engaged in major operations targeting the pkk since october 21 when a group of rebels , who ankara says infiltrated from northern iraq , ambushed a military unit , killing 12 soldiers and capturing eight .
the army says it has since killed 80 rebels on turkish territory .
pkk calls for peace plan as ankara announces sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments and sanctions put pressure on the pkk a top pkk commander on thursday called on ankara to present a peace plan that could end the group 's rebellion , which has claimed more than 37,000 lives since it began in 1984 .
ankara categorically refuses to have any contact with or make any concessions to the pkk .
turkey increased the pressure on northern iraq thursday by imposing economic sanctions that specifically target the pkk and its supporters .
foreign minister ali babacan said that a list of measures had been drawn up and that some had already been put in place but said turkey would not be announcing what these measures were .
the foreign minister said the sanctions were not aimed at the people of iraq but were specifically targeted at the pkk and those who support them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
a spokesman for germany 's bfv domestic intelligence services , commenting on the reports , said that the kongra-gel , the pkk 's political wing , is blackmailing kurdish immigrants with mafia-like demands for protection money of one month 's salary a year or much more in the case of wealthy businessmen .
" in this way they collect millions of euros in germany every year , " the spokesperson stated .
the reports came to light in the wake of violent clashes between kurds and turkish nationalists in berlin , heilbronn and mülheim at last weekend .
in berlin , 18 policemen were injured trying to break up fighting between the two sides , after turkish nationalists held a march in support of ankara 's threat to launch strikes on pkk bases in northern iraq .
the german intelligence services have since stepped up their surveillance of pkk activists in germany .
they estimate that there are 11,500 pkk members in germany , of whom 1,000 live in berlin .
germany banned the pkk in 1993 after it carried out a campaign of fire-bombings on turkish and german institutions in berlin .
pkk activity in germany intensifies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german kurds are pressured to contribute to the pkk cause experts have been monitoring an intensification of pkk activities in germany , which is home to 2.5 million turks - the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
pkk activity slowed down in 2003 but has gradually been picking up in the four years since , according to reports .
according to german police sources , the pkk is also involved in drug trafficking in germany and uses the spoils to fund its separatist struggle .
police have confirmed that several investigations have revealed a link between the pkk and drug dealers .
turkish intelligence services believe that the pkk raises 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- a year and last year spent 15 million euros on arms , notably in iraq .
in april , police confiscated 16,000 euros in banknotes in a raid on 32 suspected members of the pkk in bavaria in southern germany .
in recent years , a number of pkk members have been arrested in germany for securing financing for the group , which has been branded a terrorist organization by turkey , the united states and the european union .
last year german police arrested a turk of kurdish origin suspected of being the leader of the pkk and kongra-gel in germany and heading its fundraising and propaganda activities here .
turkey slams germany for playing down pkk however , the turkish community in germany has recently accused the country 's media of playing down the threat posed by the pkk .
germany 's largest turkish-language newspaper , hürriyet wrote last week that " the german media have a blind spot when it comes to the pkk , referring to repeated descriptions of the organization as " kurdish rebels , " " pkk members " , " separatists " and " radical kurds . "
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also criticized european countries recently for failing to arrest and extradite wanted kurdish militants to turkey .
istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said at a symposium in istanbul last weekend .
" the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad , " he said .
rice in turkey as fears of cross-border strikes mount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice wants to avoid a turkish incursion into iraq meanwhile , turkey refused to rule out cross-border attacks on pkk positions in iraq but tried to ally fears by saying such an attack would target guerrilla bases and not amount to an " invasion . "
us secretary of state condoleezza rice arrived in ankara on friday to urge turkey not to destabilize northern iraq by launching any cross-border military strike .
rice is to meet turkish president abdullah gul , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minister ali babacan on friday afternoon .
" anything that would destabilize the north of iraq is not going to be in turkey 's interest , " rice said before arriving for the talks .
" it is not going to be in our interest .
it is not going to be in iraq 's interest .
so that has been the reason for urging restraint .
" the first point that we have to underscore is that turkey , the united states and iraq have a common enemy in the pkk , " she added .
" we want to develop a very effective strategy for dealing with this threat but we are not going to be able to do this without coordination of the three nations . "
bush , erdogan to discuss pkk strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush sees the pkk as a common enemy both baghdad and washington strongly oppose any unilateral turkish action in northern iraq on the grounds that it would destabilize the only relatively calm region of the war-torn country .
us president george w. bush will meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in washington next week to discuss cooperation against the iraq-based kurdish fighters .
" i look forward to visiting with prime minister erdogan on this important subject as to how we can work together to prevent people from coming out of mountain ranges to do harm to turkish troops , " bush told reporters on thursday .
" we will have a good , substantive discussion , as you would expect allies to do .
and i 'm looking forward to seeing him here in the oval office . "
the pkk uses bases in the mountainous region for cross-border attacks as part of its 23-year campaign for self-rule in turkey 's mainly kurdish southeast .
turkey has reportedly massed up to 100,000 troops on the border with iraq and has threatened a military incursion to strike at the pkk bases unless baghdad and washington make good on promises to crack down on the rebels .
turkish troops have been engaged in major operations targeting the pkk since october 21 when a group of rebels , who ankara says infiltrated from northern iraq , ambushed a military unit , killing 12 soldiers and capturing eight .
the army says it has since killed 80 rebels on turkish territory .
pkk calls for peace plan as ankara announces sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments and sanctions put pressure on the pkk a top pkk commander on thursday called on ankara to present a peace plan that could end the group 's rebellion , which has claimed more than 37,000 lives since it began in 1984 .
ankara categorically refuses to have any contact with or make any concessions to the pkk .
turkey increased the pressure on northern iraq thursday by imposing economic sanctions that specifically target the pkk and its supporters .
foreign minister ali babacan said that a list of measures had been drawn up and that some had already been put in place but said turkey would not be announcing what these measures were .
the foreign minister said the sanctions were not aimed at the people of iraq but were specifically targeted at the pkk and those who support them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
a spokesman for germany 's bfv domestic intelligence services , commenting on the reports , said that the kongra-gel , the pkk 's political wing , is blackmailing kurdish immigrants with mafia-like demands for protection money of one month 's salary a year or much more in the case of wealthy businessmen .
" in this way they collect millions of euros in germany every year , " the spokesperson stated .
the reports came to light in the wake of violent clashes between kurds and turkish nationalists in berlin , heilbronn and mülheim at last weekend .
in berlin , 18 policemen were injured trying to break up fighting between the two sides , after turkish nationalists held a march in support of ankara 's threat to launch strikes on pkk bases in northern iraq .
the german intelligence services have since stepped up their surveillance of pkk activists in germany .
they estimate that there are 11,500 pkk members in germany , of whom 1,000 live in berlin .
germany banned the pkk in 1993 after it carried out a campaign of fire-bombings on turkish and german institutions in berlin .
pkk activity in germany intensifies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german kurds are pressured to contribute to the pkk cause experts have been monitoring an intensification of pkk activities in germany , which is home to 2.5 million turks - the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
pkk activity slowed down in 2003 but has gradually been picking up in the four years since , according to reports .
according to german police sources , the pkk is also involved in drug trafficking in germany and uses the spoils to fund its separatist struggle .
police have confirmed that several investigations have revealed a link between the pkk and drug dealers .
turkish intelligence services believe that the pkk raises 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- a year and last year spent 15 million euros on arms , notably in iraq .
in april , police confiscated 16,000 euros in banknotes in a raid on 32 suspected members of the pkk in bavaria in southern germany .
in recent years , a number of pkk members have been arrested in germany for securing financing for the group , which has been branded a terrorist organization by turkey , the united states and the european union .
last year german police arrested a turk of kurdish origin suspected of being the leader of the pkk and kongra-gel in germany and heading its fundraising and propaganda activities here .
turkey slams germany for playing down pkk however , the turkish community in germany has recently accused the country 's media of playing down the threat posed by the pkk .
germany 's largest turkish-language newspaper , hürriyet wrote last week that " the german media have a blind spot when it comes to the pkk , referring to repeated descriptions of the organization as " kurdish rebels , " " pkk members " , " separatists " and " radical kurds . "
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also criticized european countries recently for failing to arrest and extradite wanted kurdish militants to turkey .
istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said at a symposium in istanbul last weekend .
" the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad , " he said .
rice in turkey as fears of cross-border strikes mount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice wants to avoid a turkish incursion into iraq meanwhile , turkey refused to rule out cross-border attacks on pkk positions in iraq but tried to ally fears by saying such an attack would target guerrilla bases and not amount to an " invasion . "
us secretary of state condoleezza rice arrived in ankara on friday to urge turkey not to destabilize northern iraq by launching any cross-border military strike .
rice is to meet turkish president abdullah gul , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minister ali babacan on friday afternoon .
" anything that would destabilize the north of iraq is not going to be in turkey 's interest , " rice said before arriving for the talks .
" it is not going to be in our interest .
it is not going to be in iraq 's interest .
so that has been the reason for urging restraint .
" the first point that we have to underscore is that turkey , the united states and iraq have a common enemy in the pkk , " she added .
" we want to develop a very effective strategy for dealing with this threat but we are not going to be able to do this without coordination of the three nations . "
bush , erdogan to discuss pkk strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush sees the pkk as a common enemy both baghdad and washington strongly oppose any unilateral turkish action in northern iraq on the grounds that it would destabilize the only relatively calm region of the war-torn country .
us president george w. bush will meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in washington next week to discuss cooperation against the iraq-based kurdish fighters .
" i look forward to visiting with prime minister erdogan on this important subject as to how we can work together to prevent people from coming out of mountain ranges to do harm to turkish troops , " bush told reporters on thursday .
" we will have a good , substantive discussion , as you would expect allies to do .
and i 'm looking forward to seeing him here in the oval office . "
the pkk uses bases in the mountainous region for cross-border attacks as part of its 23-year campaign for self-rule in turkey 's mainly kurdish southeast .
turkey has reportedly massed up to 100,000 troops on the border with iraq and has threatened a military incursion to strike at the pkk bases unless baghdad and washington make good on promises to crack down on the rebels .
turkish troops have been engaged in major operations targeting the pkk since october 21 when a group of rebels , who ankara says infiltrated from northern iraq , ambushed a military unit , killing 12 soldiers and capturing eight .
the army says it has since killed 80 rebels on turkish territory .
pkk calls for peace plan as ankara announces sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments and sanctions put pressure on the pkk a top pkk commander on thursday called on ankara to present a peace plan that could end the group 's rebellion , which has claimed more than 37,000 lives since it began in 1984 .
ankara categorically refuses to have any contact with or make any concessions to the pkk .
turkey increased the pressure on northern iraq thursday by imposing economic sanctions that specifically target the pkk and its supporters .
foreign minister ali babacan said that a list of measures had been drawn up and that some had already been put in place but said turkey would not be announcing what these measures were .
the foreign minister said the sanctions were not aimed at the people of iraq but were specifically targeted at the pkk and those who support them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

almost one year after the eu partially froze turkey 's membership talks , the report - due to be released next week - urges turkey " to renew the momentum of political reforms " and states that " significant further efforts are needed in particular on freedom of expression , on civilian control of the military , and on the rights of non-muslim communities . "
turkey chastized on freedom of speech the eu suspended eight chapters of turkey 's 35-chapter eu negotiations package last year , citing ankara 's continuing blockade on traffic from eu member state cyprus - which is illegal under an eu-turkey customs agreement – as its main reason .
turkey has made " no progress on normalizing bilateral relations " with nicosia since then , the draft report states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu accession bid is one of the most controversial the eu is also concerned about the continued restrictions in freedom of speech and concludes that " the turkish legal system does not fully guarantee freedom of expression in line with european standards " .
the number of prosecutions of journalists , intellectuals and human rights activists for expressing non-violent opinions is on the rise .
the number of people prosecuted almost doubled in 2006 from 2005 and there were further increases in 2007 .
more than half of these cases were brought under the turkish penal code and many of those under article 301 which makes it an offense to insult " turkishness . "
together with the murder of a journalist , hrant dink , this has helped create a climate of self-censorship the draft document says .
eu worries about turkish military brussels is also unhappy about the fact that " the armed forces continue to exercise significant political influence , " in turkey and that " no progress " had been seen in the area of protection of minorities and ensuring cultural diversity in line with eu principles .
the draft takes an even-handed approach on the kurdish issue saying that turkey made " no progress in the area of cultural rights . "
however it notes that the pkk separatist group is on the eu 's terrorist list and talks of a " further deterioration of the situation in terms of attacks by the pkk and other terrorist groups . "
public opinion across the eu is hardening against turkey 's eu membership bid and president nicolas sarkozy of france leads a group of countries opposed to full eu membership for turkey , preferring a looser association with ankara instead .
macedonia not on track either the report , which covers the whole enlargement process , also said eu accession talks with macedonia are unlikely to begin before 2009 at the earliest , dashing skopje 's hopes of them starting next year , due to political problems in the former yugoslav republic , an eu source said on tuesday .

macedonia was officially made a candidate for membership in 2005 , four years after an accord brokered by the eu and nato ended a stand-off between the majority macedonian and minority albanian communities which threatened to plunge the country into civil war .
the eu insisted that entry talks could only begin when it was satisfied with macedonia 's progress on the rule of law , the rights of the albanian minority and the fight against organized crime and corruption .
the commission report is expected to cite the absence of dialogue with the albanian community , the politicization of the civil service and the blockage of key judicial reforms as its reasons for halting the talks .

the continued quarreling between the government and the opposition party representing the country 's large ethnic albanian minority , the mass sackings of civil servants after the change of government in 2006 and the divisions between macedonia 's president and prime minister are also cited by the draft report as being problematic , the paper wrote .
there was also a reference to the dispute between macedonia and greece over the country 's name .

there are fears that more strikes could hit the economy hard . the court on friday , nov .
2 , overturned a ruling last month that imposed a ban on strikes affecting the long-distance and freight services of deutsche bahn , germany 's national railway . " the decision opens the door to strikes that will cause major disruptions to freight and passenger traffic , " deutsche bahn negotiator werner bayreuther said after the ruling .
" this is not a good day for our clients . manfred schell , head of the gdl union which represents about 34,000 drivers , applauded the ruling and urged deutsche bahn to come up with another offer or face more strike action . drivers with the gdl union , which represents about 34,000 deutsche bahn employees , says its workers are underpaid in comparison with those elsewhere in europe and wants pay raises of up to 31 percent .
it has rejected a deal for a 4.5 percent wage hike struck between the rail company and two other unions .
it also refused a separate offer made by deutsche bahn . gdl , which has brought much of germany 's local commuter traffic to a halt repeatedly over recent weeks , said it aimed to target goods traffic , if the regional labor court sitting in the city of chemnitz upheld its appeal . analysts have said a strike that includes freight services could have a serious impact on europe 's largest economy .
the reach of deutsche bahn , a transport and logistics giant , spreads across europe and into asia and the middle east . freight fears a freight strike would seriously affect germany 's key carmaking , steel and chemicals sectors , with analysts putting the total costs at up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 75 million -rrb- a day , according to estimates from the german institute for economic research in berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goods deliveries by rail could be halted " when freight traffic is included the economic damages naturally occur quickly , " the institutes claudia kemfert told deutsche welle . many german companies have cut standing stocks in favor of punctual delivery , meaning a break in deliveries could lead some firms to stop their production lines , she added . german automaker daimler , however , said a freight strike would have little effect on its production . " we have been preparing for a possible strike for a long time , " a company spokesman said on friday , adding that the company would meet its transportation requirement through additional road service . harbors rely on rail deliveries harbor operators in the german port cities of bremen and hamburg also rely heavily on db to deliver freight containers .
nearly 70 percent of the containers that pass through the two harbors are loaded onto trains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for an agreement between the railway and the gdl union a deutsche bahn spokesman said thursday that an additional 100,000 trailer trucks would be required to transport the goods currently conveyed by rail .
experts , however , said road transportation would not match the scale of rail transport ant that harbor storage facilities would fill within two days . " every freight car , every locomotive and every locomotive conductor is desperately needed , " according to a statement from the germany steel economic association . the train conductors ' union , gdl , pledged before the ruling that there would be no strikes over the weekend .
" strikes will start at the earliest on monday , " a union spokesman said in frankfurt , adding that strikes would be expanded to long-distance passenger trains if the freight strikes did not elicit an improved offer from the bahn . government wants more talks german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee expressed alarm at plans to target goods traffic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transportation minister tiefensee says the economy could be seriously damaged " it 's not unlikely that if goods traffic is negatively affected over days or weeks , or even months , that this would cause serious damage to the economy , " he told ard national television friday .
" we must stop that . " tiefensee also said the federal government was working to get bahn and union officials to return to the negotiation table . the drivers seriously disrupted commuter and regional passenger services with a 30-hour strike at the end of october .

the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
a spokesman for germany 's bfv domestic intelligence services , commenting on the reports , said that the kongra-gel , the pkk 's political wing , is blackmailing kurdish immigrants with mafia-like demands for protection money of one month 's salary a year or much more in the case of wealthy businessmen .
" in this way they collect millions of euros in germany every year , " the spokesperson stated .
the reports came to light in the wake of violent clashes between kurds and turkish nationalists in berlin , heilbronn and mülheim at last weekend .
in berlin , 18 policemen were injured trying to break up fighting between the two sides , after turkish nationalists held a march in support of ankara 's threat to launch strikes on pkk bases in northern iraq .
the german intelligence services have since stepped up their surveillance of pkk activists in germany .
they estimate that there are 11,500 pkk members in germany , of whom 1,000 live in berlin .
germany banned the pkk in 1993 after it carried out a campaign of fire-bombings on turkish and german institutions in berlin .
pkk activity in germany intensifies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german kurds are pressured to contribute to the pkk cause experts have been monitoring an intensification of pkk activities in germany , which is home to 2.5 million turks - the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
pkk activity slowed down in 2003 but has gradually been picking up in the four years since , according to reports .
according to german police sources , the pkk is also involved in drug trafficking in germany and uses the spoils to fund its separatist struggle .
police have confirmed that several investigations have revealed a link between the pkk and drug dealers .
turkish intelligence services believe that the pkk raises 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- a year and last year spent 15 million euros on arms , notably in iraq .
in april , police confiscated 16,000 euros in banknotes in a raid on 32 suspected members of the pkk in bavaria in southern germany .
in recent years , a number of pkk members have been arrested in germany for securing financing for the group , which has been branded a terrorist organization by turkey , the united states and the european union .
last year german police arrested a turk of kurdish origin suspected of being the leader of the pkk and kongra-gel in germany and heading its fundraising and propaganda activities here .
turkey slams germany for playing down pkk however , the turkish community in germany has recently accused the country 's media of playing down the threat posed by the pkk .
germany 's largest turkish-language newspaper , hürriyet wrote last week that " the german media have a blind spot when it comes to the pkk , referring to repeated descriptions of the organization as " kurdish rebels , " " pkk members " , " separatists " and " radical kurds . "
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also criticized european countries recently for failing to arrest and extradite wanted kurdish militants to turkey .
istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said at a symposium in istanbul last weekend .
" the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad , " he said .
rice in turkey as fears of cross-border strikes mount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice wants to avoid a turkish incursion into iraq meanwhile , turkey refused to rule out cross-border attacks on pkk positions in iraq but tried to ally fears by saying such an attack would target guerrilla bases and not amount to an " invasion . "
us secretary of state condoleezza rice arrived in ankara on friday to urge turkey not to destabilize northern iraq by launching any cross-border military strike .
rice is to meet turkish president abdullah gul , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minister ali babacan on friday afternoon .
" anything that would destabilize the north of iraq is not going to be in turkey 's interest , " rice said before arriving for the talks .
" it is not going to be in our interest .
it is not going to be in iraq 's interest .
so that has been the reason for urging restraint .
" the first point that we have to underscore is that turkey , the united states and iraq have a common enemy in the pkk , " she added .
" we want to develop a very effective strategy for dealing with this threat but we are not going to be able to do this without coordination of the three nations . "
bush , erdogan to discuss pkk strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush sees the pkk as a common enemy both baghdad and washington strongly oppose any unilateral turkish action in northern iraq on the grounds that it would destabilize the only relatively calm region of the war-torn country .
us president george w. bush will meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in washington next week to discuss cooperation against the iraq-based kurdish fighters .
" i look forward to visiting with prime minister erdogan on this important subject as to how we can work together to prevent people from coming out of mountain ranges to do harm to turkish troops , " bush told reporters on thursday .
" we will have a good , substantive discussion , as you would expect allies to do .
and i 'm looking forward to seeing him here in the oval office . "
the pkk uses bases in the mountainous region for cross-border attacks as part of its 23-year campaign for self-rule in turkey 's mainly kurdish southeast .
turkey has reportedly massed up to 100,000 troops on the border with iraq and has threatened a military incursion to strike at the pkk bases unless baghdad and washington make good on promises to crack down on the rebels .
turkish troops have been engaged in major operations targeting the pkk since october 21 when a group of rebels , who ankara says infiltrated from northern iraq , ambushed a military unit , killing 12 soldiers and capturing eight .
the army says it has since killed 80 rebels on turkish territory .
pkk calls for peace plan as ankara announces sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments and sanctions put pressure on the pkk a top pkk commander on thursday called on ankara to present a peace plan that could end the group 's rebellion , which has claimed more than 37,000 lives since it began in 1984 .
ankara categorically refuses to have any contact with or make any concessions to the pkk .
turkey increased the pressure on northern iraq thursday by imposing economic sanctions that specifically target the pkk and its supporters .
foreign minister ali babacan said that a list of measures had been drawn up and that some had already been put in place but said turkey would not be announcing what these measures were .
the foreign minister said the sanctions were not aimed at the people of iraq but were specifically targeted at the pkk and those who support them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
a spokesman for germany 's bfv domestic intelligence services , commenting on the reports , said that the kongra-gel , the pkk 's political wing , is blackmailing kurdish immigrants with mafia-like demands for protection money of one month 's salary a year or much more in the case of wealthy businessmen .
" in this way they collect millions of euros in germany every year , " the spokesperson stated .
the reports came to light in the wake of violent clashes between kurds and turkish nationalists in berlin , heilbronn and mülheim at last weekend .
in berlin , 18 policemen were injured trying to break up fighting between the two sides , after turkish nationalists held a march in support of ankara 's threat to launch strikes on pkk bases in northern iraq .
the german intelligence services have since stepped up their surveillance of pkk activists in germany .
they estimate that there are 11,500 pkk members in germany , of whom 1,000 live in berlin .
germany banned the pkk in 1993 after it carried out a campaign of fire-bombings on turkish and german institutions in berlin .
pkk activity in germany intensifies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german kurds are pressured to contribute to the pkk cause experts have been monitoring an intensification of pkk activities in germany , which is home to 2.5 million turks - the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
pkk activity slowed down in 2003 but has gradually been picking up in the four years since , according to reports .
according to german police sources , the pkk is also involved in drug trafficking in germany and uses the spoils to fund its separatist struggle .
police have confirmed that several investigations have revealed a link between the pkk and drug dealers .
turkish intelligence services believe that the pkk raises 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- a year and last year spent 15 million euros on arms , notably in iraq .
in april , police confiscated 16,000 euros in banknotes in a raid on 32 suspected members of the pkk in bavaria in southern germany .
in recent years , a number of pkk members have been arrested in germany for securing financing for the group , which has been branded a terrorist organization by turkey , the united states and the european union .
last year german police arrested a turk of kurdish origin suspected of being the leader of the pkk and kongra-gel in germany and heading its fundraising and propaganda activities here .
turkey slams germany for playing down pkk however , the turkish community in germany has recently accused the country 's media of playing down the threat posed by the pkk .
germany 's largest turkish-language newspaper , hürriyet wrote last week that " the german media have a blind spot when it comes to the pkk , referring to repeated descriptions of the organization as " kurdish rebels , " " pkk members " , " separatists " and " radical kurds . "
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also criticized european countries recently for failing to arrest and extradite wanted kurdish militants to turkey .
istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said at a symposium in istanbul last weekend .
" the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad , " he said .
rice in turkey as fears of cross-border strikes mount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice wants to avoid a turkish incursion into iraq meanwhile , turkey refused to rule out cross-border attacks on pkk positions in iraq but tried to ally fears by saying such an attack would target guerrilla bases and not amount to an " invasion . "
us secretary of state condoleezza rice arrived in ankara on friday to urge turkey not to destabilize northern iraq by launching any cross-border military strike .
rice is to meet turkish president abdullah gul , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minister ali babacan on friday afternoon .
" anything that would destabilize the north of iraq is not going to be in turkey 's interest , " rice said before arriving for the talks .
" it is not going to be in our interest .
it is not going to be in iraq 's interest .
so that has been the reason for urging restraint .
" the first point that we have to underscore is that turkey , the united states and iraq have a common enemy in the pkk , " she added .
" we want to develop a very effective strategy for dealing with this threat but we are not going to be able to do this without coordination of the three nations . "
bush , erdogan to discuss pkk strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush sees the pkk as a common enemy both baghdad and washington strongly oppose any unilateral turkish action in northern iraq on the grounds that it would destabilize the only relatively calm region of the war-torn country .
us president george w. bush will meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in washington next week to discuss cooperation against the iraq-based kurdish fighters .
" i look forward to visiting with prime minister erdogan on this important subject as to how we can work together to prevent people from coming out of mountain ranges to do harm to turkish troops , " bush told reporters on thursday .
" we will have a good , substantive discussion , as you would expect allies to do .
and i 'm looking forward to seeing him here in the oval office . "
the pkk uses bases in the mountainous region for cross-border attacks as part of its 23-year campaign for self-rule in turkey 's mainly kurdish southeast .
turkey has reportedly massed up to 100,000 troops on the border with iraq and has threatened a military incursion to strike at the pkk bases unless baghdad and washington make good on promises to crack down on the rebels .
turkish troops have been engaged in major operations targeting the pkk since october 21 when a group of rebels , who ankara says infiltrated from northern iraq , ambushed a military unit , killing 12 soldiers and capturing eight .
the army says it has since killed 80 rebels on turkish territory .
pkk calls for peace plan as ankara announces sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments and sanctions put pressure on the pkk a top pkk commander on thursday called on ankara to present a peace plan that could end the group 's rebellion , which has claimed more than 37,000 lives since it began in 1984 .
ankara categorically refuses to have any contact with or make any concessions to the pkk .
turkey increased the pressure on northern iraq thursday by imposing economic sanctions that specifically target the pkk and its supporters .
foreign minister ali babacan said that a list of measures had been drawn up and that some had already been put in place but said turkey would not be announcing what these measures were .
the foreign minister said the sanctions were not aimed at the people of iraq but were specifically targeted at the pkk and those who support them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

work on a new exhibition space at former gestapo headquarters began on friday . a 200-meter -lrb- 656-foot -rrb- strip of the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse marks part of the boundary between the famous kreuzberg district and a neighborhood that was once in the eastern part of the german capital .
it is one of the few remaining vestiges of the one-time symbol of a divided europe .
but besides being the very focal point of the cold war , it was also here that adolf hitler 's secret police masterminded the 12-year reign of terror from 1933 to 1945 that led to the extermination of six million european jews and countless other victims .
this was the location of the headquarters of the much-feared gestapo . since 1987 , black-and-white photo reproductions documenting the nazi terror have been posted in a temporary outdoor exhibit near the ruins of the former gestapo and reich security offices , which were destroyed during the war by allied bombs . while the exhibit , called the " topography of terror , " draws roughly 400,000 visitors a year , for two decades now efforts have been underway to create a more permanent exhibition , but the project has been plagued by expensive false starts . on friday , nov .
2 , a ground-breaking ceremony took place attended by berlin mayor klaus wowereit and german culture minister bernd neumann for a new " remembrance and documentation center " in the german capital for victims of wartime gestapo terror . " it 's true .
we are going to build the remembrance and documentation center - finally , perhaps , some people will say , " wowereit said . focus on nazi perpetrators , not victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other exhibits devoted to nazi era focus on victims of holocaust although berlin is already home to exhibitions that look at the nazi genocide , such as daniel libeskind 's jewish museum and peter eisenman 's holocaust memorial , the focus of the topography of terror foundation is different , said executive director andreas nachema .
" this is not a memorial and the focus is not on jews and other victims , such as gypsies or communists .
we focus on the nazi perpetrators , the secret police and the ordinary germans who supported them , " he said .
" visitors can come to this historical site in berlin , which was once the artery of the third reich , and they should walk away with a feel for the dimension of what happened , " added nachema , who pointed out that the architectural design of the building should not get in the way of , but serve the exhibits .
in 1993 , swiss architect peter zumthor was commissioned to design a permanent home for the " topography of terror " exhibition on the vacant lot between the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse and wilhelmstrasse in the heart of the city . but serious technical flaws in the design became apparent and the design itself came under fire for , for example , letting in too much natural sunlight that would make it difficult to read the text accompanying the exhibits . " zumthor 's design concept was impossible to build , " said stefanie endlich , the foundation 's publicist and a member of the board . in addition , there were concerns that a building and exhibit focusing on the nazi perpetrators could lead to the site becoming a place of pilgrimage for neo-nazis , long a quandary that urban planners in germany have faced .
technical and budgetary problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 200-meter stretch of the berlin wall will remain at the site by 1999 the project , for which the city had earmarked 37 million deutschmarks -lrb- € 19 million or $ 27.5 million -rrb- , had all but collapsed .
although about two-thirds of the budget had been spent , only the foundation and a few supports had been built .
several construction companies working on the project went bankrupt .
new estimates found that another 28 million euros would be needed to complete the building and berlin , already facing a huge budget deficit , decided in 2000 to scrap the project .
the structures on the site were razed in 2004 .
the next year , the city held a competition for another concept and in january 2006 , a more modest design by local architect ursula wilms was chosen .
there has been no shortage of critics of how berlin 's urban planners handled the project .
at the center of the controversy was hans stimmann , berlin 's building director from 1991 until 2006 .
he was a powerful advocate of the zumthor design , even though it became clear early on that it was technically flawed , said nachema .
" stimmann was fixated on the idea that the city of berlin had to have a building designed by zumthor and no one dared challenge him , " he said .
new building to open in 2009 reunification in 1990 and the german parliament 's decision to move the capital from bonn to berlin the following year became the impetus for redesigning the city on a grand scale .
big-name architects , such as sir norman foster , renzo piano and helmut jahn flocked to berlin to reinvent prominent buildings such as the reichstag and thoroughfares such as potsdamer platz .
it had been leveled during world war ii and remained a barren no man 's land during the cold war . bildunterschrift : berlin architect ursula wilms won new competition for a less costly design today potsdamer platz is a gleaming group of high-rises and modern architecture , while the " topography of terror " is still basically a collection of posters amid the ruins of a cellar . wilms design for the topography of terror , a simple rectangular structure sheathed inside a metallic mesh , is now budgeted at 19 million euros . the section of the berlin wall now there will remain as part of the site 's landscape and a small section of the documentation center , which looks out onto niederkirchnerstrasse , will be devoted to the individuals who , according to andreas nachema , " tried to scale the wall of inhumanity .

more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
a spokesman for germany 's bfv domestic intelligence services , commenting on the reports , said that the kongra-gel , the pkk 's political wing , is blackmailing kurdish immigrants with mafia-like demands for protection money of one month 's salary a year or much more in the case of wealthy businessmen .
" in this way they collect millions of euros in germany every year , " the spokesperson stated .
the reports came to light in the wake of violent clashes between kurds and turkish nationalists in berlin , heilbronn and mülheim at last weekend .
in berlin , 18 policemen were injured trying to break up fighting between the two sides , after turkish nationalists held a march in support of ankara 's threat to launch strikes on pkk bases in northern iraq .
the german intelligence services have since stepped up their surveillance of pkk activists in germany .
they estimate that there are 11,500 pkk members in germany , of whom 1,000 live in berlin .
germany banned the pkk in 1993 after it carried out a campaign of fire-bombings on turkish and german institutions in berlin .
pkk activity in germany intensifies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german kurds are pressured to contribute to the pkk cause experts have been monitoring an intensification of pkk activities in germany , which is home to 2.5 million turks - the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
pkk activity slowed down in 2003 but has gradually been picking up in the four years since , according to reports .
according to german police sources , the pkk is also involved in drug trafficking in germany and uses the spoils to fund its separatist struggle .
police have confirmed that several investigations have revealed a link between the pkk and drug dealers .
turkish intelligence services believe that the pkk raises 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- a year and last year spent 15 million euros on arms , notably in iraq .
in april , police confiscated 16,000 euros in banknotes in a raid on 32 suspected members of the pkk in bavaria in southern germany .
in recent years , a number of pkk members have been arrested in germany for securing financing for the group , which has been branded a terrorist organization by turkey , the united states and the european union .
last year german police arrested a turk of kurdish origin suspected of being the leader of the pkk and kongra-gel in germany and heading its fundraising and propaganda activities here .
turkey slams germany for playing down pkk however , the turkish community in germany has recently accused the country 's media of playing down the threat posed by the pkk .
germany 's largest turkish-language newspaper , hürriyet wrote last week that " the german media have a blind spot when it comes to the pkk , referring to repeated descriptions of the organization as " kurdish rebels , " " pkk members " , " separatists " and " radical kurds . "
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also criticized european countries recently for failing to arrest and extradite wanted kurdish militants to turkey .
istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said at a symposium in istanbul last weekend .
" the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad , " he said .
rice in turkey as fears of cross-border strikes mount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice wants to avoid a turkish incursion into iraq meanwhile , turkey refused to rule out cross-border attacks on pkk positions in iraq but tried to ally fears by saying such an attack would target guerrilla bases and not amount to an " invasion . "
us secretary of state condoleezza rice arrived in ankara on friday to urge turkey not to destabilize northern iraq by launching any cross-border military strike .
rice is to meet turkish president abdullah gul , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minister ali babacan on friday afternoon .
" anything that would destabilize the north of iraq is not going to be in turkey 's interest , " rice said before arriving for the talks .
" it is not going to be in our interest .
it is not going to be in iraq 's interest .
so that has been the reason for urging restraint .
" the first point that we have to underscore is that turkey , the united states and iraq have a common enemy in the pkk , " she added .
" we want to develop a very effective strategy for dealing with this threat but we are not going to be able to do this without coordination of the three nations . "
bush , erdogan to discuss pkk strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush sees the pkk as a common enemy both baghdad and washington strongly oppose any unilateral turkish action in northern iraq on the grounds that it would destabilize the only relatively calm region of the war-torn country .
us president george w. bush will meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in washington next week to discuss cooperation against the iraq-based kurdish fighters .
" i look forward to visiting with prime minister erdogan on this important subject as to how we can work together to prevent people from coming out of mountain ranges to do harm to turkish troops , " bush told reporters on thursday .
" we will have a good , substantive discussion , as you would expect allies to do .
and i 'm looking forward to seeing him here in the oval office . "
the pkk uses bases in the mountainous region for cross-border attacks as part of its 23-year campaign for self-rule in turkey 's mainly kurdish southeast .
turkey has reportedly massed up to 100,000 troops on the border with iraq and has threatened a military incursion to strike at the pkk bases unless baghdad and washington make good on promises to crack down on the rebels .
turkish troops have been engaged in major operations targeting the pkk since october 21 when a group of rebels , who ankara says infiltrated from northern iraq , ambushed a military unit , killing 12 soldiers and capturing eight .
the army says it has since killed 80 rebels on turkish territory .
pkk calls for peace plan as ankara announces sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments and sanctions put pressure on the pkk a top pkk commander on thursday called on ankara to present a peace plan that could end the group 's rebellion , which has claimed more than 37,000 lives since it began in 1984 .
ankara categorically refuses to have any contact with or make any concessions to the pkk .
turkey increased the pressure on northern iraq thursday by imposing economic sanctions that specifically target the pkk and its supporters .
foreign minister ali babacan said that a list of measures had been drawn up and that some had already been put in place but said turkey would not be announcing what these measures were .
the foreign minister said the sanctions were not aimed at the people of iraq but were specifically targeted at the pkk and those who support them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

work on a new exhibition space at former gestapo headquarters began on friday . a 200-meter -lrb- 656-foot -rrb- strip of the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse marks part of the boundary between the famous kreuzberg district and a neighborhood that was once in the eastern part of the german capital .
it is one of the few remaining vestiges of the one-time symbol of a divided europe .
but besides being the very focal point of the cold war , it was also here that adolf hitler 's secret police masterminded the 12-year reign of terror from 1933 to 1945 that led to the extermination of six million european jews and countless other victims .
this was the location of the headquarters of the much-feared gestapo . since 1987 , black-and-white photo reproductions documenting the nazi terror have been posted in a temporary outdoor exhibit near the ruins of the former gestapo and reich security offices , which were destroyed during the war by allied bombs . while the exhibit , called the " topography of terror , " draws roughly 400,000 visitors a year , for two decades now efforts have been underway to create a more permanent exhibition , but the project has been plagued by expensive false starts . on friday , nov .
2 , a ground-breaking ceremony took place attended by berlin mayor klaus wowereit and german culture minister bernd neumann for a new " remembrance and documentation center " in the german capital for victims of wartime gestapo terror . " it 's true .
we are going to build the remembrance and documentation center - finally , perhaps , some people will say , " wowereit said . focus on nazi perpetrators , not victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other exhibits devoted to nazi era focus on victims of holocaust although berlin is already home to exhibitions that look at the nazi genocide , such as daniel libeskind 's jewish museum and peter eisenman 's holocaust memorial , the focus of the topography of terror foundation is different , said executive director andreas nachema .
" this is not a memorial and the focus is not on jews and other victims , such as gypsies or communists .
we focus on the nazi perpetrators , the secret police and the ordinary germans who supported them , " he said .
" visitors can come to this historical site in berlin , which was once the artery of the third reich , and they should walk away with a feel for the dimension of what happened , " added nachema , who pointed out that the architectural design of the building should not get in the way of , but serve the exhibits .
in 1993 , swiss architect peter zumthor was commissioned to design a permanent home for the " topography of terror " exhibition on the vacant lot between the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse and wilhelmstrasse in the heart of the city . but serious technical flaws in the design became apparent and the design itself came under fire for , for example , letting in too much natural sunlight that would make it difficult to read the text accompanying the exhibits . " zumthor 's design concept was impossible to build , " said stefanie endlich , the foundation 's publicist and a member of the board . in addition , there were concerns that a building and exhibit focusing on the nazi perpetrators could lead to the site becoming a place of pilgrimage for neo-nazis , long a quandary that urban planners in germany have faced .
technical and budgetary problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 200-meter stretch of the berlin wall will remain at the site by 1999 the project , for which the city had earmarked 37 million deutschmarks -lrb- € 19 million or $ 27.5 million -rrb- , had all but collapsed .
although about two-thirds of the budget had been spent , only the foundation and a few supports had been built .
several construction companies working on the project went bankrupt .
new estimates found that another 28 million euros would be needed to complete the building and berlin , already facing a huge budget deficit , decided in 2000 to scrap the project .
the structures on the site were razed in 2004 .
the next year , the city held a competition for another concept and in january 2006 , a more modest design by local architect ursula wilms was chosen .
there has been no shortage of critics of how berlin 's urban planners handled the project .
at the center of the controversy was hans stimmann , berlin 's building director from 1991 until 2006 .
he was a powerful advocate of the zumthor design , even though it became clear early on that it was technically flawed , said nachema .
" stimmann was fixated on the idea that the city of berlin had to have a building designed by zumthor and no one dared challenge him , " he said .
new building to open in 2009 reunification in 1990 and the german parliament 's decision to move the capital from bonn to berlin the following year became the impetus for redesigning the city on a grand scale .
big-name architects , such as sir norman foster , renzo piano and helmut jahn flocked to berlin to reinvent prominent buildings such as the reichstag and thoroughfares such as potsdamer platz .
it had been leveled during world war ii and remained a barren no man 's land during the cold war . bildunterschrift : berlin architect ursula wilms won new competition for a less costly design today potsdamer platz is a gleaming group of high-rises and modern architecture , while the " topography of terror " is still basically a collection of posters amid the ruins of a cellar . wilms design for the topography of terror , a simple rectangular structure sheathed inside a metallic mesh , is now budgeted at 19 million euros . the section of the berlin wall now there will remain as part of the site 's landscape and a small section of the documentation center , which looks out onto niederkirchnerstrasse , will be devoted to the individuals who , according to andreas nachema , " tried to scale the wall of inhumanity .

the next year , the city held a competition for another concept and in january 2006 , a more modest design by local architect ursula wilms was chosen .
there has been no shortage of critics of how berlin 's urban planners handled the project .
at the center of the controversy was hans stimmann , berlin 's building director from 1991 until 2006 .
he was a powerful advocate of the zumthor design , even though it became clear early on that it was technically flawed , said nachema .
" stimmann was fixated on the idea that the city of berlin had to have a building designed by zumthor and no one dared challenge him , " he said .
new building to open in 2009 reunification in 1990 and the german parliament 's decision to move the capital from bonn to berlin the following year became the impetus for redesigning the city on a grand scale .
big-name architects , such as sir norman foster , renzo piano and helmut jahn flocked to berlin to reinvent prominent buildings such as the reichstag and thoroughfares such as potsdamer platz .
it had been leveled during world war ii and remained a barren no man 's land during the cold war . bildunterschrift : berlin architect ursula wilms won new competition for a less costly design today potsdamer platz is a gleaming group of high-rises and modern architecture , while the " topography of terror " is still basically a collection of posters amid the ruins of a cellar . wilms design for the topography of terror , a simple rectangular structure sheathed inside a metallic mesh , is now budgeted at 19 million euros . the section of the berlin wall now there will remain as part of the site 's landscape and a small section of the documentation center , which looks out onto niederkirchnerstrasse , will be devoted to the individuals who , according to andreas nachema , " tried to scale the wall of inhumanity .

work on a new exhibition space at former gestapo headquarters began on friday . a 200-meter -lrb- 656-foot -rrb- strip of the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse marks part of the boundary between the famous kreuzberg district and a neighborhood that was once in the eastern part of the german capital .
it is one of the few remaining vestiges of the one-time symbol of a divided europe .
but besides being the very focal point of the cold war , it was also here that adolf hitler 's secret police masterminded the 12-year reign of terror from 1933 to 1945 that led to the extermination of six million european jews and countless other victims .
this was the location of the headquarters of the much-feared gestapo . since 1987 , black-and-white photo reproductions documenting the nazi terror have been posted in a temporary outdoor exhibit near the ruins of the former gestapo and reich security offices , which were destroyed during the war by allied bombs . while the exhibit , called the " topography of terror , " draws roughly 400,000 visitors a year , for two decades now efforts have been underway to create a more permanent exhibition , but the project has been plagued by expensive false starts . on friday , nov .
2 , a ground-breaking ceremony took place attended by berlin mayor klaus wowereit and german culture minister bernd neumann for a new " remembrance and documentation center " in the german capital for victims of wartime gestapo terror . " it 's true .
we are going to build the remembrance and documentation center - finally , perhaps , some people will say , " wowereit said . focus on nazi perpetrators , not victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other exhibits devoted to nazi era focus on victims of holocaust although berlin is already home to exhibitions that look at the nazi genocide , such as daniel libeskind 's jewish museum and peter eisenman 's holocaust memorial , the focus of the topography of terror foundation is different , said executive director andreas nachema .
" this is not a memorial and the focus is not on jews and other victims , such as gypsies or communists .
we focus on the nazi perpetrators , the secret police and the ordinary germans who supported them , " he said .
" visitors can come to this historical site in berlin , which was once the artery of the third reich , and they should walk away with a feel for the dimension of what happened , " added nachema , who pointed out that the architectural design of the building should not get in the way of , but serve the exhibits .
in 1993 , swiss architect peter zumthor was commissioned to design a permanent home for the " topography of terror " exhibition on the vacant lot between the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse and wilhelmstrasse in the heart of the city . but serious technical flaws in the design became apparent and the design itself came under fire for , for example , letting in too much natural sunlight that would make it difficult to read the text accompanying the exhibits . " zumthor 's design concept was impossible to build , " said stefanie endlich , the foundation 's publicist and a member of the board . in addition , there were concerns that a building and exhibit focusing on the nazi perpetrators could lead to the site becoming a place of pilgrimage for neo-nazis , long a quandary that urban planners in germany have faced .
technical and budgetary problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 200-meter stretch of the berlin wall will remain at the site by 1999 the project , for which the city had earmarked 37 million deutschmarks -lrb- € 19 million or $ 27.5 million -rrb- , had all but collapsed .
although about two-thirds of the budget had been spent , only the foundation and a few supports had been built .
several construction companies working on the project went bankrupt .
new estimates found that another 28 million euros would be needed to complete the building and berlin , already facing a huge budget deficit , decided in 2000 to scrap the project .
the structures on the site were razed in 2004 .
the next year , the city held a competition for another concept and in january 2006 , a more modest design by local architect ursula wilms was chosen .

almost one year after the eu partially froze turkey 's membership talks , the report - due to be released next week - urges turkey " to renew the momentum of political reforms " and states that " significant further efforts are needed in particular on freedom of expression , on civilian control of the military , and on the rights of non-muslim communities . "
turkey chastized on freedom of speech the eu suspended eight chapters of turkey 's 35-chapter eu negotiations package last year , citing ankara 's continuing blockade on traffic from eu member state cyprus - which is illegal under an eu-turkey customs agreement – as its main reason .
turkey has made " no progress on normalizing bilateral relations " with nicosia since then , the draft report states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu accession bid is one of the most controversial the eu is also concerned about the continued restrictions in freedom of speech and concludes that " the turkish legal system does not fully guarantee freedom of expression in line with european standards " .
the number of prosecutions of journalists , intellectuals and human rights activists for expressing non-violent opinions is on the rise .
the number of people prosecuted almost doubled in 2006 from 2005 and there were further increases in 2007 .
more than half of these cases were brought under the turkish penal code and many of those under article 301 which makes it an offense to insult " turkishness . "
together with the murder of a journalist , hrant dink , this has helped create a climate of self-censorship the draft document says .
eu worries about turkish military brussels is also unhappy about the fact that " the armed forces continue to exercise significant political influence , " in turkey and that " no progress " had been seen in the area of protection of minorities and ensuring cultural diversity in line with eu principles .
the draft takes an even-handed approach on the kurdish issue saying that turkey made " no progress in the area of cultural rights . "
however it notes that the pkk separatist group is on the eu 's terrorist list and talks of a " further deterioration of the situation in terms of attacks by the pkk and other terrorist groups . "
public opinion across the eu is hardening against turkey 's eu membership bid and president nicolas sarkozy of france leads a group of countries opposed to full eu membership for turkey , preferring a looser association with ankara instead .
macedonia not on track either the report , which covers the whole enlargement process , also said eu accession talks with macedonia are unlikely to begin before 2009 at the earliest , dashing skopje 's hopes of them starting next year , due to political problems in the former yugoslav republic , an eu source said on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enlargement commissioner rehn with ex-macedonian prime minister buckovski " they lost a lot of time this year when -lrb- the main ethnic albanian party -rrb- was out of parliament .
they still need to work better on political dialogue to have a climate conducive for reforms , " the source told reuters , speaking on condition of anonymity .
macedonia was officially made a candidate for membership in 2005 , four years after an accord brokered by the eu and nato ended a stand-off between the majority macedonian and minority albanian communities which threatened to plunge the country into civil war .
the eu insisted that entry talks could only begin when it was satisfied with macedonia 's progress on the rule of law , the rights of the albanian minority and the fight against organized crime and corruption .
the commission report is expected to cite the absence of dialogue with the albanian community , the politicization of the civil service and the blockage of key judicial reforms as its reasons for halting the talks .
eu cites corruption , slow progress on law reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia has made progress but more is needed a report in macedonia 's leading newspaper , dnevnik , quoted the draft european commission report as saying that " several laws are still blocked , especially judicial reform " and that " corruption is widespread and a serious problem " .
the continued quarreling between the government and the opposition party representing the country 's large ethnic albanian minority , the mass sackings of civil servants after the change of government in 2006 and the divisions between macedonia 's president and prime minister are also cited by the draft report as being problematic , the paper wrote .
there was also a reference to the dispute between macedonia and greece over the country 's name .
according to dnevnik , the eu report urged to renew the two countries to resolve their differences which arise from greece 's opposition over the use of the name " macedonia " , which is also the name of greece 's northern province .
athens considers its use a sign of territorial ambition .
the neighbors have been involved in un-led talks for a compromise since 1993 , with little progress .
croatia 's eu future in its own hands accession negotiations with croatia have reached full cruising speed , with talks under way on 14 of the 35 chapters but the commission draft warns zagreb that the progress of its membership bid is entirely in its own hands .
the reports states that croatia needs to move faster on reforming its judiciary and fighting corruption while the continuing problem of state aid to industry remains an issue .
however , the report says that democracy and the rule of law have been strengthened and macroeconomic stability maintained .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de third reich -pipe- 02.11.2007 nazi secret police museum finally gets off the ground in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the open-air exhibit will remain until the museum to house it is built building a permanent home for the popular open-air nazi secret police exhibit has taken 20 years due to design and budget problems .
work on a new exhibition space at former gestapo headquarters began on friday . a 200-meter -lrb- 656-foot -rrb- strip of the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse marks part of the boundary between the famous kreuzberg district and a neighborhood that was once in the eastern part of the german capital .
it is one of the few remaining vestiges of the one-time symbol of a divided europe .
but besides being the very focal point of the cold war , it was also here that adolf hitler 's secret police masterminded the 12-year reign of terror from 1933 to 1945 that led to the extermination of six million european jews and countless other victims .
this was the location of the headquarters of the much-feared gestapo . since 1987 , black-and-white photo reproductions documenting the nazi terror have been posted in a temporary outdoor exhibit near the ruins of the former gestapo and reich security offices , which were destroyed during the war by allied bombs . while the exhibit , called the " topography of terror , " draws roughly 400,000 visitors a year , for two decades now efforts have been underway to create a more permanent exhibition , but the project has been plagued by expensive false starts . on friday , nov .
2 , a ground-breaking ceremony took place attended by berlin mayor klaus wowereit and german culture minister bernd neumann for a new " remembrance and documentation center " in the german capital for victims of wartime gestapo terror . " it 's true .
we are going to build the remembrance and documentation center - finally , perhaps , some people will say , " wowereit said . focus on nazi perpetrators , not victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other exhibits devoted to nazi era focus on victims of holocaust although berlin is already home to exhibitions that look at the nazi genocide , such as daniel libeskind 's jewish museum and peter eisenman 's holocaust memorial , the focus of the topography of terror foundation is different , said executive director andreas nachema .
" this is not a memorial and the focus is not on jews and other victims , such as gypsies or communists .
we focus on the nazi perpetrators , the secret police and the ordinary germans who supported them , " he said .
" visitors can come to this historical site in berlin , which was once the artery of the third reich , and they should walk away with a feel for the dimension of what happened , " added nachema , who pointed out that the architectural design of the building should not get in the way of , but serve the exhibits .
in 1993 , swiss architect peter zumthor was commissioned to design a permanent home for the " topography of terror " exhibition on the vacant lot between the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse and wilhelmstrasse in the heart of the city . but serious technical flaws in the design became apparent and the design itself came under fire for , for example , letting in too much natural sunlight that would make it difficult to read the text accompanying the exhibits . " zumthor 's design concept was impossible to build , " said stefanie endlich , the foundation 's publicist and a member of the board . in addition , there were concerns that a building and exhibit focusing on the nazi perpetrators could lead to the site becoming a place of pilgrimage for neo-nazis , long a quandary that urban planners in germany have faced .
technical and budgetary problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 200-meter stretch of the berlin wall will remain at the site by 1999 the project , for which the city had earmarked 37 million deutschmarks -lrb- € 19 million or $ 27.5 million -rrb- , had all but collapsed .
although about two-thirds of the budget had been spent , only the foundation and a few supports had been built .
several construction companies working on the project went bankrupt .
new estimates found that another 28 million euros would be needed to complete the building and berlin , already facing a huge budget deficit , decided in 2000 to scrap the project .
the structures on the site were razed in 2004 .
the next year , the city held a competition for another concept and in january 2006 , a more modest design by local architect ursula wilms was chosen .
there has been no shortage of critics of how berlin 's urban planners handled the project .
at the center of the controversy was hans stimmann , berlin 's building director from 1991 until 2006 .
he was a powerful advocate of the zumthor design , even though it became clear early on that it was technically flawed , said nachema .
" stimmann was fixated on the idea that the city of berlin had to have a building designed by zumthor and no one dared challenge him , " he said .
new building to open in 2009 reunification in 1990 and the german parliament 's decision to move the capital from bonn to berlin the following year became the impetus for redesigning the city on a grand scale .
big-name architects , such as sir norman foster , renzo piano and helmut jahn flocked to berlin to reinvent prominent buildings such as the reichstag and thoroughfares such as potsdamer platz .
it had been leveled during world war ii and remained a barren no man 's land during the cold war . bildunterschrift : berlin architect ursula wilms won new competition for a less costly design today potsdamer platz is a gleaming group of high-rises and modern architecture , while the " topography of terror " is still basically a collection of posters amid the ruins of a cellar . wilms design for the topography of terror , a simple rectangular structure sheathed inside a metallic mesh , is now budgeted at 19 million euros . the section of the berlin wall now there will remain as part of the site 's landscape and a small section of the documentation center , which looks out onto niederkirchnerstrasse , will be devoted to the individuals who , according to andreas nachema , " tried to scale the wall of inhumanity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 02.11.2007 turkey , balkan states lagging on reforms , eu report says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu project continues but those wanting to join must fulfil its strict criteria a key annual progress report by the european commission says reforms are slowing down both in turkey and the western balkans , indicating that eu membership is still a distant dream for the countries . amid preparations for a new committee on the future of the eu which may try to determine where europe 's frontiers should lie and how much further the bloc should expand , the eu commission 's annual progress report is set to chide ankara for its lack of progress on reforms .
almost one year after the eu partially froze turkey 's membership talks , the report - due to be released next week - urges turkey " to renew the momentum of political reforms " and states that " significant further efforts are needed in particular on freedom of expression , on civilian control of the military , and on the rights of non-muslim communities . "
turkey chastized on freedom of speech the eu suspended eight chapters of turkey 's 35-chapter eu negotiations package last year , citing ankara 's continuing blockade on traffic from eu member state cyprus - which is illegal under an eu-turkey customs agreement – as its main reason .
turkey has made " no progress on normalizing bilateral relations " with nicosia since then , the draft report states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu accession bid is one of the most controversial the eu is also concerned about the continued restrictions in freedom of speech and concludes that " the turkish legal system does not fully guarantee freedom of expression in line with european standards " .
the number of prosecutions of journalists , intellectuals and human rights activists for expressing non-violent opinions is on the rise .
the number of people prosecuted almost doubled in 2006 from 2005 and there were further increases in 2007 .
more than half of these cases were brought under the turkish penal code and many of those under article 301 which makes it an offense to insult " turkishness . "
together with the murder of a journalist , hrant dink , this has helped create a climate of self-censorship the draft document says .
eu worries about turkish military brussels is also unhappy about the fact that " the armed forces continue to exercise significant political influence , " in turkey and that " no progress " had been seen in the area of protection of minorities and ensuring cultural diversity in line with eu principles .
the draft takes an even-handed approach on the kurdish issue saying that turkey made " no progress in the area of cultural rights . "
however it notes that the pkk separatist group is on the eu 's terrorist list and talks of a " further deterioration of the situation in terms of attacks by the pkk and other terrorist groups . "
public opinion across the eu is hardening against turkey 's eu membership bid and president nicolas sarkozy of france leads a group of countries opposed to full eu membership for turkey , preferring a looser association with ankara instead .
macedonia not on track either the report , which covers the whole enlargement process , also said eu accession talks with macedonia are unlikely to begin before 2009 at the earliest , dashing skopje 's hopes of them starting next year , due to political problems in the former yugoslav republic , an eu source said on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enlargement commissioner rehn with ex-macedonian prime minister buckovski " they lost a lot of time this year when -lrb- the main ethnic albanian party -rrb- was out of parliament .
they still need to work better on political dialogue to have a climate conducive for reforms , " the source told reuters , speaking on condition of anonymity .
macedonia was officially made a candidate for membership in 2005 , four years after an accord brokered by the eu and nato ended a stand-off between the majority macedonian and minority albanian communities which threatened to plunge the country into civil war .
the eu insisted that entry talks could only begin when it was satisfied with macedonia 's progress on the rule of law , the rights of the albanian minority and the fight against organized crime and corruption .
the commission report is expected to cite the absence of dialogue with the albanian community , the politicization of the civil service and the blockage of key judicial reforms as its reasons for halting the talks .
eu cites corruption , slow progress on law reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia has made progress but more is needed a report in macedonia 's leading newspaper , dnevnik , quoted the draft european commission report as saying that " several laws are still blocked , especially judicial reform " and that " corruption is widespread and a serious problem " .
the continued quarreling between the government and the opposition party representing the country 's large ethnic albanian minority , the mass sackings of civil servants after the change of government in 2006 and the divisions between macedonia 's president and prime minister are also cited by the draft report as being problematic , the paper wrote .
there was also a reference to the dispute between macedonia and greece over the country 's name .
according to dnevnik , the eu report urged to renew the two countries to resolve their differences which arise from greece 's opposition over the use of the name " macedonia " , which is also the name of greece 's northern province .
athens considers its use a sign of territorial ambition .
the neighbors have been involved in un-led talks for a compromise since 1993 , with little progress .
croatia 's eu future in its own hands accession negotiations with croatia have reached full cruising speed , with talks under way on 14 of the 35 chapters but the commission draft warns zagreb that the progress of its membership bid is entirely in its own hands .
the reports states that croatia needs to move faster on reforming its judiciary and fighting corruption while the continuing problem of state aid to industry remains an issue .
however , the report says that democracy and the rule of law have been strengthened and macroeconomic stability maintained .
croatia started eu accession talks in 2005 along with turkey but has forged ahead and is the only candidate likely to make it to the 27-nation bloc in the next five years , according to eu sources . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu worries about turkish military brussels is also unhappy about the fact that " the armed forces continue to exercise significant political influence , " in turkey and that " no progress " had been seen in the area of protection of minorities and ensuring cultural diversity in line with eu principles .
the draft takes an even-handed approach on the kurdish issue saying that turkey made " no progress in the area of cultural rights . "
however it notes that the pkk separatist group is on the eu 's terrorist list and talks of a " further deterioration of the situation in terms of attacks by the pkk and other terrorist groups . "
public opinion across the eu is hardening against turkey 's eu membership bid and president nicolas sarkozy of france leads a group of countries opposed to full eu membership for turkey , preferring a looser association with ankara instead .
macedonia not on track either the report , which covers the whole enlargement process , also said eu accession talks with macedonia are unlikely to begin before 2009 at the earliest , dashing skopje 's hopes of them starting next year , due to political problems in the former yugoslav republic , an eu source said on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enlargement commissioner rehn with ex-macedonian prime minister buckovski " they lost a lot of time this year when -lrb- the main ethnic albanian party -rrb- was out of parliament .
they still need to work better on political dialogue to have a climate conducive for reforms , " the source told reuters , speaking on condition of anonymity .
macedonia was officially made a candidate for membership in 2005 , four years after an accord brokered by the eu and nato ended a stand-off between the majority macedonian and minority albanian communities which threatened to plunge the country into civil war .
the eu insisted that entry talks could only begin when it was satisfied with macedonia 's progress on the rule of law , the rights of the albanian minority and the fight against organized crime and corruption .
the commission report is expected to cite the absence of dialogue with the albanian community , the politicization of the civil service and the blockage of key judicial reforms as its reasons for halting the talks .
eu cites corruption , slow progress on law reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia has made progress but more is needed a report in macedonia 's leading newspaper , dnevnik , quoted the draft european commission report as saying that " several laws are still blocked , especially judicial reform " and that " corruption is widespread and a serious problem " .
the continued quarreling between the government and the opposition party representing the country 's large ethnic albanian minority , the mass sackings of civil servants after the change of government in 2006 and the divisions between macedonia 's president and prime minister are also cited by the draft report as being problematic , the paper wrote .
there was also a reference to the dispute between macedonia and greece over the country 's name .
according to dnevnik , the eu report urged to renew the two countries to resolve their differences which arise from greece 's opposition over the use of the name " macedonia " , which is also the name of greece 's northern province .
athens considers its use a sign of territorial ambition .
the neighbors have been involved in un-led talks for a compromise since 1993 , with little progress .
croatia 's eu future in its own hands accession negotiations with croatia have reached full cruising speed , with talks under way on 14 of the 35 chapters but the commission draft warns zagreb that the progress of its membership bid is entirely in its own hands .
the reports states that croatia needs to move faster on reforming its judiciary and fighting corruption while the continuing problem of state aid to industry remains an issue .
however , the report says that democracy and the rule of law have been strengthened and macroeconomic stability maintained .
croatia started eu accession talks in 2005 along with turkey but has forged ahead and is the only candidate likely to make it to the 27-nation bloc in the next five years , according to eu sources . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de third reich -pipe- 02.11.2007 nazi secret police museum finally gets off the ground in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the open-air exhibit will remain until the museum to house it is built building a permanent home for the popular open-air nazi secret police exhibit has taken 20 years due to design and budget problems .
work on a new exhibition space at former gestapo headquarters began on friday . a 200-meter -lrb- 656-foot -rrb- strip of the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse marks part of the boundary between the famous kreuzberg district and a neighborhood that was once in the eastern part of the german capital .
it is one of the few remaining vestiges of the one-time symbol of a divided europe .
but besides being the very focal point of the cold war , it was also here that adolf hitler 's secret police masterminded the 12-year reign of terror from 1933 to 1945 that led to the extermination of six million european jews and countless other victims .
this was the location of the headquarters of the much-feared gestapo . since 1987 , black-and-white photo reproductions documenting the nazi terror have been posted in a temporary outdoor exhibit near the ruins of the former gestapo and reich security offices , which were destroyed during the war by allied bombs . while the exhibit , called the " topography of terror , " draws roughly 400,000 visitors a year , for two decades now efforts have been underway to create a more permanent exhibition , but the project has been plagued by expensive false starts . on friday , nov .
2 , a ground-breaking ceremony took place attended by berlin mayor klaus wowereit and german culture minister bernd neumann for a new " remembrance and documentation center " in the german capital for victims of wartime gestapo terror . " it 's true .
we are going to build the remembrance and documentation center - finally , perhaps , some people will say , " wowereit said . focus on nazi perpetrators , not victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other exhibits devoted to nazi era focus on victims of holocaust although berlin is already home to exhibitions that look at the nazi genocide , such as daniel libeskind 's jewish museum and peter eisenman 's holocaust memorial , the focus of the topography of terror foundation is different , said executive director andreas nachema .
" this is not a memorial and the focus is not on jews and other victims , such as gypsies or communists .
we focus on the nazi perpetrators , the secret police and the ordinary germans who supported them , " he said .
" visitors can come to this historical site in berlin , which was once the artery of the third reich , and they should walk away with a feel for the dimension of what happened , " added nachema , who pointed out that the architectural design of the building should not get in the way of , but serve the exhibits .
in 1993 , swiss architect peter zumthor was commissioned to design a permanent home for the " topography of terror " exhibition on the vacant lot between the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse and wilhelmstrasse in the heart of the city . but serious technical flaws in the design became apparent and the design itself came under fire for , for example , letting in too much natural sunlight that would make it difficult to read the text accompanying the exhibits . " zumthor 's design concept was impossible to build , " said stefanie endlich , the foundation 's publicist and a member of the board . in addition , there were concerns that a building and exhibit focusing on the nazi perpetrators could lead to the site becoming a place of pilgrimage for neo-nazis , long a quandary that urban planners in germany have faced .
technical and budgetary problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 200-meter stretch of the berlin wall will remain at the site by 1999 the project , for which the city had earmarked 37 million deutschmarks -lrb- € 19 million or $ 27.5 million -rrb- , had all but collapsed .
although about two-thirds of the budget had been spent , only the foundation and a few supports had been built .
several construction companies working on the project went bankrupt .
new estimates found that another 28 million euros would be needed to complete the building and berlin , already facing a huge budget deficit , decided in 2000 to scrap the project .
the structures on the site were razed in 2004 .
the next year , the city held a competition for another concept and in january 2006 , a more modest design by local architect ursula wilms was chosen .
there has been no shortage of critics of how berlin 's urban planners handled the project .
at the center of the controversy was hans stimmann , berlin 's building director from 1991 until 2006 .
he was a powerful advocate of the zumthor design , even though it became clear early on that it was technically flawed , said nachema .
" stimmann was fixated on the idea that the city of berlin had to have a building designed by zumthor and no one dared challenge him , " he said .
new building to open in 2009 reunification in 1990 and the german parliament 's decision to move the capital from bonn to berlin the following year became the impetus for redesigning the city on a grand scale .
big-name architects , such as sir norman foster , renzo piano and helmut jahn flocked to berlin to reinvent prominent buildings such as the reichstag and thoroughfares such as potsdamer platz .
it had been leveled during world war ii and remained a barren no man 's land during the cold war . bildunterschrift : berlin architect ursula wilms won new competition for a less costly design today potsdamer platz is a gleaming group of high-rises and modern architecture , while the " topography of terror " is still basically a collection of posters amid the ruins of a cellar . wilms design for the topography of terror , a simple rectangular structure sheathed inside a metallic mesh , is now budgeted at 19 million euros . the section of the berlin wall now there will remain as part of the site 's landscape and a small section of the documentation center , which looks out onto niederkirchnerstrasse , will be devoted to the individuals who , according to andreas nachema , " tried to scale the wall of inhumanity .

there are fears that more strikes could hit the economy hard . the court on friday , nov .
2 , overturned a ruling last month that imposed a ban on strikes affecting the long-distance and freight services of deutsche bahn , germany 's national railway . " the decision opens the door to strikes that will cause major disruptions to freight and passenger traffic , " deutsche bahn negotiator werner bayreuther said after the ruling .
" this is not a good day for our clients . manfred schell , head of the gdl union which represents about 34,000 drivers , applauded the ruling and urged deutsche bahn to come up with another offer or face more strike action . drivers with the gdl union , which represents about 34,000 deutsche bahn employees , says its workers are underpaid in comparison with those elsewhere in europe and wants pay raises of up to 31 percent .
it has rejected a deal for a 4.5 percent wage hike struck between the rail company and two other unions .
it also refused a separate offer made by deutsche bahn . gdl , which has brought much of germany 's local commuter traffic to a halt repeatedly over recent weeks , said it aimed to target goods traffic , if the regional labor court sitting in the city of chemnitz upheld its appeal . analysts have said a strike that includes freight services could have a serious impact on europe 's largest economy .
the reach of deutsche bahn , a transport and logistics giant , spreads across europe and into asia and the middle east . freight fears a freight strike would seriously affect germany 's key carmaking , steel and chemicals sectors , with analysts putting the total costs at up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 75 million -rrb- a day , according to estimates from the german institute for economic research in berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goods deliveries by rail could be halted " when freight traffic is included the economic damages naturally occur quickly , " the institutes claudia kemfert told deutsche welle . many german companies have cut standing stocks in favor of punctual delivery , meaning a break in deliveries could lead some firms to stop their production lines , she added . german automaker daimler , however , said a freight strike would have little effect on its production . " we have been preparing for a possible strike for a long time , " a company spokesman said on friday , adding that the company would meet its transportation requirement through additional road service . harbors rely on rail deliveries harbor operators in the german port cities of bremen and hamburg also rely heavily on db to deliver freight containers .
nearly 70 percent of the containers that pass through the two harbors are loaded onto trains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for an agreement between the railway and the gdl union a deutsche bahn spokesman said thursday that an additional 100,000 trailer trucks would be required to transport the goods currently conveyed by rail .
experts , however , said road transportation would not match the scale of rail transport ant that harbor storage facilities would fill within two days . " every freight car , every locomotive and every locomotive conductor is desperately needed , " according to a statement from the germany steel economic association . the train conductors ' union , gdl , pledged before the ruling that there would be no strikes over the weekend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 02.11.2007 turkey , balkan states lagging on reforms , eu report says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu project continues but those wanting to join must fulfil its strict criteria a key annual progress report by the european commission says reforms are slowing down both in turkey and the western balkans , indicating that eu membership is still a distant dream for the countries . amid preparations for a new committee on the future of the eu which may try to determine where europe 's frontiers should lie and how much further the bloc should expand , the eu commission 's annual progress report is set to chide ankara for its lack of progress on reforms .
almost one year after the eu partially froze turkey 's membership talks , the report - due to be released next week - urges turkey " to renew the momentum of political reforms " and states that " significant further efforts are needed in particular on freedom of expression , on civilian control of the military , and on the rights of non-muslim communities . "
turkey chastized on freedom of speech the eu suspended eight chapters of turkey 's 35-chapter eu negotiations package last year , citing ankara 's continuing blockade on traffic from eu member state cyprus - which is illegal under an eu-turkey customs agreement – as its main reason .
turkey has made " no progress on normalizing bilateral relations " with nicosia since then , the draft report states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu accession bid is one of the most controversial the eu is also concerned about the continued restrictions in freedom of speech and concludes that " the turkish legal system does not fully guarantee freedom of expression in line with european standards " .
the number of prosecutions of journalists , intellectuals and human rights activists for expressing non-violent opinions is on the rise .
the number of people prosecuted almost doubled in 2006 from 2005 and there were further increases in 2007 .
more than half of these cases were brought under the turkish penal code and many of those under article 301 which makes it an offense to insult " turkishness . "
together with the murder of a journalist , hrant dink , this has helped create a climate of self-censorship the draft document says .
eu worries about turkish military brussels is also unhappy about the fact that " the armed forces continue to exercise significant political influence , " in turkey and that " no progress " had been seen in the area of protection of minorities and ensuring cultural diversity in line with eu principles .
the draft takes an even-handed approach on the kurdish issue saying that turkey made " no progress in the area of cultural rights . "
however it notes that the pkk separatist group is on the eu 's terrorist list and talks of a " further deterioration of the situation in terms of attacks by the pkk and other terrorist groups . "
public opinion across the eu is hardening against turkey 's eu membership bid and president nicolas sarkozy of france leads a group of countries opposed to full eu membership for turkey , preferring a looser association with ankara instead .
macedonia not on track either the report , which covers the whole enlargement process , also said eu accession talks with macedonia are unlikely to begin before 2009 at the earliest , dashing skopje 's hopes of them starting next year , due to political problems in the former yugoslav republic , an eu source said on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enlargement commissioner rehn with ex-macedonian prime minister buckovski " they lost a lot of time this year when -lrb- the main ethnic albanian party -rrb- was out of parliament .
they still need to work better on political dialogue to have a climate conducive for reforms , " the source told reuters , speaking on condition of anonymity .
macedonia was officially made a candidate for membership in 2005 , four years after an accord brokered by the eu and nato ended a stand-off between the majority macedonian and minority albanian communities which threatened to plunge the country into civil war .
the eu insisted that entry talks could only begin when it was satisfied with macedonia 's progress on the rule of law , the rights of the albanian minority and the fight against organized crime and corruption .
the commission report is expected to cite the absence of dialogue with the albanian community , the politicization of the civil service and the blockage of key judicial reforms as its reasons for halting the talks .
eu cites corruption , slow progress on law reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia has made progress but more is needed a report in macedonia 's leading newspaper , dnevnik , quoted the draft european commission report as saying that " several laws are still blocked , especially judicial reform " and that " corruption is widespread and a serious problem " .
the continued quarreling between the government and the opposition party representing the country 's large ethnic albanian minority , the mass sackings of civil servants after the change of government in 2006 and the divisions between macedonia 's president and prime minister are also cited by the draft report as being problematic , the paper wrote .
there was also a reference to the dispute between macedonia and greece over the country 's name .
according to dnevnik , the eu report urged to renew the two countries to resolve their differences which arise from greece 's opposition over the use of the name " macedonia " , which is also the name of greece 's northern province .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 02.11.2007 germany reports pkk funding as tensions rise on iraq border großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tensions have been rising on the turkish-iraqi border while the tensions between turkey and kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- rebels continue , reports in germany suggest that kurds living in the country are forced to hand over millions of euros to the group . experts believe that while some of germany 's 600,000 kurdish immigrants give the money willingly to fund its separatist campaign in southeastern turkey , others are pressured into contributing under duress .
the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
a spokesman for germany 's bfv domestic intelligence services , commenting on the reports , said that the kongra-gel , the pkk 's political wing , is blackmailing kurdish immigrants with mafia-like demands for protection money of one month 's salary a year or much more in the case of wealthy businessmen .
" in this way they collect millions of euros in germany every year , " the spokesperson stated .
the reports came to light in the wake of violent clashes between kurds and turkish nationalists in berlin , heilbronn and mülheim at last weekend .
in berlin , 18 policemen were injured trying to break up fighting between the two sides , after turkish nationalists held a march in support of ankara 's threat to launch strikes on pkk bases in northern iraq .
the german intelligence services have since stepped up their surveillance of pkk activists in germany .
they estimate that there are 11,500 pkk members in germany , of whom 1,000 live in berlin .
germany banned the pkk in 1993 after it carried out a campaign of fire-bombings on turkish and german institutions in berlin .
pkk activity in germany intensifies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german kurds are pressured to contribute to the pkk cause experts have been monitoring an intensification of pkk activities in germany , which is home to 2.5 million turks - the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
pkk activity slowed down in 2003 but has gradually been picking up in the four years since , according to reports .
according to german police sources , the pkk is also involved in drug trafficking in germany and uses the spoils to fund its separatist struggle .
police have confirmed that several investigations have revealed a link between the pkk and drug dealers .
turkish intelligence services believe that the pkk raises 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- a year and last year spent 15 million euros on arms , notably in iraq .
in april , police confiscated 16,000 euros in banknotes in a raid on 32 suspected members of the pkk in bavaria in southern germany .
in recent years , a number of pkk members have been arrested in germany for securing financing for the group , which has been branded a terrorist organization by turkey , the united states and the european union .
last year german police arrested a turk of kurdish origin suspected of being the leader of the pkk and kongra-gel in germany and heading its fundraising and propaganda activities here .
turkey slams germany for playing down pkk however , the turkish community in germany has recently accused the country 's media of playing down the threat posed by the pkk .
germany 's largest turkish-language newspaper , hürriyet wrote last week that " the german media have a blind spot when it comes to the pkk , referring to repeated descriptions of the organization as " kurdish rebels , " " pkk members " , " separatists " and " radical kurds . "
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also criticized european countries recently for failing to arrest and extradite wanted kurdish militants to turkey .
istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said at a symposium in istanbul last weekend .
" the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad , " he said .
rice in turkey as fears of cross-border strikes mount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice wants to avoid a turkish incursion into iraq meanwhile , turkey refused to rule out cross-border attacks on pkk positions in iraq but tried to ally fears by saying such an attack would target guerrilla bases and not amount to an " invasion . "
us secretary of state condoleezza rice arrived in ankara on friday to urge turkey not to destabilize northern iraq by launching any cross-border military strike .
rice is to meet turkish president abdullah gul , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minister ali babacan on friday afternoon .
" anything that would destabilize the north of iraq is not going to be in turkey 's interest , " rice said before arriving for the talks .
" it is not going to be in our interest .
it is not going to be in iraq 's interest .
so that has been the reason for urging restraint .
" the first point that we have to underscore is that turkey , the united states and iraq have a common enemy in the pkk , " she added .
" we want to develop a very effective strategy for dealing with this threat but we are not going to be able to do this without coordination of the three nations . "
bush , erdogan to discuss pkk strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush sees the pkk as a common enemy both baghdad and washington strongly oppose any unilateral turkish action in northern iraq on the grounds that it would destabilize the only relatively calm region of the war-torn country .
us president george w. bush will meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in washington next week to discuss cooperation against the iraq-based kurdish fighters .
" i look forward to visiting with prime minister erdogan on this important subject as to how we can work together to prevent people from coming out of mountain ranges to do harm to turkish troops , " bush told reporters on thursday .
" we will have a good , substantive discussion , as you would expect allies to do .
and i 'm looking forward to seeing him here in the oval office . "
the pkk uses bases in the mountainous region for cross-border attacks as part of its 23-year campaign for self-rule in turkey 's mainly kurdish southeast .
turkey has reportedly massed up to 100,000 troops on the border with iraq and has threatened a military incursion to strike at the pkk bases unless baghdad and washington make good on promises to crack down on the rebels .
turkish troops have been engaged in major operations targeting the pkk since october 21 when a group of rebels , who ankara says infiltrated from northern iraq , ambushed a military unit , killing 12 soldiers and capturing eight .
the army says it has since killed 80 rebels on turkish territory .
pkk calls for peace plan as ankara announces sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments and sanctions put pressure on the pkk a top pkk commander on thursday called on ankara to present a peace plan that could end the group 's rebellion , which has claimed more than 37,000 lives since it began in 1984 .
ankara categorically refuses to have any contact with or make any concessions to the pkk .
turkey increased the pressure on northern iraq thursday by imposing economic sanctions that specifically target the pkk and its supporters .
foreign minister ali babacan said that a list of measures had been drawn up and that some had already been put in place but said turkey would not be announcing what these measures were .
the foreign minister said the sanctions were not aimed at the people of iraq but were specifically targeted at the pkk and those who support them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

work on a new exhibition space at former gestapo headquarters began on friday . a 200-meter -lrb- 656-foot -rrb- strip of the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse marks part of the boundary between the famous kreuzberg district and a neighborhood that was once in the eastern part of the german capital .
it is one of the few remaining vestiges of the one-time symbol of a divided europe .
but besides being the very focal point of the cold war , it was also here that adolf hitler 's secret police masterminded the 12-year reign of terror from 1933 to 1945 that led to the extermination of six million european jews and countless other victims .
this was the location of the headquarters of the much-feared gestapo . since 1987 , black-and-white photo reproductions documenting the nazi terror have been posted in a temporary outdoor exhibit near the ruins of the former gestapo and reich security offices , which were destroyed during the war by allied bombs . while the exhibit , called the " topography of terror , " draws roughly 400,000 visitors a year , for two decades now efforts have been underway to create a more permanent exhibition , but the project has been plagued by expensive false starts . on friday , nov .
2 , a ground-breaking ceremony took place attended by berlin mayor klaus wowereit and german culture minister bernd neumann for a new " remembrance and documentation center " in the german capital for victims of wartime gestapo terror . " it 's true .
we are going to build the remembrance and documentation center - finally , perhaps , some people will say , " wowereit said . focus on nazi perpetrators , not victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other exhibits devoted to nazi era focus on victims of holocaust although berlin is already home to exhibitions that look at the nazi genocide , such as daniel libeskind 's jewish museum and peter eisenman 's holocaust memorial , the focus of the topography of terror foundation is different , said executive director andreas nachema .
" this is not a memorial and the focus is not on jews and other victims , such as gypsies or communists .
we focus on the nazi perpetrators , the secret police and the ordinary germans who supported them , " he said .
" visitors can come to this historical site in berlin , which was once the artery of the third reich , and they should walk away with a feel for the dimension of what happened , " added nachema , who pointed out that the architectural design of the building should not get in the way of , but serve the exhibits .
in 1993 , swiss architect peter zumthor was commissioned to design a permanent home for the " topography of terror " exhibition on the vacant lot between the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse and wilhelmstrasse in the heart of the city . but serious technical flaws in the design became apparent and the design itself came under fire for , for example , letting in too much natural sunlight that would make it difficult to read the text accompanying the exhibits . " zumthor 's design concept was impossible to build , " said stefanie endlich , the foundation 's publicist and a member of the board . in addition , there were concerns that a building and exhibit focusing on the nazi perpetrators could lead to the site becoming a place of pilgrimage for neo-nazis , long a quandary that urban planners in germany have faced .
technical and budgetary problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 200-meter stretch of the berlin wall will remain at the site by 1999 the project , for which the city had earmarked 37 million deutschmarks -lrb- € 19 million or $ 27.5 million -rrb- , had all but collapsed .
although about two-thirds of the budget had been spent , only the foundation and a few supports had been built .
several construction companies working on the project went bankrupt .
new estimates found that another 28 million euros would be needed to complete the building and berlin , already facing a huge budget deficit , decided in 2000 to scrap the project .
the structures on the site were razed in 2004 .
the next year , the city held a competition for another concept and in january 2006 , a more modest design by local architect ursula wilms was chosen .
there has been no shortage of critics of how berlin 's urban planners handled the project .
at the center of the controversy was hans stimmann , berlin 's building director from 1991 until 2006 .
he was a powerful advocate of the zumthor design , even though it became clear early on that it was technically flawed , said nachema .
" stimmann was fixated on the idea that the city of berlin had to have a building designed by zumthor and no one dared challenge him , " he said .
new building to open in 2009 reunification in 1990 and the german parliament 's decision to move the capital from bonn to berlin the following year became the impetus for redesigning the city on a grand scale .
big-name architects , such as sir norman foster , renzo piano and helmut jahn flocked to berlin to reinvent prominent buildings such as the reichstag and thoroughfares such as potsdamer platz .
it had been leveled during world war ii and remained a barren no man 's land during the cold war . bildunterschrift : berlin architect ursula wilms won new competition for a less costly design today potsdamer platz is a gleaming group of high-rises and modern architecture , while the " topography of terror " is still basically a collection of posters amid the ruins of a cellar . wilms design for the topography of terror , a simple rectangular structure sheathed inside a metallic mesh , is now budgeted at 19 million euros . the section of the berlin wall now there will remain as part of the site 's landscape and a small section of the documentation center , which looks out onto niederkirchnerstrasse , will be devoted to the individuals who , according to andreas nachema , " tried to scale the wall of inhumanity .

almost one year after the eu partially froze turkey 's membership talks , the report - due to be released next week - urges turkey " to renew the momentum of political reforms " and states that " significant further efforts are needed in particular on freedom of expression , on civilian control of the military , and on the rights of non-muslim communities . "
turkey chastized on freedom of speech the eu suspended eight chapters of turkey 's 35-chapter eu negotiations package last year , citing ankara 's continuing blockade on traffic from eu member state cyprus - which is illegal under an eu-turkey customs agreement – as its main reason .
turkey has made " no progress on normalizing bilateral relations " with nicosia since then , the draft report states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu accession bid is one of the most controversial the eu is also concerned about the continued restrictions in freedom of speech and concludes that " the turkish legal system does not fully guarantee freedom of expression in line with european standards " .
the number of prosecutions of journalists , intellectuals and human rights activists for expressing non-violent opinions is on the rise .
the number of people prosecuted almost doubled in 2006 from 2005 and there were further increases in 2007 .
more than half of these cases were brought under the turkish penal code and many of those under article 301 which makes it an offense to insult " turkishness . "
together with the murder of a journalist , hrant dink , this has helped create a climate of self-censorship the draft document says .
eu worries about turkish military brussels is also unhappy about the fact that " the armed forces continue to exercise significant political influence , " in turkey and that " no progress " had been seen in the area of protection of minorities and ensuring cultural diversity in line with eu principles .
the draft takes an even-handed approach on the kurdish issue saying that turkey made " no progress in the area of cultural rights . "
however it notes that the pkk separatist group is on the eu 's terrorist list and talks of a " further deterioration of the situation in terms of attacks by the pkk and other terrorist groups . "
public opinion across the eu is hardening against turkey 's eu membership bid and president nicolas sarkozy of france leads a group of countries opposed to full eu membership for turkey , preferring a looser association with ankara instead .
macedonia not on track either the report , which covers the whole enlargement process , also said eu accession talks with macedonia are unlikely to begin before 2009 at the earliest , dashing skopje 's hopes of them starting next year , due to political problems in the former yugoslav republic , an eu source said on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enlargement commissioner rehn with ex-macedonian prime minister buckovski " they lost a lot of time this year when -lrb- the main ethnic albanian party -rrb- was out of parliament .
they still need to work better on political dialogue to have a climate conducive for reforms , " the source told reuters , speaking on condition of anonymity .
macedonia was officially made a candidate for membership in 2005 , four years after an accord brokered by the eu and nato ended a stand-off between the majority macedonian and minority albanian communities which threatened to plunge the country into civil war .
the eu insisted that entry talks could only begin when it was satisfied with macedonia 's progress on the rule of law , the rights of the albanian minority and the fight against organized crime and corruption .
the commission report is expected to cite the absence of dialogue with the albanian community , the politicization of the civil service and the blockage of key judicial reforms as its reasons for halting the talks .
eu cites corruption , slow progress on law reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia has made progress but more is needed a report in macedonia 's leading newspaper , dnevnik , quoted the draft european commission report as saying that " several laws are still blocked , especially judicial reform " and that " corruption is widespread and a serious problem " .
the continued quarreling between the government and the opposition party representing the country 's large ethnic albanian minority , the mass sackings of civil servants after the change of government in 2006 and the divisions between macedonia 's president and prime minister are also cited by the draft report as being problematic , the paper wrote .
there was also a reference to the dispute between macedonia and greece over the country 's name .
according to dnevnik , the eu report urged to renew the two countries to resolve their differences which arise from greece 's opposition over the use of the name " macedonia " , which is also the name of greece 's northern province .
athens considers its use a sign of territorial ambition .
the neighbors have been involved in un-led talks for a compromise since 1993 , with little progress .
croatia 's eu future in its own hands accession negotiations with croatia have reached full cruising speed , with talks under way on 14 of the 35 chapters but the commission draft warns zagreb that the progress of its membership bid is entirely in its own hands .
the reports states that croatia needs to move faster on reforming its judiciary and fighting corruption while the continuing problem of state aid to industry remains an issue .
however , the report says that democracy and the rule of law have been strengthened and macroeconomic stability maintained .

almost one year after the eu partially froze turkey 's membership talks , the report - due to be released next week - urges turkey " to renew the momentum of political reforms " and states that " significant further efforts are needed in particular on freedom of expression , on civilian control of the military , and on the rights of non-muslim communities . "
turkey chastized on freedom of speech the eu suspended eight chapters of turkey 's 35-chapter eu negotiations package last year , citing ankara 's continuing blockade on traffic from eu member state cyprus - which is illegal under an eu-turkey customs agreement – as its main reason .
turkey has made " no progress on normalizing bilateral relations " with nicosia since then , the draft report states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu accession bid is one of the most controversial the eu is also concerned about the continued restrictions in freedom of speech and concludes that " the turkish legal system does not fully guarantee freedom of expression in line with european standards " .
the number of prosecutions of journalists , intellectuals and human rights activists for expressing non-violent opinions is on the rise .
the number of people prosecuted almost doubled in 2006 from 2005 and there were further increases in 2007 .
more than half of these cases were brought under the turkish penal code and many of those under article 301 which makes it an offense to insult " turkishness . "
together with the murder of a journalist , hrant dink , this has helped create a climate of self-censorship the draft document says .
eu worries about turkish military brussels is also unhappy about the fact that " the armed forces continue to exercise significant political influence , " in turkey and that " no progress " had been seen in the area of protection of minorities and ensuring cultural diversity in line with eu principles .
the draft takes an even-handed approach on the kurdish issue saying that turkey made " no progress in the area of cultural rights . "
however it notes that the pkk separatist group is on the eu 's terrorist list and talks of a " further deterioration of the situation in terms of attacks by the pkk and other terrorist groups . "
public opinion across the eu is hardening against turkey 's eu membership bid and president nicolas sarkozy of france leads a group of countries opposed to full eu membership for turkey , preferring a looser association with ankara instead .
macedonia not on track either the report , which covers the whole enlargement process , also said eu accession talks with macedonia are unlikely to begin before 2009 at the earliest , dashing skopje 's hopes of them starting next year , due to political problems in the former yugoslav republic , an eu source said on tuesday .

macedonia was officially made a candidate for membership in 2005 , four years after an accord brokered by the eu and nato ended a stand-off between the majority macedonian and minority albanian communities which threatened to plunge the country into civil war .
the eu insisted that entry talks could only begin when it was satisfied with macedonia 's progress on the rule of law , the rights of the albanian minority and the fight against organized crime and corruption .
the commission report is expected to cite the absence of dialogue with the albanian community , the politicization of the civil service and the blockage of key judicial reforms as its reasons for halting the talks .

the continued quarreling between the government and the opposition party representing the country 's large ethnic albanian minority , the mass sackings of civil servants after the change of government in 2006 and the divisions between macedonia 's president and prime minister are also cited by the draft report as being problematic , the paper wrote .
there was also a reference to the dispute between macedonia and greece over the country 's name .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as a frequent visitor from india to germany , i feel that german impressions of india are very dated .
india is changing rapidly nowadays and a decade makes a lot of difference .
india is already an economic and technological power in many areas .
yes , it has many poor people but that is bound to happen with a population of 1.1 billion .
i doubt india will achieve the living standards of germany for many decades .
but a simple doubling of gdp , which is possible in the next 10 years , can wipe out the widespread poverty which was the source of buddha 's awakening even 2500 years ago .
germany should open up to india in trade and people movement and take advantage of our 700 million young people under the age of 30 . - ranjan ganguli , india i 'd like to praise angela markel , who made a slight shift from china to see india .
i regret previous german politicians ' inability to see india as nothing more than a multifaceted , poor country .
if germany wants to make its presence felt in india it needs to correct its outlook towards india and not judge it in figures but by its possibilities . - minakshi , india bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel met with indian prime minister singh on tuesday while the policy of the government is to attract investments and skilled professionals from india , the conduct of the foreign office employees is becoming increasingly hostile .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 02.11.2007 germany reports pkk funding as tensions rise on iraq border großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tensions have been rising on the turkish-iraqi border while the tensions between turkey and kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- rebels continue , reports in germany suggest that kurds living in the country are forced to hand over millions of euros to the group . experts believe that while some of germany 's 600,000 kurdish immigrants give the money willingly to fund its separatist campaign in southeastern turkey , others are pressured into contributing under duress .
the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
a spokesman for germany 's bfv domestic intelligence services , commenting on the reports , said that the kongra-gel , the pkk 's political wing , is blackmailing kurdish immigrants with mafia-like demands for protection money of one month 's salary a year or much more in the case of wealthy businessmen .
" in this way they collect millions of euros in germany every year , " the spokesperson stated .
the reports came to light in the wake of violent clashes between kurds and turkish nationalists in berlin , heilbronn and mülheim at last weekend .
in berlin , 18 policemen were injured trying to break up fighting between the two sides , after turkish nationalists held a march in support of ankara 's threat to launch strikes on pkk bases in northern iraq .
the german intelligence services have since stepped up their surveillance of pkk activists in germany .
they estimate that there are 11,500 pkk members in germany , of whom 1,000 live in berlin .
germany banned the pkk in 1993 after it carried out a campaign of fire-bombings on turkish and german institutions in berlin .
pkk activity in germany intensifies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german kurds are pressured to contribute to the pkk cause experts have been monitoring an intensification of pkk activities in germany , which is home to 2.5 million turks - the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
pkk activity slowed down in 2003 but has gradually been picking up in the four years since , according to reports .
according to german police sources , the pkk is also involved in drug trafficking in germany and uses the spoils to fund its separatist struggle .
police have confirmed that several investigations have revealed a link between the pkk and drug dealers .
turkish intelligence services believe that the pkk raises 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- a year and last year spent 15 million euros on arms , notably in iraq .
in april , police confiscated 16,000 euros in banknotes in a raid on 32 suspected members of the pkk in bavaria in southern germany .
in recent years , a number of pkk members have been arrested in germany for securing financing for the group , which has been branded a terrorist organization by turkey , the united states and the european union .
last year german police arrested a turk of kurdish origin suspected of being the leader of the pkk and kongra-gel in germany and heading its fundraising and propaganda activities here .
turkey slams germany for playing down pkk however , the turkish community in germany has recently accused the country 's media of playing down the threat posed by the pkk .
germany 's largest turkish-language newspaper , hürriyet wrote last week that " the german media have a blind spot when it comes to the pkk , referring to repeated descriptions of the organization as " kurdish rebels , " " pkk members " , " separatists " and " radical kurds . "
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also criticized european countries recently for failing to arrest and extradite wanted kurdish militants to turkey .
istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said at a symposium in istanbul last weekend .

rice in turkey as fears of cross-border strikes mount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice wants to avoid a turkish incursion into iraq meanwhile , turkey refused to rule out cross-border attacks on pkk positions in iraq but tried to ally fears by saying such an attack would target guerrilla bases and not amount to an " invasion . "
us secretary of state condoleezza rice arrived in ankara on friday to urge turkey not to destabilize northern iraq by launching any cross-border military strike .
rice is to meet turkish president abdullah gul , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minister ali babacan on friday afternoon .
" anything that would destabilize the north of iraq is not going to be in turkey 's interest , " rice said before arriving for the talks .
" it is not going to be in our interest .
it is not going to be in iraq 's interest .
so that has been the reason for urging restraint .
" the first point that we have to underscore is that turkey , the united states and iraq have a common enemy in the pkk , " she added .
" we want to develop a very effective strategy for dealing with this threat but we are not going to be able to do this without coordination of the three nations . "
bush , erdogan to discuss pkk strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush sees the pkk as a common enemy both baghdad and washington strongly oppose any unilateral turkish action in northern iraq on the grounds that it would destabilize the only relatively calm region of the war-torn country .
us president george w. bush will meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in washington next week to discuss cooperation against the iraq-based kurdish fighters .
" i look forward to visiting with prime minister erdogan on this important subject as to how we can work together to prevent people from coming out of mountain ranges to do harm to turkish troops , " bush told reporters on thursday .
" we will have a good , substantive discussion , as you would expect allies to do .
and i 'm looking forward to seeing him here in the oval office . "
the pkk uses bases in the mountainous region for cross-border attacks as part of its 23-year campaign for self-rule in turkey 's mainly kurdish southeast .
turkey has reportedly massed up to 100,000 troops on the border with iraq and has threatened a military incursion to strike at the pkk bases unless baghdad and washington make good on promises to crack down on the rebels .
turkish troops have been engaged in major operations targeting the pkk since october 21 when a group of rebels , who ankara says infiltrated from northern iraq , ambushed a military unit , killing 12 soldiers and capturing eight .
the army says it has since killed 80 rebels on turkish territory .
pkk calls for peace plan as ankara announces sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments and sanctions put pressure on the pkk a top pkk commander on thursday called on ankara to present a peace plan that could end the group 's rebellion , which has claimed more than 37,000 lives since it began in 1984 .
ankara categorically refuses to have any contact with or make any concessions to the pkk .
turkey increased the pressure on northern iraq thursday by imposing economic sanctions that specifically target the pkk and its supporters .
foreign minister ali babacan said that a list of measures had been drawn up and that some had already been put in place but said turkey would not be announcing what these measures were .
the foreign minister said the sanctions were not aimed at the people of iraq but were specifically targeted at the pkk and those who support them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
a spokesman for germany 's bfv domestic intelligence services , commenting on the reports , said that the kongra-gel , the pkk 's political wing , is blackmailing kurdish immigrants with mafia-like demands for protection money of one month 's salary a year or much more in the case of wealthy businessmen .
" in this way they collect millions of euros in germany every year , " the spokesperson stated .
the reports came to light in the wake of violent clashes between kurds and turkish nationalists in berlin , heilbronn and mülheim at last weekend .
in berlin , 18 policemen were injured trying to break up fighting between the two sides , after turkish nationalists held a march in support of ankara 's threat to launch strikes on pkk bases in northern iraq .
the german intelligence services have since stepped up their surveillance of pkk activists in germany .
they estimate that there are 11,500 pkk members in germany , of whom 1,000 live in berlin .
germany banned the pkk in 1993 after it carried out a campaign of fire-bombings on turkish and german institutions in berlin .
pkk activity in germany intensifies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german kurds are pressured to contribute to the pkk cause experts have been monitoring an intensification of pkk activities in germany , which is home to 2.5 million turks - the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
pkk activity slowed down in 2003 but has gradually been picking up in the four years since , according to reports .
according to german police sources , the pkk is also involved in drug trafficking in germany and uses the spoils to fund its separatist struggle .
police have confirmed that several investigations have revealed a link between the pkk and drug dealers .
turkish intelligence services believe that the pkk raises 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- a year and last year spent 15 million euros on arms , notably in iraq .
in april , police confiscated 16,000 euros in banknotes in a raid on 32 suspected members of the pkk in bavaria in southern germany .
in recent years , a number of pkk members have been arrested in germany for securing financing for the group , which has been branded a terrorist organization by turkey , the united states and the european union .
last year german police arrested a turk of kurdish origin suspected of being the leader of the pkk and kongra-gel in germany and heading its fundraising and propaganda activities here .
turkey slams germany for playing down pkk however , the turkish community in germany has recently accused the country 's media of playing down the threat posed by the pkk .
germany 's largest turkish-language newspaper , hürriyet wrote last week that " the german media have a blind spot when it comes to the pkk , referring to repeated descriptions of the organization as " kurdish rebels , " " pkk members " , " separatists " and " radical kurds . "
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also criticized european countries recently for failing to arrest and extradite wanted kurdish militants to turkey .
istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said at a symposium in istanbul last weekend .
" the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad , " he said .
rice in turkey as fears of cross-border strikes mount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice wants to avoid a turkish incursion into iraq meanwhile , turkey refused to rule out cross-border attacks on pkk positions in iraq but tried to ally fears by saying such an attack would target guerrilla bases and not amount to an " invasion . "
us secretary of state condoleezza rice arrived in ankara on friday to urge turkey not to destabilize northern iraq by launching any cross-border military strike .
rice is to meet turkish president abdullah gul , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minister ali babacan on friday afternoon .
" anything that would destabilize the north of iraq is not going to be in turkey 's interest , " rice said before arriving for the talks .
" it is not going to be in our interest .
it is not going to be in iraq 's interest .
so that has been the reason for urging restraint .
" the first point that we have to underscore is that turkey , the united states and iraq have a common enemy in the pkk , " she added .
" we want to develop a very effective strategy for dealing with this threat but we are not going to be able to do this without coordination of the three nations . "
bush , erdogan to discuss pkk strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush sees the pkk as a common enemy both baghdad and washington strongly oppose any unilateral turkish action in northern iraq on the grounds that it would destabilize the only relatively calm region of the war-torn country .
us president george w. bush will meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in washington next week to discuss cooperation against the iraq-based kurdish fighters .
" i look forward to visiting with prime minister erdogan on this important subject as to how we can work together to prevent people from coming out of mountain ranges to do harm to turkish troops , " bush told reporters on thursday .
" we will have a good , substantive discussion , as you would expect allies to do .
and i 'm looking forward to seeing him here in the oval office . "
the pkk uses bases in the mountainous region for cross-border attacks as part of its 23-year campaign for self-rule in turkey 's mainly kurdish southeast .
turkey has reportedly massed up to 100,000 troops on the border with iraq and has threatened a military incursion to strike at the pkk bases unless baghdad and washington make good on promises to crack down on the rebels .
turkish troops have been engaged in major operations targeting the pkk since october 21 when a group of rebels , who ankara says infiltrated from northern iraq , ambushed a military unit , killing 12 soldiers and capturing eight .
the army says it has since killed 80 rebels on turkish territory .
pkk calls for peace plan as ankara announces sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments and sanctions put pressure on the pkk a top pkk commander on thursday called on ankara to present a peace plan that could end the group 's rebellion , which has claimed more than 37,000 lives since it began in 1984 .
ankara categorically refuses to have any contact with or make any concessions to the pkk .
turkey increased the pressure on northern iraq thursday by imposing economic sanctions that specifically target the pkk and its supporters .
foreign minister ali babacan said that a list of measures had been drawn up and that some had already been put in place but said turkey would not be announcing what these measures were .
the foreign minister said the sanctions were not aimed at the people of iraq but were specifically targeted at the pkk and those who support them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
a spokesman for germany 's bfv domestic intelligence services , commenting on the reports , said that the kongra-gel , the pkk 's political wing , is blackmailing kurdish immigrants with mafia-like demands for protection money of one month 's salary a year or much more in the case of wealthy businessmen .
" in this way they collect millions of euros in germany every year , " the spokesperson stated .
the reports came to light in the wake of violent clashes between kurds and turkish nationalists in berlin , heilbronn and mülheim at last weekend .
in berlin , 18 policemen were injured trying to break up fighting between the two sides , after turkish nationalists held a march in support of ankara 's threat to launch strikes on pkk bases in northern iraq .
the german intelligence services have since stepped up their surveillance of pkk activists in germany .
they estimate that there are 11,500 pkk members in germany , of whom 1,000 live in berlin .
germany banned the pkk in 1993 after it carried out a campaign of fire-bombings on turkish and german institutions in berlin .
pkk activity in germany intensifies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german kurds are pressured to contribute to the pkk cause experts have been monitoring an intensification of pkk activities in germany , which is home to 2.5 million turks - the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
pkk activity slowed down in 2003 but has gradually been picking up in the four years since , according to reports .
according to german police sources , the pkk is also involved in drug trafficking in germany and uses the spoils to fund its separatist struggle .
police have confirmed that several investigations have revealed a link between the pkk and drug dealers .
turkish intelligence services believe that the pkk raises 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- a year and last year spent 15 million euros on arms , notably in iraq .
in april , police confiscated 16,000 euros in banknotes in a raid on 32 suspected members of the pkk in bavaria in southern germany .
in recent years , a number of pkk members have been arrested in germany for securing financing for the group , which has been branded a terrorist organization by turkey , the united states and the european union .
last year german police arrested a turk of kurdish origin suspected of being the leader of the pkk and kongra-gel in germany and heading its fundraising and propaganda activities here .
turkey slams germany for playing down pkk however , the turkish community in germany has recently accused the country 's media of playing down the threat posed by the pkk .
germany 's largest turkish-language newspaper , hürriyet wrote last week that " the german media have a blind spot when it comes to the pkk , referring to repeated descriptions of the organization as " kurdish rebels , " " pkk members " , " separatists " and " radical kurds . "
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also criticized european countries recently for failing to arrest and extradite wanted kurdish militants to turkey .
istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said at a symposium in istanbul last weekend .
" the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad , " he said .
rice in turkey as fears of cross-border strikes mount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice wants to avoid a turkish incursion into iraq meanwhile , turkey refused to rule out cross-border attacks on pkk positions in iraq but tried to ally fears by saying such an attack would target guerrilla bases and not amount to an " invasion . "
us secretary of state condoleezza rice arrived in ankara on friday to urge turkey not to destabilize northern iraq by launching any cross-border military strike .
rice is to meet turkish president abdullah gul , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minister ali babacan on friday afternoon .
" anything that would destabilize the north of iraq is not going to be in turkey 's interest , " rice said before arriving for the talks .
" it is not going to be in our interest .
it is not going to be in iraq 's interest .
so that has been the reason for urging restraint .
" the first point that we have to underscore is that turkey , the united states and iraq have a common enemy in the pkk , " she added .
" we want to develop a very effective strategy for dealing with this threat but we are not going to be able to do this without coordination of the three nations . "
bush , erdogan to discuss pkk strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush sees the pkk as a common enemy both baghdad and washington strongly oppose any unilateral turkish action in northern iraq on the grounds that it would destabilize the only relatively calm region of the war-torn country .
us president george w. bush will meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in washington next week to discuss cooperation against the iraq-based kurdish fighters .
" i look forward to visiting with prime minister erdogan on this important subject as to how we can work together to prevent people from coming out of mountain ranges to do harm to turkish troops , " bush told reporters on thursday .
" we will have a good , substantive discussion , as you would expect allies to do .
and i 'm looking forward to seeing him here in the oval office . "
the pkk uses bases in the mountainous region for cross-border attacks as part of its 23-year campaign for self-rule in turkey 's mainly kurdish southeast .
turkey has reportedly massed up to 100,000 troops on the border with iraq and has threatened a military incursion to strike at the pkk bases unless baghdad and washington make good on promises to crack down on the rebels .
turkish troops have been engaged in major operations targeting the pkk since october 21 when a group of rebels , who ankara says infiltrated from northern iraq , ambushed a military unit , killing 12 soldiers and capturing eight .
the army says it has since killed 80 rebels on turkish territory .
pkk calls for peace plan as ankara announces sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments and sanctions put pressure on the pkk a top pkk commander on thursday called on ankara to present a peace plan that could end the group 's rebellion , which has claimed more than 37,000 lives since it began in 1984 .
ankara categorically refuses to have any contact with or make any concessions to the pkk .
turkey increased the pressure on northern iraq thursday by imposing economic sanctions that specifically target the pkk and its supporters .
foreign minister ali babacan said that a list of measures had been drawn up and that some had already been put in place but said turkey would not be announcing what these measures were .
the foreign minister said the sanctions were not aimed at the people of iraq but were specifically targeted at the pkk and those who support them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
a spokesman for germany 's bfv domestic intelligence services , commenting on the reports , said that the kongra-gel , the pkk 's political wing , is blackmailing kurdish immigrants with mafia-like demands for protection money of one month 's salary a year or much more in the case of wealthy businessmen .
" in this way they collect millions of euros in germany every year , " the spokesperson stated .
the reports came to light in the wake of violent clashes between kurds and turkish nationalists in berlin , heilbronn and mülheim at last weekend .
in berlin , 18 policemen were injured trying to break up fighting between the two sides , after turkish nationalists held a march in support of ankara 's threat to launch strikes on pkk bases in northern iraq .
the german intelligence services have since stepped up their surveillance of pkk activists in germany .
they estimate that there are 11,500 pkk members in germany , of whom 1,000 live in berlin .
germany banned the pkk in 1993 after it carried out a campaign of fire-bombings on turkish and german institutions in berlin .
pkk activity in germany intensifies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german kurds are pressured to contribute to the pkk cause experts have been monitoring an intensification of pkk activities in germany , which is home to 2.5 million turks - the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
pkk activity slowed down in 2003 but has gradually been picking up in the four years since , according to reports .
according to german police sources , the pkk is also involved in drug trafficking in germany and uses the spoils to fund its separatist struggle .
police have confirmed that several investigations have revealed a link between the pkk and drug dealers .
turkish intelligence services believe that the pkk raises 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- a year and last year spent 15 million euros on arms , notably in iraq .
in april , police confiscated 16,000 euros in banknotes in a raid on 32 suspected members of the pkk in bavaria in southern germany .
in recent years , a number of pkk members have been arrested in germany for securing financing for the group , which has been branded a terrorist organization by turkey , the united states and the european union .
last year german police arrested a turk of kurdish origin suspected of being the leader of the pkk and kongra-gel in germany and heading its fundraising and propaganda activities here .
turkey slams germany for playing down pkk however , the turkish community in germany has recently accused the country 's media of playing down the threat posed by the pkk .
germany 's largest turkish-language newspaper , hürriyet wrote last week that " the german media have a blind spot when it comes to the pkk , referring to repeated descriptions of the organization as " kurdish rebels , " " pkk members " , " separatists " and " radical kurds . "
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also criticized european countries recently for failing to arrest and extradite wanted kurdish militants to turkey .
istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said at a symposium in istanbul last weekend .
" the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad , " he said .
rice in turkey as fears of cross-border strikes mount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice wants to avoid a turkish incursion into iraq meanwhile , turkey refused to rule out cross-border attacks on pkk positions in iraq but tried to ally fears by saying such an attack would target guerrilla bases and not amount to an " invasion . "
us secretary of state condoleezza rice arrived in ankara on friday to urge turkey not to destabilize northern iraq by launching any cross-border military strike .
rice is to meet turkish president abdullah gul , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minister ali babacan on friday afternoon .
" anything that would destabilize the north of iraq is not going to be in turkey 's interest , " rice said before arriving for the talks .
" it is not going to be in our interest .
it is not going to be in iraq 's interest .
so that has been the reason for urging restraint .
" the first point that we have to underscore is that turkey , the united states and iraq have a common enemy in the pkk , " she added .
" we want to develop a very effective strategy for dealing with this threat but we are not going to be able to do this without coordination of the three nations . "
bush , erdogan to discuss pkk strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush sees the pkk as a common enemy both baghdad and washington strongly oppose any unilateral turkish action in northern iraq on the grounds that it would destabilize the only relatively calm region of the war-torn country .
us president george w. bush will meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in washington next week to discuss cooperation against the iraq-based kurdish fighters .
" i look forward to visiting with prime minister erdogan on this important subject as to how we can work together to prevent people from coming out of mountain ranges to do harm to turkish troops , " bush told reporters on thursday .
" we will have a good , substantive discussion , as you would expect allies to do .
and i 'm looking forward to seeing him here in the oval office . "
the pkk uses bases in the mountainous region for cross-border attacks as part of its 23-year campaign for self-rule in turkey 's mainly kurdish southeast .
turkey has reportedly massed up to 100,000 troops on the border with iraq and has threatened a military incursion to strike at the pkk bases unless baghdad and washington make good on promises to crack down on the rebels .
turkish troops have been engaged in major operations targeting the pkk since october 21 when a group of rebels , who ankara says infiltrated from northern iraq , ambushed a military unit , killing 12 soldiers and capturing eight .
the army says it has since killed 80 rebels on turkish territory .
pkk calls for peace plan as ankara announces sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments and sanctions put pressure on the pkk a top pkk commander on thursday called on ankara to present a peace plan that could end the group 's rebellion , which has claimed more than 37,000 lives since it began in 1984 .
ankara categorically refuses to have any contact with or make any concessions to the pkk .
turkey increased the pressure on northern iraq thursday by imposing economic sanctions that specifically target the pkk and its supporters .
foreign minister ali babacan said that a list of measures had been drawn up and that some had already been put in place but said turkey would not be announcing what these measures were .
the foreign minister said the sanctions were not aimed at the people of iraq but were specifically targeted at the pkk and those who support them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

work on a new exhibition space at former gestapo headquarters began on friday . a 200-meter -lrb- 656-foot -rrb- strip of the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse marks part of the boundary between the famous kreuzberg district and a neighborhood that was once in the eastern part of the german capital .
it is one of the few remaining vestiges of the one-time symbol of a divided europe .
but besides being the very focal point of the cold war , it was also here that adolf hitler 's secret police masterminded the 12-year reign of terror from 1933 to 1945 that led to the extermination of six million european jews and countless other victims .
this was the location of the headquarters of the much-feared gestapo . since 1987 , black-and-white photo reproductions documenting the nazi terror have been posted in a temporary outdoor exhibit near the ruins of the former gestapo and reich security offices , which were destroyed during the war by allied bombs . while the exhibit , called the " topography of terror , " draws roughly 400,000 visitors a year , for two decades now efforts have been underway to create a more permanent exhibition , but the project has been plagued by expensive false starts . on friday , nov .
2 , a ground-breaking ceremony took place attended by berlin mayor klaus wowereit and german culture minister bernd neumann for a new " remembrance and documentation center " in the german capital for victims of wartime gestapo terror . " it 's true .
we are going to build the remembrance and documentation center - finally , perhaps , some people will say , " wowereit said . focus on nazi perpetrators , not victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other exhibits devoted to nazi era focus on victims of holocaust although berlin is already home to exhibitions that look at the nazi genocide , such as daniel libeskind 's jewish museum and peter eisenman 's holocaust memorial , the focus of the topography of terror foundation is different , said executive director andreas nachema .
" this is not a memorial and the focus is not on jews and other victims , such as gypsies or communists .
we focus on the nazi perpetrators , the secret police and the ordinary germans who supported them , " he said .
" visitors can come to this historical site in berlin , which was once the artery of the third reich , and they should walk away with a feel for the dimension of what happened , " added nachema , who pointed out that the architectural design of the building should not get in the way of , but serve the exhibits .
in 1993 , swiss architect peter zumthor was commissioned to design a permanent home for the " topography of terror " exhibition on the vacant lot between the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse and wilhelmstrasse in the heart of the city . but serious technical flaws in the design became apparent and the design itself came under fire for , for example , letting in too much natural sunlight that would make it difficult to read the text accompanying the exhibits . " zumthor 's design concept was impossible to build , " said stefanie endlich , the foundation 's publicist and a member of the board . in addition , there were concerns that a building and exhibit focusing on the nazi perpetrators could lead to the site becoming a place of pilgrimage for neo-nazis , long a quandary that urban planners in germany have faced .
technical and budgetary problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 200-meter stretch of the berlin wall will remain at the site by 1999 the project , for which the city had earmarked 37 million deutschmarks -lrb- € 19 million or $ 27.5 million -rrb- , had all but collapsed .
although about two-thirds of the budget had been spent , only the foundation and a few supports had been built .
several construction companies working on the project went bankrupt .
new estimates found that another 28 million euros would be needed to complete the building and berlin , already facing a huge budget deficit , decided in 2000 to scrap the project .
the structures on the site were razed in 2004 .
the next year , the city held a competition for another concept and in january 2006 , a more modest design by local architect ursula wilms was chosen .
there has been no shortage of critics of how berlin 's urban planners handled the project .
at the center of the controversy was hans stimmann , berlin 's building director from 1991 until 2006 .
he was a powerful advocate of the zumthor design , even though it became clear early on that it was technically flawed , said nachema .
" stimmann was fixated on the idea that the city of berlin had to have a building designed by zumthor and no one dared challenge him , " he said .
new building to open in 2009 reunification in 1990 and the german parliament 's decision to move the capital from bonn to berlin the following year became the impetus for redesigning the city on a grand scale .
big-name architects , such as sir norman foster , renzo piano and helmut jahn flocked to berlin to reinvent prominent buildings such as the reichstag and thoroughfares such as potsdamer platz .
it had been leveled during world war ii and remained a barren no man 's land during the cold war . bildunterschrift : berlin architect ursula wilms won new competition for a less costly design today potsdamer platz is a gleaming group of high-rises and modern architecture , while the " topography of terror " is still basically a collection of posters amid the ruins of a cellar . wilms design for the topography of terror , a simple rectangular structure sheathed inside a metallic mesh , is now budgeted at 19 million euros . the section of the berlin wall now there will remain as part of the site 's landscape and a small section of the documentation center , which looks out onto niederkirchnerstrasse , will be devoted to the individuals who , according to andreas nachema , " tried to scale the wall of inhumanity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 02.11.2007 turkey , balkan states lagging on reforms , eu report says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu project continues but those wanting to join must fulfil its strict criteria a key annual progress report by the european commission says reforms are slowing down both in turkey and the western balkans , indicating that eu membership is still a distant dream for the countries . amid preparations for a new committee on the future of the eu which may try to determine where europe 's frontiers should lie and how much further the bloc should expand , the eu commission 's annual progress report is set to chide ankara for its lack of progress on reforms .
almost one year after the eu partially froze turkey 's membership talks , the report - due to be released next week - urges turkey " to renew the momentum of political reforms " and states that " significant further efforts are needed in particular on freedom of expression , on civilian control of the military , and on the rights of non-muslim communities . "
turkey chastized on freedom of speech the eu suspended eight chapters of turkey 's 35-chapter eu negotiations package last year , citing ankara 's continuing blockade on traffic from eu member state cyprus - which is illegal under an eu-turkey customs agreement – as its main reason .
turkey has made " no progress on normalizing bilateral relations " with nicosia since then , the draft report states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu accession bid is one of the most controversial the eu is also concerned about the continued restrictions in freedom of speech and concludes that " the turkish legal system does not fully guarantee freedom of expression in line with european standards " .
the number of prosecutions of journalists , intellectuals and human rights activists for expressing non-violent opinions is on the rise .
the number of people prosecuted almost doubled in 2006 from 2005 and there were further increases in 2007 .
more than half of these cases were brought under the turkish penal code and many of those under article 301 which makes it an offense to insult " turkishness . "
together with the murder of a journalist , hrant dink , this has helped create a climate of self-censorship the draft document says .
eu worries about turkish military brussels is also unhappy about the fact that " the armed forces continue to exercise significant political influence , " in turkey and that " no progress " had been seen in the area of protection of minorities and ensuring cultural diversity in line with eu principles .
the draft takes an even-handed approach on the kurdish issue saying that turkey made " no progress in the area of cultural rights . "
however it notes that the pkk separatist group is on the eu 's terrorist list and talks of a " further deterioration of the situation in terms of attacks by the pkk and other terrorist groups . "

almost one year after the eu partially froze turkey 's membership talks , the report - due to be released next week - urges turkey " to renew the momentum of political reforms " and states that " significant further efforts are needed in particular on freedom of expression , on civilian control of the military , and on the rights of non-muslim communities .

almost one year after the eu partially froze turkey 's membership talks , the report - due to be released next week - urges turkey " to renew the momentum of political reforms " and states that " significant further efforts are needed in particular on freedom of expression , on civilian control of the military , and on the rights of non-muslim communities . "
turkey chastized on freedom of speech the eu suspended eight chapters of turkey 's 35-chapter eu negotiations package last year , citing ankara 's continuing blockade on traffic from eu member state cyprus - which is illegal under an eu-turkey customs agreement – as its main reason .
turkey has made " no progress on normalizing bilateral relations " with nicosia since then , the draft report states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu accession bid is one of the most controversial the eu is also concerned about the continued restrictions in freedom of speech and concludes that " the turkish legal system does not fully guarantee freedom of expression in line with european standards " .
the number of prosecutions of journalists , intellectuals and human rights activists for expressing non-violent opinions is on the rise .
the number of people prosecuted almost doubled in 2006 from 2005 and there were further increases in 2007 .
more than half of these cases were brought under the turkish penal code and many of those under article 301 which makes it an offense to insult " turkishness . "
together with the murder of a journalist , hrant dink , this has helped create a climate of self-censorship the draft document says .
eu worries about turkish military brussels is also unhappy about the fact that " the armed forces continue to exercise significant political influence , " in turkey and that " no progress " had been seen in the area of protection of minorities and ensuring cultural diversity in line with eu principles .
the draft takes an even-handed approach on the kurdish issue saying that turkey made " no progress in the area of cultural rights . "
however it notes that the pkk separatist group is on the eu 's terrorist list and talks of a " further deterioration of the situation in terms of attacks by the pkk and other terrorist groups . "
public opinion across the eu is hardening against turkey 's eu membership bid and president nicolas sarkozy of france leads a group of countries opposed to full eu membership for turkey , preferring a looser association with ankara instead .
macedonia not on track either the report , which covers the whole enlargement process , also said eu accession talks with macedonia are unlikely to begin before 2009 at the earliest , dashing skopje 's hopes of them starting next year , due to political problems in the former yugoslav republic , an eu source said on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enlargement commissioner rehn with ex-macedonian prime minister buckovski " they lost a lot of time this year when -lrb- the main ethnic albanian party -rrb- was out of parliament .
they still need to work better on political dialogue to have a climate conducive for reforms , " the source told reuters , speaking on condition of anonymity .
macedonia was officially made a candidate for membership in 2005 , four years after an accord brokered by the eu and nato ended a stand-off between the majority macedonian and minority albanian communities which threatened to plunge the country into civil war .
the eu insisted that entry talks could only begin when it was satisfied with macedonia 's progress on the rule of law , the rights of the albanian minority and the fight against organized crime and corruption .
the commission report is expected to cite the absence of dialogue with the albanian community , the politicization of the civil service and the blockage of key judicial reforms as its reasons for halting the talks .
eu cites corruption , slow progress on law reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia has made progress but more is needed a report in macedonia 's leading newspaper , dnevnik , quoted the draft european commission report as saying that " several laws are still blocked , especially judicial reform " and that " corruption is widespread and a serious problem " .
the continued quarreling between the government and the opposition party representing the country 's large ethnic albanian minority , the mass sackings of civil servants after the change of government in 2006 and the divisions between macedonia 's president and prime minister are also cited by the draft report as being problematic , the paper wrote .
there was also a reference to the dispute between macedonia and greece over the country 's name .
according to dnevnik , the eu report urged to renew the two countries to resolve their differences which arise from greece 's opposition over the use of the name " macedonia " , which is also the name of greece 's northern province .
athens considers its use a sign of territorial ambition .
the neighbors have been involved in un-led talks for a compromise since 1993 , with little progress .
croatia 's eu future in its own hands accession negotiations with croatia have reached full cruising speed , with talks under way on 14 of the 35 chapters but the commission draft warns zagreb that the progress of its membership bid is entirely in its own hands .
the reports states that croatia needs to move faster on reforming its judiciary and fighting corruption while the continuing problem of state aid to industry remains an issue .
however , the report says that democracy and the rule of law have been strengthened and macroeconomic stability maintained .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 02.11.2007 germany reports pkk funding as tensions rise on iraq border großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tensions have been rising on the turkish-iraqi border while the tensions between turkey and kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- rebels continue , reports in germany suggest that kurds living in the country are forced to hand over millions of euros to the group . experts believe that while some of germany 's 600,000 kurdish immigrants give the money willingly to fund its separatist campaign in southeastern turkey , others are pressured into contributing under duress .
the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
a spokesman for germany 's bfv domestic intelligence services , commenting on the reports , said that the kongra-gel , the pkk 's political wing , is blackmailing kurdish immigrants with mafia-like demands for protection money of one month 's salary a year or much more in the case of wealthy businessmen .
" in this way they collect millions of euros in germany every year , " the spokesperson stated .
the reports came to light in the wake of violent clashes between kurds and turkish nationalists in berlin , heilbronn and mülheim at last weekend .
in berlin , 18 policemen were injured trying to break up fighting between the two sides , after turkish nationalists held a march in support of ankara 's threat to launch strikes on pkk bases in northern iraq .
the german intelligence services have since stepped up their surveillance of pkk activists in germany .
they estimate that there are 11,500 pkk members in germany , of whom 1,000 live in berlin .
germany banned the pkk in 1993 after it carried out a campaign of fire-bombings on turkish and german institutions in berlin .
pkk activity in germany intensifies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german kurds are pressured to contribute to the pkk cause experts have been monitoring an intensification of pkk activities in germany , which is home to 2.5 million turks - the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
pkk activity slowed down in 2003 but has gradually been picking up in the four years since , according to reports .
according to german police sources , the pkk is also involved in drug trafficking in germany and uses the spoils to fund its separatist struggle .
police have confirmed that several investigations have revealed a link between the pkk and drug dealers .
turkish intelligence services believe that the pkk raises 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- a year and last year spent 15 million euros on arms , notably in iraq .
in april , police confiscated 16,000 euros in banknotes in a raid on 32 suspected members of the pkk in bavaria in southern germany .
in recent years , a number of pkk members have been arrested in germany for securing financing for the group , which has been branded a terrorist organization by turkey , the united states and the european union .
last year german police arrested a turk of kurdish origin suspected of being the leader of the pkk and kongra-gel in germany and heading its fundraising and propaganda activities here .
turkey slams germany for playing down pkk however , the turkish community in germany has recently accused the country 's media of playing down the threat posed by the pkk .
germany 's largest turkish-language newspaper , hürriyet wrote last week that " the german media have a blind spot when it comes to the pkk , referring to repeated descriptions of the organization as " kurdish rebels , " " pkk members " , " separatists " and " radical kurds . "
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also criticized european countries recently for failing to arrest and extradite wanted kurdish militants to turkey .
istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said at a symposium in istanbul last weekend .
" the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad , " he said .
rice in turkey as fears of cross-border strikes mount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice wants to avoid a turkish incursion into iraq meanwhile , turkey refused to rule out cross-border attacks on pkk positions in iraq but tried to ally fears by saying such an attack would target guerrilla bases and not amount to an " invasion . "
us secretary of state condoleezza rice arrived in ankara on friday to urge turkey not to destabilize northern iraq by launching any cross-border military strike .
rice is to meet turkish president abdullah gul , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minister ali babacan on friday afternoon .
" anything that would destabilize the north of iraq is not going to be in turkey 's interest , " rice said before arriving for the talks .
" it is not going to be in our interest .
it is not going to be in iraq 's interest .
so that has been the reason for urging restraint .
" the first point that we have to underscore is that turkey , the united states and iraq have a common enemy in the pkk , " she added .
" we want to develop a very effective strategy for dealing with this threat but we are not going to be able to do this without coordination of the three nations . "
bush , erdogan to discuss pkk strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush sees the pkk as a common enemy both baghdad and washington strongly oppose any unilateral turkish action in northern iraq on the grounds that it would destabilize the only relatively calm region of the war-torn country .
us president george w. bush will meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in washington next week to discuss cooperation against the iraq-based kurdish fighters .
" i look forward to visiting with prime minister erdogan on this important subject as to how we can work together to prevent people from coming out of mountain ranges to do harm to turkish troops , " bush told reporters on thursday .
" we will have a good , substantive discussion , as you would expect allies to do .
and i 'm looking forward to seeing him here in the oval office . "
the pkk uses bases in the mountainous region for cross-border attacks as part of its 23-year campaign for self-rule in turkey 's mainly kurdish southeast .
turkey has reportedly massed up to 100,000 troops on the border with iraq and has threatened a military incursion to strike at the pkk bases unless baghdad and washington make good on promises to crack down on the rebels .
turkish troops have been engaged in major operations targeting the pkk since october 21 when a group of rebels , who ankara says infiltrated from northern iraq , ambushed a military unit , killing 12 soldiers and capturing eight .
the army says it has since killed 80 rebels on turkish territory .

ankara categorically refuses to have any contact with or make any concessions to the pkk .
turkey increased the pressure on northern iraq thursday by imposing economic sanctions that specifically target the pkk and its supporters .
foreign minister ali babacan said that a list of measures had been drawn up and that some had already been put in place but said turkey would not be announcing what these measures were .

the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
a spokesman for germany 's bfv domestic intelligence services , commenting on the reports , said that the kongra-gel , the pkk 's political wing , is blackmailing kurdish immigrants with mafia-like demands for protection money of one month 's salary a year or much more in the case of wealthy businessmen .
" in this way they collect millions of euros in germany every year , " the spokesperson stated .
the reports came to light in the wake of violent clashes between kurds and turkish nationalists in berlin , heilbronn and mülheim at last weekend .
in berlin , 18 policemen were injured trying to break up fighting between the two sides , after turkish nationalists held a march in support of ankara 's threat to launch strikes on pkk bases in northern iraq .
the german intelligence services have since stepped up their surveillance of pkk activists in germany .
they estimate that there are 11,500 pkk members in germany , of whom 1,000 live in berlin .
germany banned the pkk in 1993 after it carried out a campaign of fire-bombings on turkish and german institutions in berlin .
pkk activity in germany intensifies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german kurds are pressured to contribute to the pkk cause experts have been monitoring an intensification of pkk activities in germany , which is home to 2.5 million turks - the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
pkk activity slowed down in 2003 but has gradually been picking up in the four years since , according to reports .
according to german police sources , the pkk is also involved in drug trafficking in germany and uses the spoils to fund its separatist struggle .
police have confirmed that several investigations have revealed a link between the pkk and drug dealers .
turkish intelligence services believe that the pkk raises 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- a year and last year spent 15 million euros on arms , notably in iraq .
in april , police confiscated 16,000 euros in banknotes in a raid on 32 suspected members of the pkk in bavaria in southern germany .
in recent years , a number of pkk members have been arrested in germany for securing financing for the group , which has been branded a terrorist organization by turkey , the united states and the european union .
last year german police arrested a turk of kurdish origin suspected of being the leader of the pkk and kongra-gel in germany and heading its fundraising and propaganda activities here .
turkey slams germany for playing down pkk however , the turkish community in germany has recently accused the country 's media of playing down the threat posed by the pkk .
germany 's largest turkish-language newspaper , hürriyet wrote last week that " the german media have a blind spot when it comes to the pkk , referring to repeated descriptions of the organization as " kurdish rebels , " " pkk members " , " separatists " and " radical kurds . "
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also criticized european countries recently for failing to arrest and extradite wanted kurdish militants to turkey .
istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said at a symposium in istanbul last weekend .
" the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad , " he said .

there are fears that more strikes could hit the economy hard . the court on friday , nov .
2 , overturned a ruling last month that imposed a ban on strikes affecting the long-distance and freight services of deutsche bahn , germany 's national railway . " the decision opens the door to strikes that will cause major disruptions to freight and passenger traffic , " deutsche bahn negotiator werner bayreuther said after the ruling .
" this is not a good day for our clients . manfred schell , head of the gdl union which represents about 34,000 drivers , applauded the ruling and urged deutsche bahn to come up with another offer or face more strike action . drivers with the gdl union , which represents about 34,000 deutsche bahn employees , says its workers are underpaid in comparison with those elsewhere in europe and wants pay raises of up to 31 percent .
it has rejected a deal for a 4.5 percent wage hike struck between the rail company and two other unions .
it also refused a separate offer made by deutsche bahn . gdl , which has brought much of germany 's local commuter traffic to a halt repeatedly over recent weeks , said it aimed to target goods traffic , if the regional labor court sitting in the city of chemnitz upheld its appeal . analysts have said a strike that includes freight services could have a serious impact on europe 's largest economy .
the reach of deutsche bahn , a transport and logistics giant , spreads across europe and into asia and the middle east . freight fears a freight strike would seriously affect germany 's key carmaking , steel and chemicals sectors , with analysts putting the total costs at up to 50 million euros -lrb- $ 75 million -rrb- a day , according to estimates from the german institute for economic research in berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goods deliveries by rail could be halted " when freight traffic is included the economic damages naturally occur quickly , " the institutes claudia kemfert told deutsche welle . many german companies have cut standing stocks in favor of punctual delivery , meaning a break in deliveries could lead some firms to stop their production lines , she added . german automaker daimler , however , said a freight strike would have little effect on its production . " we have been preparing for a possible strike for a long time , " a company spokesman said on friday , adding that the company would meet its transportation requirement through additional road service . harbors rely on rail deliveries harbor operators in the german port cities of bremen and hamburg also rely heavily on db to deliver freight containers .
nearly 70 percent of the containers that pass through the two harbors are loaded onto trains . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for an agreement between the railway and the gdl union a deutsche bahn spokesman said thursday that an additional 100,000 trailer trucks would be required to transport the goods currently conveyed by rail .
experts , however , said road transportation would not match the scale of rail transport ant that harbor storage facilities would fill within two days .

almost one year after the eu partially froze turkey 's membership talks , the report - due to be released next week - urges turkey " to renew the momentum of political reforms " and states that " significant further efforts are needed in particular on freedom of expression , on civilian control of the military , and on the rights of non-muslim communities . "
turkey chastized on freedom of speech the eu suspended eight chapters of turkey 's 35-chapter eu negotiations package last year , citing ankara 's continuing blockade on traffic from eu member state cyprus - which is illegal under an eu-turkey customs agreement – as its main reason .
turkey has made " no progress on normalizing bilateral relations " with nicosia since then , the draft report states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu accession bid is one of the most controversial the eu is also concerned about the continued restrictions in freedom of speech and concludes that " the turkish legal system does not fully guarantee freedom of expression in line with european standards " .
the number of prosecutions of journalists , intellectuals and human rights activists for expressing non-violent opinions is on the rise .
the number of people prosecuted almost doubled in 2006 from 2005 and there were further increases in 2007 .
more than half of these cases were brought under the turkish penal code and many of those under article 301 which makes it an offense to insult " turkishness . "
together with the murder of a journalist , hrant dink , this has helped create a climate of self-censorship the draft document says .
eu worries about turkish military brussels is also unhappy about the fact that " the armed forces continue to exercise significant political influence , " in turkey and that " no progress " had been seen in the area of protection of minorities and ensuring cultural diversity in line with eu principles .
the draft takes an even-handed approach on the kurdish issue saying that turkey made " no progress in the area of cultural rights . "
however it notes that the pkk separatist group is on the eu 's terrorist list and talks of a " further deterioration of the situation in terms of attacks by the pkk and other terrorist groups . "
public opinion across the eu is hardening against turkey 's eu membership bid and president nicolas sarkozy of france leads a group of countries opposed to full eu membership for turkey , preferring a looser association with ankara instead .
macedonia not on track either the report , which covers the whole enlargement process , also said eu accession talks with macedonia are unlikely to begin before 2009 at the earliest , dashing skopje 's hopes of them starting next year , due to political problems in the former yugoslav republic , an eu source said on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enlargement commissioner rehn with ex-macedonian prime minister buckovski " they lost a lot of time this year when -lrb- the main ethnic albanian party -rrb- was out of parliament .
they still need to work better on political dialogue to have a climate conducive for reforms , " the source told reuters , speaking on condition of anonymity .
macedonia was officially made a candidate for membership in 2005 , four years after an accord brokered by the eu and nato ended a stand-off between the majority macedonian and minority albanian communities which threatened to plunge the country into civil war .
the eu insisted that entry talks could only begin when it was satisfied with macedonia 's progress on the rule of law , the rights of the albanian minority and the fight against organized crime and corruption .
the commission report is expected to cite the absence of dialogue with the albanian community , the politicization of the civil service and the blockage of key judicial reforms as its reasons for halting the talks .
eu cites corruption , slow progress on law reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia has made progress but more is needed a report in macedonia 's leading newspaper , dnevnik , quoted the draft european commission report as saying that " several laws are still blocked , especially judicial reform " and that " corruption is widespread and a serious problem " .
the continued quarreling between the government and the opposition party representing the country 's large ethnic albanian minority , the mass sackings of civil servants after the change of government in 2006 and the divisions between macedonia 's president and prime minister are also cited by the draft report as being problematic , the paper wrote .
there was also a reference to the dispute between macedonia and greece over the country 's name .
according to dnevnik , the eu report urged to renew the two countries to resolve their differences which arise from greece 's opposition over the use of the name " macedonia " , which is also the name of greece 's northern province .
athens considers its use a sign of territorial ambition .
the neighbors have been involved in un-led talks for a compromise since 1993 , with little progress .
croatia 's eu future in its own hands accession negotiations with croatia have reached full cruising speed , with talks under way on 14 of the 35 chapters but the commission draft warns zagreb that the progress of its membership bid is entirely in its own hands .
the reports states that croatia needs to move faster on reforming its judiciary and fighting corruption while the continuing problem of state aid to industry remains an issue .
however , the report says that democracy and the rule of law have been strengthened and macroeconomic stability maintained .

macedonia not on track either the report , which covers the whole enlargement process , also said eu accession talks with macedonia are unlikely to begin before 2009 at the earliest , dashing skopje 's hopes of them starting next year , due to political problems in the former yugoslav republic , an eu source said on tuesday .

macedonia was officially made a candidate for membership in 2005 , four years after an accord brokered by the eu and nato ended a stand-off between the majority macedonian and minority albanian communities which threatened to plunge the country into civil war .
the eu insisted that entry talks could only begin when it was satisfied with macedonia 's progress on the rule of law , the rights of the albanian minority and the fight against organized crime and corruption .
the commission report is expected to cite the absence of dialogue with the albanian community , the politicization of the civil service and the blockage of key judicial reforms as its reasons for halting the talks .

there was also a reference to the dispute between macedonia and greece over the country 's name .

eu worries about turkish military brussels is also unhappy about the fact that " the armed forces continue to exercise significant political influence , " in turkey and that " no progress " had been seen in the area of protection of minorities and ensuring cultural diversity in line with eu principles .
the draft takes an even-handed approach on the kurdish issue saying that turkey made " no progress in the area of cultural rights . "
however it notes that the pkk separatist group is on the eu 's terrorist list and talks of a " further deterioration of the situation in terms of attacks by the pkk and other terrorist groups . "
public opinion across the eu is hardening against turkey 's eu membership bid and president nicolas sarkozy of france leads a group of countries opposed to full eu membership for turkey , preferring a looser association with ankara instead .
macedonia not on track either the report , which covers the whole enlargement process , also said eu accession talks with macedonia are unlikely to begin before 2009 at the earliest , dashing skopje 's hopes of them starting next year , due to political problems in the former yugoslav republic , an eu source said on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enlargement commissioner rehn with ex-macedonian prime minister buckovski " they lost a lot of time this year when -lrb- the main ethnic albanian party -rrb- was out of parliament .
they still need to work better on political dialogue to have a climate conducive for reforms , " the source told reuters , speaking on condition of anonymity .
macedonia was officially made a candidate for membership in 2005 , four years after an accord brokered by the eu and nato ended a stand-off between the majority macedonian and minority albanian communities which threatened to plunge the country into civil war .
the eu insisted that entry talks could only begin when it was satisfied with macedonia 's progress on the rule of law , the rights of the albanian minority and the fight against organized crime and corruption .
the commission report is expected to cite the absence of dialogue with the albanian community , the politicization of the civil service and the blockage of key judicial reforms as its reasons for halting the talks .
eu cites corruption , slow progress on law reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia has made progress but more is needed a report in macedonia 's leading newspaper , dnevnik , quoted the draft european commission report as saying that " several laws are still blocked , especially judicial reform " and that " corruption is widespread and a serious problem " .
the continued quarreling between the government and the opposition party representing the country 's large ethnic albanian minority , the mass sackings of civil servants after the change of government in 2006 and the divisions between macedonia 's president and prime minister are also cited by the draft report as being problematic , the paper wrote .
there was also a reference to the dispute between macedonia and greece over the country 's name .
according to dnevnik , the eu report urged to renew the two countries to resolve their differences which arise from greece 's opposition over the use of the name " macedonia " , which is also the name of greece 's northern province .
athens considers its use a sign of territorial ambition .
the neighbors have been involved in un-led talks for a compromise since 1993 , with little progress .
croatia 's eu future in its own hands accession negotiations with croatia have reached full cruising speed , with talks under way on 14 of the 35 chapters but the commission draft warns zagreb that the progress of its membership bid is entirely in its own hands .
the reports states that croatia needs to move faster on reforming its judiciary and fighting corruption while the continuing problem of state aid to industry remains an issue .
however , the report says that democracy and the rule of law have been strengthened and macroeconomic stability maintained .
croatia started eu accession talks in 2005 along with turkey but has forged ahead and is the only candidate likely to make it to the 27-nation bloc in the next five years , according to eu sources . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

work on a new exhibition space at former gestapo headquarters began on friday . a 200-meter -lrb- 656-foot -rrb- strip of the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse marks part of the boundary between the famous kreuzberg district and a neighborhood that was once in the eastern part of the german capital .
it is one of the few remaining vestiges of the one-time symbol of a divided europe .
but besides being the very focal point of the cold war , it was also here that adolf hitler 's secret police masterminded the 12-year reign of terror from 1933 to 1945 that led to the extermination of six million european jews and countless other victims .
this was the location of the headquarters of the much-feared gestapo . since 1987 , black-and-white photo reproductions documenting the nazi terror have been posted in a temporary outdoor exhibit near the ruins of the former gestapo and reich security offices , which were destroyed during the war by allied bombs . while the exhibit , called the " topography of terror , " draws roughly 400,000 visitors a year , for two decades now efforts have been underway to create a more permanent exhibition , but the project has been plagued by expensive false starts . on friday , nov .
2 , a ground-breaking ceremony took place attended by berlin mayor klaus wowereit and german culture minister bernd neumann for a new " remembrance and documentation center " in the german capital for victims of wartime gestapo terror . " it 's true .
we are going to build the remembrance and documentation center - finally , perhaps , some people will say , " wowereit said . focus on nazi perpetrators , not victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other exhibits devoted to nazi era focus on victims of holocaust although berlin is already home to exhibitions that look at the nazi genocide , such as daniel libeskind 's jewish museum and peter eisenman 's holocaust memorial , the focus of the topography of terror foundation is different , said executive director andreas nachema .
" this is not a memorial and the focus is not on jews and other victims , such as gypsies or communists .
we focus on the nazi perpetrators , the secret police and the ordinary germans who supported them , " he said .
" visitors can come to this historical site in berlin , which was once the artery of the third reich , and they should walk away with a feel for the dimension of what happened , " added nachema , who pointed out that the architectural design of the building should not get in the way of , but serve the exhibits .
in 1993 , swiss architect peter zumthor was commissioned to design a permanent home for the " topography of terror " exhibition on the vacant lot between the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse and wilhelmstrasse in the heart of the city . but serious technical flaws in the design became apparent and the design itself came under fire for , for example , letting in too much natural sunlight that would make it difficult to read the text accompanying the exhibits . " zumthor 's design concept was impossible to build , " said stefanie endlich , the foundation 's publicist and a member of the board . in addition , there were concerns that a building and exhibit focusing on the nazi perpetrators could lead to the site becoming a place of pilgrimage for neo-nazis , long a quandary that urban planners in germany have faced .
technical and budgetary problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 200-meter stretch of the berlin wall will remain at the site by 1999 the project , for which the city had earmarked 37 million deutschmarks -lrb- € 19 million or $ 27.5 million -rrb- , had all but collapsed .
although about two-thirds of the budget had been spent , only the foundation and a few supports had been built .
several construction companies working on the project went bankrupt .
new estimates found that another 28 million euros would be needed to complete the building and berlin , already facing a huge budget deficit , decided in 2000 to scrap the project .
the structures on the site were razed in 2004 .
the next year , the city held a competition for another concept and in january 2006 , a more modest design by local architect ursula wilms was chosen .
there has been no shortage of critics of how berlin 's urban planners handled the project .
at the center of the controversy was hans stimmann , berlin 's building director from 1991 until 2006 .
he was a powerful advocate of the zumthor design , even though it became clear early on that it was technically flawed , said nachema .
" stimmann was fixated on the idea that the city of berlin had to have a building designed by zumthor and no one dared challenge him , " he said .
new building to open in 2009 reunification in 1990 and the german parliament 's decision to move the capital from bonn to berlin the following year became the impetus for redesigning the city on a grand scale .
big-name architects , such as sir norman foster , renzo piano and helmut jahn flocked to berlin to reinvent prominent buildings such as the reichstag and thoroughfares such as potsdamer platz .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 02.11.2007 germany reports pkk funding as tensions rise on iraq border großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tensions have been rising on the turkish-iraqi border while the tensions between turkey and kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- rebels continue , reports in germany suggest that kurds living in the country are forced to hand over millions of euros to the group . experts believe that while some of germany 's 600,000 kurdish immigrants give the money willingly to fund its separatist campaign in southeastern turkey , others are pressured into contributing under duress .
the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
a spokesman for germany 's bfv domestic intelligence services , commenting on the reports , said that the kongra-gel , the pkk 's political wing , is blackmailing kurdish immigrants with mafia-like demands for protection money of one month 's salary a year or much more in the case of wealthy businessmen .
" in this way they collect millions of euros in germany every year , " the spokesperson stated .
the reports came to light in the wake of violent clashes between kurds and turkish nationalists in berlin , heilbronn and mülheim at last weekend .
in berlin , 18 policemen were injured trying to break up fighting between the two sides , after turkish nationalists held a march in support of ankara 's threat to launch strikes on pkk bases in northern iraq .
the german intelligence services have since stepped up their surveillance of pkk activists in germany .
they estimate that there are 11,500 pkk members in germany , of whom 1,000 live in berlin .
germany banned the pkk in 1993 after it carried out a campaign of fire-bombings on turkish and german institutions in berlin .
pkk activity in germany intensifies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german kurds are pressured to contribute to the pkk cause experts have been monitoring an intensification of pkk activities in germany , which is home to 2.5 million turks - the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
pkk activity slowed down in 2003 but has gradually been picking up in the four years since , according to reports .
according to german police sources , the pkk is also involved in drug trafficking in germany and uses the spoils to fund its separatist struggle .
police have confirmed that several investigations have revealed a link between the pkk and drug dealers .
turkish intelligence services believe that the pkk raises 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- a year and last year spent 15 million euros on arms , notably in iraq .
in april , police confiscated 16,000 euros in banknotes in a raid on 32 suspected members of the pkk in bavaria in southern germany .
in recent years , a number of pkk members have been arrested in germany for securing financing for the group , which has been branded a terrorist organization by turkey , the united states and the european union .
last year german police arrested a turk of kurdish origin suspected of being the leader of the pkk and kongra-gel in germany and heading its fundraising and propaganda activities here .
turkey slams germany for playing down pkk however , the turkish community in germany has recently accused the country 's media of playing down the threat posed by the pkk .
germany 's largest turkish-language newspaper , hürriyet wrote last week that " the german media have a blind spot when it comes to the pkk , referring to repeated descriptions of the organization as " kurdish rebels , " " pkk members " , " separatists " and " radical kurds . "
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also criticized european countries recently for failing to arrest and extradite wanted kurdish militants to turkey .
istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said at a symposium in istanbul last weekend .
" the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad , " he said .
rice in turkey as fears of cross-border strikes mount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice wants to avoid a turkish incursion into iraq meanwhile , turkey refused to rule out cross-border attacks on pkk positions in iraq but tried to ally fears by saying such an attack would target guerrilla bases and not amount to an " invasion . "
us secretary of state condoleezza rice arrived in ankara on friday to urge turkey not to destabilize northern iraq by launching any cross-border military strike .
rice is to meet turkish president abdullah gul , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minister ali babacan on friday afternoon .
" anything that would destabilize the north of iraq is not going to be in turkey 's interest , " rice said before arriving for the talks .
" it is not going to be in our interest .
it is not going to be in iraq 's interest .
so that has been the reason for urging restraint .
" the first point that we have to underscore is that turkey , the united states and iraq have a common enemy in the pkk , " she added .
" we want to develop a very effective strategy for dealing with this threat but we are not going to be able to do this without coordination of the three nations . "
bush , erdogan to discuss pkk strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush sees the pkk as a common enemy both baghdad and washington strongly oppose any unilateral turkish action in northern iraq on the grounds that it would destabilize the only relatively calm region of the war-torn country .
us president george w. bush will meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in washington next week to discuss cooperation against the iraq-based kurdish fighters .
" i look forward to visiting with prime minister erdogan on this important subject as to how we can work together to prevent people from coming out of mountain ranges to do harm to turkish troops , " bush told reporters on thursday .
" we will have a good , substantive discussion , as you would expect allies to do .
and i 'm looking forward to seeing him here in the oval office . "
the pkk uses bases in the mountainous region for cross-border attacks as part of its 23-year campaign for self-rule in turkey 's mainly kurdish southeast .
turkey has reportedly massed up to 100,000 troops on the border with iraq and has threatened a military incursion to strike at the pkk bases unless baghdad and washington make good on promises to crack down on the rebels .
turkish troops have been engaged in major operations targeting the pkk since october 21 when a group of rebels , who ankara says infiltrated from northern iraq , ambushed a military unit , killing 12 soldiers and capturing eight .
the army says it has since killed 80 rebels on turkish territory .
pkk calls for peace plan as ankara announces sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments and sanctions put pressure on the pkk a top pkk commander on thursday called on ankara to present a peace plan that could end the group 's rebellion , which has claimed more than 37,000 lives since it began in 1984 .
ankara categorically refuses to have any contact with or make any concessions to the pkk .
turkey increased the pressure on northern iraq thursday by imposing economic sanctions that specifically target the pkk and its supporters .
foreign minister ali babacan said that a list of measures had been drawn up and that some had already been put in place but said turkey would not be announcing what these measures were .
the foreign minister said the sanctions were not aimed at the people of iraq but were specifically targeted at the pkk and those who support them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
a spokesman for germany 's bfv domestic intelligence services , commenting on the reports , said that the kongra-gel , the pkk 's political wing , is blackmailing kurdish immigrants with mafia-like demands for protection money of one month 's salary a year or much more in the case of wealthy businessmen .
" in this way they collect millions of euros in germany every year , " the spokesperson stated .
the reports came to light in the wake of violent clashes between kurds and turkish nationalists in berlin , heilbronn and mülheim at last weekend .
in berlin , 18 policemen were injured trying to break up fighting between the two sides , after turkish nationalists held a march in support of ankara 's threat to launch strikes on pkk bases in northern iraq .
the german intelligence services have since stepped up their surveillance of pkk activists in germany .
they estimate that there are 11,500 pkk members in germany , of whom 1,000 live in berlin .
germany banned the pkk in 1993 after it carried out a campaign of fire-bombings on turkish and german institutions in berlin .
pkk activity in germany intensifies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german kurds are pressured to contribute to the pkk cause experts have been monitoring an intensification of pkk activities in germany , which is home to 2.5 million turks - the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
pkk activity slowed down in 2003 but has gradually been picking up in the four years since , according to reports .
according to german police sources , the pkk is also involved in drug trafficking in germany and uses the spoils to fund its separatist struggle .
police have confirmed that several investigations have revealed a link between the pkk and drug dealers .
turkish intelligence services believe that the pkk raises 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- a year and last year spent 15 million euros on arms , notably in iraq .
in april , police confiscated 16,000 euros in banknotes in a raid on 32 suspected members of the pkk in bavaria in southern germany .
in recent years , a number of pkk members have been arrested in germany for securing financing for the group , which has been branded a terrorist organization by turkey , the united states and the european union .
last year german police arrested a turk of kurdish origin suspected of being the leader of the pkk and kongra-gel in germany and heading its fundraising and propaganda activities here .
turkey slams germany for playing down pkk however , the turkish community in germany has recently accused the country 's media of playing down the threat posed by the pkk .
germany 's largest turkish-language newspaper , hürriyet wrote last week that " the german media have a blind spot when it comes to the pkk , referring to repeated descriptions of the organization as " kurdish rebels , " " pkk members " , " separatists " and " radical kurds . "
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also criticized european countries recently for failing to arrest and extradite wanted kurdish militants to turkey .

in recent years , a number of pkk members have been arrested in germany for securing financing for the group , which has been branded a terrorist organization by turkey , the united states and the european union .
last year german police arrested a turk of kurdish origin suspected of being the leader of the pkk and kongra-gel in germany and heading its fundraising and propaganda activities here .
turkey slams germany for playing down pkk however , the turkish community in germany has recently accused the country 's media of playing down the threat posed by the pkk .
germany 's largest turkish-language newspaper , hürriyet wrote last week that " the german media have a blind spot when it comes to the pkk , referring to repeated descriptions of the organization as " kurdish rebels , " " pkk members " , " separatists " and " radical kurds . "
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also criticized european countries recently for failing to arrest and extradite wanted kurdish militants to turkey .
istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said at a symposium in istanbul last weekend .
" the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad , " he said .
rice in turkey as fears of cross-border strikes mount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice wants to avoid a turkish incursion into iraq meanwhile , turkey refused to rule out cross-border attacks on pkk positions in iraq but tried to ally fears by saying such an attack would target guerrilla bases and not amount to an " invasion . "
us secretary of state condoleezza rice arrived in ankara on friday to urge turkey not to destabilize northern iraq by launching any cross-border military strike .
rice is to meet turkish president abdullah gul , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minister ali babacan on friday afternoon .
" anything that would destabilize the north of iraq is not going to be in turkey 's interest , " rice said before arriving for the talks .
" it is not going to be in our interest .
it is not going to be in iraq 's interest .
so that has been the reason for urging restraint .
" the first point that we have to underscore is that turkey , the united states and iraq have a common enemy in the pkk , " she added .
" we want to develop a very effective strategy for dealing with this threat but we are not going to be able to do this without coordination of the three nations . "
bush , erdogan to discuss pkk strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush sees the pkk as a common enemy both baghdad and washington strongly oppose any unilateral turkish action in northern iraq on the grounds that it would destabilize the only relatively calm region of the war-torn country .
us president george w. bush will meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in washington next week to discuss cooperation against the iraq-based kurdish fighters .
" i look forward to visiting with prime minister erdogan on this important subject as to how we can work together to prevent people from coming out of mountain ranges to do harm to turkish troops , " bush told reporters on thursday .
" we will have a good , substantive discussion , as you would expect allies to do .
and i 'm looking forward to seeing him here in the oval office . "
the pkk uses bases in the mountainous region for cross-border attacks as part of its 23-year campaign for self-rule in turkey 's mainly kurdish southeast .
turkey has reportedly massed up to 100,000 troops on the border with iraq and has threatened a military incursion to strike at the pkk bases unless baghdad and washington make good on promises to crack down on the rebels .
turkish troops have been engaged in major operations targeting the pkk since october 21 when a group of rebels , who ankara says infiltrated from northern iraq , ambushed a military unit , killing 12 soldiers and capturing eight .
the army says it has since killed 80 rebels on turkish territory .

ankara categorically refuses to have any contact with or make any concessions to the pkk .
turkey increased the pressure on northern iraq thursday by imposing economic sanctions that specifically target the pkk and its supporters .
foreign minister ali babacan said that a list of measures had been drawn up and that some had already been put in place but said turkey would not be announcing what these measures were .

the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
a spokesman for germany 's bfv domestic intelligence services , commenting on the reports , said that the kongra-gel , the pkk 's political wing , is blackmailing kurdish immigrants with mafia-like demands for protection money of one month 's salary a year or much more in the case of wealthy businessmen .
" in this way they collect millions of euros in germany every year , " the spokesperson stated .
the reports came to light in the wake of violent clashes between kurds and turkish nationalists in berlin , heilbronn and mülheim at last weekend .
in berlin , 18 policemen were injured trying to break up fighting between the two sides , after turkish nationalists held a march in support of ankara 's threat to launch strikes on pkk bases in northern iraq .
the german intelligence services have since stepped up their surveillance of pkk activists in germany .
they estimate that there are 11,500 pkk members in germany , of whom 1,000 live in berlin .
germany banned the pkk in 1993 after it carried out a campaign of fire-bombings on turkish and german institutions in berlin .

pkk activity slowed down in 2003 but has gradually been picking up in the four years since , according to reports .
according to german police sources , the pkk is also involved in drug trafficking in germany and uses the spoils to fund its separatist struggle .
police have confirmed that several investigations have revealed a link between the pkk and drug dealers .

work on a new exhibition space at former gestapo headquarters began on friday . a 200-meter -lrb- 656-foot -rrb- strip of the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse marks part of the boundary between the famous kreuzberg district and a neighborhood that was once in the eastern part of the german capital .
it is one of the few remaining vestiges of the one-time symbol of a divided europe .
but besides being the very focal point of the cold war , it was also here that adolf hitler 's secret police masterminded the 12-year reign of terror from 1933 to 1945 that led to the extermination of six million european jews and countless other victims .

work on a new exhibition space at former gestapo headquarters began on friday . a 200-meter -lrb- 656-foot -rrb- strip of the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse marks part of the boundary between the famous kreuzberg district and a neighborhood that was once in the eastern part of the german capital .
it is one of the few remaining vestiges of the one-time symbol of a divided europe .
but besides being the very focal point of the cold war , it was also here that adolf hitler 's secret police masterminded the 12-year reign of terror from 1933 to 1945 that led to the extermination of six million european jews and countless other victims .
this was the location of the headquarters of the much-feared gestapo . since 1987 , black-and-white photo reproductions documenting the nazi terror have been posted in a temporary outdoor exhibit near the ruins of the former gestapo and reich security offices , which were destroyed during the war by allied bombs . while the exhibit , called the " topography of terror , " draws roughly 400,000 visitors a year , for two decades now efforts have been underway to create a more permanent exhibition , but the project has been plagued by expensive false starts . on friday , nov .
2 , a ground-breaking ceremony took place attended by berlin mayor klaus wowereit and german culture minister bernd neumann for a new " remembrance and documentation center " in the german capital for victims of wartime gestapo terror . " it 's true .
we are going to build the remembrance and documentation center - finally , perhaps , some people will say , " wowereit said . focus on nazi perpetrators , not victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other exhibits devoted to nazi era focus on victims of holocaust although berlin is already home to exhibitions that look at the nazi genocide , such as daniel libeskind 's jewish museum and peter eisenman 's holocaust memorial , the focus of the topography of terror foundation is different , said executive director andreas nachema .
" this is not a memorial and the focus is not on jews and other victims , such as gypsies or communists .
we focus on the nazi perpetrators , the secret police and the ordinary germans who supported them , " he said .
" visitors can come to this historical site in berlin , which was once the artery of the third reich , and they should walk away with a feel for the dimension of what happened , " added nachema , who pointed out that the architectural design of the building should not get in the way of , but serve the exhibits .
in 1993 , swiss architect peter zumthor was commissioned to design a permanent home for the " topography of terror " exhibition on the vacant lot between the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse and wilhelmstrasse in the heart of the city . but serious technical flaws in the design became apparent and the design itself came under fire for , for example , letting in too much natural sunlight that would make it difficult to read the text accompanying the exhibits . " zumthor 's design concept was impossible to build , " said stefanie endlich , the foundation 's publicist and a member of the board . in addition , there were concerns that a building and exhibit focusing on the nazi perpetrators could lead to the site becoming a place of pilgrimage for neo-nazis , long a quandary that urban planners in germany have faced .
technical and budgetary problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 200-meter stretch of the berlin wall will remain at the site by 1999 the project , for which the city had earmarked 37 million deutschmarks -lrb- € 19 million or $ 27.5 million -rrb- , had all but collapsed .
although about two-thirds of the budget had been spent , only the foundation and a few supports had been built .
several construction companies working on the project went bankrupt .
new estimates found that another 28 million euros would be needed to complete the building and berlin , already facing a huge budget deficit , decided in 2000 to scrap the project .
the structures on the site were razed in 2004 .
the next year , the city held a competition for another concept and in january 2006 , a more modest design by local architect ursula wilms was chosen .
there has been no shortage of critics of how berlin 's urban planners handled the project .
at the center of the controversy was hans stimmann , berlin 's building director from 1991 until 2006 .
he was a powerful advocate of the zumthor design , even though it became clear early on that it was technically flawed , said nachema .
" stimmann was fixated on the idea that the city of berlin had to have a building designed by zumthor and no one dared challenge him , " he said .
new building to open in 2009 reunification in 1990 and the german parliament 's decision to move the capital from bonn to berlin the following year became the impetus for redesigning the city on a grand scale .
big-name architects , such as sir norman foster , renzo piano and helmut jahn flocked to berlin to reinvent prominent buildings such as the reichstag and thoroughfares such as potsdamer platz .
it had been leveled during world war ii and remained a barren no man 's land during the cold war . bildunterschrift : berlin architect ursula wilms won new competition for a less costly design today potsdamer platz is a gleaming group of high-rises and modern architecture , while the " topography of terror " is still basically a collection of posters amid the ruins of a cellar . wilms design for the topography of terror , a simple rectangular structure sheathed inside a metallic mesh , is now budgeted at 19 million euros . the section of the berlin wall now there will remain as part of the site 's landscape and a small section of the documentation center , which looks out onto niederkirchnerstrasse , will be devoted to the individuals who , according to andreas nachema , " tried to scale the wall of inhumanity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eu expansion -pipe- 02.11.2007 turkey , balkan states lagging on reforms , eu report says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu project continues but those wanting to join must fulfil its strict criteria a key annual progress report by the european commission says reforms are slowing down both in turkey and the western balkans , indicating that eu membership is still a distant dream for the countries . amid preparations for a new committee on the future of the eu which may try to determine where europe 's frontiers should lie and how much further the bloc should expand , the eu commission 's annual progress report is set to chide ankara for its lack of progress on reforms .
almost one year after the eu partially froze turkey 's membership talks , the report - due to be released next week - urges turkey " to renew the momentum of political reforms " and states that " significant further efforts are needed in particular on freedom of expression , on civilian control of the military , and on the rights of non-muslim communities . "
turkey chastized on freedom of speech the eu suspended eight chapters of turkey 's 35-chapter eu negotiations package last year , citing ankara 's continuing blockade on traffic from eu member state cyprus - which is illegal under an eu-turkey customs agreement – as its main reason .
turkey has made " no progress on normalizing bilateral relations " with nicosia since then , the draft report states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu accession bid is one of the most controversial the eu is also concerned about the continued restrictions in freedom of speech and concludes that " the turkish legal system does not fully guarantee freedom of expression in line with european standards " .
the number of prosecutions of journalists , intellectuals and human rights activists for expressing non-violent opinions is on the rise .
the number of people prosecuted almost doubled in 2006 from 2005 and there were further increases in 2007 .
more than half of these cases were brought under the turkish penal code and many of those under article 301 which makes it an offense to insult " turkishness . "
together with the murder of a journalist , hrant dink , this has helped create a climate of self-censorship the draft document says .
eu worries about turkish military brussels is also unhappy about the fact that " the armed forces continue to exercise significant political influence , " in turkey and that " no progress " had been seen in the area of protection of minorities and ensuring cultural diversity in line with eu principles .
the draft takes an even-handed approach on the kurdish issue saying that turkey made " no progress in the area of cultural rights . "
however it notes that the pkk separatist group is on the eu 's terrorist list and talks of a " further deterioration of the situation in terms of attacks by the pkk and other terrorist groups . "
public opinion across the eu is hardening against turkey 's eu membership bid and president nicolas sarkozy of france leads a group of countries opposed to full eu membership for turkey , preferring a looser association with ankara instead .
macedonia not on track either the report , which covers the whole enlargement process , also said eu accession talks with macedonia are unlikely to begin before 2009 at the earliest , dashing skopje 's hopes of them starting next year , due to political problems in the former yugoslav republic , an eu source said on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enlargement commissioner rehn with ex-macedonian prime minister buckovski " they lost a lot of time this year when -lrb- the main ethnic albanian party -rrb- was out of parliament .
they still need to work better on political dialogue to have a climate conducive for reforms , " the source told reuters , speaking on condition of anonymity .
macedonia was officially made a candidate for membership in 2005 , four years after an accord brokered by the eu and nato ended a stand-off between the majority macedonian and minority albanian communities which threatened to plunge the country into civil war .
the eu insisted that entry talks could only begin when it was satisfied with macedonia 's progress on the rule of law , the rights of the albanian minority and the fight against organized crime and corruption .
the commission report is expected to cite the absence of dialogue with the albanian community , the politicization of the civil service and the blockage of key judicial reforms as its reasons for halting the talks .
eu cites corruption , slow progress on law reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia has made progress but more is needed a report in macedonia 's leading newspaper , dnevnik , quoted the draft european commission report as saying that " several laws are still blocked , especially judicial reform " and that " corruption is widespread and a serious problem " .
the continued quarreling between the government and the opposition party representing the country 's large ethnic albanian minority , the mass sackings of civil servants after the change of government in 2006 and the divisions between macedonia 's president and prime minister are also cited by the draft report as being problematic , the paper wrote .
there was also a reference to the dispute between macedonia and greece over the country 's name .
according to dnevnik , the eu report urged to renew the two countries to resolve their differences which arise from greece 's opposition over the use of the name " macedonia " , which is also the name of greece 's northern province .
athens considers its use a sign of territorial ambition .
the neighbors have been involved in un-led talks for a compromise since 1993 , with little progress .
croatia 's eu future in its own hands accession negotiations with croatia have reached full cruising speed , with talks under way on 14 of the 35 chapters but the commission draft warns zagreb that the progress of its membership bid is entirely in its own hands .
the reports states that croatia needs to move faster on reforming its judiciary and fighting corruption while the continuing problem of state aid to industry remains an issue .
however , the report says that democracy and the rule of law have been strengthened and macroeconomic stability maintained .
croatia started eu accession talks in 2005 along with turkey but has forged ahead and is the only candidate likely to make it to the 27-nation bloc in the next five years , according to eu sources . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de third reich -pipe- 02.11.2007 nazi secret police museum finally gets off the ground in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the open-air exhibit will remain until the museum to house it is built building a permanent home for the popular open-air nazi secret police exhibit has taken 20 years due to design and budget problems .
work on a new exhibition space at former gestapo headquarters began on friday . a 200-meter -lrb- 656-foot -rrb- strip of the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse marks part of the boundary between the famous kreuzberg district and a neighborhood that was once in the eastern part of the german capital .
it is one of the few remaining vestiges of the one-time symbol of a divided europe .
but besides being the very focal point of the cold war , it was also here that adolf hitler 's secret police masterminded the 12-year reign of terror from 1933 to 1945 that led to the extermination of six million european jews and countless other victims .
this was the location of the headquarters of the much-feared gestapo . since 1987 , black-and-white photo reproductions documenting the nazi terror have been posted in a temporary outdoor exhibit near the ruins of the former gestapo and reich security offices , which were destroyed during the war by allied bombs . while the exhibit , called the " topography of terror , " draws roughly 400,000 visitors a year , for two decades now efforts have been underway to create a more permanent exhibition , but the project has been plagued by expensive false starts . on friday , nov .
2 , a ground-breaking ceremony took place attended by berlin mayor klaus wowereit and german culture minister bernd neumann for a new " remembrance and documentation center " in the german capital for victims of wartime gestapo terror . " it 's true .
we are going to build the remembrance and documentation center - finally , perhaps , some people will say , " wowereit said . focus on nazi perpetrators , not victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other exhibits devoted to nazi era focus on victims of holocaust although berlin is already home to exhibitions that look at the nazi genocide , such as daniel libeskind 's jewish museum and peter eisenman 's holocaust memorial , the focus of the topography of terror foundation is different , said executive director andreas nachema .
" this is not a memorial and the focus is not on jews and other victims , such as gypsies or communists .
we focus on the nazi perpetrators , the secret police and the ordinary germans who supported them , " he said .
" visitors can come to this historical site in berlin , which was once the artery of the third reich , and they should walk away with a feel for the dimension of what happened , " added nachema , who pointed out that the architectural design of the building should not get in the way of , but serve the exhibits .
in 1993 , swiss architect peter zumthor was commissioned to design a permanent home for the " topography of terror " exhibition on the vacant lot between the berlin wall at niederkirchnerstrasse and wilhelmstrasse in the heart of the city . but serious technical flaws in the design became apparent and the design itself came under fire for , for example , letting in too much natural sunlight that would make it difficult to read the text accompanying the exhibits . " zumthor 's design concept was impossible to build , " said stefanie endlich , the foundation 's publicist and a member of the board . in addition , there were concerns that a building and exhibit focusing on the nazi perpetrators could lead to the site becoming a place of pilgrimage for neo-nazis , long a quandary that urban planners in germany have faced .
technical and budgetary problems bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 200-meter stretch of the berlin wall will remain at the site by 1999 the project , for which the city had earmarked 37 million deutschmarks -lrb- € 19 million or $ 27.5 million -rrb- , had all but collapsed .
although about two-thirds of the budget had been spent , only the foundation and a few supports had been built .
several construction companies working on the project went bankrupt .
new estimates found that another 28 million euros would be needed to complete the building and berlin , already facing a huge budget deficit , decided in 2000 to scrap the project .
the structures on the site were razed in 2004 .
the next year , the city held a competition for another concept and in january 2006 , a more modest design by local architect ursula wilms was chosen .
there has been no shortage of critics of how berlin 's urban planners handled the project .
at the center of the controversy was hans stimmann , berlin 's building director from 1991 until 2006 .
he was a powerful advocate of the zumthor design , even though it became clear early on that it was technically flawed , said nachema .
" stimmann was fixated on the idea that the city of berlin had to have a building designed by zumthor and no one dared challenge him , " he said .
new building to open in 2009 reunification in 1990 and the german parliament 's decision to move the capital from bonn to berlin the following year became the impetus for redesigning the city on a grand scale .
big-name architects , such as sir norman foster , renzo piano and helmut jahn flocked to berlin to reinvent prominent buildings such as the reichstag and thoroughfares such as potsdamer platz .
it had been leveled during world war ii and remained a barren no man 's land during the cold war . bildunterschrift : berlin architect ursula wilms won new competition for a less costly design today potsdamer platz is a gleaming group of high-rises and modern architecture , while the " topography of terror " is still basically a collection of posters amid the ruins of a cellar . wilms design for the topography of terror , a simple rectangular structure sheathed inside a metallic mesh , is now budgeted at 19 million euros . the section of the berlin wall now there will remain as part of the site 's landscape and a small section of the documentation center , which looks out onto niederkirchnerstrasse , will be devoted to the individuals who , according to andreas nachema , " tried to scale the wall of inhumanity .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . as a frequent visitor from india to germany , i feel that german impressions of india are very dated .
india is changing rapidly nowadays and a decade makes a lot of difference .
india is already an economic and technological power in many areas .
yes , it has many poor people but that is bound to happen with a population of 1.1 billion .
i doubt india will achieve the living standards of germany for many decades .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 02.11.2007 germany reports pkk funding as tensions rise on iraq border großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tensions have been rising on the turkish-iraqi border while the tensions between turkey and kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- rebels continue , reports in germany suggest that kurds living in the country are forced to hand over millions of euros to the group . experts believe that while some of germany 's 600,000 kurdish immigrants give the money willingly to fund its separatist campaign in southeastern turkey , others are pressured into contributing under duress .
the pkk is an outlawed nationalist kurdish guerrilla group waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeast turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms against turkey in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the southeast .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
a spokesman for germany 's bfv domestic intelligence services , commenting on the reports , said that the kongra-gel , the pkk 's political wing , is blackmailing kurdish immigrants with mafia-like demands for protection money of one month 's salary a year or much more in the case of wealthy businessmen .
" in this way they collect millions of euros in germany every year , " the spokesperson stated .
the reports came to light in the wake of violent clashes between kurds and turkish nationalists in berlin , heilbronn and mülheim at last weekend .
in berlin , 18 policemen were injured trying to break up fighting between the two sides , after turkish nationalists held a march in support of ankara 's threat to launch strikes on pkk bases in northern iraq .
the german intelligence services have since stepped up their surveillance of pkk activists in germany .
they estimate that there are 11,500 pkk members in germany , of whom 1,000 live in berlin .
germany banned the pkk in 1993 after it carried out a campaign of fire-bombings on turkish and german institutions in berlin .
pkk activity in germany intensifies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german kurds are pressured to contribute to the pkk cause experts have been monitoring an intensification of pkk activities in germany , which is home to 2.5 million turks - the biggest turkish community outside turkey .
pkk activity slowed down in 2003 but has gradually been picking up in the four years since , according to reports .
according to german police sources , the pkk is also involved in drug trafficking in germany and uses the spoils to fund its separatist struggle .
police have confirmed that several investigations have revealed a link between the pkk and drug dealers .
turkish intelligence services believe that the pkk raises 300 million euros -lrb- $ 430 million -rrb- a year and last year spent 15 million euros on arms , notably in iraq .
in april , police confiscated 16,000 euros in banknotes in a raid on 32 suspected members of the pkk in bavaria in southern germany .
in recent years , a number of pkk members have been arrested in germany for securing financing for the group , which has been branded a terrorist organization by turkey , the united states and the european union .
last year german police arrested a turk of kurdish origin suspected of being the leader of the pkk and kongra-gel in germany and heading its fundraising and propaganda activities here .
turkey slams germany for playing down pkk however , the turkish community in germany has recently accused the country 's media of playing down the threat posed by the pkk .
germany 's largest turkish-language newspaper , hürriyet wrote last week that " the german media have a blind spot when it comes to the pkk , referring to repeated descriptions of the organization as " kurdish rebels , " " pkk members " , " separatists " and " radical kurds . "
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also criticized european countries recently for failing to arrest and extradite wanted kurdish militants to turkey .
istanbul has regularly asked countries to do more against the pkk which is considered a terrorist organization both by the european union and the us .
" unfortunately no eu country has extradited members of the pkk to turkey , despite labeling it as a terrorist organization , " erdogan said at a symposium in istanbul last weekend .
" the fact there has been no improvement shows clearly how sincere our western friends are on this issue .
erdogan criticized what he called an approach of " your terrorist is good , my terrorist is bad , " he said .
rice in turkey as fears of cross-border strikes mount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice wants to avoid a turkish incursion into iraq meanwhile , turkey refused to rule out cross-border attacks on pkk positions in iraq but tried to ally fears by saying such an attack would target guerrilla bases and not amount to an " invasion . "
us secretary of state condoleezza rice arrived in ankara on friday to urge turkey not to destabilize northern iraq by launching any cross-border military strike .
rice is to meet turkish president abdullah gul , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan and foreign minister ali babacan on friday afternoon .
" anything that would destabilize the north of iraq is not going to be in turkey 's interest , " rice said before arriving for the talks .
" it is not going to be in our interest .
it is not going to be in iraq 's interest .
so that has been the reason for urging restraint .
" the first point that we have to underscore is that turkey , the united states and iraq have a common enemy in the pkk , " she added .
" we want to develop a very effective strategy for dealing with this threat but we are not going to be able to do this without coordination of the three nations . "
bush , erdogan to discuss pkk strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush sees the pkk as a common enemy both baghdad and washington strongly oppose any unilateral turkish action in northern iraq on the grounds that it would destabilize the only relatively calm region of the war-torn country .
us president george w. bush will meet with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in washington next week to discuss cooperation against the iraq-based kurdish fighters .
" i look forward to visiting with prime minister erdogan on this important subject as to how we can work together to prevent people from coming out of mountain ranges to do harm to turkish troops , " bush told reporters on thursday .
" we will have a good , substantive discussion , as you would expect allies to do .
and i 'm looking forward to seeing him here in the oval office . "
the pkk uses bases in the mountainous region for cross-border attacks as part of its 23-year campaign for self-rule in turkey 's mainly kurdish southeast .
turkey has reportedly massed up to 100,000 troops on the border with iraq and has threatened a military incursion to strike at the pkk bases unless baghdad and washington make good on promises to crack down on the rebels .
turkish troops have been engaged in major operations targeting the pkk since october 21 when a group of rebels , who ankara says infiltrated from northern iraq , ambushed a military unit , killing 12 soldiers and capturing eight .
the army says it has since killed 80 rebels on turkish territory .
pkk calls for peace plan as ankara announces sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : troop deployments and sanctions put pressure on the pkk a top pkk commander on thursday called on ankara to present a peace plan that could end the group 's rebellion , which has claimed more than 37,000 lives since it began in 1984 .
ankara categorically refuses to have any contact with or make any concessions to the pkk .
turkey increased the pressure on northern iraq thursday by imposing economic sanctions that specifically target the pkk and its supporters .
foreign minister ali babacan said that a list of measures had been drawn up and that some had already been put in place but said turkey would not be announcing what these measures were .
the foreign minister said the sanctions were not aimed at the people of iraq but were specifically targeted at the pkk and those who support them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is social networking just for the young ?
that 's a question i asked earlier this year after signing up to facebook , myspace and bebo and struggling to find friends of my own vintage .
the answer was a resounding no - within days of voicing my concerns i had hundreds of new friends and was spending far too much time socialising online .
now though , saga , the firm which markets travel and insurance to the over-50s , has decided that there is a gap in the market for older social networkers .
the travel and insurance company believes there is a sizeable audience out there which wants to socialise online but is intimidated by the poking , loud music and startlingly indiscreet pictures which are part and parcel of the likes of facebook and myspace .
the theory is they will be more comfortable in somewhere like sagazone , a site which will refuse you membership if you are under 50 .
so i took a journey into the sagazone to find out whether it really stood a chance of winning an audience .
first , a confession .
to get access , i was forced to make a slight adjustment to my date of birth to make it appear i was fifty - though not by as much as i would have liked .
once onboard , and having posted a profile with a fetching picture of an eccentric man with a woolly hat , i set off to explore .
it is a very restrained and low-tech approach to networking .
facebook seemed pretty plain to anyone who had started with the multi-coloured swapshop world of myspace and bebo , but sagazone is like stepping into the library .
no opportunity to post exciting photos or share favourite music or video clips , not even the online scrabble which occupies far too much of my time on facebook .
it is over at the forums that most of the activity is going on , and here it is pretty lively .
discussions on everything from gardening to relationships , from technology to prostate cancer are attracting plenty of interest .
so i started my own thread , asking why people would choose a network that is defined by age , rather than one anyone can join .
" the people on here are intelligent , well read , and interesting , and they know something about life , " said " jen " .
" at 65 , who could ask for anything more ? "
plenty others had joined other networking sites and found them unsatisfying .
" i 'm far too fat and hard-up to want to talk fashion or designer labels and what 's more , i know what an apostrophe is and where not to put one , " wrote " orkneymermaid " .
one man who 'd been persuaded to join facebook and bebo by younger family members said " i felt like a nosy perverted eavesdropper ¿ ¿ and constantly ducking flying sheep and getting bled by the attacks of vampires gets tedious . "
anyone who has suffered facebook 's more juvenile features will feel sympathy .
back at my inbox i find several users have contacted me , including two ladies who wish to compliment me on my hat .
it 's a friendly enough place but i remain to be convinced that it will win a mass audience .
it lacks the constant drip-feed of news from your friends that has made facebook so compelling .
as the social networking industry enjoys explosive growth , with infant businesses suddenly worth 15 billion dollars , all sorts of new services are being launched .
many , like saga , are betting that the industry will become more segmented , with different services aimed at different groups , from young mothers , to students , to former soldiers .
but i 'm not convinced that i will become a saga surfer , even when i eventually qualify to become a member .

is social networking just for the young ?
that 's a question i asked earlier this year after signing up to facebook , myspace and bebo and struggling to find friends of my own vintage .
the answer was a resounding no - within days of voicing my concerns i had hundreds of new friends and was spending far too much time socialising online .
now though , saga , the firm which markets travel and insurance to the over-50s , has decided that there is a gap in the market for older social networkers .
the travel and insurance company believes there is a sizeable audience out there which wants to socialise online but is intimidated by the poking , loud music and startlingly indiscreet pictures which are part and parcel of the likes of facebook and myspace .
the theory is they will be more comfortable in somewhere like sagazone , a site which will refuse you membership if you are under 50 .
so i took a journey into the sagazone to find out whether it really stood a chance of winning an audience .
first , a confession .
to get access , i was forced to make a slight adjustment to my date of birth to make it appear i was fifty - though not by as much as i would have liked .
once onboard , and having posted a profile with a fetching picture of an eccentric man with a woolly hat , i set off to explore .
many folk have found places like facebook and bebo are not for them it is a very restrained and low-tech approach to networking .
facebook seemed pretty plain to anyone who had started with the multi-coloured swapshop world of myspace and bebo , but sagazone is like stepping into the library .
no opportunity to post exciting photos or share favourite music or video clips , not even the online scrabble which occupies far too much of my time on facebook .
it is over at the forums that most of the activity is going on , and here it is pretty lively .
discussions on everything from gardening to relationships , from technology to prostate cancer are attracting plenty of interest .
so i started my own thread , asking why people would choose a network that is defined by age , rather than one anyone can join .
" the people on here are intelligent , well read , and interesting , and they know something about life , " said " jen " .
" at 65 , who could ask for anything more ? "
plenty others had joined other networking sites and found them unsatisfying .
" i 'm far too fat and hard-up to want to talk fashion or designer labels and what 's more , i know what an apostrophe is and where not to put one , " wrote " orkneymermaid " .
video games are not just for the young one man who 'd been persuaded to join facebook and bebo by younger family members said " i felt like a nosy perverted eavesdropper ¿ ¿ and constantly ducking flying sheep and getting bled by the attacks of vampires gets tedious . "
anyone who has suffered facebook 's more juvenile features will feel sympathy .
back at my inbox i find several users have contacted me , including two ladies who wish to compliment me on my hat .
it 's a friendly enough place but i remain to be convinced that it will win a mass audience .
it lacks the constant drip-feed of news from your friends that has made facebook so compelling .
as the social networking industry enjoys explosive growth , with infant businesses suddenly worth 15 billion dollars , all sorts of new services are being launched .
many , like saga , are betting that the industry will become more segmented , with different services aimed at different groups , from young mothers , to students , to former soldiers .
but i 'm not convinced that i will become a saga surfer , even when i eventually qualify to become a member .

is social networking just for the young ?
that 's a question i asked earlier this year after signing up to facebook , myspace and bebo and struggling to find friends of my own vintage .
the answer was a resounding no - within days of voicing my concerns i had hundreds of new friends and was spending far too much time socialising online .
now though , saga , the firm which markets travel and insurance to the over-50s , has decided that there is a gap in the market for older social networkers .
the travel and insurance company believes there is a sizeable audience out there which wants to socialise online but is intimidated by the poking , loud music and startlingly indiscreet pictures which are part and parcel of the likes of facebook and myspace .
the theory is they will be more comfortable in somewhere like sagazone , a site which will refuse you membership if you are under 50 .
so i took a journey into the sagazone to find out whether it really stood a chance of winning an audience .
first , a confession .
to get access , i was forced to make a slight adjustment to my date of birth to make it appear i was fifty - though not by as much as i would have liked .
once onboard , and having posted a profile with a fetching picture of an eccentric man with a woolly hat , i set off to explore .
many folk have found places like facebook and bebo are not for them it is a very restrained and low-tech approach to networking .
facebook seemed pretty plain to anyone who had started with the multi-coloured swapshop world of myspace and bebo , but sagazone is like stepping into the library .
no opportunity to post exciting photos or share favourite music or video clips , not even the online scrabble which occupies far too much of my time on facebook .
it is over at the forums that most of the activity is going on , and here it is pretty lively .
discussions on everything from gardening to relationships , from technology to prostate cancer are attracting plenty of interest .
so i started my own thread , asking why people would choose a network that is defined by age , rather than one anyone can join .
" the people on here are intelligent , well read , and interesting , and they know something about life , " said " jen " .
" at 65 , who could ask for anything more ? "
plenty others had joined other networking sites and found them unsatisfying .
" i 'm far too fat and hard-up to want to talk fashion or designer labels and what 's more , i know what an apostrophe is and where not to put one , " wrote " orkneymermaid " .
video games are not just for the young one man who 'd been persuaded to join facebook and bebo by younger family members said " i felt like a nosy perverted eavesdropper ¿ ¿ and constantly ducking flying sheep and getting bled by the attacks of vampires gets tedious . "
anyone who has suffered facebook 's more juvenile features will feel sympathy .
back at my inbox i find several users have contacted me , including two ladies who wish to compliment me on my hat .
it 's a friendly enough place but i remain to be convinced that it will win a mass audience .

during the hearings , they heard detailed evidence about room 1600 - the emergency operations control room .
it was here that the hunt for the failed 21 july bombers was co-ordinated .
inside , one officer played the role of " loggist " - recording by hand everything that was going on and every decision that commanders made .

the diary says they had " control " of him , but at this early stage they were not sure whether he was definitely their target - would-be bomber hussain osman .
by the time the brazilian reached brixton tube station , the officers felt his behaviour was giving cause for concern .
the critical issue for scotland yard was how to stop this man .
surveillance officers were armed for their own safety , but were not trained to confront a potential suicide bomber .
in the ops room , commander cressida dick said so19 , the specialist firearms officers , must get to the scene and step in .
but nobody was sure where the firearms officers were .
they should have been outside the flat but were not there in time to stop him jumping on a bus .
the ops room , fearing the target was now heading for stockwell tube , asked the senior firearms commander on the ground to clarify what was going on .
minutes later , at 1000 bst , it was clear that officers were convinced their target was heading for the underground .
if he was one of the bombers , he would have to be stopped .
the log shows commander dick gave a specific order : if the identification is good - stop him .
time was running out .
commander dick again insisted that so19 must stop the target .
but the loggist recorded that they were still not at the station - and the subject was now on the escalators .
suddenly , at 1004 bst , she was forced to change the strategy .
so12 , the lightly-armed surveillance officers , had no choice but to stop the man themselves .
then seconds later , commander dick was informed that so19 officers had arrived and declared state red , meaning they were taking over and preparing to make a " hard stop " .
as the firearms teams rushed to the platform , officers briefed commander dick that everything was " all right " upstairs - but nobody knew what was going on downstairs .
at 1008 bst the call came in : - a man had been shot .
within minutes , cressida dick offered to step back as the designated senior officer with responsibility for operation kratos , the met 's policies to shoot a suicide bomber without warning : " this is an important decision in the light of what has happened , " she wrote later that evening in the formal typed version of her decision log .
" not appropriate for me to make it ... this has major implications potentially for the metropolitan police service and london . "
her superiors backed her and asked her to stay in charge of the operation room .
very soon afterwards , the facts began to emerge .
there was still an " urgent need " for the suspected bombers to be arrested - but the man killed at stockwell did not seem to be the man the suspect .

mills said she promised sir paul she would " walk away with nothing " in a " very gentle and quick divorce " if he took the blame for their split .
in an interview on us show today , she claimed he agreed to take responsibility but " did nothing " .
sir paul 's spokeswoman declined to comment .
the couple , who married in 2002 , are in the middle of divorce negotiations .
they have a four-year-old daughter , beatrice .
" all i can say is when we first split , i said to paul : ' i 'm going to be crucified .
you know why we split .
you know the truth .
they do n't need to know the details , but you need to stand up and say -lsb- you are -rsb- responsible for the breakdown of this marriage , " ' mills told the nbc programme .
the couple 's separation has been very high profile she said sir paul was a " broken man " when she met him and that he was unable to perform on stage .
" i was a huge support for paul .
i put all my own work except my charity on hold for the seven-and-a-half years we were together , " she added .
the interview followed mills ' emotional outburst on uk breakfast programme gmtv earlier this week , in which she accused the tabloid press of " pushing her to the edge " .
she said she had received death threats and been " close to suicide " .
british newspapers were largely unsympathetic , with one tabloid describing her as " self-pitying " .
government minister david lammy told bbc one 's question time he had found it " disturbing " to watch the mills interview .
" i did feel actually quite sorry for her .
i do think she is a woman very much on the edge , " he said .
it was definitely the wrong thing to do phil hall , heather mills ' former spokesman " it was actually quite disturbing to watch and i hope that perhaps she seeks the right support because it 's not nice to see someone who clearly is losing themselves to the media frenzy surrounding them and , in the end , a marriage that is breaking down .
" and she does have a child , so i do feel for her in that sense , " he added .
meanwhile , mills ' press spokesman has resigned following her gmtv interview because he felt her public outburst was " a mistake " .
" it was definitely the wrong thing to do , " said phil hall , who was hired by mills in 2006 after her marriage split .
" i 'm very sad about it .
we 've been through a lot during the last two years and it 's a shame , " he told the reuters news agency .
mr hall said he had advised mills to not respond to bad press coverage .
" my view is that you need good relations with the media to turn the negative into the positive and i advise always to ignore the stuff thrown at you , " said the former editor of tabloid newspaper the news of the world .

mills said she promised sir paul she would " walk away with nothing " in a " very gentle and quick divorce " if he took the blame for their split .
in an interview on us show today , she claimed he agreed to take responsibility but " did nothing " .
sir paul 's spokeswoman declined to comment .
the couple , who married in 2002 , are in the middle of divorce negotiations .
they have a four-year-old daughter , beatrice .
" all i can say is when we first split , i said to paul : ' i 'm going to be crucified .
you know why we split .
you know the truth .
they do n't need to know the details , but you need to stand up and say -lsb- you are -rsb- responsible for the breakdown of this marriage , " ' mills told the nbc programme .
the couple 's separation has been very high profile she said sir paul was a " broken man " when she met him and that he was unable to perform on stage .
" i was a huge support for paul .
i put all my own work except my charity on hold for the seven-and-a-half years we were together , " she added .
the interview followed mills ' emotional outburst on uk breakfast programme gmtv earlier this week , in which she accused the tabloid press of " pushing her to the edge " .
she said she had received death threats and been " close to suicide " .
british newspapers were largely unsympathetic , with one tabloid describing her as " self-pitying " .
government minister david lammy told bbc one 's question time he had found it " disturbing " to watch the mills interview .
" i did feel actually quite sorry for her .
i do think she is a woman very much on the edge , " he said .
it was definitely the wrong thing to do phil hall , heather mills ' former spokesman " it was actually quite disturbing to watch and i hope that perhaps she seeks the right support because it 's not nice to see someone who clearly is losing themselves to the media frenzy surrounding them and , in the end , a marriage that is breaking down .
" and she does have a child , so i do feel for her in that sense , " he added .
meanwhile , mills ' press spokesman has resigned following her gmtv interview because he felt her public outburst was " a mistake " .
" it was definitely the wrong thing to do , " said phil hall , who was hired by mills in 2006 after her marriage split .
" i 'm very sad about it .
we 've been through a lot during the last two years and it 's a shame , " he told the reuters news agency .
mr hall said he had advised mills to not respond to bad press coverage .
" my view is that you need good relations with the media to turn the negative into the positive and i advise always to ignore the stuff thrown at you , " said the former editor of tabloid newspaper the news of the world .

vehicles entering london 's congestion charge zone between 0700 gmt and 1800 gmt on weekdays currently have to pay an £ 8 fee .
this will rise to £ 25 for high-polluting vehicles , including many luxury cars , from october 2008 , if the mayor of london 's proposal for an emissions-related road toll is given the go-ahead .

clean green cars said tfl should only enable low-polluting cars with at least four doors to register as private hire vehicles .

guinness world records has recognised folding @ home -lrb- fah -rrb- as the world 's most powerful distributed computing network .
fah has signed up nearly 700,000 ps3s to examine how the shape of proteins affect diseases such as alzheimer 's .
the network has more than one petaflop of computing power - the equivalent of 1,000 trillion calculations per second .
" to have folding @ home recognized by guinness world records as the most powerful distributed computing network ever is a reflection of the extraordinary worldwide participation by gamers and consumers around the world and for that we are very grateful , " said professor vijay pande of stanford university and a leader of the fah project .
disease link distributed computing is a method for solving large complex problems by dividing them between many computers .
cell specs 256 billion calculations per second 2.5mb of on-chip memory able to shuttle data to and from off-chip memory at speeds up to 100 gigabytes per second , 234 million transistors the cell 's hard sell they harness the idle processing power of computers to crunch small packets of data , which are then fed back over the internet to a central computer .
the technique has been used by several groups to study everything from how malaria spreads to searching for new cancer drugs .
one of the most high profile projects is seti @ home , which uses computer cycles to search through thousands of hours of radio telescope signals for signs of extra-terrestrial intelligence .
fah uses distributed computing to examine protein folding and how it maybe linked to diseases .
proteins that do not fold correctly have been implicated in diseases such as alzheimer 's , huntingdon 's , bse and many cancers .
speed test until march this year , fah only ran on pcs .
the program had around 200,000 computers participating in the program , the equivalent of about 250 teraflops -lrb- trillion calculations per second -rrb- .
the addition of 670,000 ps3s has taken the computing power of the network to more than one petaflop .
by comparison bluegene l , which tops the list of most powerful supercomputers , has a top speed of just 280.6 teraflops .
the boost is in part because of the ps3 's powerful processor , known as the " cell " , which runs up to 10 times faster than current pc chips .
" it is clear that none of this would be even remotely possible without the power of ps3 , it has increased our research capabilities by leaps and bounds , " said prof pande .

guinness world records has recognised folding @ home -lrb- fah -rrb- as the world 's most powerful distributed computing network .
fah has signed up nearly 700,000 ps3s to examine how the shape of proteins affect diseases such as alzheimer 's .
the network has more than one petaflop of computing power - the equivalent of 1,000 trillion calculations per second .
" to have folding @ home recognized by guinness world records as the most powerful distributed computing network ever is a reflection of the extraordinary worldwide participation by gamers and consumers around the world and for that we are very grateful , " said professor vijay pande of stanford university and a leader of the fah project .
disease link distributed computing is a method for solving large complex problems by dividing them between many computers .
cell specs 256 billion calculations per second 2.5mb of on-chip memory able to shuttle data to and from off-chip memory at speeds up to 100 gigabytes per second , 234 million transistors the cell 's hard sell they harness the idle processing power of computers to crunch small packets of data , which are then fed back over the internet to a central computer .
the technique has been used by several groups to study everything from how malaria spreads to searching for new cancer drugs .
one of the most high profile projects is seti @ home , which uses computer cycles to search through thousands of hours of radio telescope signals for signs of extra-terrestrial intelligence .
fah uses distributed computing to examine protein folding and how it maybe linked to diseases .
proteins that do not fold correctly have been implicated in diseases such as alzheimer 's , huntingdon 's , bse and many cancers .
speed test until march this year , fah only ran on pcs .
the program had around 200,000 computers participating in the program , the equivalent of about 250 teraflops -lrb- trillion calculations per second -rrb- .
the addition of 670,000 ps3s has taken the computing power of the network to more than one petaflop .
by comparison bluegene l , which tops the list of most powerful supercomputers , has a top speed of just 280.6 teraflops .
the boost is in part because of the ps3 's powerful processor , known as the " cell " , which runs up to 10 times faster than current pc chips .
" it is clear that none of this would be even remotely possible without the power of ps3 , it has increased our research capabilities by leaps and bounds , " said prof pande .

the drugs , with an estimated street value of more than $ 400m -lrb- £ 192m -rrb- , were found in by the mexican navy in cargo containers on a ship from colombia .
the seizure dwarfed the 11.5 tons found last month at the port of tampico .
the us ambassador said the seizures showed congress should approve funding for a major new anti-drug initiative . "
this seizure highlights the need for us congressional action on the proposed merida initiative " antonio garza jr us ambassador to mexico doubts over us anti-drugs aid " this seizure highlights the need for us congressional action on the proposed merida initiative , which will provide both countries with more and better tools to co-ordinate our high-stakes battle against the cartels and their narco-trafficking activities , " antonio garza jr said in a statement .
mr garza also said the seizure was " further proof of president -lsb- felipe -rsb- calderon 's commitment to cripple drug lords and bring them to justice " .
organised crime the mexican attorney-general 's office initially said on tuesday that the navy had discovered 11 tons of cocaine onboard the ship esmeralda , which had arrived from buenaventura in colombia .
but on thursday , the navy announced it had found a second stash of cocaine amid the ship 's cargo , bringing the total seizure to 23.5 tons .
the navy said the cocaine was found in more than 21,000 packages and that the final tally could rise further because officials had not yet finished searching all of the ship 's containers .
" with actions such as this one , the mexican government reaffirms the reach of the strategy being executed by this administration to break the operational networks and the business of organised crime groups dedicated to damaging the health , security and well-being of mexican society , " public security minister genaro garcia luna said in a statement .

the initial call came following allegations of child abuse on the western isles .
seven men and a woman were arrested in a series of dawn raids on the islands and in england in 2003 .
the crown office later dropped all charges .
mr stewart said : " it was a recommendation in the western isles inspectorate report , but there has n't been any action on this point to date .

in january , a report found child protection services in the highlands still needed improvement following the death of danielle , who was known to the social work department .
lee gaytor attacked danielle at her mother tracy reid 's home in inverness in november 2002 .
her body was put in a suitcase and dumped in the caledonian canal , where it was found in january 2003 .

alistair darling announced last month that cgt would be charged at a single rate of 18 % .
however , in june 2001 the government held a consultation on cgt reform which considered the simplification that has now been adopted .
the treasury 's response at the time was " the government was not attracted by any of these proposals " .
one of the main effects of mr darling 's simplification of the cgt system was the abolition of taper relief .
taper relief was a system introduced by mr brown in 1998 under which assets that were held for a long time were subject to a lower rate of tax .
" now we have unearthed the latest critic of the government 's ill-thought-out business tax increases - gordon brown himself , " said shadow chancellor george osborne .
a treasury spokesperson said in a statement that the difference was that the 1998 reform followed " years of macroeconomic instability and under-investment " .
" after a decade of low and stable inflation and continuous growth , the chancellor announced in the pre-budget report that we will now move to a single low rate of 18 % , which will make the system more straightforward and sustainable while incentivising investment and enterprise , " the statement added .
