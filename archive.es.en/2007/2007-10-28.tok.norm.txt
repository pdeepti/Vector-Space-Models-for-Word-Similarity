28 , as delegates wound up a major congress aimed at reviving the party 's flagging fortunes ahead of the 2009 elections . the 144-year-old party approved a new basic party program for only the third time since world war ii , reasserting core social democratic values at the end of a three-day congress in hamburg that saw it take a distinct turn to the left .
" there is no humanity when our actions are not guided by solidarity , " party chairman kurt beck told more than 500 delegates gathered in hamburg on the final day of the congress .
the program received near-unanimous support .
german chancellor merkel criticized the shift in her coalition partner as a " reversion to socialism . "
" we do not need a return to socialism like the social democrats want - we had enough of that in the gdr , " said merkel , referring to communist east germany where she grew up .
spd votes to roll back reforms merkel 's conservative christian union and the spd , its traditional rival , formed a left-right coalition in november 2005 after a bitterly fought , inconclusive general election .
two years on , merkel 's alliance is riding high with about 39 percent support versus just 26 percent for the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " king kurt " ' remains the undeclared candidate for chancellor for the 2009 election kurt beck , the main architect of the shift who was reelected with a thumping majority , said the party 's revised course did not mean a break with the past but rather an attempt to " answer the questions of today and the challenges of tomorrow , " beck said .
the party 's new " hamburg program " - updating the 1989 berlin program - contains several references to the term " democratic socialism , " which has been controversial within the party over recent years .
during the congress , the spd voted to roll back some of the harsher aspects of the market reforms implemented under chancellor gerhard schröder four years ago .
delegates decided in favor of paying unemployment benefit at the full rate to older claimants for longer than previously , easing the transition to retirement at 67 for manual workers and paying child support to the age of 27 , rather than 25 .
earlier , in an unexpected move , the spd voted in favor of introducing a top speed of 130 kph -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on germany 's famed speed-limit-free autobahns , or motorways , in a bid to cut the country 's co2 emissions from cars .
" a symbolic issue " germany 's powerful car industry has pressured lawmakers not to introduce national speed limits , arguing that high speeds help them sell mercedes , porsche and bmw around the world and help protect german jobs .
however a number of studies have shown that speed limits could effectively slash polluting emissions .
environmental groups have said a speed limit would cut vehicle co2 output by 5 percent overnight and 15 percent long-term once more fuel-efficient cars were used .
at a conference on climate change in berlin last week , nobel laureate al gore criticized germany in a speech for not having motorway speed limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's speed limit-free autobahns are the envy of the world the non-binding measure however will be hard to pass into law in the face of opposition by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the spd 's coalition partner .
" it 's an important symbolic issue , " said environmental minister sigmar gabriel .
" but it will probably be hard to pass into law because we wo n't find a majority for that with -lsb- merkel 's -rsb- christian democrats . "
left-wingers try to derail privatization project the two-day party conference , which sought ways to pull the spd out of a poll slump and had been marred by a bitter row over scaling back labor market reforms , also targeted the privatization of germany 's railways , deutsche bahn , which aims to raise 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- in a 2008 initial public offering .
kurt beck managed to stave off an attempt by left-wingers in the party to torpedo the privatization project .
left-wingers had feared spd ministers would settle on an unacceptable compromise with the christian democrats to sell the deutsche bahn stake to institutional investors rather than small investors .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , tried to win support by promising to ensure controls that would prevent hedge funds from breaking up deutsche bahn .
" we 'll keep the ' locusts ' away , " he said .
ultimately the party agreed on a compromise , with left-wingers managing to insert a condition - " otherwise the spd rejects the sale of shares " - into a draft resolution on the privatization .
merkel slammed for turkey stance the conference produced another surprise when foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuked chancellor merkel for holding out the promise of eu membership to turkey for decades , contingent on reforms , but then withdrawing support .
merkel 's party favors a privileged partnership with ankara , short of membership .
" at the crucial moment they caved in , " the normally diplomatic steinmeier said .
" what can i do with a party like the conservatives that acts like that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have enjoyed a harmonious relationship in a further sign of tensions between steinmeier and merkel , who have cooperated on foreign policy for the past two years , the foreign minister criticized the chancellor 's method of talking about human rights in china and russia through the german media rather than using more effective channels .
" when we speak out for human rights it 's not just for a quick headline back home , " steinmeier said , referring to merkel 's recent focus on human rights in china and russia that has strained relations with both countries .
" no military adventures in iran " the foreign minister also voiced concern about us intentions towards iran .
" we must prevent nuclear weapons in the middle east .
but military adventures are no contribution to a solution , " steinmeier said .
" on the contrary , the daily ranting about it only makes a solution more difficult . "
but he made clear the need to keep nuclear weapons away from iran .
atomic weapons should not land " in the hands of people who deny the holocaust , " he said in a reference to controversial remarks by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
" this would destabilize the entire middle east , " he said , stressing that germany would continue to work towards a diplomatic solution along with the united states , russia and china . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin has the last word on arms sales , and gives the go-ahead a bit too willingly , say human rights groups . an estimated 80,000 people are employed by the german arms industry , which might be far fewer than during the cold war but still counts as a thriving business .
most of the weapons and armaments manufactured are earmarked for the bundeswehr , but exports are now on the rise .
submarines and tanks " made in germany " might boast technological excellence , but the market for them is a small and highly competitive one .
although not one single german company numbers among the world 's top ten largest arms manufacturers , the country is nonetheless one of the world 's busiest arms exporters .
german-made armaments tend to be produced by medium-sized companies , but the fact they boast first-class quality guarantees them a lucrative corner of the cut-throat international market .
and in recent years , germany has managed to boost this share even further .
the business of war according to journalist thomas meuter , an expert on the german arms industry , this success is largely due to technical know-how .
" with its various products and developments , -lrb- germany -rrb- plays in the champions ' league , " says meuter .
" these products include armed vehicles and tanks , as well as technologies to protect these vehicles and soldiers . "
the leopard 2 , for example , is a german main battle tank built by the german company krauss-maffei-wegmann .
exceptionally bullet and mine-proof , it 's a bestseller with armies deployed on foreign soil .
government green light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german arms technology is top quality in this respect , major international missions such as afghanistan can mean big business for the german arms industry .
but sales are not always straightforward .
according to german basic law , all arms exports need to be approved by the government .
the lion 's share of germany 's exported armaments goes to nato partners and european countries - sales to which berlin will generally give the green light .
but when it comes to other countries , the deal has to meet certain stipulations laid out in arms export guidelines .
these criteria were last agreed by the previous government .
social democrat uta zapf has been a long-standing member of the german parliament 's defense committee and helped draft the regulations .
" one criterion concerns flashpoints , another human rights , " explains zapf .
" these two points are very decisive , and the way around them , as it were , is to cite german security interests . "
the ethics of selling arms much to the disgust of mathias john , an arms expert with amnesty international , this argument justifies the sale of german submarines to pakistan , despite current unrest and a flawed human rights record .
" making german arms technology available to a regime that breaches human rights sends a wrong signal , " he argues .
" it 's comparable to selling turkey a large number of arms - as repeatedly happened in the past , despite its catastrophic human rights record - including battle tanks and small arms which specifically lead to breaches of human rights . "
the public is seldom kept abreast of these decisions , given that the federal security council meetings to consider the export requests from arms manufacturers are top secret .
according to uta zapf , not even the german parliament is able to exert influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arms industry is small-scale than used to be , but still thriving " it would be more transparent if we were kept informed and could contribute to the decision-making process , " she says .
" but the government will not allow this , because sales requests from industry are subject to data protection and the information needs to be kept private to protect business interests .
however , other countries have found ways of dealing with these issues . "
for the time being , greater transparency remains off the cards .
neither the government not the arms industry has a vested interest in changing the status quo .

berlin has the last word on arms sales , and gives the go-ahead a bit too willingly , say human rights groups . an estimated 80,000 people are employed by the german arms industry , which might be far fewer than during the cold war but still counts as a thriving business .
most of the weapons and armaments manufactured are earmarked for the bundeswehr , but exports are now on the rise .
submarines and tanks " made in germany " might boast technological excellence , but the market for them is a small and highly competitive one .
although not one single german company numbers among the world 's top ten largest arms manufacturers , the country is nonetheless one of the world 's busiest arms exporters .
german-made armaments tend to be produced by medium-sized companies , but the fact they boast first-class quality guarantees them a lucrative corner of the cut-throat international market .
and in recent years , germany has managed to boost this share even further .
the business of war according to journalist thomas meuter , an expert on the german arms industry , this success is largely due to technical know-how .
" with its various products and developments , -lrb- germany -rrb- plays in the champions ' league , " says meuter .
" these products include armed vehicles and tanks , as well as technologies to protect these vehicles and soldiers . "
the leopard 2 , for example , is a german main battle tank built by the german company krauss-maffei-wegmann .
exceptionally bullet and mine-proof , it 's a bestseller with armies deployed on foreign soil .
government green light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german arms technology is top quality in this respect , major international missions such as afghanistan can mean big business for the german arms industry .
but sales are not always straightforward .
according to german basic law , all arms exports need to be approved by the government .
the lion 's share of germany 's exported armaments goes to nato partners and european countries - sales to which berlin will generally give the green light .
but when it comes to other countries , the deal has to meet certain stipulations laid out in arms export guidelines .
these criteria were last agreed by the previous government .
social democrat uta zapf has been a long-standing member of the german parliament 's defense committee and helped draft the regulations .
" one criterion concerns flashpoints , another human rights , " explains zapf .
" these two points are very decisive , and the way around them , as it were , is to cite german security interests . "
the ethics of selling arms much to the disgust of mathias john , an arms expert with amnesty international , this argument justifies the sale of german submarines to pakistan , despite current unrest and a flawed human rights record .
" making german arms technology available to a regime that breaches human rights sends a wrong signal , " he argues .
" it 's comparable to selling turkey a large number of arms - as repeatedly happened in the past , despite its catastrophic human rights record - including battle tanks and small arms which specifically lead to breaches of human rights . "
the public is seldom kept abreast of these decisions , given that the federal security council meetings to consider the export requests from arms manufacturers are top secret .
according to uta zapf , not even the german parliament is able to exert influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arms industry is small-scale than used to be , but still thriving " it would be more transparent if we were kept informed and could contribute to the decision-making process , " she says .
" but the government will not allow this , because sales requests from industry are subject to data protection and the information needs to be kept private to protect business interests .
however , other countries have found ways of dealing with these issues . "
for the time being , greater transparency remains off the cards .
neither the government not the arms industry has a vested interest in changing the status quo .

28 , as delegates wound up a major congress aimed at reviving the party 's flagging fortunes ahead of the 2009 elections . the 144-year-old party approved a new basic party program for only the third time since world war ii , reasserting core social democratic values at the end of a three-day congress in hamburg that saw it take a distinct turn to the left .
" there is no humanity when our actions are not guided by solidarity , " party chairman kurt beck told more than 500 delegates gathered in hamburg on the final day of the congress .
the program received near-unanimous support .
german chancellor merkel criticized the shift in her coalition partner as a " reversion to socialism . "
" we do not need a return to socialism like the social democrats want - we had enough of that in the gdr , " said merkel , referring to communist east germany where she grew up .
spd votes to roll back reforms merkel 's conservative christian union and the spd , its traditional rival , formed a left-right coalition in november 2005 after a bitterly fought , inconclusive general election .
two years on , merkel 's alliance is riding high with about 39 percent support versus just 26 percent for the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " king kurt " ' remains the undeclared candidate for chancellor for the 2009 election kurt beck , the main architect of the shift who was reelected with a thumping majority , said the party 's revised course did not mean a break with the past but rather an attempt to " answer the questions of today and the challenges of tomorrow , " beck said .
the party 's new " hamburg program " - updating the 1989 berlin program - contains several references to the term " democratic socialism , " which has been controversial within the party over recent years .
during the congress , the spd voted to roll back some of the harsher aspects of the market reforms implemented under chancellor gerhard schröder four years ago .
delegates decided in favor of paying unemployment benefit at the full rate to older claimants for longer than previously , easing the transition to retirement at 67 for manual workers and paying child support to the age of 27 , rather than 25 .
earlier , in an unexpected move , the spd voted in favor of introducing a top speed of 130 kph -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on germany 's famed speed-limit-free autobahns , or motorways , in a bid to cut the country 's co2 emissions from cars .
" a symbolic issue " germany 's powerful car industry has pressured lawmakers not to introduce national speed limits , arguing that high speeds help them sell mercedes , porsche and bmw around the world and help protect german jobs .
however a number of studies have shown that speed limits could effectively slash polluting emissions .
environmental groups have said a speed limit would cut vehicle co2 output by 5 percent overnight and 15 percent long-term once more fuel-efficient cars were used .
at a conference on climate change in berlin last week , nobel laureate al gore criticized germany in a speech for not having motorway speed limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's speed limit-free autobahns are the envy of the world the non-binding measure however will be hard to pass into law in the face of opposition by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the spd 's coalition partner .
" it 's an important symbolic issue , " said environmental minister sigmar gabriel .
" but it will probably be hard to pass into law because we wo n't find a majority for that with -lsb- merkel 's -rsb- christian democrats . "
left-wingers try to derail privatization project the two-day party conference , which sought ways to pull the spd out of a poll slump and had been marred by a bitter row over scaling back labor market reforms , also targeted the privatization of germany 's railways , deutsche bahn , which aims to raise 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- in a 2008 initial public offering .
kurt beck managed to stave off an attempt by left-wingers in the party to torpedo the privatization project .
left-wingers had feared spd ministers would settle on an unacceptable compromise with the christian democrats to sell the deutsche bahn stake to institutional investors rather than small investors .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , tried to win support by promising to ensure controls that would prevent hedge funds from breaking up deutsche bahn .
" we 'll keep the ' locusts ' away , " he said .
ultimately the party agreed on a compromise , with left-wingers managing to insert a condition - " otherwise the spd rejects the sale of shares " - into a draft resolution on the privatization .
merkel slammed for turkey stance the conference produced another surprise when foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuked chancellor merkel for holding out the promise of eu membership to turkey for decades , contingent on reforms , but then withdrawing support .
merkel 's party favors a privileged partnership with ankara , short of membership .
" at the crucial moment they caved in , " the normally diplomatic steinmeier said .
" what can i do with a party like the conservatives that acts like that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have enjoyed a harmonious relationship in a further sign of tensions between steinmeier and merkel , who have cooperated on foreign policy for the past two years , the foreign minister criticized the chancellor 's method of talking about human rights in china and russia through the german media rather than using more effective channels .
" when we speak out for human rights it 's not just for a quick headline back home , " steinmeier said , referring to merkel 's recent focus on human rights in china and russia that has strained relations with both countries .
" no military adventures in iran " the foreign minister also voiced concern about us intentions towards iran .
" we must prevent nuclear weapons in the middle east .
but military adventures are no contribution to a solution , " steinmeier said .
" on the contrary , the daily ranting about it only makes a solution more difficult . "
but he made clear the need to keep nuclear weapons away from iran .
atomic weapons should not land " in the hands of people who deny the holocaust , " he said in a reference to controversial remarks by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
" this would destabilize the entire middle east , " he said , stressing that germany would continue to work towards a diplomatic solution along with the united states , russia and china . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , as delegates wound up a major congress aimed at reviving the party 's flagging fortunes ahead of the 2009 elections . the 144-year-old party approved a new basic party program for only the third time since world war ii , reasserting core social democratic values at the end of a three-day congress in hamburg that saw it take a distinct turn to the left .
" there is no humanity when our actions are not guided by solidarity , " party chairman kurt beck told more than 500 delegates gathered in hamburg on the final day of the congress .
the program received near-unanimous support .
german chancellor merkel criticized the shift in her coalition partner as a " reversion to socialism . "
" we do not need a return to socialism like the social democrats want - we had enough of that in the gdr , " said merkel , referring to communist east germany where she grew up .

berlin has the last word on arms sales , and gives the go-ahead a bit too willingly , say human rights groups . an estimated 80,000 people are employed by the german arms industry , which might be far fewer than during the cold war but still counts as a thriving business .
most of the weapons and armaments manufactured are earmarked for the bundeswehr , but exports are now on the rise .
submarines and tanks " made in germany " might boast technological excellence , but the market for them is a small and highly competitive one .
although not one single german company numbers among the world 's top ten largest arms manufacturers , the country is nonetheless one of the world 's busiest arms exporters .
german-made armaments tend to be produced by medium-sized companies , but the fact they boast first-class quality guarantees them a lucrative corner of the cut-throat international market .
and in recent years , germany has managed to boost this share even further .
the business of war according to journalist thomas meuter , an expert on the german arms industry , this success is largely due to technical know-how .
" with its various products and developments , -lrb- germany -rrb- plays in the champions ' league , " says meuter .
" these products include armed vehicles and tanks , as well as technologies to protect these vehicles and soldiers . "
the leopard 2 , for example , is a german main battle tank built by the german company krauss-maffei-wegmann .
exceptionally bullet and mine-proof , it 's a bestseller with armies deployed on foreign soil .
government green light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german arms technology is top quality in this respect , major international missions such as afghanistan can mean big business for the german arms industry .
but sales are not always straightforward .
according to german basic law , all arms exports need to be approved by the government .
the lion 's share of germany 's exported armaments goes to nato partners and european countries - sales to which berlin will generally give the green light .
but when it comes to other countries , the deal has to meet certain stipulations laid out in arms export guidelines .
these criteria were last agreed by the previous government .
social democrat uta zapf has been a long-standing member of the german parliament 's defense committee and helped draft the regulations .
" one criterion concerns flashpoints , another human rights , " explains zapf .
" these two points are very decisive , and the way around them , as it were , is to cite german security interests . "
the ethics of selling arms much to the disgust of mathias john , an arms expert with amnesty international , this argument justifies the sale of german submarines to pakistan , despite current unrest and a flawed human rights record .
" making german arms technology available to a regime that breaches human rights sends a wrong signal , " he argues .
" it 's comparable to selling turkey a large number of arms - as repeatedly happened in the past , despite its catastrophic human rights record - including battle tanks and small arms which specifically lead to breaches of human rights . "
the public is seldom kept abreast of these decisions , given that the federal security council meetings to consider the export requests from arms manufacturers are top secret .
according to uta zapf , not even the german parliament is able to exert influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arms industry is small-scale than used to be , but still thriving " it would be more transparent if we were kept informed and could contribute to the decision-making process , " she says .
" but the government will not allow this , because sales requests from industry are subject to data protection and the information needs to be kept private to protect business interests .
however , other countries have found ways of dealing with these issues . "
for the time being , greater transparency remains off the cards .
neither the government not the arms industry has a vested interest in changing the status quo .

berlin has the last word on arms sales , and gives the go-ahead a bit too willingly , say human rights groups . an estimated 80,000 people are employed by the german arms industry , which might be far fewer than during the cold war but still counts as a thriving business .
most of the weapons and armaments manufactured are earmarked for the bundeswehr , but exports are now on the rise .
submarines and tanks " made in germany " might boast technological excellence , but the market for them is a small and highly competitive one .
although not one single german company numbers among the world 's top ten largest arms manufacturers , the country is nonetheless one of the world 's busiest arms exporters .
german-made armaments tend to be produced by medium-sized companies , but the fact they boast first-class quality guarantees them a lucrative corner of the cut-throat international market .
and in recent years , germany has managed to boost this share even further .
the business of war according to journalist thomas meuter , an expert on the german arms industry , this success is largely due to technical know-how .
" with its various products and developments , -lrb- germany -rrb- plays in the champions ' league , " says meuter .
" these products include armed vehicles and tanks , as well as technologies to protect these vehicles and soldiers . "
the leopard 2 , for example , is a german main battle tank built by the german company krauss-maffei-wegmann .
exceptionally bullet and mine-proof , it 's a bestseller with armies deployed on foreign soil .
government green light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german arms technology is top quality in this respect , major international missions such as afghanistan can mean big business for the german arms industry .
but sales are not always straightforward .
according to german basic law , all arms exports need to be approved by the government .
the lion 's share of germany 's exported armaments goes to nato partners and european countries - sales to which berlin will generally give the green light .
but when it comes to other countries , the deal has to meet certain stipulations laid out in arms export guidelines .
these criteria were last agreed by the previous government .
social democrat uta zapf has been a long-standing member of the german parliament 's defense committee and helped draft the regulations .
" one criterion concerns flashpoints , another human rights , " explains zapf .
" these two points are very decisive , and the way around them , as it were , is to cite german security interests . "
the ethics of selling arms much to the disgust of mathias john , an arms expert with amnesty international , this argument justifies the sale of german submarines to pakistan , despite current unrest and a flawed human rights record .
" making german arms technology available to a regime that breaches human rights sends a wrong signal , " he argues .
" it 's comparable to selling turkey a large number of arms - as repeatedly happened in the past , despite its catastrophic human rights record - including battle tanks and small arms which specifically lead to breaches of human rights . "
the public is seldom kept abreast of these decisions , given that the federal security council meetings to consider the export requests from arms manufacturers are top secret .
according to uta zapf , not even the german parliament is able to exert influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arms industry is small-scale than used to be , but still thriving " it would be more transparent if we were kept informed and could contribute to the decision-making process , " she says .
" but the government will not allow this , because sales requests from industry are subject to data protection and the information needs to be kept private to protect business interests .
however , other countries have found ways of dealing with these issues . "
for the time being , greater transparency remains off the cards .
neither the government not the arms industry has a vested interest in changing the status quo .
instead , the public has to rely for this kind of information on the annual arms export report - but is still waiting for publication of the 2006 file . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 28.10.2007 germany 's social democrats turn left to renew core principles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd members voted unanimously in favor of " democratic socialism " germany 's social democratic party reasserted its commitment to " democratic socialism " sunday , oct .
28 , as delegates wound up a major congress aimed at reviving the party 's flagging fortunes ahead of the 2009 elections . the 144-year-old party approved a new basic party program for only the third time since world war ii , reasserting core social democratic values at the end of a three-day congress in hamburg that saw it take a distinct turn to the left .
" there is no humanity when our actions are not guided by solidarity , " party chairman kurt beck told more than 500 delegates gathered in hamburg on the final day of the congress .
the program received near-unanimous support .
german chancellor merkel criticized the shift in her coalition partner as a " reversion to socialism . "
" we do not need a return to socialism like the social democrats want - we had enough of that in the gdr , " said merkel , referring to communist east germany where she grew up .
spd votes to roll back reforms merkel 's conservative christian union and the spd , its traditional rival , formed a left-right coalition in november 2005 after a bitterly fought , inconclusive general election .
two years on , merkel 's alliance is riding high with about 39 percent support versus just 26 percent for the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " king kurt " ' remains the undeclared candidate for chancellor for the 2009 election kurt beck , the main architect of the shift who was reelected with a thumping majority , said the party 's revised course did not mean a break with the past but rather an attempt to " answer the questions of today and the challenges of tomorrow , " beck said .
the party 's new " hamburg program " - updating the 1989 berlin program - contains several references to the term " democratic socialism , " which has been controversial within the party over recent years .
during the congress , the spd voted to roll back some of the harsher aspects of the market reforms implemented under chancellor gerhard schröder four years ago .
delegates decided in favor of paying unemployment benefit at the full rate to older claimants for longer than previously , easing the transition to retirement at 67 for manual workers and paying child support to the age of 27 , rather than 25 .
earlier , in an unexpected move , the spd voted in favor of introducing a top speed of 130 kph -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on germany 's famed speed-limit-free autobahns , or motorways , in a bid to cut the country 's co2 emissions from cars .
" a symbolic issue " germany 's powerful car industry has pressured lawmakers not to introduce national speed limits , arguing that high speeds help them sell mercedes , porsche and bmw around the world and help protect german jobs .
however a number of studies have shown that speed limits could effectively slash polluting emissions .
environmental groups have said a speed limit would cut vehicle co2 output by 5 percent overnight and 15 percent long-term once more fuel-efficient cars were used .
at a conference on climate change in berlin last week , nobel laureate al gore criticized germany in a speech for not having motorway speed limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's speed limit-free autobahns are the envy of the world the non-binding measure however will be hard to pass into law in the face of opposition by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the spd 's coalition partner .
" it 's an important symbolic issue , " said environmental minister sigmar gabriel .
" but it will probably be hard to pass into law because we wo n't find a majority for that with -lsb- merkel 's -rsb- christian democrats . "
left-wingers try to derail privatization project the two-day party conference , which sought ways to pull the spd out of a poll slump and had been marred by a bitter row over scaling back labor market reforms , also targeted the privatization of germany 's railways , deutsche bahn , which aims to raise 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- in a 2008 initial public offering .
kurt beck managed to stave off an attempt by left-wingers in the party to torpedo the privatization project .
left-wingers had feared spd ministers would settle on an unacceptable compromise with the christian democrats to sell the deutsche bahn stake to institutional investors rather than small investors .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , tried to win support by promising to ensure controls that would prevent hedge funds from breaking up deutsche bahn .
" we 'll keep the ' locusts ' away , " he said .
ultimately the party agreed on a compromise , with left-wingers managing to insert a condition - " otherwise the spd rejects the sale of shares " - into a draft resolution on the privatization .
merkel slammed for turkey stance the conference produced another surprise when foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuked chancellor merkel for holding out the promise of eu membership to turkey for decades , contingent on reforms , but then withdrawing support .
merkel 's party favors a privileged partnership with ankara , short of membership .
" at the crucial moment they caved in , " the normally diplomatic steinmeier said .
" what can i do with a party like the conservatives that acts like that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have enjoyed a harmonious relationship in a further sign of tensions between steinmeier and merkel , who have cooperated on foreign policy for the past two years , the foreign minister criticized the chancellor 's method of talking about human rights in china and russia through the german media rather than using more effective channels .
" when we speak out for human rights it 's not just for a quick headline back home , " steinmeier said , referring to merkel 's recent focus on human rights in china and russia that has strained relations with both countries .
" no military adventures in iran " the foreign minister also voiced concern about us intentions towards iran .
" we must prevent nuclear weapons in the middle east .
but military adventures are no contribution to a solution , " steinmeier said .
" on the contrary , the daily ranting about it only makes a solution more difficult . "
but he made clear the need to keep nuclear weapons away from iran .
atomic weapons should not land " in the hands of people who deny the holocaust , " he said in a reference to controversial remarks by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
" this would destabilize the entire middle east , " he said , stressing that germany would continue to work towards a diplomatic solution along with the united states , russia and china . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , as delegates wound up a major congress aimed at reviving the party 's flagging fortunes ahead of the 2009 elections . the 144-year-old party approved a new basic party program for only the third time since world war ii , reasserting core social democratic values at the end of a three-day congress in hamburg that saw it take a distinct turn to the left .
" there is no humanity when our actions are not guided by solidarity , " party chairman kurt beck told more than 500 delegates gathered in hamburg on the final day of the congress .
the program received near-unanimous support .
german chancellor merkel criticized the shift in her coalition partner as a " reversion to socialism . "
" we do not need a return to socialism like the social democrats want - we had enough of that in the gdr , " said merkel , referring to communist east germany where she grew up .
spd votes to roll back reforms merkel 's conservative christian union and the spd , its traditional rival , formed a left-right coalition in november 2005 after a bitterly fought , inconclusive general election .
two years on , merkel 's alliance is riding high with about 39 percent support versus just 26 percent for the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " king kurt " ' remains the undeclared candidate for chancellor for the 2009 election kurt beck , the main architect of the shift who was reelected with a thumping majority , said the party 's revised course did not mean a break with the past but rather an attempt to " answer the questions of today and the challenges of tomorrow , " beck said .
the party 's new " hamburg program " - updating the 1989 berlin program - contains several references to the term " democratic socialism , " which has been controversial within the party over recent years .
during the congress , the spd voted to roll back some of the harsher aspects of the market reforms implemented under chancellor gerhard schröder four years ago .
delegates decided in favor of paying unemployment benefit at the full rate to older claimants for longer than previously , easing the transition to retirement at 67 for manual workers and paying child support to the age of 27 , rather than 25 .
earlier , in an unexpected move , the spd voted in favor of introducing a top speed of 130 kph -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on germany 's famed speed-limit-free autobahns , or motorways , in a bid to cut the country 's co2 emissions from cars .
" a symbolic issue " germany 's powerful car industry has pressured lawmakers not to introduce national speed limits , arguing that high speeds help them sell mercedes , porsche and bmw around the world and help protect german jobs .
however a number of studies have shown that speed limits could effectively slash polluting emissions .
environmental groups have said a speed limit would cut vehicle co2 output by 5 percent overnight and 15 percent long-term once more fuel-efficient cars were used .
at a conference on climate change in berlin last week , nobel laureate al gore criticized germany in a speech for not having motorway speed limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's speed limit-free autobahns are the envy of the world the non-binding measure however will be hard to pass into law in the face of opposition by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the spd 's coalition partner .
" it 's an important symbolic issue , " said environmental minister sigmar gabriel .
" but it will probably be hard to pass into law because we wo n't find a majority for that with -lsb- merkel 's -rsb- christian democrats . "
left-wingers try to derail privatization project the two-day party conference , which sought ways to pull the spd out of a poll slump and had been marred by a bitter row over scaling back labor market reforms , also targeted the privatization of germany 's railways , deutsche bahn , which aims to raise 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- in a 2008 initial public offering .
kurt beck managed to stave off an attempt by left-wingers in the party to torpedo the privatization project .
left-wingers had feared spd ministers would settle on an unacceptable compromise with the christian democrats to sell the deutsche bahn stake to institutional investors rather than small investors .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , tried to win support by promising to ensure controls that would prevent hedge funds from breaking up deutsche bahn .
" we 'll keep the ' locusts ' away , " he said .
ultimately the party agreed on a compromise , with left-wingers managing to insert a condition - " otherwise the spd rejects the sale of shares " - into a draft resolution on the privatization .
merkel slammed for turkey stance the conference produced another surprise when foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuked chancellor merkel for holding out the promise of eu membership to turkey for decades , contingent on reforms , but then withdrawing support .
merkel 's party favors a privileged partnership with ankara , short of membership .
" at the crucial moment they caved in , " the normally diplomatic steinmeier said .
" what can i do with a party like the conservatives that acts like that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have enjoyed a harmonious relationship in a further sign of tensions between steinmeier and merkel , who have cooperated on foreign policy for the past two years , the foreign minister criticized the chancellor 's method of talking about human rights in china and russia through the german media rather than using more effective channels .
" when we speak out for human rights it 's not just for a quick headline back home , " steinmeier said , referring to merkel 's recent focus on human rights in china and russia that has strained relations with both countries .
" no military adventures in iran " the foreign minister also voiced concern about us intentions towards iran .
" we must prevent nuclear weapons in the middle east .
but military adventures are no contribution to a solution , " steinmeier said .
" on the contrary , the daily ranting about it only makes a solution more difficult . "
but he made clear the need to keep nuclear weapons away from iran .

berlin has the last word on arms sales , and gives the go-ahead a bit too willingly , say human rights groups . an estimated 80,000 people are employed by the german arms industry , which might be far fewer than during the cold war but still counts as a thriving business .
most of the weapons and armaments manufactured are earmarked for the bundeswehr , but exports are now on the rise .
submarines and tanks " made in germany " might boast technological excellence , but the market for them is a small and highly competitive one .
although not one single german company numbers among the world 's top ten largest arms manufacturers , the country is nonetheless one of the world 's busiest arms exporters .
german-made armaments tend to be produced by medium-sized companies , but the fact they boast first-class quality guarantees them a lucrative corner of the cut-throat international market .
and in recent years , germany has managed to boost this share even further .
the business of war according to journalist thomas meuter , an expert on the german arms industry , this success is largely due to technical know-how .
" with its various products and developments , -lrb- germany -rrb- plays in the champions ' league , " says meuter .
" these products include armed vehicles and tanks , as well as technologies to protect these vehicles and soldiers . "
the leopard 2 , for example , is a german main battle tank built by the german company krauss-maffei-wegmann .
exceptionally bullet and mine-proof , it 's a bestseller with armies deployed on foreign soil .
government green light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german arms technology is top quality in this respect , major international missions such as afghanistan can mean big business for the german arms industry .
but sales are not always straightforward .
according to german basic law , all arms exports need to be approved by the government .
the lion 's share of germany 's exported armaments goes to nato partners and european countries - sales to which berlin will generally give the green light .
but when it comes to other countries , the deal has to meet certain stipulations laid out in arms export guidelines .
these criteria were last agreed by the previous government .
social democrat uta zapf has been a long-standing member of the german parliament 's defense committee and helped draft the regulations .
" one criterion concerns flashpoints , another human rights , " explains zapf .
" these two points are very decisive , and the way around them , as it were , is to cite german security interests . "
the ethics of selling arms much to the disgust of mathias john , an arms expert with amnesty international , this argument justifies the sale of german submarines to pakistan , despite current unrest and a flawed human rights record .
" making german arms technology available to a regime that breaches human rights sends a wrong signal , " he argues .
" it 's comparable to selling turkey a large number of arms - as repeatedly happened in the past , despite its catastrophic human rights record - including battle tanks and small arms which specifically lead to breaches of human rights . "
the public is seldom kept abreast of these decisions , given that the federal security council meetings to consider the export requests from arms manufacturers are top secret .
according to uta zapf , not even the german parliament is able to exert influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arms industry is small-scale than used to be , but still thriving " it would be more transparent if we were kept informed and could contribute to the decision-making process , " she says .
" but the government will not allow this , because sales requests from industry are subject to data protection and the information needs to be kept private to protect business interests .
however , other countries have found ways of dealing with these issues . "
for the time being , greater transparency remains off the cards .
neither the government not the arms industry has a vested interest in changing the status quo .
instead , the public has to rely for this kind of information on the annual arms export report - but is still waiting for publication of the 2006 file . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , as delegates wound up a major congress aimed at reviving the party 's flagging fortunes ahead of the 2009 elections . the 144-year-old party approved a new basic party program for only the third time since world war ii , reasserting core social democratic values at the end of a three-day congress in hamburg that saw it take a distinct turn to the left .
" there is no humanity when our actions are not guided by solidarity , " party chairman kurt beck told more than 500 delegates gathered in hamburg on the final day of the congress .
the program received near-unanimous support .
german chancellor merkel criticized the shift in her coalition partner as a " reversion to socialism . "
" we do not need a return to socialism like the social democrats want - we had enough of that in the gdr , " said merkel , referring to communist east germany where she grew up .
spd votes to roll back reforms merkel 's conservative christian union and the spd , its traditional rival , formed a left-right coalition in november 2005 after a bitterly fought , inconclusive general election .
two years on , merkel 's alliance is riding high with about 39 percent support versus just 26 percent for the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " king kurt " ' remains the undeclared candidate for chancellor for the 2009 election kurt beck , the main architect of the shift who was reelected with a thumping majority , said the party 's revised course did not mean a break with the past but rather an attempt to " answer the questions of today and the challenges of tomorrow , " beck said .
the party 's new " hamburg program " - updating the 1989 berlin program - contains several references to the term " democratic socialism , " which has been controversial within the party over recent years .
during the congress , the spd voted to roll back some of the harsher aspects of the market reforms implemented under chancellor gerhard schröder four years ago .
delegates decided in favor of paying unemployment benefit at the full rate to older claimants for longer than previously , easing the transition to retirement at 67 for manual workers and paying child support to the age of 27 , rather than 25 .
earlier , in an unexpected move , the spd voted in favor of introducing a top speed of 130 kph -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on germany 's famed speed-limit-free autobahns , or motorways , in a bid to cut the country 's co2 emissions from cars .
" a symbolic issue " germany 's powerful car industry has pressured lawmakers not to introduce national speed limits , arguing that high speeds help them sell mercedes , porsche and bmw around the world and help protect german jobs .
however a number of studies have shown that speed limits could effectively slash polluting emissions .
environmental groups have said a speed limit would cut vehicle co2 output by 5 percent overnight and 15 percent long-term once more fuel-efficient cars were used .
at a conference on climate change in berlin last week , nobel laureate al gore criticized germany in a speech for not having motorway speed limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's speed limit-free autobahns are the envy of the world the non-binding measure however will be hard to pass into law in the face of opposition by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the spd 's coalition partner .
" it 's an important symbolic issue , " said environmental minister sigmar gabriel .
" but it will probably be hard to pass into law because we wo n't find a majority for that with -lsb- merkel 's -rsb- christian democrats . "
left-wingers try to derail privatization project the two-day party conference , which sought ways to pull the spd out of a poll slump and had been marred by a bitter row over scaling back labor market reforms , also targeted the privatization of germany 's railways , deutsche bahn , which aims to raise 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- in a 2008 initial public offering .
kurt beck managed to stave off an attempt by left-wingers in the party to torpedo the privatization project .
left-wingers had feared spd ministers would settle on an unacceptable compromise with the christian democrats to sell the deutsche bahn stake to institutional investors rather than small investors .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , tried to win support by promising to ensure controls that would prevent hedge funds from breaking up deutsche bahn .
" we 'll keep the ' locusts ' away , " he said .
ultimately the party agreed on a compromise , with left-wingers managing to insert a condition - " otherwise the spd rejects the sale of shares " - into a draft resolution on the privatization .
merkel slammed for turkey stance the conference produced another surprise when foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuked chancellor merkel for holding out the promise of eu membership to turkey for decades , contingent on reforms , but then withdrawing support .
merkel 's party favors a privileged partnership with ankara , short of membership .
" at the crucial moment they caved in , " the normally diplomatic steinmeier said .
" what can i do with a party like the conservatives that acts like that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have enjoyed a harmonious relationship in a further sign of tensions between steinmeier and merkel , who have cooperated on foreign policy for the past two years , the foreign minister criticized the chancellor 's method of talking about human rights in china and russia through the german media rather than using more effective channels .
" when we speak out for human rights it 's not just for a quick headline back home , " steinmeier said , referring to merkel 's recent focus on human rights in china and russia that has strained relations with both countries .
" no military adventures in iran " the foreign minister also voiced concern about us intentions towards iran .
" we must prevent nuclear weapons in the middle east .
but military adventures are no contribution to a solution , " steinmeier said .
" on the contrary , the daily ranting about it only makes a solution more difficult . "
but he made clear the need to keep nuclear weapons away from iran .
atomic weapons should not land " in the hands of people who deny the holocaust , " he said in a reference to controversial remarks by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
" this would destabilize the entire middle east , " he said , stressing that germany would continue to work towards a diplomatic solution along with the united states , russia and china . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin has the last word on arms sales , and gives the go-ahead a bit too willingly , say human rights groups . an estimated 80,000 people are employed by the german arms industry , which might be far fewer than during the cold war but still counts as a thriving business .
most of the weapons and armaments manufactured are earmarked for the bundeswehr , but exports are now on the rise .
submarines and tanks " made in germany " might boast technological excellence , but the market for them is a small and highly competitive one .
although not one single german company numbers among the world 's top ten largest arms manufacturers , the country is nonetheless one of the world 's busiest arms exporters .
german-made armaments tend to be produced by medium-sized companies , but the fact they boast first-class quality guarantees them a lucrative corner of the cut-throat international market .
and in recent years , germany has managed to boost this share even further .
the business of war according to journalist thomas meuter , an expert on the german arms industry , this success is largely due to technical know-how .
" with its various products and developments , -lrb- germany -rrb- plays in the champions ' league , " says meuter .
" these products include armed vehicles and tanks , as well as technologies to protect these vehicles and soldiers . "
the leopard 2 , for example , is a german main battle tank built by the german company krauss-maffei-wegmann .
exceptionally bullet and mine-proof , it 's a bestseller with armies deployed on foreign soil .
government green light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german arms technology is top quality in this respect , major international missions such as afghanistan can mean big business for the german arms industry .
but sales are not always straightforward .
according to german basic law , all arms exports need to be approved by the government .
the lion 's share of germany 's exported armaments goes to nato partners and european countries - sales to which berlin will generally give the green light .
but when it comes to other countries , the deal has to meet certain stipulations laid out in arms export guidelines .
these criteria were last agreed by the previous government .
social democrat uta zapf has been a long-standing member of the german parliament 's defense committee and helped draft the regulations .
" one criterion concerns flashpoints , another human rights , " explains zapf .
" these two points are very decisive , and the way around them , as it were , is to cite german security interests . "
the ethics of selling arms much to the disgust of mathias john , an arms expert with amnesty international , this argument justifies the sale of german submarines to pakistan , despite current unrest and a flawed human rights record .
" making german arms technology available to a regime that breaches human rights sends a wrong signal , " he argues .
" it 's comparable to selling turkey a large number of arms - as repeatedly happened in the past , despite its catastrophic human rights record - including battle tanks and small arms which specifically lead to breaches of human rights . "

german chancellor merkel criticized the shift in her coalition partner as a " reversion to socialism . "
" we do not need a return to socialism like the social democrats want - we had enough of that in the gdr , " said merkel , referring to communist east germany where she grew up .
spd votes to roll back reforms merkel 's conservative christian union and the spd , its traditional rival , formed a left-right coalition in november 2005 after a bitterly fought , inconclusive general election .
two years on , merkel 's alliance is riding high with about 39 percent support versus just 26 percent for the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " king kurt " ' remains the undeclared candidate for chancellor for the 2009 election kurt beck , the main architect of the shift who was reelected with a thumping majority , said the party 's revised course did not mean a break with the past but rather an attempt to " answer the questions of today and the challenges of tomorrow , " beck said .
the party 's new " hamburg program " - updating the 1989 berlin program - contains several references to the term " democratic socialism , " which has been controversial within the party over recent years .
during the congress , the spd voted to roll back some of the harsher aspects of the market reforms implemented under chancellor gerhard schröder four years ago .
delegates decided in favor of paying unemployment benefit at the full rate to older claimants for longer than previously , easing the transition to retirement at 67 for manual workers and paying child support to the age of 27 , rather than 25 .
earlier , in an unexpected move , the spd voted in favor of introducing a top speed of 130 kph -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on germany 's famed speed-limit-free autobahns , or motorways , in a bid to cut the country 's co2 emissions from cars .
" a symbolic issue " germany 's powerful car industry has pressured lawmakers not to introduce national speed limits , arguing that high speeds help them sell mercedes , porsche and bmw around the world and help protect german jobs .
however a number of studies have shown that speed limits could effectively slash polluting emissions .
environmental groups have said a speed limit would cut vehicle co2 output by 5 percent overnight and 15 percent long-term once more fuel-efficient cars were used .
at a conference on climate change in berlin last week , nobel laureate al gore criticized germany in a speech for not having motorway speed limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's speed limit-free autobahns are the envy of the world the non-binding measure however will be hard to pass into law in the face of opposition by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the spd 's coalition partner .
" it 's an important symbolic issue , " said environmental minister sigmar gabriel .
" but it will probably be hard to pass into law because we wo n't find a majority for that with -lsb- merkel 's -rsb- christian democrats . "
left-wingers try to derail privatization project the two-day party conference , which sought ways to pull the spd out of a poll slump and had been marred by a bitter row over scaling back labor market reforms , also targeted the privatization of germany 's railways , deutsche bahn , which aims to raise 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- in a 2008 initial public offering .
kurt beck managed to stave off an attempt by left-wingers in the party to torpedo the privatization project .
left-wingers had feared spd ministers would settle on an unacceptable compromise with the christian democrats to sell the deutsche bahn stake to institutional investors rather than small investors .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , tried to win support by promising to ensure controls that would prevent hedge funds from breaking up deutsche bahn .
" we 'll keep the ' locusts ' away , " he said .
ultimately the party agreed on a compromise , with left-wingers managing to insert a condition - " otherwise the spd rejects the sale of shares " - into a draft resolution on the privatization .
merkel slammed for turkey stance the conference produced another surprise when foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuked chancellor merkel for holding out the promise of eu membership to turkey for decades , contingent on reforms , but then withdrawing support .
merkel 's party favors a privileged partnership with ankara , short of membership .
" at the crucial moment they caved in , " the normally diplomatic steinmeier said .
" what can i do with a party like the conservatives that acts like that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have enjoyed a harmonious relationship in a further sign of tensions between steinmeier and merkel , who have cooperated on foreign policy for the past two years , the foreign minister criticized the chancellor 's method of talking about human rights in china and russia through the german media rather than using more effective channels .
" when we speak out for human rights it 's not just for a quick headline back home , " steinmeier said , referring to merkel 's recent focus on human rights in china and russia that has strained relations with both countries .
" no military adventures in iran " the foreign minister also voiced concern about us intentions towards iran .
" we must prevent nuclear weapons in the middle east .
but military adventures are no contribution to a solution , " steinmeier said .
" on the contrary , the daily ranting about it only makes a solution more difficult . "
but he made clear the need to keep nuclear weapons away from iran .
atomic weapons should not land " in the hands of people who deny the holocaust , " he said in a reference to controversial remarks by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
" this would destabilize the entire middle east , " he said , stressing that germany would continue to work towards a diplomatic solution along with the united states , russia and china . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

left-wingers try to derail privatization project the two-day party conference , which sought ways to pull the spd out of a poll slump and had been marred by a bitter row over scaling back labor market reforms , also targeted the privatization of germany 's railways , deutsche bahn , which aims to raise 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- in a 2008 initial public offering .
kurt beck managed to stave off an attempt by left-wingers in the party to torpedo the privatization project .
left-wingers had feared spd ministers would settle on an unacceptable compromise with the christian democrats to sell the deutsche bahn stake to institutional investors rather than small investors .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , tried to win support by promising to ensure controls that would prevent hedge funds from breaking up deutsche bahn .
" we 'll keep the ' locusts ' away , " he said .
ultimately the party agreed on a compromise , with left-wingers managing to insert a condition - " otherwise the spd rejects the sale of shares " - into a draft resolution on the privatization .
merkel slammed for turkey stance the conference produced another surprise when foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuked chancellor merkel for holding out the promise of eu membership to turkey for decades , contingent on reforms , but then withdrawing support .
merkel 's party favors a privileged partnership with ankara , short of membership .
" at the crucial moment they caved in , " the normally diplomatic steinmeier said .
" what can i do with a party like the conservatives that acts like that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have enjoyed a harmonious relationship in a further sign of tensions between steinmeier and merkel , who have cooperated on foreign policy for the past two years , the foreign minister criticized the chancellor 's method of talking about human rights in china and russia through the german media rather than using more effective channels .
" when we speak out for human rights it 's not just for a quick headline back home , " steinmeier said , referring to merkel 's recent focus on human rights in china and russia that has strained relations with both countries .
" no military adventures in iran " the foreign minister also voiced concern about us intentions towards iran .
" we must prevent nuclear weapons in the middle east .
but military adventures are no contribution to a solution , " steinmeier said .
" on the contrary , the daily ranting about it only makes a solution more difficult . "
but he made clear the need to keep nuclear weapons away from iran .
atomic weapons should not land " in the hands of people who deny the holocaust , " he said in a reference to controversial remarks by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .

28 , as delegates wound up a major congress aimed at reviving the party 's flagging fortunes ahead of the 2009 elections . the 144-year-old party approved a new basic party program for only the third time since world war ii , reasserting core social democratic values at the end of a three-day congress in hamburg that saw it take a distinct turn to the left .
" there is no humanity when our actions are not guided by solidarity , " party chairman kurt beck told more than 500 delegates gathered in hamburg on the final day of the congress .
the program received near-unanimous support .
german chancellor merkel criticized the shift in her coalition partner as a " reversion to socialism . "
" we do not need a return to socialism like the social democrats want - we had enough of that in the gdr , " said merkel , referring to communist east germany where she grew up .
spd votes to roll back reforms merkel 's conservative christian union and the spd , its traditional rival , formed a left-right coalition in november 2005 after a bitterly fought , inconclusive general election .
two years on , merkel 's alliance is riding high with about 39 percent support versus just 26 percent for the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " king kurt " ' remains the undeclared candidate for chancellor for the 2009 election kurt beck , the main architect of the shift who was reelected with a thumping majority , said the party 's revised course did not mean a break with the past but rather an attempt to " answer the questions of today and the challenges of tomorrow , " beck said .
the party 's new " hamburg program " - updating the 1989 berlin program - contains several references to the term " democratic socialism , " which has been controversial within the party over recent years .
during the congress , the spd voted to roll back some of the harsher aspects of the market reforms implemented under chancellor gerhard schröder four years ago .
delegates decided in favor of paying unemployment benefit at the full rate to older claimants for longer than previously , easing the transition to retirement at 67 for manual workers and paying child support to the age of 27 , rather than 25 .
earlier , in an unexpected move , the spd voted in favor of introducing a top speed of 130 kph -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on germany 's famed speed-limit-free autobahns , or motorways , in a bid to cut the country 's co2 emissions from cars .
" a symbolic issue " germany 's powerful car industry has pressured lawmakers not to introduce national speed limits , arguing that high speeds help them sell mercedes , porsche and bmw around the world and help protect german jobs .
however a number of studies have shown that speed limits could effectively slash polluting emissions .
environmental groups have said a speed limit would cut vehicle co2 output by 5 percent overnight and 15 percent long-term once more fuel-efficient cars were used .
at a conference on climate change in berlin last week , nobel laureate al gore criticized germany in a speech for not having motorway speed limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's speed limit-free autobahns are the envy of the world the non-binding measure however will be hard to pass into law in the face of opposition by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the spd 's coalition partner .
" it 's an important symbolic issue , " said environmental minister sigmar gabriel .
" but it will probably be hard to pass into law because we wo n't find a majority for that with -lsb- merkel 's -rsb- christian democrats . "
left-wingers try to derail privatization project the two-day party conference , which sought ways to pull the spd out of a poll slump and had been marred by a bitter row over scaling back labor market reforms , also targeted the privatization of germany 's railways , deutsche bahn , which aims to raise 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- in a 2008 initial public offering .

berlin has the last word on arms sales , and gives the go-ahead a bit too willingly , say human rights groups . an estimated 80,000 people are employed by the german arms industry , which might be far fewer than during the cold war but still counts as a thriving business .
most of the weapons and armaments manufactured are earmarked for the bundeswehr , but exports are now on the rise .
submarines and tanks " made in germany " might boast technological excellence , but the market for them is a small and highly competitive one .
although not one single german company numbers among the world 's top ten largest arms manufacturers , the country is nonetheless one of the world 's busiest arms exporters .
german-made armaments tend to be produced by medium-sized companies , but the fact they boast first-class quality guarantees them a lucrative corner of the cut-throat international market .
and in recent years , germany has managed to boost this share even further .
the business of war according to journalist thomas meuter , an expert on the german arms industry , this success is largely due to technical know-how .
" with its various products and developments , -lrb- germany -rrb- plays in the champions ' league , " says meuter .
" these products include armed vehicles and tanks , as well as technologies to protect these vehicles and soldiers . "
the leopard 2 , for example , is a german main battle tank built by the german company krauss-maffei-wegmann .
exceptionally bullet and mine-proof , it 's a bestseller with armies deployed on foreign soil .
government green light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german arms technology is top quality in this respect , major international missions such as afghanistan can mean big business for the german arms industry .
but sales are not always straightforward .
according to german basic law , all arms exports need to be approved by the government .
the lion 's share of germany 's exported armaments goes to nato partners and european countries - sales to which berlin will generally give the green light .
but when it comes to other countries , the deal has to meet certain stipulations laid out in arms export guidelines .
these criteria were last agreed by the previous government .
social democrat uta zapf has been a long-standing member of the german parliament 's defense committee and helped draft the regulations .
" one criterion concerns flashpoints , another human rights , " explains zapf .
" these two points are very decisive , and the way around them , as it were , is to cite german security interests . "
the ethics of selling arms much to the disgust of mathias john , an arms expert with amnesty international , this argument justifies the sale of german submarines to pakistan , despite current unrest and a flawed human rights record .
" making german arms technology available to a regime that breaches human rights sends a wrong signal , " he argues .
" it 's comparable to selling turkey a large number of arms - as repeatedly happened in the past , despite its catastrophic human rights record - including battle tanks and small arms which specifically lead to breaches of human rights . "
the public is seldom kept abreast of these decisions , given that the federal security council meetings to consider the export requests from arms manufacturers are top secret .
according to uta zapf , not even the german parliament is able to exert influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arms industry is small-scale than used to be , but still thriving " it would be more transparent if we were kept informed and could contribute to the decision-making process , " she says .
" but the government will not allow this , because sales requests from industry are subject to data protection and the information needs to be kept private to protect business interests .
however , other countries have found ways of dealing with these issues . "
for the time being , greater transparency remains off the cards .

berlin has the last word on arms sales , and gives the go-ahead a bit too willingly , say human rights groups . an estimated 80,000 people are employed by the german arms industry , which might be far fewer than during the cold war but still counts as a thriving business .

although not one single german company numbers among the world 's top ten largest arms manufacturers , the country is nonetheless one of the world 's busiest arms exporters .
german-made armaments tend to be produced by medium-sized companies , but the fact they boast first-class quality guarantees them a lucrative corner of the cut-throat international market .

28 , as delegates wound up a major congress aimed at reviving the party 's flagging fortunes ahead of the 2009 elections . the 144-year-old party approved a new basic party program for only the third time since world war ii , reasserting core social democratic values at the end of a three-day congress in hamburg that saw it take a distinct turn to the left .
" there is no humanity when our actions are not guided by solidarity , " party chairman kurt beck told more than 500 delegates gathered in hamburg on the final day of the congress .
the program received near-unanimous support .
german chancellor merkel criticized the shift in her coalition partner as a " reversion to socialism . "
" we do not need a return to socialism like the social democrats want - we had enough of that in the gdr , " said merkel , referring to communist east germany where she grew up .
spd votes to roll back reforms merkel 's conservative christian union and the spd , its traditional rival , formed a left-right coalition in november 2005 after a bitterly fought , inconclusive general election .
two years on , merkel 's alliance is riding high with about 39 percent support versus just 26 percent for the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " king kurt " ' remains the undeclared candidate for chancellor for the 2009 election kurt beck , the main architect of the shift who was reelected with a thumping majority , said the party 's revised course did not mean a break with the past but rather an attempt to " answer the questions of today and the challenges of tomorrow , " beck said .
the party 's new " hamburg program " - updating the 1989 berlin program - contains several references to the term " democratic socialism , " which has been controversial within the party over recent years .
during the congress , the spd voted to roll back some of the harsher aspects of the market reforms implemented under chancellor gerhard schröder four years ago .
delegates decided in favor of paying unemployment benefit at the full rate to older claimants for longer than previously , easing the transition to retirement at 67 for manual workers and paying child support to the age of 27 , rather than 25 .
earlier , in an unexpected move , the spd voted in favor of introducing a top speed of 130 kph -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on germany 's famed speed-limit-free autobahns , or motorways , in a bid to cut the country 's co2 emissions from cars .
" a symbolic issue " germany 's powerful car industry has pressured lawmakers not to introduce national speed limits , arguing that high speeds help them sell mercedes , porsche and bmw around the world and help protect german jobs .
however a number of studies have shown that speed limits could effectively slash polluting emissions .
environmental groups have said a speed limit would cut vehicle co2 output by 5 percent overnight and 15 percent long-term once more fuel-efficient cars were used .
at a conference on climate change in berlin last week , nobel laureate al gore criticized germany in a speech for not having motorway speed limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's speed limit-free autobahns are the envy of the world the non-binding measure however will be hard to pass into law in the face of opposition by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the spd 's coalition partner .
" it 's an important symbolic issue , " said environmental minister sigmar gabriel .
" but it will probably be hard to pass into law because we wo n't find a majority for that with -lsb- merkel 's -rsb- christian democrats . "
left-wingers try to derail privatization project the two-day party conference , which sought ways to pull the spd out of a poll slump and had been marred by a bitter row over scaling back labor market reforms , also targeted the privatization of germany 's railways , deutsche bahn , which aims to raise 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- in a 2008 initial public offering .
kurt beck managed to stave off an attempt by left-wingers in the party to torpedo the privatization project .
left-wingers had feared spd ministers would settle on an unacceptable compromise with the christian democrats to sell the deutsche bahn stake to institutional investors rather than small investors .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , tried to win support by promising to ensure controls that would prevent hedge funds from breaking up deutsche bahn .
" we 'll keep the ' locusts ' away , " he said .
ultimately the party agreed on a compromise , with left-wingers managing to insert a condition - " otherwise the spd rejects the sale of shares " - into a draft resolution on the privatization .
merkel slammed for turkey stance the conference produced another surprise when foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuked chancellor merkel for holding out the promise of eu membership to turkey for decades , contingent on reforms , but then withdrawing support .
merkel 's party favors a privileged partnership with ankara , short of membership .
" at the crucial moment they caved in , " the normally diplomatic steinmeier said .
" what can i do with a party like the conservatives that acts like that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have enjoyed a harmonious relationship in a further sign of tensions between steinmeier and merkel , who have cooperated on foreign policy for the past two years , the foreign minister criticized the chancellor 's method of talking about human rights in china and russia through the german media rather than using more effective channels .
" when we speak out for human rights it 's not just for a quick headline back home , " steinmeier said , referring to merkel 's recent focus on human rights in china and russia that has strained relations with both countries .
" no military adventures in iran " the foreign minister also voiced concern about us intentions towards iran .
" we must prevent nuclear weapons in the middle east .
but military adventures are no contribution to a solution , " steinmeier said .
" on the contrary , the daily ranting about it only makes a solution more difficult . "
but he made clear the need to keep nuclear weapons away from iran .
atomic weapons should not land " in the hands of people who deny the holocaust , " he said in a reference to controversial remarks by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
" this would destabilize the entire middle east , " he said , stressing that germany would continue to work towards a diplomatic solution along with the united states , russia and china . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin has the last word on arms sales , and gives the go-ahead a bit too willingly , say human rights groups . an estimated 80,000 people are employed by the german arms industry , which might be far fewer than during the cold war but still counts as a thriving business .
most of the weapons and armaments manufactured are earmarked for the bundeswehr , but exports are now on the rise .
submarines and tanks " made in germany " might boast technological excellence , but the market for them is a small and highly competitive one .
although not one single german company numbers among the world 's top ten largest arms manufacturers , the country is nonetheless one of the world 's busiest arms exporters .
german-made armaments tend to be produced by medium-sized companies , but the fact they boast first-class quality guarantees them a lucrative corner of the cut-throat international market .
and in recent years , germany has managed to boost this share even further .
the business of war according to journalist thomas meuter , an expert on the german arms industry , this success is largely due to technical know-how .
" with its various products and developments , -lrb- germany -rrb- plays in the champions ' league , " says meuter .
" these products include armed vehicles and tanks , as well as technologies to protect these vehicles and soldiers . "
the leopard 2 , for example , is a german main battle tank built by the german company krauss-maffei-wegmann .
exceptionally bullet and mine-proof , it 's a bestseller with armies deployed on foreign soil .
government green light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german arms technology is top quality in this respect , major international missions such as afghanistan can mean big business for the german arms industry .
but sales are not always straightforward .
according to german basic law , all arms exports need to be approved by the government .
the lion 's share of germany 's exported armaments goes to nato partners and european countries - sales to which berlin will generally give the green light .
but when it comes to other countries , the deal has to meet certain stipulations laid out in arms export guidelines .
these criteria were last agreed by the previous government .
social democrat uta zapf has been a long-standing member of the german parliament 's defense committee and helped draft the regulations .
" one criterion concerns flashpoints , another human rights , " explains zapf .
" these two points are very decisive , and the way around them , as it were , is to cite german security interests . "
the ethics of selling arms much to the disgust of mathias john , an arms expert with amnesty international , this argument justifies the sale of german submarines to pakistan , despite current unrest and a flawed human rights record .
" making german arms technology available to a regime that breaches human rights sends a wrong signal , " he argues .
" it 's comparable to selling turkey a large number of arms - as repeatedly happened in the past , despite its catastrophic human rights record - including battle tanks and small arms which specifically lead to breaches of human rights . "
the public is seldom kept abreast of these decisions , given that the federal security council meetings to consider the export requests from arms manufacturers are top secret .
according to uta zapf , not even the german parliament is able to exert influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arms industry is small-scale than used to be , but still thriving " it would be more transparent if we were kept informed and could contribute to the decision-making process , " she says .
" but the government will not allow this , because sales requests from industry are subject to data protection and the information needs to be kept private to protect business interests .
however , other countries have found ways of dealing with these issues . "
for the time being , greater transparency remains off the cards .
neither the government not the arms industry has a vested interest in changing the status quo .

berlin has the last word on arms sales , and gives the go-ahead a bit too willingly , say human rights groups . an estimated 80,000 people are employed by the german arms industry , which might be far fewer than during the cold war but still counts as a thriving business .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 28.10.2007 germany 's social democrats turn left to renew core principles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd members voted unanimously in favor of " democratic socialism " germany 's social democratic party reasserted its commitment to " democratic socialism " sunday , oct .
28 , as delegates wound up a major congress aimed at reviving the party 's flagging fortunes ahead of the 2009 elections . the 144-year-old party approved a new basic party program for only the third time since world war ii , reasserting core social democratic values at the end of a three-day congress in hamburg that saw it take a distinct turn to the left .
" there is no humanity when our actions are not guided by solidarity , " party chairman kurt beck told more than 500 delegates gathered in hamburg on the final day of the congress .
the program received near-unanimous support .
german chancellor merkel criticized the shift in her coalition partner as a " reversion to socialism . "
" we do not need a return to socialism like the social democrats want - we had enough of that in the gdr , " said merkel , referring to communist east germany where she grew up .
spd votes to roll back reforms merkel 's conservative christian union and the spd , its traditional rival , formed a left-right coalition in november 2005 after a bitterly fought , inconclusive general election .
two years on , merkel 's alliance is riding high with about 39 percent support versus just 26 percent for the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " king kurt " ' remains the undeclared candidate for chancellor for the 2009 election kurt beck , the main architect of the shift who was reelected with a thumping majority , said the party 's revised course did not mean a break with the past but rather an attempt to " answer the questions of today and the challenges of tomorrow , " beck said .
the party 's new " hamburg program " - updating the 1989 berlin program - contains several references to the term " democratic socialism , " which has been controversial within the party over recent years .
during the congress , the spd voted to roll back some of the harsher aspects of the market reforms implemented under chancellor gerhard schröder four years ago .
delegates decided in favor of paying unemployment benefit at the full rate to older claimants for longer than previously , easing the transition to retirement at 67 for manual workers and paying child support to the age of 27 , rather than 25 .
earlier , in an unexpected move , the spd voted in favor of introducing a top speed of 130 kph -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on germany 's famed speed-limit-free autobahns , or motorways , in a bid to cut the country 's co2 emissions from cars .
" a symbolic issue " germany 's powerful car industry has pressured lawmakers not to introduce national speed limits , arguing that high speeds help them sell mercedes , porsche and bmw around the world and help protect german jobs .
however a number of studies have shown that speed limits could effectively slash polluting emissions .
environmental groups have said a speed limit would cut vehicle co2 output by 5 percent overnight and 15 percent long-term once more fuel-efficient cars were used .
at a conference on climate change in berlin last week , nobel laureate al gore criticized germany in a speech for not having motorway speed limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's speed limit-free autobahns are the envy of the world the non-binding measure however will be hard to pass into law in the face of opposition by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the spd 's coalition partner .
" it 's an important symbolic issue , " said environmental minister sigmar gabriel .
" but it will probably be hard to pass into law because we wo n't find a majority for that with -lsb- merkel 's -rsb- christian democrats . "
left-wingers try to derail privatization project the two-day party conference , which sought ways to pull the spd out of a poll slump and had been marred by a bitter row over scaling back labor market reforms , also targeted the privatization of germany 's railways , deutsche bahn , which aims to raise 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- in a 2008 initial public offering .
kurt beck managed to stave off an attempt by left-wingers in the party to torpedo the privatization project .
left-wingers had feared spd ministers would settle on an unacceptable compromise with the christian democrats to sell the deutsche bahn stake to institutional investors rather than small investors .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , tried to win support by promising to ensure controls that would prevent hedge funds from breaking up deutsche bahn .
" we 'll keep the ' locusts ' away , " he said .
ultimately the party agreed on a compromise , with left-wingers managing to insert a condition - " otherwise the spd rejects the sale of shares " - into a draft resolution on the privatization .
merkel slammed for turkey stance the conference produced another surprise when foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuked chancellor merkel for holding out the promise of eu membership to turkey for decades , contingent on reforms , but then withdrawing support .
merkel 's party favors a privileged partnership with ankara , short of membership .
" at the crucial moment they caved in , " the normally diplomatic steinmeier said .
" what can i do with a party like the conservatives that acts like that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have enjoyed a harmonious relationship in a further sign of tensions between steinmeier and merkel , who have cooperated on foreign policy for the past two years , the foreign minister criticized the chancellor 's method of talking about human rights in china and russia through the german media rather than using more effective channels .
" when we speak out for human rights it 's not just for a quick headline back home , " steinmeier said , referring to merkel 's recent focus on human rights in china and russia that has strained relations with both countries .
" no military adventures in iran " the foreign minister also voiced concern about us intentions towards iran .
" we must prevent nuclear weapons in the middle east .
but military adventures are no contribution to a solution , " steinmeier said .
" on the contrary , the daily ranting about it only makes a solution more difficult . "
but he made clear the need to keep nuclear weapons away from iran .
atomic weapons should not land " in the hands of people who deny the holocaust , " he said in a reference to controversial remarks by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
" this would destabilize the entire middle east , " he said , stressing that germany would continue to work towards a diplomatic solution along with the united states , russia and china . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , as delegates wound up a major congress aimed at reviving the party 's flagging fortunes ahead of the 2009 elections . the 144-year-old party approved a new basic party program for only the third time since world war ii , reasserting core social democratic values at the end of a three-day congress in hamburg that saw it take a distinct turn to the left .
" there is no humanity when our actions are not guided by solidarity , " party chairman kurt beck told more than 500 delegates gathered in hamburg on the final day of the congress .
the program received near-unanimous support .
german chancellor merkel criticized the shift in her coalition partner as a " reversion to socialism . "
" we do not need a return to socialism like the social democrats want - we had enough of that in the gdr , " said merkel , referring to communist east germany where she grew up .
spd votes to roll back reforms merkel 's conservative christian union and the spd , its traditional rival , formed a left-right coalition in november 2005 after a bitterly fought , inconclusive general election .
two years on , merkel 's alliance is riding high with about 39 percent support versus just 26 percent for the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " king kurt " ' remains the undeclared candidate for chancellor for the 2009 election kurt beck , the main architect of the shift who was reelected with a thumping majority , said the party 's revised course did not mean a break with the past but rather an attempt to " answer the questions of today and the challenges of tomorrow , " beck said .
the party 's new " hamburg program " - updating the 1989 berlin program - contains several references to the term " democratic socialism , " which has been controversial within the party over recent years .
during the congress , the spd voted to roll back some of the harsher aspects of the market reforms implemented under chancellor gerhard schröder four years ago .
delegates decided in favor of paying unemployment benefit at the full rate to older claimants for longer than previously , easing the transition to retirement at 67 for manual workers and paying child support to the age of 27 , rather than 25 .
earlier , in an unexpected move , the spd voted in favor of introducing a top speed of 130 kph -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on germany 's famed speed-limit-free autobahns , or motorways , in a bid to cut the country 's co2 emissions from cars .
" a symbolic issue " germany 's powerful car industry has pressured lawmakers not to introduce national speed limits , arguing that high speeds help them sell mercedes , porsche and bmw around the world and help protect german jobs .
however a number of studies have shown that speed limits could effectively slash polluting emissions .
environmental groups have said a speed limit would cut vehicle co2 output by 5 percent overnight and 15 percent long-term once more fuel-efficient cars were used .
at a conference on climate change in berlin last week , nobel laureate al gore criticized germany in a speech for not having motorway speed limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's speed limit-free autobahns are the envy of the world the non-binding measure however will be hard to pass into law in the face of opposition by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the spd 's coalition partner .
" it 's an important symbolic issue , " said environmental minister sigmar gabriel .
" but it will probably be hard to pass into law because we wo n't find a majority for that with -lsb- merkel 's -rsb- christian democrats . "
left-wingers try to derail privatization project the two-day party conference , which sought ways to pull the spd out of a poll slump and had been marred by a bitter row over scaling back labor market reforms , also targeted the privatization of germany 's railways , deutsche bahn , which aims to raise 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- in a 2008 initial public offering .
kurt beck managed to stave off an attempt by left-wingers in the party to torpedo the privatization project .
left-wingers had feared spd ministers would settle on an unacceptable compromise with the christian democrats to sell the deutsche bahn stake to institutional investors rather than small investors .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , tried to win support by promising to ensure controls that would prevent hedge funds from breaking up deutsche bahn .
" we 'll keep the ' locusts ' away , " he said .
ultimately the party agreed on a compromise , with left-wingers managing to insert a condition - " otherwise the spd rejects the sale of shares " - into a draft resolution on the privatization .
merkel slammed for turkey stance the conference produced another surprise when foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuked chancellor merkel for holding out the promise of eu membership to turkey for decades , contingent on reforms , but then withdrawing support .
merkel 's party favors a privileged partnership with ankara , short of membership .
" at the crucial moment they caved in , " the normally diplomatic steinmeier said .
" what can i do with a party like the conservatives that acts like that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have enjoyed a harmonious relationship in a further sign of tensions between steinmeier and merkel , who have cooperated on foreign policy for the past two years , the foreign minister criticized the chancellor 's method of talking about human rights in china and russia through the german media rather than using more effective channels .
" when we speak out for human rights it 's not just for a quick headline back home , " steinmeier said , referring to merkel 's recent focus on human rights in china and russia that has strained relations with both countries .
" no military adventures in iran " the foreign minister also voiced concern about us intentions towards iran .
" we must prevent nuclear weapons in the middle east .
but military adventures are no contribution to a solution , " steinmeier said .
" on the contrary , the daily ranting about it only makes a solution more difficult . "
but he made clear the need to keep nuclear weapons away from iran .
atomic weapons should not land " in the hands of people who deny the holocaust , " he said in a reference to controversial remarks by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
" this would destabilize the entire middle east , " he said , stressing that germany would continue to work towards a diplomatic solution along with the united states , russia and china . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin has the last word on arms sales , and gives the go-ahead a bit too willingly , say human rights groups . an estimated 80,000 people are employed by the german arms industry , which might be far fewer than during the cold war but still counts as a thriving business .
most of the weapons and armaments manufactured are earmarked for the bundeswehr , but exports are now on the rise .
submarines and tanks " made in germany " might boast technological excellence , but the market for them is a small and highly competitive one .
although not one single german company numbers among the world 's top ten largest arms manufacturers , the country is nonetheless one of the world 's busiest arms exporters .
german-made armaments tend to be produced by medium-sized companies , but the fact they boast first-class quality guarantees them a lucrative corner of the cut-throat international market .
and in recent years , germany has managed to boost this share even further .
the business of war according to journalist thomas meuter , an expert on the german arms industry , this success is largely due to technical know-how .
" with its various products and developments , -lrb- germany -rrb- plays in the champions ' league , " says meuter .
" these products include armed vehicles and tanks , as well as technologies to protect these vehicles and soldiers . "
the leopard 2 , for example , is a german main battle tank built by the german company krauss-maffei-wegmann .
exceptionally bullet and mine-proof , it 's a bestseller with armies deployed on foreign soil .
government green light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german arms technology is top quality in this respect , major international missions such as afghanistan can mean big business for the german arms industry .
but sales are not always straightforward .
according to german basic law , all arms exports need to be approved by the government .
the lion 's share of germany 's exported armaments goes to nato partners and european countries - sales to which berlin will generally give the green light .
but when it comes to other countries , the deal has to meet certain stipulations laid out in arms export guidelines .
these criteria were last agreed by the previous government .
social democrat uta zapf has been a long-standing member of the german parliament 's defense committee and helped draft the regulations .
" one criterion concerns flashpoints , another human rights , " explains zapf .
" these two points are very decisive , and the way around them , as it were , is to cite german security interests . "
the ethics of selling arms much to the disgust of mathias john , an arms expert with amnesty international , this argument justifies the sale of german submarines to pakistan , despite current unrest and a flawed human rights record .
" making german arms technology available to a regime that breaches human rights sends a wrong signal , " he argues .
" it 's comparable to selling turkey a large number of arms - as repeatedly happened in the past , despite its catastrophic human rights record - including battle tanks and small arms which specifically lead to breaches of human rights . "
the public is seldom kept abreast of these decisions , given that the federal security council meetings to consider the export requests from arms manufacturers are top secret .
according to uta zapf , not even the german parliament is able to exert influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arms industry is small-scale than used to be , but still thriving " it would be more transparent if we were kept informed and could contribute to the decision-making process , " she says .
" but the government will not allow this , because sales requests from industry are subject to data protection and the information needs to be kept private to protect business interests .
however , other countries have found ways of dealing with these issues . "
for the time being , greater transparency remains off the cards .

berlin has the last word on arms sales , and gives the go-ahead a bit too willingly , say human rights groups . an estimated 80,000 people are employed by the german arms industry , which might be far fewer than during the cold war but still counts as a thriving business .
most of the weapons and armaments manufactured are earmarked for the bundeswehr , but exports are now on the rise .
submarines and tanks " made in germany " might boast technological excellence , but the market for them is a small and highly competitive one .
although not one single german company numbers among the world 's top ten largest arms manufacturers , the country is nonetheless one of the world 's busiest arms exporters .
german-made armaments tend to be produced by medium-sized companies , but the fact they boast first-class quality guarantees them a lucrative corner of the cut-throat international market .
and in recent years , germany has managed to boost this share even further .
the business of war according to journalist thomas meuter , an expert on the german arms industry , this success is largely due to technical know-how .
" with its various products and developments , -lrb- germany -rrb- plays in the champions ' league , " says meuter .
" these products include armed vehicles and tanks , as well as technologies to protect these vehicles and soldiers . "
the leopard 2 , for example , is a german main battle tank built by the german company krauss-maffei-wegmann .
exceptionally bullet and mine-proof , it 's a bestseller with armies deployed on foreign soil .

but sales are not always straightforward .
according to german basic law , all arms exports need to be approved by the government .
the lion 's share of germany 's exported armaments goes to nato partners and european countries - sales to which berlin will generally give the green light .
but when it comes to other countries , the deal has to meet certain stipulations laid out in arms export guidelines .
these criteria were last agreed by the previous government .
social democrat uta zapf has been a long-standing member of the german parliament 's defense committee and helped draft the regulations .
" one criterion concerns flashpoints , another human rights , " explains zapf .
" these two points are very decisive , and the way around them , as it were , is to cite german security interests . "
the ethics of selling arms much to the disgust of mathias john , an arms expert with amnesty international , this argument justifies the sale of german submarines to pakistan , despite current unrest and a flawed human rights record .
" making german arms technology available to a regime that breaches human rights sends a wrong signal , " he argues .
" it 's comparable to selling turkey a large number of arms - as repeatedly happened in the past , despite its catastrophic human rights record - including battle tanks and small arms which specifically lead to breaches of human rights . "
the public is seldom kept abreast of these decisions , given that the federal security council meetings to consider the export requests from arms manufacturers are top secret .
according to uta zapf , not even the german parliament is able to exert influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arms industry is small-scale than used to be , but still thriving " it would be more transparent if we were kept informed and could contribute to the decision-making process , " she says .
" but the government will not allow this , because sales requests from industry are subject to data protection and the information needs to be kept private to protect business interests .
however , other countries have found ways of dealing with these issues . "
for the time being , greater transparency remains off the cards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 28.10.2007 germany 's social democrats turn left to renew core principles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd members voted unanimously in favor of " democratic socialism " germany 's social democratic party reasserted its commitment to " democratic socialism " sunday , oct .
28 , as delegates wound up a major congress aimed at reviving the party 's flagging fortunes ahead of the 2009 elections . the 144-year-old party approved a new basic party program for only the third time since world war ii , reasserting core social democratic values at the end of a three-day congress in hamburg that saw it take a distinct turn to the left .
" there is no humanity when our actions are not guided by solidarity , " party chairman kurt beck told more than 500 delegates gathered in hamburg on the final day of the congress .
the program received near-unanimous support .
german chancellor merkel criticized the shift in her coalition partner as a " reversion to socialism . "
" we do not need a return to socialism like the social democrats want - we had enough of that in the gdr , " said merkel , referring to communist east germany where she grew up .
spd votes to roll back reforms merkel 's conservative christian union and the spd , its traditional rival , formed a left-right coalition in november 2005 after a bitterly fought , inconclusive general election .
two years on , merkel 's alliance is riding high with about 39 percent support versus just 26 percent for the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " king kurt " ' remains the undeclared candidate for chancellor for the 2009 election kurt beck , the main architect of the shift who was reelected with a thumping majority , said the party 's revised course did not mean a break with the past but rather an attempt to " answer the questions of today and the challenges of tomorrow , " beck said .
the party 's new " hamburg program " - updating the 1989 berlin program - contains several references to the term " democratic socialism , " which has been controversial within the party over recent years .
during the congress , the spd voted to roll back some of the harsher aspects of the market reforms implemented under chancellor gerhard schröder four years ago .
delegates decided in favor of paying unemployment benefit at the full rate to older claimants for longer than previously , easing the transition to retirement at 67 for manual workers and paying child support to the age of 27 , rather than 25 .
earlier , in an unexpected move , the spd voted in favor of introducing a top speed of 130 kph -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on germany 's famed speed-limit-free autobahns , or motorways , in a bid to cut the country 's co2 emissions from cars .
" a symbolic issue " germany 's powerful car industry has pressured lawmakers not to introduce national speed limits , arguing that high speeds help them sell mercedes , porsche and bmw around the world and help protect german jobs .
however a number of studies have shown that speed limits could effectively slash polluting emissions .
environmental groups have said a speed limit would cut vehicle co2 output by 5 percent overnight and 15 percent long-term once more fuel-efficient cars were used .
at a conference on climate change in berlin last week , nobel laureate al gore criticized germany in a speech for not having motorway speed limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's speed limit-free autobahns are the envy of the world the non-binding measure however will be hard to pass into law in the face of opposition by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the spd 's coalition partner .
" it 's an important symbolic issue , " said environmental minister sigmar gabriel .
" but it will probably be hard to pass into law because we wo n't find a majority for that with -lsb- merkel 's -rsb- christian democrats . "
left-wingers try to derail privatization project the two-day party conference , which sought ways to pull the spd out of a poll slump and had been marred by a bitter row over scaling back labor market reforms , also targeted the privatization of germany 's railways , deutsche bahn , which aims to raise 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- in a 2008 initial public offering .
kurt beck managed to stave off an attempt by left-wingers in the party to torpedo the privatization project .
left-wingers had feared spd ministers would settle on an unacceptable compromise with the christian democrats to sell the deutsche bahn stake to institutional investors rather than small investors .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , tried to win support by promising to ensure controls that would prevent hedge funds from breaking up deutsche bahn .
" we 'll keep the ' locusts ' away , " he said .
ultimately the party agreed on a compromise , with left-wingers managing to insert a condition - " otherwise the spd rejects the sale of shares " - into a draft resolution on the privatization .
merkel slammed for turkey stance the conference produced another surprise when foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuked chancellor merkel for holding out the promise of eu membership to turkey for decades , contingent on reforms , but then withdrawing support .
merkel 's party favors a privileged partnership with ankara , short of membership .
" at the crucial moment they caved in , " the normally diplomatic steinmeier said .
" what can i do with a party like the conservatives that acts like that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have enjoyed a harmonious relationship in a further sign of tensions between steinmeier and merkel , who have cooperated on foreign policy for the past two years , the foreign minister criticized the chancellor 's method of talking about human rights in china and russia through the german media rather than using more effective channels .
" when we speak out for human rights it 's not just for a quick headline back home , " steinmeier said , referring to merkel 's recent focus on human rights in china and russia that has strained relations with both countries .
" no military adventures in iran " the foreign minister also voiced concern about us intentions towards iran .
" we must prevent nuclear weapons in the middle east .
but military adventures are no contribution to a solution , " steinmeier said .
" on the contrary , the daily ranting about it only makes a solution more difficult . "
but he made clear the need to keep nuclear weapons away from iran .
atomic weapons should not land " in the hands of people who deny the holocaust , " he said in a reference to controversial remarks by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
" this would destabilize the entire middle east , " he said , stressing that germany would continue to work towards a diplomatic solution along with the united states , russia and china . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , as delegates wound up a major congress aimed at reviving the party 's flagging fortunes ahead of the 2009 elections . the 144-year-old party approved a new basic party program for only the third time since world war ii , reasserting core social democratic values at the end of a three-day congress in hamburg that saw it take a distinct turn to the left .
" there is no humanity when our actions are not guided by solidarity , " party chairman kurt beck told more than 500 delegates gathered in hamburg on the final day of the congress .
the program received near-unanimous support .
german chancellor merkel criticized the shift in her coalition partner as a " reversion to socialism . "
" we do not need a return to socialism like the social democrats want - we had enough of that in the gdr , " said merkel , referring to communist east germany where she grew up .
spd votes to roll back reforms merkel 's conservative christian union and the spd , its traditional rival , formed a left-right coalition in november 2005 after a bitterly fought , inconclusive general election .
two years on , merkel 's alliance is riding high with about 39 percent support versus just 26 percent for the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " king kurt " ' remains the undeclared candidate for chancellor for the 2009 election kurt beck , the main architect of the shift who was reelected with a thumping majority , said the party 's revised course did not mean a break with the past but rather an attempt to " answer the questions of today and the challenges of tomorrow , " beck said .
the party 's new " hamburg program " - updating the 1989 berlin program - contains several references to the term " democratic socialism , " which has been controversial within the party over recent years .
during the congress , the spd voted to roll back some of the harsher aspects of the market reforms implemented under chancellor gerhard schröder four years ago .
delegates decided in favor of paying unemployment benefit at the full rate to older claimants for longer than previously , easing the transition to retirement at 67 for manual workers and paying child support to the age of 27 , rather than 25 .
earlier , in an unexpected move , the spd voted in favor of introducing a top speed of 130 kph -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on germany 's famed speed-limit-free autobahns , or motorways , in a bid to cut the country 's co2 emissions from cars .
" a symbolic issue " germany 's powerful car industry has pressured lawmakers not to introduce national speed limits , arguing that high speeds help them sell mercedes , porsche and bmw around the world and help protect german jobs .
however a number of studies have shown that speed limits could effectively slash polluting emissions .
environmental groups have said a speed limit would cut vehicle co2 output by 5 percent overnight and 15 percent long-term once more fuel-efficient cars were used .
at a conference on climate change in berlin last week , nobel laureate al gore criticized germany in a speech for not having motorway speed limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's speed limit-free autobahns are the envy of the world the non-binding measure however will be hard to pass into law in the face of opposition by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the spd 's coalition partner .
" it 's an important symbolic issue , " said environmental minister sigmar gabriel .
" but it will probably be hard to pass into law because we wo n't find a majority for that with -lsb- merkel 's -rsb- christian democrats . "
left-wingers try to derail privatization project the two-day party conference , which sought ways to pull the spd out of a poll slump and had been marred by a bitter row over scaling back labor market reforms , also targeted the privatization of germany 's railways , deutsche bahn , which aims to raise 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- in a 2008 initial public offering .
kurt beck managed to stave off an attempt by left-wingers in the party to torpedo the privatization project .
left-wingers had feared spd ministers would settle on an unacceptable compromise with the christian democrats to sell the deutsche bahn stake to institutional investors rather than small investors .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , tried to win support by promising to ensure controls that would prevent hedge funds from breaking up deutsche bahn .
" we 'll keep the ' locusts ' away , " he said .
ultimately the party agreed on a compromise , with left-wingers managing to insert a condition - " otherwise the spd rejects the sale of shares " - into a draft resolution on the privatization .
merkel slammed for turkey stance the conference produced another surprise when foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuked chancellor merkel for holding out the promise of eu membership to turkey for decades , contingent on reforms , but then withdrawing support .
merkel 's party favors a privileged partnership with ankara , short of membership .
" at the crucial moment they caved in , " the normally diplomatic steinmeier said .
" what can i do with a party like the conservatives that acts like that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have enjoyed a harmonious relationship in a further sign of tensions between steinmeier and merkel , who have cooperated on foreign policy for the past two years , the foreign minister criticized the chancellor 's method of talking about human rights in china and russia through the german media rather than using more effective channels .
" when we speak out for human rights it 's not just for a quick headline back home , " steinmeier said , referring to merkel 's recent focus on human rights in china and russia that has strained relations with both countries .
" no military adventures in iran " the foreign minister also voiced concern about us intentions towards iran .

berlin has the last word on arms sales , and gives the go-ahead a bit too willingly , say human rights groups . an estimated 80,000 people are employed by the german arms industry , which might be far fewer than during the cold war but still counts as a thriving business .
most of the weapons and armaments manufactured are earmarked for the bundeswehr , but exports are now on the rise .
submarines and tanks " made in germany " might boast technological excellence , but the market for them is a small and highly competitive one .
although not one single german company numbers among the world 's top ten largest arms manufacturers , the country is nonetheless one of the world 's busiest arms exporters .
german-made armaments tend to be produced by medium-sized companies , but the fact they boast first-class quality guarantees them a lucrative corner of the cut-throat international market .
and in recent years , germany has managed to boost this share even further .
the business of war according to journalist thomas meuter , an expert on the german arms industry , this success is largely due to technical know-how .
" with its various products and developments , -lrb- germany -rrb- plays in the champions ' league , " says meuter .
" these products include armed vehicles and tanks , as well as technologies to protect these vehicles and soldiers . "
the leopard 2 , for example , is a german main battle tank built by the german company krauss-maffei-wegmann .
exceptionally bullet and mine-proof , it 's a bestseller with armies deployed on foreign soil .
government green light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german arms technology is top quality in this respect , major international missions such as afghanistan can mean big business for the german arms industry .
but sales are not always straightforward .
according to german basic law , all arms exports need to be approved by the government .
the lion 's share of germany 's exported armaments goes to nato partners and european countries - sales to which berlin will generally give the green light .
but when it comes to other countries , the deal has to meet certain stipulations laid out in arms export guidelines .
these criteria were last agreed by the previous government .
social democrat uta zapf has been a long-standing member of the german parliament 's defense committee and helped draft the regulations .
" one criterion concerns flashpoints , another human rights , " explains zapf .
" these two points are very decisive , and the way around them , as it were , is to cite german security interests . "
the ethics of selling arms much to the disgust of mathias john , an arms expert with amnesty international , this argument justifies the sale of german submarines to pakistan , despite current unrest and a flawed human rights record .
" making german arms technology available to a regime that breaches human rights sends a wrong signal , " he argues .
" it 's comparable to selling turkey a large number of arms - as repeatedly happened in the past , despite its catastrophic human rights record - including battle tanks and small arms which specifically lead to breaches of human rights . "
the public is seldom kept abreast of these decisions , given that the federal security council meetings to consider the export requests from arms manufacturers are top secret .
according to uta zapf , not even the german parliament is able to exert influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arms industry is small-scale than used to be , but still thriving " it would be more transparent if we were kept informed and could contribute to the decision-making process , " she says .
" but the government will not allow this , because sales requests from industry are subject to data protection and the information needs to be kept private to protect business interests .
however , other countries have found ways of dealing with these issues . "
for the time being , greater transparency remains off the cards .
neither the government not the arms industry has a vested interest in changing the status quo .
instead , the public has to rely for this kind of information on the annual arms export report - but is still waiting for publication of the 2006 file . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin has the last word on arms sales , and gives the go-ahead a bit too willingly , say human rights groups . an estimated 80,000 people are employed by the german arms industry , which might be far fewer than during the cold war but still counts as a thriving business .

german-made armaments tend to be produced by medium-sized companies , but the fact they boast first-class quality guarantees them a lucrative corner of the cut-throat international market .

berlin has the last word on arms sales , and gives the go-ahead a bit too willingly , say human rights groups . an estimated 80,000 people are employed by the german arms industry , which might be far fewer than during the cold war but still counts as a thriving business .
most of the weapons and armaments manufactured are earmarked for the bundeswehr , but exports are now on the rise .
submarines and tanks " made in germany " might boast technological excellence , but the market for them is a small and highly competitive one .
although not one single german company numbers among the world 's top ten largest arms manufacturers , the country is nonetheless one of the world 's busiest arms exporters .
german-made armaments tend to be produced by medium-sized companies , but the fact they boast first-class quality guarantees them a lucrative corner of the cut-throat international market .
and in recent years , germany has managed to boost this share even further .
the business of war according to journalist thomas meuter , an expert on the german arms industry , this success is largely due to technical know-how .
" with its various products and developments , -lrb- germany -rrb- plays in the champions ' league , " says meuter .
" these products include armed vehicles and tanks , as well as technologies to protect these vehicles and soldiers . "
the leopard 2 , for example , is a german main battle tank built by the german company krauss-maffei-wegmann .
exceptionally bullet and mine-proof , it 's a bestseller with armies deployed on foreign soil .
government green light bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german arms technology is top quality in this respect , major international missions such as afghanistan can mean big business for the german arms industry .
but sales are not always straightforward .
according to german basic law , all arms exports need to be approved by the government .
the lion 's share of germany 's exported armaments goes to nato partners and european countries - sales to which berlin will generally give the green light .
but when it comes to other countries , the deal has to meet certain stipulations laid out in arms export guidelines .
these criteria were last agreed by the previous government .
social democrat uta zapf has been a long-standing member of the german parliament 's defense committee and helped draft the regulations .
" one criterion concerns flashpoints , another human rights , " explains zapf .
" these two points are very decisive , and the way around them , as it were , is to cite german security interests . "
the ethics of selling arms much to the disgust of mathias john , an arms expert with amnesty international , this argument justifies the sale of german submarines to pakistan , despite current unrest and a flawed human rights record .
" making german arms technology available to a regime that breaches human rights sends a wrong signal , " he argues .
" it 's comparable to selling turkey a large number of arms - as repeatedly happened in the past , despite its catastrophic human rights record - including battle tanks and small arms which specifically lead to breaches of human rights . "
the public is seldom kept abreast of these decisions , given that the federal security council meetings to consider the export requests from arms manufacturers are top secret .
according to uta zapf , not even the german parliament is able to exert influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arms industry is small-scale than used to be , but still thriving " it would be more transparent if we were kept informed and could contribute to the decision-making process , " she says .
" but the government will not allow this , because sales requests from industry are subject to data protection and the information needs to be kept private to protect business interests .
however , other countries have found ways of dealing with these issues . "
for the time being , greater transparency remains off the cards .
neither the government not the arms industry has a vested interest in changing the status quo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 28.10.2007 germany 's social democrats turn left to renew core principles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd members voted unanimously in favor of " democratic socialism " germany 's social democratic party reasserted its commitment to " democratic socialism " sunday , oct .
28 , as delegates wound up a major congress aimed at reviving the party 's flagging fortunes ahead of the 2009 elections . the 144-year-old party approved a new basic party program for only the third time since world war ii , reasserting core social democratic values at the end of a three-day congress in hamburg that saw it take a distinct turn to the left .
" there is no humanity when our actions are not guided by solidarity , " party chairman kurt beck told more than 500 delegates gathered in hamburg on the final day of the congress .
the program received near-unanimous support .
german chancellor merkel criticized the shift in her coalition partner as a " reversion to socialism . "
" we do not need a return to socialism like the social democrats want - we had enough of that in the gdr , " said merkel , referring to communist east germany where she grew up .
spd votes to roll back reforms merkel 's conservative christian union and the spd , its traditional rival , formed a left-right coalition in november 2005 after a bitterly fought , inconclusive general election .
two years on , merkel 's alliance is riding high with about 39 percent support versus just 26 percent for the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " king kurt " ' remains the undeclared candidate for chancellor for the 2009 election kurt beck , the main architect of the shift who was reelected with a thumping majority , said the party 's revised course did not mean a break with the past but rather an attempt to " answer the questions of today and the challenges of tomorrow , " beck said .
the party 's new " hamburg program " - updating the 1989 berlin program - contains several references to the term " democratic socialism , " which has been controversial within the party over recent years .
during the congress , the spd voted to roll back some of the harsher aspects of the market reforms implemented under chancellor gerhard schröder four years ago .
delegates decided in favor of paying unemployment benefit at the full rate to older claimants for longer than previously , easing the transition to retirement at 67 for manual workers and paying child support to the age of 27 , rather than 25 .
earlier , in an unexpected move , the spd voted in favor of introducing a top speed of 130 kph -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on germany 's famed speed-limit-free autobahns , or motorways , in a bid to cut the country 's co2 emissions from cars .
" a symbolic issue " germany 's powerful car industry has pressured lawmakers not to introduce national speed limits , arguing that high speeds help them sell mercedes , porsche and bmw around the world and help protect german jobs .
however a number of studies have shown that speed limits could effectively slash polluting emissions .
environmental groups have said a speed limit would cut vehicle co2 output by 5 percent overnight and 15 percent long-term once more fuel-efficient cars were used .
at a conference on climate change in berlin last week , nobel laureate al gore criticized germany in a speech for not having motorway speed limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's speed limit-free autobahns are the envy of the world the non-binding measure however will be hard to pass into law in the face of opposition by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the spd 's coalition partner .
" it 's an important symbolic issue , " said environmental minister sigmar gabriel .
" but it will probably be hard to pass into law because we wo n't find a majority for that with -lsb- merkel 's -rsb- christian democrats . "
left-wingers try to derail privatization project the two-day party conference , which sought ways to pull the spd out of a poll slump and had been marred by a bitter row over scaling back labor market reforms , also targeted the privatization of germany 's railways , deutsche bahn , which aims to raise 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- in a 2008 initial public offering .
kurt beck managed to stave off an attempt by left-wingers in the party to torpedo the privatization project .
left-wingers had feared spd ministers would settle on an unacceptable compromise with the christian democrats to sell the deutsche bahn stake to institutional investors rather than small investors .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , tried to win support by promising to ensure controls that would prevent hedge funds from breaking up deutsche bahn .
" we 'll keep the ' locusts ' away , " he said .
ultimately the party agreed on a compromise , with left-wingers managing to insert a condition - " otherwise the spd rejects the sale of shares " - into a draft resolution on the privatization .
merkel slammed for turkey stance the conference produced another surprise when foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuked chancellor merkel for holding out the promise of eu membership to turkey for decades , contingent on reforms , but then withdrawing support .
merkel 's party favors a privileged partnership with ankara , short of membership .
" at the crucial moment they caved in , " the normally diplomatic steinmeier said .
" what can i do with a party like the conservatives that acts like that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have enjoyed a harmonious relationship in a further sign of tensions between steinmeier and merkel , who have cooperated on foreign policy for the past two years , the foreign minister criticized the chancellor 's method of talking about human rights in china and russia through the german media rather than using more effective channels .
" when we speak out for human rights it 's not just for a quick headline back home , " steinmeier said , referring to merkel 's recent focus on human rights in china and russia that has strained relations with both countries .
" no military adventures in iran " the foreign minister also voiced concern about us intentions towards iran .
" we must prevent nuclear weapons in the middle east .
but military adventures are no contribution to a solution , " steinmeier said .
" on the contrary , the daily ranting about it only makes a solution more difficult . "
but he made clear the need to keep nuclear weapons away from iran .
atomic weapons should not land " in the hands of people who deny the holocaust , " he said in a reference to controversial remarks by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
" this would destabilize the entire middle east , " he said , stressing that germany would continue to work towards a diplomatic solution along with the united states , russia and china . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 28.10.2007 germany 's social democrats turn left to renew core principles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd members voted unanimously in favor of " democratic socialism " germany 's social democratic party reasserted its commitment to " democratic socialism " sunday , oct .
28 , as delegates wound up a major congress aimed at reviving the party 's flagging fortunes ahead of the 2009 elections . the 144-year-old party approved a new basic party program for only the third time since world war ii , reasserting core social democratic values at the end of a three-day congress in hamburg that saw it take a distinct turn to the left .
" there is no humanity when our actions are not guided by solidarity , " party chairman kurt beck told more than 500 delegates gathered in hamburg on the final day of the congress .
the program received near-unanimous support .
german chancellor merkel criticized the shift in her coalition partner as a " reversion to socialism . "
" we do not need a return to socialism like the social democrats want - we had enough of that in the gdr , " said merkel , referring to communist east germany where she grew up .
spd votes to roll back reforms merkel 's conservative christian union and the spd , its traditional rival , formed a left-right coalition in november 2005 after a bitterly fought , inconclusive general election .
two years on , merkel 's alliance is riding high with about 39 percent support versus just 26 percent for the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " king kurt " ' remains the undeclared candidate for chancellor for the 2009 election kurt beck , the main architect of the shift who was reelected with a thumping majority , said the party 's revised course did not mean a break with the past but rather an attempt to " answer the questions of today and the challenges of tomorrow , " beck said .
the party 's new " hamburg program " - updating the 1989 berlin program - contains several references to the term " democratic socialism , " which has been controversial within the party over recent years .
during the congress , the spd voted to roll back some of the harsher aspects of the market reforms implemented under chancellor gerhard schröder four years ago .
delegates decided in favor of paying unemployment benefit at the full rate to older claimants for longer than previously , easing the transition to retirement at 67 for manual workers and paying child support to the age of 27 , rather than 25 .
earlier , in an unexpected move , the spd voted in favor of introducing a top speed of 130 kph -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on germany 's famed speed-limit-free autobahns , or motorways , in a bid to cut the country 's co2 emissions from cars .
" a symbolic issue " germany 's powerful car industry has pressured lawmakers not to introduce national speed limits , arguing that high speeds help them sell mercedes , porsche and bmw around the world and help protect german jobs .
however a number of studies have shown that speed limits could effectively slash polluting emissions .
environmental groups have said a speed limit would cut vehicle co2 output by 5 percent overnight and 15 percent long-term once more fuel-efficient cars were used .
at a conference on climate change in berlin last week , nobel laureate al gore criticized germany in a speech for not having motorway speed limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's speed limit-free autobahns are the envy of the world the non-binding measure however will be hard to pass into law in the face of opposition by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the spd 's coalition partner .
" it 's an important symbolic issue , " said environmental minister sigmar gabriel .
" but it will probably be hard to pass into law because we wo n't find a majority for that with -lsb- merkel 's -rsb- christian democrats . "
left-wingers try to derail privatization project the two-day party conference , which sought ways to pull the spd out of a poll slump and had been marred by a bitter row over scaling back labor market reforms , also targeted the privatization of germany 's railways , deutsche bahn , which aims to raise 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- in a 2008 initial public offering .
kurt beck managed to stave off an attempt by left-wingers in the party to torpedo the privatization project .
left-wingers had feared spd ministers would settle on an unacceptable compromise with the christian democrats to sell the deutsche bahn stake to institutional investors rather than small investors .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , tried to win support by promising to ensure controls that would prevent hedge funds from breaking up deutsche bahn .
" we 'll keep the ' locusts ' away , " he said .
ultimately the party agreed on a compromise , with left-wingers managing to insert a condition - " otherwise the spd rejects the sale of shares " - into a draft resolution on the privatization .
merkel slammed for turkey stance the conference produced another surprise when foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuked chancellor merkel for holding out the promise of eu membership to turkey for decades , contingent on reforms , but then withdrawing support .
merkel 's party favors a privileged partnership with ankara , short of membership .
" at the crucial moment they caved in , " the normally diplomatic steinmeier said .
" what can i do with a party like the conservatives that acts like that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have enjoyed a harmonious relationship in a further sign of tensions between steinmeier and merkel , who have cooperated on foreign policy for the past two years , the foreign minister criticized the chancellor 's method of talking about human rights in china and russia through the german media rather than using more effective channels .
" when we speak out for human rights it 's not just for a quick headline back home , " steinmeier said , referring to merkel 's recent focus on human rights in china and russia that has strained relations with both countries .
" no military adventures in iran " the foreign minister also voiced concern about us intentions towards iran .
" we must prevent nuclear weapons in the middle east .
but military adventures are no contribution to a solution , " steinmeier said .
" on the contrary , the daily ranting about it only makes a solution more difficult . "
but he made clear the need to keep nuclear weapons away from iran .
atomic weapons should not land " in the hands of people who deny the holocaust , " he said in a reference to controversial remarks by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
" this would destabilize the entire middle east , " he said , stressing that germany would continue to work towards a diplomatic solution along with the united states , russia and china . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , as delegates wound up a major congress aimed at reviving the party 's flagging fortunes ahead of the 2009 elections . the 144-year-old party approved a new basic party program for only the third time since world war ii , reasserting core social democratic values at the end of a three-day congress in hamburg that saw it take a distinct turn to the left .
" there is no humanity when our actions are not guided by solidarity , " party chairman kurt beck told more than 500 delegates gathered in hamburg on the final day of the congress .
the program received near-unanimous support .
german chancellor merkel criticized the shift in her coalition partner as a " reversion to socialism . "
" we do not need a return to socialism like the social democrats want - we had enough of that in the gdr , " said merkel , referring to communist east germany where she grew up .
spd votes to roll back reforms merkel 's conservative christian union and the spd , its traditional rival , formed a left-right coalition in november 2005 after a bitterly fought , inconclusive general election .
two years on , merkel 's alliance is riding high with about 39 percent support versus just 26 percent for the spd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " king kurt " ' remains the undeclared candidate for chancellor for the 2009 election kurt beck , the main architect of the shift who was reelected with a thumping majority , said the party 's revised course did not mean a break with the past but rather an attempt to " answer the questions of today and the challenges of tomorrow , " beck said .
the party 's new " hamburg program " - updating the 1989 berlin program - contains several references to the term " democratic socialism , " which has been controversial within the party over recent years .
during the congress , the spd voted to roll back some of the harsher aspects of the market reforms implemented under chancellor gerhard schröder four years ago .
delegates decided in favor of paying unemployment benefit at the full rate to older claimants for longer than previously , easing the transition to retirement at 67 for manual workers and paying child support to the age of 27 , rather than 25 .
earlier , in an unexpected move , the spd voted in favor of introducing a top speed of 130 kph -lrb- 80 mph -rrb- on germany 's famed speed-limit-free autobahns , or motorways , in a bid to cut the country 's co2 emissions from cars .
" a symbolic issue " germany 's powerful car industry has pressured lawmakers not to introduce national speed limits , arguing that high speeds help them sell mercedes , porsche and bmw around the world and help protect german jobs .
however a number of studies have shown that speed limits could effectively slash polluting emissions .
environmental groups have said a speed limit would cut vehicle co2 output by 5 percent overnight and 15 percent long-term once more fuel-efficient cars were used .
at a conference on climate change in berlin last week , nobel laureate al gore criticized germany in a speech for not having motorway speed limits .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's speed limit-free autobahns are the envy of the world the non-binding measure however will be hard to pass into law in the face of opposition by chancellor merkel 's center-right christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the spd 's coalition partner .
" it 's an important symbolic issue , " said environmental minister sigmar gabriel .
" but it will probably be hard to pass into law because we wo n't find a majority for that with -lsb- merkel 's -rsb- christian democrats . "
left-wingers try to derail privatization project the two-day party conference , which sought ways to pull the spd out of a poll slump and had been marred by a bitter row over scaling back labor market reforms , also targeted the privatization of germany 's railways , deutsche bahn , which aims to raise 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- in a 2008 initial public offering .
kurt beck managed to stave off an attempt by left-wingers in the party to torpedo the privatization project .
left-wingers had feared spd ministers would settle on an unacceptable compromise with the christian democrats to sell the deutsche bahn stake to institutional investors rather than small investors .
transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , tried to win support by promising to ensure controls that would prevent hedge funds from breaking up deutsche bahn .
" we 'll keep the ' locusts ' away , " he said .
ultimately the party agreed on a compromise , with left-wingers managing to insert a condition - " otherwise the spd rejects the sale of shares " - into a draft resolution on the privatization .
merkel slammed for turkey stance the conference produced another surprise when foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier rebuked chancellor merkel for holding out the promise of eu membership to turkey for decades , contingent on reforms , but then withdrawing support .
merkel 's party favors a privileged partnership with ankara , short of membership .
" at the crucial moment they caved in , " the normally diplomatic steinmeier said .
" what can i do with a party like the conservatives that acts like that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinmeier have enjoyed a harmonious relationship in a further sign of tensions between steinmeier and merkel , who have cooperated on foreign policy for the past two years , the foreign minister criticized the chancellor 's method of talking about human rights in china and russia through the german media rather than using more effective channels .
" when we speak out for human rights it 's not just for a quick headline back home , " steinmeier said , referring to merkel 's recent focus on human rights in china and russia that has strained relations with both countries .
" no military adventures in iran " the foreign minister also voiced concern about us intentions towards iran .
" we must prevent nuclear weapons in the middle east .
but military adventures are no contribution to a solution , " steinmeier said .
" on the contrary , the daily ranting about it only makes a solution more difficult . "
but he made clear the need to keep nuclear weapons away from iran .
atomic weapons should not land " in the hands of people who deny the holocaust , " he said in a reference to controversial remarks by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
" this would destabilize the entire middle east , " he said , stressing that germany would continue to work towards a diplomatic solution along with the united states , russia and china . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by robert pigott religious affairs correspondent , bbc news protesters marked the 40th anniversary of the abortion act forty years after the abortion act came into effect , terminations in britain are running at 450 a day .
opponents of the legislation say the scale of abortion is reason enough to introduce substantial restrictions .
but as the issue seems about to become more political , pro-choice activists say the law should actually be relaxed .
a coalition of anti-abortion campaigners gathered outside parliament to focus attention on what they say is the toll taken by the abortion act .
since 1967 the yearly rate of abortion has multiplied - from 22,000 in 1968 to 193,000 last year .
more than a fifth of pregnancies end that way .
the act was intended to protect the health of desperate women who might otherwise seek the help of back-street amateurs .
now , even lord steel , who , as a backbench mp , put forward the legislation , accepts that abortion has become a form of contraception .
rising tensions rarely has there been so much at stake in the debate about abortion .
a human fertilisation and embryos bill is expected shortly to be introduced into parliament .
it is likely to give both sides an opportunity to table amendments changing the law on abortion .
i actually believe that there are n't enough abortions john parsons that fact alone has led to a significant rise in the tension , visible among those brandishing placards on the streets of westminster .
among them was 17-year-old antoinette akoiye , at the rally with a smiling woman in a wheelchair .
ms akoiye said her mother was advised to have an abortion .
" i 'm very happy and very fortunate enough that she took a stand but not many mothers can .
they just go along with the doctor 's advice and " - she makes a gesture with her hand - " gone . "
abortion law has been changed before .
in 1988 the upper limit for aborting a foetus was reduced from 28 weeks ' gestation to 24 weeks .
in the battle to reduce it further , anti-abortion groups are publicising progressively clearer images of foetuses down to 12 or so weeks of gestation , drawing attention to their already human appearance .
but now pro-choice groups see an opportunity to press for a relaxation of the law - partly in the belief that mps who oppose abortion are outnumbered by those who support a woman 's right to choose .
' sensible option ' john parsons , a consultant gynaecologist who has been performing abortions for decades , wants new legislation to give young women , in particular , easier access to abortion .
" i actually believe that there are n't enough abortions , " said mr parsons .
" i believe that there are n't enough people who realise that this is a sensible option .
i am very concerned about the young girls , teenaged women having babies .
that 's really not sensible . "
mr parsons would like to end the rule requiring two doctors to sanction abortions and to allow nurses and others to perform them .
he said women should be able to get drugs over the chemist 's counter to allow them to abort foetuses up to nine weeks in gestation at home .
we 're trying to change minds and hearts cardinal cormac murphy-o 'connor he said the effect would be something like " the worst of periods " .
for mr parsons , improved sex education was the best way to bring down the number of abortions .
" there are too many unintended pregnancies and we should be improving the contraception facilities availability for young people . "
the roman catholic church - for which abortion is nothing less than the killing of a human being - is reluctant to sanction contraception as a weapon in the battle to reduce the rate of abortion .
but its approach to the 40th anniversary of the act has been marked by a new realism , in particular an acceptance that a complete ban may not be " achievable " .
in may , a powerful attack by the head of the scottish catholic church cardinal keith o 'brien against catholic politicians who support abortion , left an impression of inflexibility on a matter of absolute principle .
last week , however , cardinal o 'brien and the leader of the roman catholic church in england and wales , cardinal cormac murphy-o 'connor , wrote a joint open letter which called for a campaign that accepted " incremental " changes in the law .
in effect it gave catholics permission to vote for abortions after 20 weeks ' gestation , if the only option was a less restrictive limit of 24 weeks .
" we 're trying to change minds and hearts - that 's what this rally is about , " said cardinal murphy-o 'connor as the protesters walked from the houses of parliament to service in westminster cathedral for a service designed , they said , to commemorate the 6.7 million foetuses aborted since 1967 .
" but it 's legitimate for politicians to support incremental change , " he added .
" while they may be - and hopefully are - totally opposed to abortion , at the same time if they feel this is an achievable aim to lessen the limit , then that 's something i would support . "

' sensible option ' john parsons , a consultant gynaecologist who has been performing abortions for decades , wants new legislation to give young women , in particular , easier access to abortion .
" i actually believe that there are n't enough abortions , " said mr parsons .
" i believe that there are n't enough people who realise that this is a sensible option .
i am very concerned about the young girls , teenaged women having babies .
that 's really not sensible . "
mr parsons would like to end the rule requiring two doctors to sanction abortions and to allow nurses and others to perform them .
he said women should be able to get drugs over the chemist 's counter to allow them to abort foetuses up to nine weeks in gestation at home .

the roman catholic church - for which abortion is nothing less than the killing of a human being - is reluctant to sanction contraception as a weapon in the battle to reduce the rate of abortion .

in may , a powerful attack by the head of the scottish catholic church cardinal keith o 'brien against catholic politicians who support abortion , left an impression of inflexibility on a matter of absolute principle .
last week , however , cardinal o 'brien and the leader of the roman catholic church in england and wales , cardinal cormac murphy-o 'connor , wrote a joint open letter which called for a campaign that accepted " incremental " changes in the law .
in effect it gave catholics permission to vote for abortions after 20 weeks ' gestation , if the only option was a less restrictive limit of 24 weeks .
" we 're trying to change minds and hearts - that 's what this rally is about , " said cardinal murphy-o 'connor as the protesters walked from the houses of parliament to service in westminster cathedral for a service designed , they said , to commemorate the 6.7 million foetuses aborted since 1967 .
" but it 's legitimate for politicians to support incremental change , " he added .
" while they may be - and hopefully are - totally opposed to abortion , at the same time if they feel this is an achievable aim to lessen the limit , then that 's something i would support . "

by robert pigott religious affairs correspondent , bbc news protesters marked the 40th anniversary of the abortion act forty years after the abortion act came into effect , terminations in britain are running at 450 a day .
opponents of the legislation say the scale of abortion is reason enough to introduce substantial restrictions .
but as the issue seems about to become more political , pro-choice activists say the law should actually be relaxed .
a coalition of anti-abortion campaigners gathered outside parliament to focus attention on what they say is the toll taken by the abortion act .
since 1967 the yearly rate of abortion has multiplied - from 22,000 in 1968 to 193,000 last year .
more than a fifth of pregnancies end that way .
the act was intended to protect the health of desperate women who might otherwise seek the help of back-street amateurs .
now , even lord steel , who , as a backbench mp , put forward the legislation , accepts that abortion has become a form of contraception .
rising tensions rarely has there been so much at stake in the debate about abortion .
a human fertilisation and embryos bill is expected shortly to be introduced into parliament .
it is likely to give both sides an opportunity to table amendments changing the law on abortion .
i actually believe that there are n't enough abortions john parsons that fact alone has led to a significant rise in the tension , visible among those brandishing placards on the streets of westminster .
among them was 17-year-old antoinette akoiye , at the rally with a smiling woman in a wheelchair .
ms akoiye said her mother was advised to have an abortion .
" i 'm very happy and very fortunate enough that she took a stand but not many mothers can .
they just go along with the doctor 's advice and " - she makes a gesture with her hand - " gone . "
abortion law has been changed before .
in 1988 the upper limit for aborting a foetus was reduced from 28 weeks ' gestation to 24 weeks .
in the battle to reduce it further , anti-abortion groups are publicising progressively clearer images of foetuses down to 12 or so weeks of gestation , drawing attention to their already human appearance .

i actually believe that there are n't enough abortions john parsons that fact alone has led to a significant rise in the tension , visible among those brandishing placards on the streets of westminster .
among them was 17-year-old antoinette akoiye , at the rally with a smiling woman in a wheelchair .
ms akoiye said her mother was advised to have an abortion .
" i 'm very happy and very fortunate enough that she took a stand but not many mothers can .
they just go along with the doctor 's advice and " - she makes a gesture with her hand - " gone . "
abortion law has been changed before .
in 1988 the upper limit for aborting a foetus was reduced from 28 weeks ' gestation to 24 weeks .
in the battle to reduce it further , anti-abortion groups are publicising progressively clearer images of foetuses down to 12 or so weeks of gestation , drawing attention to their already human appearance .
but now pro-choice groups see an opportunity to press for a relaxation of the law - partly in the belief that mps who oppose abortion are outnumbered by those who support a woman 's right to choose .
' sensible option ' john parsons , a consultant gynaecologist who has been performing abortions for decades , wants new legislation to give young women , in particular , easier access to abortion .
" i actually believe that there are n't enough abortions , " said mr parsons .
" i believe that there are n't enough people who realise that this is a sensible option .
i am very concerned about the young girls , teenaged women having babies .
that 's really not sensible . "
mr parsons would like to end the rule requiring two doctors to sanction abortions and to allow nurses and others to perform them .
he said women should be able to get drugs over the chemist 's counter to allow them to abort foetuses up to nine weeks in gestation at home .
we 're trying to change minds and hearts cardinal cormac murphy-o 'connor he said the effect would be something like " the worst of periods " .
for mr parsons , improved sex education was the best way to bring down the number of abortions .
" there are too many unintended pregnancies and we should be improving the contraception facilities availability for young people . "
the roman catholic church - for which abortion is nothing less than the killing of a human being - is reluctant to sanction contraception as a weapon in the battle to reduce the rate of abortion .
but its approach to the 40th anniversary of the act has been marked by a new realism , in particular an acceptance that a complete ban may not be " achievable " .
in may , a powerful attack by the head of the scottish catholic church cardinal keith o 'brien against catholic politicians who support abortion , left an impression of inflexibility on a matter of absolute principle .
last week , however , cardinal o 'brien and the leader of the roman catholic church in england and wales , cardinal cormac murphy-o 'connor , wrote a joint open letter which called for a campaign that accepted " incremental " changes in the law .
in effect it gave catholics permission to vote for abortions after 20 weeks ' gestation , if the only option was a less restrictive limit of 24 weeks .
" we 're trying to change minds and hearts - that 's what this rally is about , " said cardinal murphy-o 'connor as the protesters walked from the houses of parliament to service in westminster cathedral for a service designed , they said , to commemorate the 6.7 million foetuses aborted since 1967 .
" but it 's legitimate for politicians to support incremental change , " he added .
" while they may be - and hopefully are - totally opposed to abortion , at the same time if they feel this is an achievable aim to lessen the limit , then that 's something i would support . "

opponents of the legislation say the scale of abortion is reason enough to introduce substantial restrictions .
but as the issue seems about to become more political , pro-choice activists say the law should actually be relaxed .
a coalition of anti-abortion campaigners gathered outside parliament to focus attention on what they say is the toll taken by the abortion act .

more than a fifth of pregnancies end that way .
the act was intended to protect the health of desperate women who might otherwise seek the help of back-street amateurs .

the british asians in football forum says many smaller clubs see it as a way of raising both coffers and community relations .
" the penny 's dropped with regards the potential of the asian community , " said abdul " butch " fazal of the forum .
" we 're a wealthy community and that brown pound counts .
most asian football fans are second or third generation british .
they 're established , in good jobs and earning nice money . "
and he added that unlike their parents or grandparents , football is not frowned upon .
changing look luton town football club chief executive john mitchell believes clubs have neglected the potential of an asian-british fan base and have work to do to spark interest in the game at a local level .
" there 's no easy solution , " he said .
" over the years there has been a change in the local community that has n't been recognised but now we want to do something about it . "
he said luton town is working with local asian business leaders , resident groups and children 's football teams . "
i 've never really had the chance to go to live games , but since my boys have been playing all the family enjoy it much more and we 've been looking to go to some matches . "
football dad irtiza shah but mr fazal said the entire look of some clubs needs to change .
" clubs are actually desperate now to get asian players and spectators in , but they 've got to change that under-representation in every strata of the game from administration to coaching to players , the lot . "
' racism remains ' hamza shah plays for an under-nines football team and his father says he is going to be an asian david beckham .
along with six of his friends and three of their fathers , he recently saw his first proper football match , courtesy of luton town 's outreach programme .
hamza 's dad , syed , says the group loves football but have been put off in the past .
" football should be a showcase for unification because everyone likes football , " he said of the game 's potential .
" a few years ago there were n't very many black players and now there are no asians . "
he said racism remains a reality in today 's game .
" there does seem to be an elitism and inherent racism within the sport and you see that and your enthusiasm flags . "
but irtiza shah , who was at the same match with his sons and nephews , says they are all keen to attend .
" i 've never really had the chance to go to live games , but since my boys have been playing all the family enjoy it much more and we 've been looking to go to some matches . "
the luton town ground is in bury park , which is home to a large number of ethnic minority migrants .
yet few seem loyal to the local club .
" i support manchester united , " said one resident of kenilworth road .
" my house is just next to the stadium and i park my car in their car park .
i 'm a bit ashamed .
i really should go . "
other locals admitted to supporting liverpool and chelsea , but not the hatters .
luton is not the only club looking to fill its seats with a new generation of asian fan .
similar initiatives are being run at bradford , oldham , blackburn , leicester and others .
' affordable fun ' west bromwich albion 's owners believe part of the problem is the sport 's image as an expensive outing .
this they put down to the reputation of the big earning , big spending premier league clubs .
in order to send a message about the affordability of the local game , they 've been training ethnic minority community coaches who go into schools wearing the club strip and teach football during lunch breaks .
abdur obeed is one of those coaches and on a recent playground visit , he was surrounded by dozens of children eager to play .
he mixed up a team of girls and boys and soon a boisterous game was under way , with a young girl in a head scarf emerging among the most enthusiastic .
" lots of these kids have parents that are into football , " said mr obeed .
" their grandparents and their families probably were n't so keen but now they 're supporting their children because they love football and that 's why we 're seeing more young asians playing . "
eight-year-old bilal amar , one of the first-timers at a luton match , sounds a positive note for the future of local asian football support .
" i like luton , they 're a good team , " he said .
" they 've got some good talent .
it 's more exciting than the tv .
i want to go again .
i think my dad will say yes . "

the british asians in football forum says many smaller clubs see it as a way of raising both coffers and community relations .
" the penny 's dropped with regards the potential of the asian community , " said abdul " butch " fazal of the forum .
" we 're a wealthy community and that brown pound counts .
most asian football fans are second or third generation british .
they 're established , in good jobs and earning nice money . "
and he added that unlike their parents or grandparents , football is not frowned upon .
changing look luton town football club chief executive john mitchell believes clubs have neglected the potential of an asian-british fan base and have work to do to spark interest in the game at a local level .
" there 's no easy solution , " he said .
" over the years there has been a change in the local community that has n't been recognised but now we want to do something about it . "
he said luton town is working with local asian business leaders , resident groups and children 's football teams .
i 've never really had the chance to go to live games , but since my boys have been playing all the family enjoy it much more and we 've been looking to go to some matches .
football dad irtiza shah but mr fazal said the entire look of some clubs needs to change .
" clubs are actually desperate now to get asian players and spectators in , but they 've got to change that under-representation in every strata of the game from administration to coaching to players , the lot . "
' racism remains ' hamza shah plays for an under-nines football team and his father says he is going to be an asian david beckham .
along with six of his friends and three of their fathers , he recently saw his first proper football match , courtesy of luton town 's outreach programme .
hamza 's dad , syed , says the group loves football but have been put off in the past .
" football should be a showcase for unification because everyone likes football , " he said of the game 's potential .
" a few years ago there were n't very many black players and now there are no asians . "
he said racism remains a reality in today 's game .
fans of the future are being invited to watch local football matches " there does seem to be an elitism and inherent racism within the sport and you see that and your enthusiasm flags . "

indigenous and christian beliefs have fused together here .
god is worshipped but , just as important , is pachamama or mother earth .
the aymara people have lived in the andes for more than 2,000 years , pre-dating the incas who ruled over large parts of the west of south america .
the llama foetus is considered sacred by many in bolivia many of their traditional beliefs remained intact during the later spanish colonisation and they still survive today .
in bolivia , more than half the population consider themselves indigenous indians .
the aymara is one of the biggest groups .
even the president respects their ancient rituals .
in the steep , cobbled , back streets of la paz , bolivia 's administrative capital , it is easy to see these traditions being practised .
witches ' market the area is busy .
day-to-day life is a constant bustle , with women selling fruit and vegetables , sitting alongside friends flogging alpaca wool hats to tourists .
we live and eat from the land .
pachamama is our mother and we have to respect her juana , spiritual healer here small shops and wooden stalls are stacked high with potions , charms , and herbs , and not too pleasant looking llama foetuses .
more on them later .
behind each one stands a woman , waiting patiently for her services to be needed .
in one of these stalls i got chatting to juana and ivan , a husband and wife team said to have a special gift .
juana is a practising yatiri , a spiritual healer .
llama foetuses are offered for sale in bolivian markets she learnt the craft from her father who was , in turn , guided by his father .
her family , she says , has been blessed for generations , but she told me that of five children she is the only one with this power .
" i realised when i was nine that i could heal , " she said .
" i helped my mother and sisters when they got ill . "
when she was 16 she started working on the stall , slowly taking over the business that has been on this spot for half a century .
for 12 years this very calm and gentle woman has been helping people who are sick and trying to bring them good luck .
pachamama " we live and eat from the land , " juana said .
the offering included sugar tablets , herb and wool " pachamama is our mother and we have to respect her . "
many people burn offerings , hoping pachamama will bring them good luck , health , fortune and happiness .
juana offered to make me an offering too .
she began by spreading a base of herbs on a large sheet of paper .
then she started sifting through a box of small rectangular tablets made from sugar .
each one had a symbol on it - a house , a dollar bill , hearts , a star or a book .
she chose one with the outline of a condor , a giant south american bird .
it would , she said , bring me positive energy and peace .
wrapped in silver leaf another , with a picture of a nearby mountain , would bless me on my travels and she added another tablet that she told me would protect my health .
the offering was growing in size .
next , were walnuts - again for health - sweets shaped like llamas - an animal that is so much a part of life here - more sugar cubes , then llama wool , the clothing of pachamama .
on top of all this she placed a llama foetus .
if you were to dig up most bolivian homes , you would find one of these buried beneath the foundations .
they are a gift to pachamama , a way of apologising for cutting into her .
they are an important part of any offering and are said to be very lucky .
the smoke swirling in circles was a sure sign of good luck next , she wrapped gold and silver leaf around the foetus , and added some llama meat , and incense , presumably to make the concoction smell nicer as it burnt .
ivan meanwhile was chopping wood .
most people take their offering home to burn them there , but i did not think my hotel would be happy with that idea and i was sure ivan could build a better fire .
he sent me off to buy some bottles of beer which we would use for a toast .
so right there on the street , next to the stall , we made the offering .
lucky i placed the packet onto the wood and made my request to pachamama .
with a little fuel , the fire took hold quickly .
we toasted pachamama with the beer , asking other stall holders to join in and wish me well .
an offering was burnt and prayers made to pachamama i should tell you at this point that i am soon to become a father for the first time and so my wishes from pachamama naturally concerned the future for my child .
juana was delighted and seemed genuine when she told me that the offering was being well received .
the smoke swirling in circles was a sure sign of this , apparently , and meant good luck .
the beer , she said , was particularly sweet , again a sign of luck .
she seemed really content when a man - no-one knew who he was - approached the fire seemingly transfixed by the flame .
" this is very lucky , " she said .
" and it means you 'll have a son . "
i will wait and see .

pachamama is our mother and we have to respect her juana , spiritual healer here small shops and wooden stalls are stacked high with potions , charms , and herbs , and not too pleasant looking llama foetuses .
more on them later .
behind each one stands a woman , waiting patiently for her services to be needed .
in one of these stalls i got chatting to juana and ivan , a husband and wife team said to have a special gift .
juana is a practising yatiri , a spiritual healer .
llama foetuses are offered for sale in bolivian markets she learnt the craft from her father who was , in turn , guided by his father .
her family , she says , has been blessed for generations , but she told me that of five children she is the only one with this power .
" i realised when i was nine that i could heal , " she said .
" i helped my mother and sisters when they got ill . "
when she was 16 she started working on the stall , slowly taking over the business that has been on this spot for half a century .
for 12 years this very calm and gentle woman has been helping people who are sick and trying to bring them good luck .
pachamama " we live and eat from the land , " juana said .
the offering included sugar tablets , herb and wool " pachamama is our mother and we have to respect her . "
many people burn offerings , hoping pachamama will bring them good luck , health , fortune and happiness .
juana offered to make me an offering too .
she began by spreading a base of herbs on a large sheet of paper .
then she started sifting through a box of small rectangular tablets made from sugar .
each one had a symbol on it - a house , a dollar bill , hearts , a star or a book .
she chose one with the outline of a condor , a giant south american bird .
it would , she said , bring me positive energy and peace .
wrapped in silver leaf another , with a picture of a nearby mountain , would bless me on my travels and she added another tablet that she told me would protect my health .
the offering was growing in size .
next , were walnuts - again for health - sweets shaped like llamas - an animal that is so much a part of life here - more sugar cubes , then llama wool , the clothing of pachamama .
on top of all this she placed a llama foetus .
if you were to dig up most bolivian homes , you would find one of these buried beneath the foundations .
they are a gift to pachamama , a way of apologising for cutting into her .
they are an important part of any offering and are said to be very lucky .
the smoke swirling in circles was a sure sign of good luck next , she wrapped gold and silver leaf around the foetus , and added some llama meat , and incense , presumably to make the concoction smell nicer as it burnt .
ivan meanwhile was chopping wood .
most people take their offering home to burn them there , but i did not think my hotel would be happy with that idea and i was sure ivan could build a better fire .
he sent me off to buy some bottles of beer which we would use for a toast .
so right there on the street , next to the stall , we made the offering .
lucky i placed the packet onto the wood and made my request to pachamama .
with a little fuel , the fire took hold quickly .
we toasted pachamama with the beer , asking other stall holders to join in and wish me well .
an offering was burnt and prayers made to pachamama i should tell you at this point that i am soon to become a father for the first time and so my wishes from pachamama naturally concerned the future for my child .
juana was delighted and seemed genuine when she told me that the offering was being well received .
the smoke swirling in circles was a sure sign of this , apparently , and meant good luck .
the beer , she said , was particularly sweet , again a sign of luck .
she seemed really content when a man - no-one knew who he was - approached the fire seemingly transfixed by the flame .
" this is very lucky , " she said .
" and it means you 'll have a son . "
i will wait and see .

indigenous and christian beliefs have fused together here .
god is worshipped but , just as important , is pachamama or mother earth .
the aymara people have lived in the andes for more than 2,000 years , pre-dating the incas who ruled over large parts of the west of south america .
the llama foetus is considered sacred by many in bolivia many of their traditional beliefs remained intact during the later spanish colonisation and they still survive today .
in bolivia , more than half the population consider themselves indigenous indians .
the aymara is one of the biggest groups .
even the president respects their ancient rituals .
in the steep , cobbled , back streets of la paz , bolivia 's administrative capital , it is easy to see these traditions being practised .

a 10-year-old boy was filmed making clothes for gap shops in the us and europe as part of an investigation by the uk 's observer newspaper .
the boy told the observer he had been sold to a factory owner by his family .
gap , which has made commitments not to use child labour , said that only one item - a girl 's smock blouse - was involved .
the boy said he had been working for four months without pay and would not be allowed to leave the job until the fee his family had received was repaid .
another boy of 12 said children were beaten if bosses thought they were not working hard enough , the paper reported . "
this is very upsetting and we intend to investigate thoroughly " gap spokesman dan henkle dan henkle , a spokesman for gap , said : " we were made aware earlier this week that a reporter had found an incident of children working in a factory that was producing for one of our brands , and this is completely unacceptable to us .
" we have a strict prohibition on child labour , and we are taking this very seriously .
this is very upsetting and we intend to investigate thoroughly . "
emergency meeting the spokesman said gap monitors factories which make its clothing and in 2006 revoked approval for 23 factories which it said failed to comply with its standards .
mr henkle also said the company was calling an emergency meeting with its suppliers in the region .
the smock blouse will not be offered for sale in the company 's 3,000 stores around the world , gap said , and instead will be destroyed .
western clothing chains increasingly get their products made in asia , taking advantage of cheaper labour .
