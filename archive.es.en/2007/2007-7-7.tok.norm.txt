europeans face the specter of a growing terrorist threat in their midst .
on the two-year anniversary of the london train bombings , great britain can no longer ignore its disaffected muslim communities . the united kingdom has faced more attacks than any other eu country or the united states .
since september 11 , 2001 , islamic extremists have carried out at least four major terrorist attacks on british soil . in the us , by contrast , only one successful attack motivated by islamic jihad was carried out in late 2001 , when letters tainted with a lethal strain of the anthrax virus killed five people . in an effort to explain why the uk has become a more frequent target of terrorism than the us , analysts have cited the failure of european states to integrate their muslim populations into mainstream society . " these are not terror cells operating across borders or exporting holy warriors from the middle east , " said professor hans giessmann of the university of hamburg .
the incidents in london , glasgow , madrid and other european cities " have been carried out across the board by homegrown terrorists . " " what we are dealing with here is a spill-over of extremist ideologies into disenfranchised communities within our midst , " giessmann said , suggesting that many of the two million arabs living in the uk have failed to adapt to the british way of life . parallel societies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breeding ground : a tight-knit muslim community in leeds , england a security expert at the london-based limehouse group , hazhir teimourian , blames england 's liberal immigration policies .
" this government has done enormous damage with its lax policy on immigration , " he said . teimourian said the labor government under former prime minister tony blair " has given islamists from all over the world the freedom to set up shop in england . " " the result , " he says , " is an increasing ghettoization and alienation of these communities , " rendering them highly susceptible to radical islamic ideologies such as the brand of suicidal jihad -lrb- holy war -rrb- preached by al qaeda . giessmann agrees that a false sense of tolerance in europe has led to the emergence of parallel societies where many do n't speak the national language . " these communities do n't have an integrated existence , and that makes them susceptible to various forms of radicalization , " he said . especially the second and third-generation immigrants - children of the original migrants who came to england after world war two - have become increasingly sensitized by 9/11 and the wars in iraq and afghanistan .
teimourian said some of these youths were even turning on their parents for " not being islamic enough . " indeed , none of the seven suspects arrested in connection with last week 's attempted car bomb attacks in london and glasgow are older than 30 . " in germany , too , we have finally recognized that integration does n't function on autopilot , " giessmann said .
" the ' clash of civilizations ' is happening within our own fragmented society , and we have not succeeded in defining a collective identity in the context of a multi-ethnic nation-state . " germany has a large number of muslim immigrants , most of them of turkish descent , who often live in secluded and low-income neighborhoods and have little or no contact with their german peers . in addition , many muslims come from rural backgrounds .
in britain , teimourian observes that " they have a high degree of hatred for western culture because they do n't understand it and feel threatened by it . " teimourian , who himself is an iranian kurd who emigrated to the uk over 50 years ago , decided to raise his own children as christians under the church of england " so that they feel more attached to the european identity . " no " islam town " in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 9/11 raised the profile of america 's 2.35 million muslims american muslim communities are different .
" america is much less tolerant of alienation , " teimourian said , adding that american muslims " are told , at least implicitly , that they must become american . " as a result , american muslims by and large do not live together as entities , according to giessmann .
in that regard , muslims are unlike their chinese , italian or other immigrant counterparts , who came to the us much earlier and formed isolated clusters - " chinatown " or " little italy , " for example .
there is no " islam town " in america . historically speaking , the american muslim community is still in its infancy .
and it is being shaped by community leaders such as zaid shakir , a progressive imam in california who has gained widespread popularity by preaching a moderate brand of islam that meshes well with the american way of life . in a recent interview with us journalist bill moyers , shakir said there was " an american muslim culture emerging , which is very important , because then you can get a unique understanding of the religion that would allow the american muslim to take his or her rightful place amongst the various muslim communities of the world . " but as a percentage of the population , the muslim minority in the us is far smaller than in the uk - 2.35 million muslims live in the continental united states , or less than one percent of the total population .
muslims in great britain make up three percent of the population . furthermore , america 's muslim population is more affluent than in the uk .
" they are more professional and less like peasants , " as teimourian put it .

but many have refused to let themselves be cowed . first , the collapse of the soviet union dragged movie-making throughout the region to the brink of a financial abyss .
then , as privatization took off , cinemas began closing and were converted to sex clubs and discos . a short time later , a new and potentially more lethal rival appeared on the scene , with hollywood movies starting to fill up the cinemas that had survived the end of communism , further undercutting hopes of an early rebound in the local film business . but as the more recent years have shown , filmmakers in central and eastern europe -lrb- cee -rrb- have been remarkably resilient .
a new generation of directors is now emerging to help shape a modern cinema that in many cases explore the changes that were unleashed by the revolutions that swept away decades of stalinism in 1989 . romania leads the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's come a long way since communism " many of these filmmakers accumulated ideas and frustrations , " said mihai gligor of the romanian film promotion association . " even after the revolution it was hard to get money , " he said .
" in many cases it was a fight with a system that was very corrupt .
it was a continuing fight . " however , romania has been helping to lead a revival in filmmaking in the region and a renewed global interest in a movie business that has produced some of the most pioneering figures in global cinema . in particular , this follows the success of cristian mungiu 's " 4 months , 3 weeks , 2 days " in winning the prestigious palme d 'or prize at cannes , which has also helped generate renewed interest among local audiences across cee in films made by national directors . seven years ago , no films were being made in romania , yet now the nation manages to pump out between 10 and 20 feature films a year . fresh and innovative underscoring the arrival of cee 's new generation of filmmakers , three czech feature movies and two animated films were included in the official program of this year 's berlin film festival .
poland 's gdynia film festival last year included 30 entries from debut directors . " they have a fresh and innovative approach towards filmmaking .
some of them have even invented a new film language , " said eva vezer , general manager of magyar filmunio , hungary 's film promotion board and a member of the european film promotion board , describing the region 's new wave of filmmakers . dashed hopes what is more , the new cee cinema appears to have emerged just as the dreams were fading across the region about what the fall of communism might have led to . the result has been that many of the region 's directors have been retracing the events surrounding the fall of communism and the new social values that have taken shape . this became clear from the films screened at this year 's karlovy vary film festival , which showcases films from cee . these include movies such as " dolina " by hungarian director zoltan kamondi , about the takeover of a town by authoritarian forces , " simple things " by russian director alexey popogrebsky , on personal turmoil set against urban life in st. petersburg , and " hope " by polish director stanislaw mucha . hope portrays a struggle between money and a less materialist view of the world as a young man tries to negotiate with the thief who stole a rare painting from a warsaw church to return the work of art . another polish film screened in karlovy vary is " saviour 's square " from directors krzysztof krauze and joanna kos-krauze , which touched on the role of women in post-communist eastern europe . the communist legacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today there are few traces of communism left in europe zoltan kamondi believes that , despite having lived under democracy , the basic instincts of many people in everyday life have not changed since the days when they were still living in a dictatorship . celebrations last year marking the 50th anniversary of the hungarian revolution also gave the nation 's film-makers the chance to look back on their country 's battle to chart a more independent course . even directors such as elke hauck , who grew up under the communism in east germany have sought to explore how east germans have managed to adjust to the new world that emerged following the fall of theberlin wall . in her debut film , " karger , " the hero finds he needs to make some radical changes to his life after it lurches into a crisis . but drawing on largely unprofessional cast , one of the main characters told a press conference following a screening of the film in karlovy vary that she found it relatively easy to play her role . like her character , anja dietrich said : ' i am looking for a job right now .

europeans face the specter of a growing terrorist threat in their midst .
on the two-year anniversary of the london train bombings , great britain can no longer ignore its disaffected muslim communities . the united kingdom has faced more attacks than any other eu country or the united states .
since september 11 , 2001 , islamic extremists have carried out at least four major terrorist attacks on british soil . in the us , by contrast , only one successful attack motivated by islamic jihad was carried out in late 2001 , when letters tainted with a lethal strain of the anthrax virus killed five people . in an effort to explain why the uk has become a more frequent target of terrorism than the us , analysts have cited the failure of european states to integrate their muslim populations into mainstream society . " these are not terror cells operating across borders or exporting holy warriors from the middle east , " said professor hans giessmann of the university of hamburg .
the incidents in london , glasgow , madrid and other european cities " have been carried out across the board by homegrown terrorists .

" " the result , " he says , " is an increasing ghettoization and alienation of these communities , " rendering them highly susceptible to radical islamic ideologies such as the brand of suicidal jihad -lrb- holy war -rrb- preached by al qaeda . giessmann agrees that a false sense of tolerance in europe has led to the emergence of parallel societies where many do n't speak the national language . " these communities do n't have an integrated existence , and that makes them susceptible to various forms of radicalization , " he said . especially the second and third-generation immigrants - children of the original migrants who came to england after world war two - have become increasingly sensitized by 9/11 and the wars in iraq and afghanistan .
teimourian said some of these youths were even turning on their parents for " not being islamic enough . " indeed , none of the seven suspects arrested in connection with last week 's attempted car bomb attacks in london and glasgow are older than 30 . " in germany , too , we have finally recognized that integration does n't function on autopilot , " giessmann said .

europeans face the specter of a growing terrorist threat in their midst .
on the two-year anniversary of the london train bombings , great britain can no longer ignore its disaffected muslim communities . the united kingdom has faced more attacks than any other eu country or the united states .
since september 11 , 2001 , islamic extremists have carried out at least four major terrorist attacks on british soil . in the us , by contrast , only one successful attack motivated by islamic jihad was carried out in late 2001 , when letters tainted with a lethal strain of the anthrax virus killed five people . in an effort to explain why the uk has become a more frequent target of terrorism than the us , analysts have cited the failure of european states to integrate their muslim populations into mainstream society . " these are not terror cells operating across borders or exporting holy warriors from the middle east , " said professor hans giessmann of the university of hamburg .
the incidents in london , glasgow , madrid and other european cities " have been carried out across the board by homegrown terrorists . " " what we are dealing with here is a spill-over of extremist ideologies into disenfranchised communities within our midst , " giessmann said , suggesting that many of the two million arabs living in the uk have failed to adapt to the british way of life . parallel societies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breeding ground : a tight-knit muslim community in leeds , england a security expert at the london-based limehouse group , hazhir teimourian , blames england 's liberal immigration policies .
" this government has done enormous damage with its lax policy on immigration , " he said . teimourian said the labor government under former prime minister tony blair " has given islamists from all over the world the freedom to set up shop in england . " " the result , " he says , " is an increasing ghettoization and alienation of these communities , " rendering them highly susceptible to radical islamic ideologies such as the brand of suicidal jihad -lrb- holy war -rrb- preached by al qaeda . giessmann agrees that a false sense of tolerance in europe has led to the emergence of parallel societies where many do n't speak the national language . " these communities do n't have an integrated existence , and that makes them susceptible to various forms of radicalization , " he said . especially the second and third-generation immigrants - children of the original migrants who came to england after world war two - have become increasingly sensitized by 9/11 and the wars in iraq and afghanistan .
teimourian said some of these youths were even turning on their parents for " not being islamic enough . " indeed , none of the seven suspects arrested in connection with last week 's attempted car bomb attacks in london and glasgow are older than 30 . " in germany , too , we have finally recognized that integration does n't function on autopilot , " giessmann said .
" the ' clash of civilizations ' is happening within our own fragmented society , and we have not succeeded in defining a collective identity in the context of a multi-ethnic nation-state . " germany has a large number of muslim immigrants , most of them of turkish descent , who often live in secluded and low-income neighborhoods and have little or no contact with their german peers . in addition , many muslims come from rural backgrounds .
in britain , teimourian observes that " they have a high degree of hatred for western culture because they do n't understand it and feel threatened by it . " teimourian , who himself is an iranian kurd who emigrated to the uk over 50 years ago , decided to raise his own children as christians under the church of england " so that they feel more attached to the european identity . " no " islam town " in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 9/11 raised the profile of america 's 2.35 million muslims american muslim communities are different .
" america is much less tolerant of alienation , " teimourian said , adding that american muslims " are told , at least implicitly , that they must become american . " as a result , american muslims by and large do not live together as entities , according to giessmann .
in that regard , muslims are unlike their chinese , italian or other immigrant counterparts , who came to the us much earlier and formed isolated clusters - " chinatown " or " little italy , " for example .
there is no " islam town " in america . historically speaking , the american muslim community is still in its infancy .
and it is being shaped by community leaders such as zaid shakir , a progressive imam in california who has gained widespread popularity by preaching a moderate brand of islam that meshes well with the american way of life . in a recent interview with us journalist bill moyers , shakir said there was " an american muslim culture emerging , which is very important , because then you can get a unique understanding of the religion that would allow the american muslim to take his or her rightful place amongst the various muslim communities of the world . " but as a percentage of the population , the muslim minority in the us is far smaller than in the uk - 2.35 million muslims live in the continental united states , or less than one percent of the total population .
muslims in great britain make up three percent of the population . furthermore , america 's muslim population is more affluent than in the uk .
" they are more professional and less like peasants , " as teimourian put it .

but many have refused to let themselves be cowed . first , the collapse of the soviet union dragged movie-making throughout the region to the brink of a financial abyss .
then , as privatization took off , cinemas began closing and were converted to sex clubs and discos . a short time later , a new and potentially more lethal rival appeared on the scene , with hollywood movies starting to fill up the cinemas that had survived the end of communism , further undercutting hopes of an early rebound in the local film business . but as the more recent years have shown , filmmakers in central and eastern europe -lrb- cee -rrb- have been remarkably resilient .
a new generation of directors is now emerging to help shape a modern cinema that in many cases explore the changes that were unleashed by the revolutions that swept away decades of stalinism in 1989 . romania leads the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's come a long way since communism " many of these filmmakers accumulated ideas and frustrations , " said mihai gligor of the romanian film promotion association . " even after the revolution it was hard to get money , " he said .
" in many cases it was a fight with a system that was very corrupt .
it was a continuing fight . " however , romania has been helping to lead a revival in filmmaking in the region and a renewed global interest in a movie business that has produced some of the most pioneering figures in global cinema . in particular , this follows the success of cristian mungiu 's " 4 months , 3 weeks , 2 days " in winning the prestigious palme d 'or prize at cannes , which has also helped generate renewed interest among local audiences across cee in films made by national directors . seven years ago , no films were being made in romania , yet now the nation manages to pump out between 10 and 20 feature films a year . fresh and innovative underscoring the arrival of cee 's new generation of filmmakers , three czech feature movies and two animated films were included in the official program of this year 's berlin film festival .
poland 's gdynia film festival last year included 30 entries from debut directors . " they have a fresh and innovative approach towards filmmaking .
some of them have even invented a new film language , " said eva vezer , general manager of magyar filmunio , hungary 's film promotion board and a member of the european film promotion board , describing the region 's new wave of filmmakers . dashed hopes what is more , the new cee cinema appears to have emerged just as the dreams were fading across the region about what the fall of communism might have led to . the result has been that many of the region 's directors have been retracing the events surrounding the fall of communism and the new social values that have taken shape . this became clear from the films screened at this year 's karlovy vary film festival , which showcases films from cee . these include movies such as " dolina " by hungarian director zoltan kamondi , about the takeover of a town by authoritarian forces , " simple things " by russian director alexey popogrebsky , on personal turmoil set against urban life in st. petersburg , and " hope " by polish director stanislaw mucha . hope portrays a struggle between money and a less materialist view of the world as a young man tries to negotiate with the thief who stole a rare painting from a warsaw church to return the work of art . another polish film screened in karlovy vary is " saviour 's square " from directors krzysztof krauze and joanna kos-krauze , which touched on the role of women in post-communist eastern europe . the communist legacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today there are few traces of communism left in europe zoltan kamondi believes that , despite having lived under democracy , the basic instincts of many people in everyday life have not changed since the days when they were still living in a dictatorship . celebrations last year marking the 50th anniversary of the hungarian revolution also gave the nation 's film-makers the chance to look back on their country 's battle to chart a more independent course . even directors such as elke hauck , who grew up under the communism in east germany have sought to explore how east germans have managed to adjust to the new world that emerged following the fall of theberlin wall . in her debut film , " karger , " the hero finds he needs to make some radical changes to his life after it lurches into a crisis . but drawing on largely unprofessional cast , one of the main characters told a press conference following a screening of the film in karlovy vary that she found it relatively easy to play her role . like her character , anja dietrich said : ' i am looking for a job right now .

europeans face the specter of a growing terrorist threat in their midst .
on the two-year anniversary of the london train bombings , great britain can no longer ignore its disaffected muslim communities . the united kingdom has faced more attacks than any other eu country or the united states .
since september 11 , 2001 , islamic extremists have carried out at least four major terrorist attacks on british soil . in the us , by contrast , only one successful attack motivated by islamic jihad was carried out in late 2001 , when letters tainted with a lethal strain of the anthrax virus killed five people . in an effort to explain why the uk has become a more frequent target of terrorism than the us , analysts have cited the failure of european states to integrate their muslim populations into mainstream society . " these are not terror cells operating across borders or exporting holy warriors from the middle east , " said professor hans giessmann of the university of hamburg .
the incidents in london , glasgow , madrid and other european cities " have been carried out across the board by homegrown terrorists . " " what we are dealing with here is a spill-over of extremist ideologies into disenfranchised communities within our midst , " giessmann said , suggesting that many of the two million arabs living in the uk have failed to adapt to the british way of life . parallel societies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breeding ground : a tight-knit muslim community in leeds , england a security expert at the london-based limehouse group , hazhir teimourian , blames england 's liberal immigration policies .
" this government has done enormous damage with its lax policy on immigration , " he said . teimourian said the labor government under former prime minister tony blair " has given islamists from all over the world the freedom to set up shop in england . " " the result , " he says , " is an increasing ghettoization and alienation of these communities , " rendering them highly susceptible to radical islamic ideologies such as the brand of suicidal jihad -lrb- holy war -rrb- preached by al qaeda . giessmann agrees that a false sense of tolerance in europe has led to the emergence of parallel societies where many do n't speak the national language . " these communities do n't have an integrated existence , and that makes them susceptible to various forms of radicalization , " he said . especially the second and third-generation immigrants - children of the original migrants who came to england after world war two - have become increasingly sensitized by 9/11 and the wars in iraq and afghanistan .
teimourian said some of these youths were even turning on their parents for " not being islamic enough . " indeed , none of the seven suspects arrested in connection with last week 's attempted car bomb attacks in london and glasgow are older than 30 . " in germany , too , we have finally recognized that integration does n't function on autopilot , " giessmann said .
" the ' clash of civilizations ' is happening within our own fragmented society , and we have not succeeded in defining a collective identity in the context of a multi-ethnic nation-state . " germany has a large number of muslim immigrants , most of them of turkish descent , who often live in secluded and low-income neighborhoods and have little or no contact with their german peers . in addition , many muslims come from rural backgrounds .

but the road there is a rocky one .
the selection process is tough and only the very best applicants get a position . it does n't get more idyllic than this .
the german foreign ministry 's training academy is based along the woods and fields on the shores of lake tegel in berlin .
it 's there that the country 's prospective diplomats get their final polish before they head off to the embassies in rome , minsk or addis ababa . but do n't be deceived by the scenery .
there 's a lot of hard work at the academy and the timetable is full to the brink . christian doktor is one of the 35 attachés here .
for one year , the academy is intensely preparing him and the other future diplomats for their job serving germany 's foreign policies . whoever has made it here already has a university degree - and gets a one-year crash course in diplomacy on top of it .
according to doktor , it started off with learning how to communicate within a group and in public .
then rhetoric and language courses in english and french were on the schedule . " we had a history block , a run in eight days through german history from 1871 through today , " doktor said . but doktor does n't consider the compact instruction as stress , but rather as a privilege .
after completing his studies in law , the 28-year-old worked in the foreign office for a year - and got hooked . " the ministry of foreign affairs is , of course , an amazing employer , " doktor said .
" there 's no other profession which takes you to so many countries in the world . " being a diplomat is a life decision in order to get one of the 35 spots at the academy , doktor had to compete with some 1,500 other applicants .
he also had to prove in a multi-stage selection process that he is suitable for the diplomatic profession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is germany 's most well-known diplomat " this does n't just include intellectual capabilities and the creativity needed for this job , but also social and intercultural competence , as well as self-confident appearance and motivation , " said head trainer stefan biedermann .
whoever wants to become a diplomat also has to be willing to work in a different country every three years . " that 's why we always speak of a life decision and not a career decision , " biedermann said .
" it affects your private life , your family , relatives and friends so completely , that you should n't talk about a simple career or a job in this case . " doktor has long since made this decision for himself .
he wants to see the world and get to know various cultures .
the thought of living with moving boxes does n't scare him . parties are part of it , too the 35 attachés also spend a lot of their free time together .
doktor said he hoped that the group will go through their respective careers and support and help each other . " you need contacts , not just professionally , but also on a human and social level , " doktor said .
" that is a very important goal that is reached with this training , because we are all here together , celebrating together and doing sports together . " the prospective diplomats thus should n't just be getting to know the finer points of consular work during their year at the academy in tegel , but rather also the other attachés .
trainer biedermann therefore does n't at all object to the many wild parties . " they often go into the early hours of the morning , " biedermann said .
" the training supervisors only demand that at eight the next morning , everyone is back in the classroom in tie and suit , keeping a stiff upper lip - or countenance , as the diplomat calls it .

some of them have even invented a new film language , " said eva vezer , general manager of magyar filmunio , hungary 's film promotion board and a member of the european film promotion board , describing the region 's new wave of filmmakers . dashed hopes what is more , the new cee cinema appears to have emerged just as the dreams were fading across the region about what the fall of communism might have led to . the result has been that many of the region 's directors have been retracing the events surrounding the fall of communism and the new social values that have taken shape . this became clear from the films screened at this year 's karlovy vary film festival , which showcases films from cee . these include movies such as " dolina " by hungarian director zoltan kamondi , about the takeover of a town by authoritarian forces , " simple things " by russian director alexey popogrebsky , on personal turmoil set against urban life in st. petersburg , and " hope " by polish director stanislaw mucha . hope portrays a struggle between money and a less materialist view of the world as a young man tries to negotiate with the thief who stole a rare painting from a warsaw church to return the work of art . another polish film screened in karlovy vary is " saviour 's square " from directors krzysztof krauze and joanna kos-krauze , which touched on the role of women in post-communist eastern europe . the communist legacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today there are few traces of communism left in europe zoltan kamondi believes that , despite having lived under democracy , the basic instincts of many people in everyday life have not changed since the days when they were still living in a dictatorship . celebrations last year marking the 50th anniversary of the hungarian revolution also gave the nation 's film-makers the chance to look back on their country 's battle to chart a more independent course . even directors such as elke hauck , who grew up under the communism in east germany have sought to explore how east germans have managed to adjust to the new world that emerged following the fall of theberlin wall . in her debut film , " karger , " the hero finds he needs to make some radical changes to his life after it lurches into a crisis . but drawing on largely unprofessional cast , one of the main characters told a press conference following a screening of the film in karlovy vary that she found it relatively easy to play her role . like her character , anja dietrich said : ' i am looking for a job right now .

but the road there is a rocky one .
the selection process is tough and only the very best applicants get a position . it does n't get more idyllic than this .
the german foreign ministry 's training academy is based along the woods and fields on the shores of lake tegel in berlin .
it 's there that the country 's prospective diplomats get their final polish before they head off to the embassies in rome , minsk or addis ababa . but do n't be deceived by the scenery .
there 's a lot of hard work at the academy and the timetable is full to the brink . christian doktor is one of the 35 attachés here .
for one year , the academy is intensely preparing him and the other future diplomats for their job serving germany 's foreign policies . whoever has made it here already has a university degree - and gets a one-year crash course in diplomacy on top of it .
according to doktor , it started off with learning how to communicate within a group and in public .
then rhetoric and language courses in english and french were on the schedule . " we had a history block , a run in eight days through german history from 1871 through today , " doktor said . but doktor does n't consider the compact instruction as stress , but rather as a privilege .
after completing his studies in law , the 28-year-old worked in the foreign office for a year - and got hooked . " the ministry of foreign affairs is , of course , an amazing employer , " doktor said .
" there 's no other profession which takes you to so many countries in the world . " being a diplomat is a life decision in order to get one of the 35 spots at the academy , doktor had to compete with some 1,500 other applicants .
he also had to prove in a multi-stage selection process that he is suitable for the diplomatic profession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is germany 's most well-known diplomat " this does n't just include intellectual capabilities and the creativity needed for this job , but also social and intercultural competence , as well as self-confident appearance and motivation , " said head trainer stefan biedermann .
whoever wants to become a diplomat also has to be willing to work in a different country every three years . " that 's why we always speak of a life decision and not a career decision , " biedermann said .
" it affects your private life , your family , relatives and friends so completely , that you should n't talk about a simple career or a job in this case . " doktor has long since made this decision for himself .
he wants to see the world and get to know various cultures .
the thought of living with moving boxes does n't scare him . parties are part of it , too the 35 attachés also spend a lot of their free time together .
doktor said he hoped that the group will go through their respective careers and support and help each other . " you need contacts , not just professionally , but also on a human and social level , " doktor said .
" that is a very important goal that is reached with this training , because we are all here together , celebrating together and doing sports together . " the prospective diplomats thus should n't just be getting to know the finer points of consular work during their year at the academy in tegel , but rather also the other attachés .
trainer biedermann therefore does n't at all object to the many wild parties . " they often go into the early hours of the morning , " biedermann said .

but the road there is a rocky one .
the selection process is tough and only the very best applicants get a position . it does n't get more idyllic than this .
the german foreign ministry 's training academy is based along the woods and fields on the shores of lake tegel in berlin .
it 's there that the country 's prospective diplomats get their final polish before they head off to the embassies in rome , minsk or addis ababa . but do n't be deceived by the scenery .
there 's a lot of hard work at the academy and the timetable is full to the brink . christian doktor is one of the 35 attachés here .
for one year , the academy is intensely preparing him and the other future diplomats for their job serving germany 's foreign policies . whoever has made it here already has a university degree - and gets a one-year crash course in diplomacy on top of it .
according to doktor , it started off with learning how to communicate within a group and in public .
then rhetoric and language courses in english and french were on the schedule . " we had a history block , a run in eight days through german history from 1871 through today , " doktor said . but doktor does n't consider the compact instruction as stress , but rather as a privilege .

europeans face the specter of a growing terrorist threat in their midst .
on the two-year anniversary of the london train bombings , great britain can no longer ignore its disaffected muslim communities . the united kingdom has faced more attacks than any other eu country or the united states .
since september 11 , 2001 , islamic extremists have carried out at least four major terrorist attacks on british soil . in the us , by contrast , only one successful attack motivated by islamic jihad was carried out in late 2001 , when letters tainted with a lethal strain of the anthrax virus killed five people . in an effort to explain why the uk has become a more frequent target of terrorism than the us , analysts have cited the failure of european states to integrate their muslim populations into mainstream society . " these are not terror cells operating across borders or exporting holy warriors from the middle east , " said professor hans giessmann of the university of hamburg .
the incidents in london , glasgow , madrid and other european cities " have been carried out across the board by homegrown terrorists . " " what we are dealing with here is a spill-over of extremist ideologies into disenfranchised communities within our midst , " giessmann said , suggesting that many of the two million arabs living in the uk have failed to adapt to the british way of life . parallel societies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breeding ground : a tight-knit muslim community in leeds , england a security expert at the london-based limehouse group , hazhir teimourian , blames england 's liberal immigration policies .
" this government has done enormous damage with its lax policy on immigration , " he said . teimourian said the labor government under former prime minister tony blair " has given islamists from all over the world the freedom to set up shop in england . " " the result , " he says , " is an increasing ghettoization and alienation of these communities , " rendering them highly susceptible to radical islamic ideologies such as the brand of suicidal jihad -lrb- holy war -rrb- preached by al qaeda . giessmann agrees that a false sense of tolerance in europe has led to the emergence of parallel societies where many do n't speak the national language . " these communities do n't have an integrated existence , and that makes them susceptible to various forms of radicalization , " he said . especially the second and third-generation immigrants - children of the original migrants who came to england after world war two - have become increasingly sensitized by 9/11 and the wars in iraq and afghanistan .
teimourian said some of these youths were even turning on their parents for " not being islamic enough . " indeed , none of the seven suspects arrested in connection with last week 's attempted car bomb attacks in london and glasgow are older than 30 . " in germany , too , we have finally recognized that integration does n't function on autopilot , " giessmann said .
" the ' clash of civilizations ' is happening within our own fragmented society , and we have not succeeded in defining a collective identity in the context of a multi-ethnic nation-state . " germany has a large number of muslim immigrants , most of them of turkish descent , who often live in secluded and low-income neighborhoods and have little or no contact with their german peers . in addition , many muslims come from rural backgrounds .
in britain , teimourian observes that " they have a high degree of hatred for western culture because they do n't understand it and feel threatened by it . " teimourian , who himself is an iranian kurd who emigrated to the uk over 50 years ago , decided to raise his own children as christians under the church of england " so that they feel more attached to the european identity . " no " islam town " in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 9/11 raised the profile of america 's 2.35 million muslims american muslim communities are different .
" america is much less tolerant of alienation , " teimourian said , adding that american muslims " are told , at least implicitly , that they must become american . " as a result , american muslims by and large do not live together as entities , according to giessmann .
in that regard , muslims are unlike their chinese , italian or other immigrant counterparts , who came to the us much earlier and formed isolated clusters - " chinatown " or " little italy , " for example .
there is no " islam town " in america . historically speaking , the american muslim community is still in its infancy .
and it is being shaped by community leaders such as zaid shakir , a progressive imam in california who has gained widespread popularity by preaching a moderate brand of islam that meshes well with the american way of life . in a recent interview with us journalist bill moyers , shakir said there was " an american muslim culture emerging , which is very important , because then you can get a unique understanding of the religion that would allow the american muslim to take his or her rightful place amongst the various muslim communities of the world . " but as a percentage of the population , the muslim minority in the us is far smaller than in the uk - 2.35 million muslims live in the continental united states , or less than one percent of the total population .
muslims in great britain make up three percent of the population . furthermore , america 's muslim population is more affluent than in the uk .
" they are more professional and less like peasants , " as teimourian put it .

since september 11 , 2001 , islamic extremists have carried out at least four major terrorist attacks on british soil . in the us , by contrast , only one successful attack motivated by islamic jihad was carried out in late 2001 , when letters tainted with a lethal strain of the anthrax virus killed five people . in an effort to explain why the uk has become a more frequent target of terrorism than the us , analysts have cited the failure of european states to integrate their muslim populations into mainstream society . " these are not terror cells operating across borders or exporting holy warriors from the middle east , " said professor hans giessmann of the university of hamburg .
the incidents in london , glasgow , madrid and other european cities " have been carried out across the board by homegrown terrorists . " " what we are dealing with here is a spill-over of extremist ideologies into disenfranchised communities within our midst , " giessmann said , suggesting that many of the two million arabs living in the uk have failed to adapt to the british way of life . parallel societies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breeding ground : a tight-knit muslim community in leeds , england a security expert at the london-based limehouse group , hazhir teimourian , blames england 's liberal immigration policies .
" this government has done enormous damage with its lax policy on immigration , " he said . teimourian said the labor government under former prime minister tony blair " has given islamists from all over the world the freedom to set up shop in england . " " the result , " he says , " is an increasing ghettoization and alienation of these communities , " rendering them highly susceptible to radical islamic ideologies such as the brand of suicidal jihad -lrb- holy war -rrb- preached by al qaeda . giessmann agrees that a false sense of tolerance in europe has led to the emergence of parallel societies where many do n't speak the national language . " these communities do n't have an integrated existence , and that makes them susceptible to various forms of radicalization , " he said . especially the second and third-generation immigrants - children of the original migrants who came to england after world war two - have become increasingly sensitized by 9/11 and the wars in iraq and afghanistan .
teimourian said some of these youths were even turning on their parents for " not being islamic enough . " indeed , none of the seven suspects arrested in connection with last week 's attempted car bomb attacks in london and glasgow are older than 30 . " in germany , too , we have finally recognized that integration does n't function on autopilot , " giessmann said .
" the ' clash of civilizations ' is happening within our own fragmented society , and we have not succeeded in defining a collective identity in the context of a multi-ethnic nation-state . " germany has a large number of muslim immigrants , most of them of turkish descent , who often live in secluded and low-income neighborhoods and have little or no contact with their german peers . in addition , many muslims come from rural backgrounds .
in britain , teimourian observes that " they have a high degree of hatred for western culture because they do n't understand it and feel threatened by it . " teimourian , who himself is an iranian kurd who emigrated to the uk over 50 years ago , decided to raise his own children as christians under the church of england " so that they feel more attached to the european identity . " no " islam town " in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 9/11 raised the profile of america 's 2.35 million muslims american muslim communities are different .
" america is much less tolerant of alienation , " teimourian said , adding that american muslims " are told , at least implicitly , that they must become american . " as a result , american muslims by and large do not live together as entities , according to giessmann .
in that regard , muslims are unlike their chinese , italian or other immigrant counterparts , who came to the us much earlier and formed isolated clusters - " chinatown " or " little italy , " for example .
there is no " islam town " in america . historically speaking , the american muslim community is still in its infancy .
and it is being shaped by community leaders such as zaid shakir , a progressive imam in california who has gained widespread popularity by preaching a moderate brand of islam that meshes well with the american way of life . in a recent interview with us journalist bill moyers , shakir said there was " an american muslim culture emerging , which is very important , because then you can get a unique understanding of the religion that would allow the american muslim to take his or her rightful place amongst the various muslim communities of the world . " but as a percentage of the population , the muslim minority in the us is far smaller than in the uk - 2.35 million muslims live in the continental united states , or less than one percent of the total population .
muslims in great britain make up three percent of the population . furthermore , america 's muslim population is more affluent than in the uk .
" they are more professional and less like peasants , " as teimourian put it .
and giessmann claims that on average , " these people have been better assimilated into american society . " alex bakst send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it affects your private life , your family , relatives and friends so completely , that you should n't talk about a simple career or a job in this case . " doktor has long since made this decision for himself .
he wants to see the world and get to know various cultures .
the thought of living with moving boxes does n't scare him . parties are part of it , too the 35 attachés also spend a lot of their free time together .

but the road there is a rocky one .
the selection process is tough and only the very best applicants get a position . it does n't get more idyllic than this .
the german foreign ministry 's training academy is based along the woods and fields on the shores of lake tegel in berlin .
it 's there that the country 's prospective diplomats get their final polish before they head off to the embassies in rome , minsk or addis ababa . but do n't be deceived by the scenery .
there 's a lot of hard work at the academy and the timetable is full to the brink . christian doktor is one of the 35 attachés here .
for one year , the academy is intensely preparing him and the other future diplomats for their job serving germany 's foreign policies . whoever has made it here already has a university degree - and gets a one-year crash course in diplomacy on top of it .
according to doktor , it started off with learning how to communicate within a group and in public .
then rhetoric and language courses in english and french were on the schedule . " we had a history block , a run in eight days through german history from 1871 through today , " doktor said . but doktor does n't consider the compact instruction as stress , but rather as a privilege .
after completing his studies in law , the 28-year-old worked in the foreign office for a year - and got hooked . " the ministry of foreign affairs is , of course , an amazing employer , " doktor said .
" there 's no other profession which takes you to so many countries in the world . " being a diplomat is a life decision in order to get one of the 35 spots at the academy , doktor had to compete with some 1,500 other applicants .
he also had to prove in a multi-stage selection process that he is suitable for the diplomatic profession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is germany 's most well-known diplomat " this does n't just include intellectual capabilities and the creativity needed for this job , but also social and intercultural competence , as well as self-confident appearance and motivation , " said head trainer stefan biedermann .
whoever wants to become a diplomat also has to be willing to work in a different country every three years . " that 's why we always speak of a life decision and not a career decision , " biedermann said .
" it affects your private life , your family , relatives and friends so completely , that you should n't talk about a simple career or a job in this case . " doktor has long since made this decision for himself .
he wants to see the world and get to know various cultures .
the thought of living with moving boxes does n't scare him . parties are part of it , too the 35 attachés also spend a lot of their free time together .
doktor said he hoped that the group will go through their respective careers and support and help each other . " you need contacts , not just professionally , but also on a human and social level , " doktor said .
" that is a very important goal that is reached with this training , because we are all here together , celebrating together and doing sports together . " the prospective diplomats thus should n't just be getting to know the finer points of consular work during their year at the academy in tegel , but rather also the other attachés .
trainer biedermann therefore does n't at all object to the many wild parties . " they often go into the early hours of the morning , " biedermann said .
" the training supervisors only demand that at eight the next morning , everyone is back in the classroom in tie and suit , keeping a stiff upper lip - or countenance , as the diplomat calls it .

europeans face the specter of a growing terrorist threat in their midst .
on the two-year anniversary of the london train bombings , great britain can no longer ignore its disaffected muslim communities . the united kingdom has faced more attacks than any other eu country or the united states .
since september 11 , 2001 , islamic extremists have carried out at least four major terrorist attacks on british soil . in the us , by contrast , only one successful attack motivated by islamic jihad was carried out in late 2001 , when letters tainted with a lethal strain of the anthrax virus killed five people . in an effort to explain why the uk has become a more frequent target of terrorism than the us , analysts have cited the failure of european states to integrate their muslim populations into mainstream society . " these are not terror cells operating across borders or exporting holy warriors from the middle east , " said professor hans giessmann of the university of hamburg .
the incidents in london , glasgow , madrid and other european cities " have been carried out across the board by homegrown terrorists . " " what we are dealing with here is a spill-over of extremist ideologies into disenfranchised communities within our midst , " giessmann said , suggesting that many of the two million arabs living in the uk have failed to adapt to the british way of life . parallel societies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breeding ground : a tight-knit muslim community in leeds , england a security expert at the london-based limehouse group , hazhir teimourian , blames england 's liberal immigration policies .
" this government has done enormous damage with its lax policy on immigration , " he said . teimourian said the labor government under former prime minister tony blair " has given islamists from all over the world the freedom to set up shop in england . " " the result , " he says , " is an increasing ghettoization and alienation of these communities , " rendering them highly susceptible to radical islamic ideologies such as the brand of suicidal jihad -lrb- holy war -rrb- preached by al qaeda . giessmann agrees that a false sense of tolerance in europe has led to the emergence of parallel societies where many do n't speak the national language . " these communities do n't have an integrated existence , and that makes them susceptible to various forms of radicalization , " he said . especially the second and third-generation immigrants - children of the original migrants who came to england after world war two - have become increasingly sensitized by 9/11 and the wars in iraq and afghanistan .
teimourian said some of these youths were even turning on their parents for " not being islamic enough . " indeed , none of the seven suspects arrested in connection with last week 's attempted car bomb attacks in london and glasgow are older than 30 . " in germany , too , we have finally recognized that integration does n't function on autopilot , " giessmann said .
" the ' clash of civilizations ' is happening within our own fragmented society , and we have not succeeded in defining a collective identity in the context of a multi-ethnic nation-state . " germany has a large number of muslim immigrants , most of them of turkish descent , who often live in secluded and low-income neighborhoods and have little or no contact with their german peers . in addition , many muslims come from rural backgrounds .
in britain , teimourian observes that " they have a high degree of hatred for western culture because they do n't understand it and feel threatened by it . " teimourian , who himself is an iranian kurd who emigrated to the uk over 50 years ago , decided to raise his own children as christians under the church of england " so that they feel more attached to the european identity . " no " islam town " in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 9/11 raised the profile of america 's 2.35 million muslims american muslim communities are different .
" america is much less tolerant of alienation , " teimourian said , adding that american muslims " are told , at least implicitly , that they must become american . " as a result , american muslims by and large do not live together as entities , according to giessmann .
in that regard , muslims are unlike their chinese , italian or other immigrant counterparts , who came to the us much earlier and formed isolated clusters - " chinatown " or " little italy , " for example .
there is no " islam town " in america . historically speaking , the american muslim community is still in its infancy .
and it is being shaped by community leaders such as zaid shakir , a progressive imam in california who has gained widespread popularity by preaching a moderate brand of islam that meshes well with the american way of life . in a recent interview with us journalist bill moyers , shakir said there was " an american muslim culture emerging , which is very important , because then you can get a unique understanding of the religion that would allow the american muslim to take his or her rightful place amongst the various muslim communities of the world . " but as a percentage of the population , the muslim minority in the us is far smaller than in the uk - 2.35 million muslims live in the continental united states , or less than one percent of the total population .
muslims in great britain make up three percent of the population . furthermore , america 's muslim population is more affluent than in the uk .
" they are more professional and less like peasants , " as teimourian put it .
and giessmann claims that on average , " these people have been better assimilated into american society . " alex bakst send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 07.07.2007 germany 's training ground for diplomats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being a diplomat is about more than just shaking hands working in various countries as a diplomat is a dream career for many german university graduates .
but the road there is a rocky one .
the selection process is tough and only the very best applicants get a position . it does n't get more idyllic than this .
the german foreign ministry 's training academy is based along the woods and fields on the shores of lake tegel in berlin .
it 's there that the country 's prospective diplomats get their final polish before they head off to the embassies in rome , minsk or addis ababa . but do n't be deceived by the scenery .
there 's a lot of hard work at the academy and the timetable is full to the brink . christian doktor is one of the 35 attachés here .
for one year , the academy is intensely preparing him and the other future diplomats for their job serving germany 's foreign policies . whoever has made it here already has a university degree - and gets a one-year crash course in diplomacy on top of it .
according to doktor , it started off with learning how to communicate within a group and in public .
then rhetoric and language courses in english and french were on the schedule . " we had a history block , a run in eight days through german history from 1871 through today , " doktor said . but doktor does n't consider the compact instruction as stress , but rather as a privilege .
after completing his studies in law , the 28-year-old worked in the foreign office for a year - and got hooked . " the ministry of foreign affairs is , of course , an amazing employer , " doktor said .
" there 's no other profession which takes you to so many countries in the world . " being a diplomat is a life decision in order to get one of the 35 spots at the academy , doktor had to compete with some 1,500 other applicants .
he also had to prove in a multi-stage selection process that he is suitable for the diplomatic profession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is germany 's most well-known diplomat " this does n't just include intellectual capabilities and the creativity needed for this job , but also social and intercultural competence , as well as self-confident appearance and motivation , " said head trainer stefan biedermann .
whoever wants to become a diplomat also has to be willing to work in a different country every three years . " that 's why we always speak of a life decision and not a career decision , " biedermann said .
" it affects your private life , your family , relatives and friends so completely , that you should n't talk about a simple career or a job in this case . " doktor has long since made this decision for himself .
he wants to see the world and get to know various cultures .
the thought of living with moving boxes does n't scare him . parties are part of it , too the 35 attachés also spend a lot of their free time together .
doktor said he hoped that the group will go through their respective careers and support and help each other . " you need contacts , not just professionally , but also on a human and social level , " doktor said .
" that is a very important goal that is reached with this training , because we are all here together , celebrating together and doing sports together . " the prospective diplomats thus should n't just be getting to know the finer points of consular work during their year at the academy in tegel , but rather also the other attachés .
trainer biedermann therefore does n't at all object to the many wild parties . " they often go into the early hours of the morning , " biedermann said .
" the training supervisors only demand that at eight the next morning , everyone is back in the classroom in tie and suit , keeping a stiff upper lip - or countenance , as the diplomat calls it .

" even after the revolution it was hard to get money , " he said .
" in many cases it was a fight with a system that was very corrupt .
it was a continuing fight . " however , romania has been helping to lead a revival in filmmaking in the region and a renewed global interest in a movie business that has produced some of the most pioneering figures in global cinema . in particular , this follows the success of cristian mungiu 's " 4 months , 3 weeks , 2 days " in winning the prestigious palme d 'or prize at cannes , which has also helped generate renewed interest among local audiences across cee in films made by national directors . seven years ago , no films were being made in romania , yet now the nation manages to pump out between 10 and 20 feature films a year . fresh and innovative underscoring the arrival of cee 's new generation of filmmakers , three czech feature movies and two animated films were included in the official program of this year 's berlin film festival .
poland 's gdynia film festival last year included 30 entries from debut directors . " they have a fresh and innovative approach towards filmmaking .
some of them have even invented a new film language , " said eva vezer , general manager of magyar filmunio , hungary 's film promotion board and a member of the european film promotion board , describing the region 's new wave of filmmakers . dashed hopes what is more , the new cee cinema appears to have emerged just as the dreams were fading across the region about what the fall of communism might have led to . the result has been that many of the region 's directors have been retracing the events surrounding the fall of communism and the new social values that have taken shape . this became clear from the films screened at this year 's karlovy vary film festival , which showcases films from cee . these include movies such as " dolina " by hungarian director zoltan kamondi , about the takeover of a town by authoritarian forces , " simple things " by russian director alexey popogrebsky , on personal turmoil set against urban life in st. petersburg , and " hope " by polish director stanislaw mucha . hope portrays a struggle between money and a less materialist view of the world as a young man tries to negotiate with the thief who stole a rare painting from a warsaw church to return the work of art . another polish film screened in karlovy vary is " saviour 's square " from directors krzysztof krauze and joanna kos-krauze , which touched on the role of women in post-communist eastern europe . the communist legacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today there are few traces of communism left in europe zoltan kamondi believes that , despite having lived under democracy , the basic instincts of many people in everyday life have not changed since the days when they were still living in a dictatorship . celebrations last year marking the 50th anniversary of the hungarian revolution also gave the nation 's film-makers the chance to look back on their country 's battle to chart a more independent course . even directors such as elke hauck , who grew up under the communism in east germany have sought to explore how east germans have managed to adjust to the new world that emerged following the fall of theberlin wall . in her debut film , " karger , " the hero finds he needs to make some radical changes to his life after it lurches into a crisis . but drawing on largely unprofessional cast , one of the main characters told a press conference following a screening of the film in karlovy vary that she found it relatively easy to play her role . like her character , anja dietrich said : ' i am looking for a job right now .

" however , romania has been helping to lead a revival in filmmaking in the region and a renewed global interest in a movie business that has produced some of the most pioneering figures in global cinema . in particular , this follows the success of cristian mungiu 's " 4 months , 3 weeks , 2 days " in winning the prestigious palme d 'or prize at cannes , which has also helped generate renewed interest among local audiences across cee in films made by national directors . seven years ago , no films were being made in romania , yet now the nation manages to pump out between 10 and 20 feature films a year . fresh and innovative underscoring the arrival of cee 's new generation of filmmakers , three czech feature movies and two animated films were included in the official program of this year 's berlin film festival .
poland 's gdynia film festival last year included 30 entries from debut directors . " they have a fresh and innovative approach towards filmmaking .
some of them have even invented a new film language , " said eva vezer , general manager of magyar filmunio , hungary 's film promotion board and a member of the european film promotion board , describing the region 's new wave of filmmakers . dashed hopes what is more , the new cee cinema appears to have emerged just as the dreams were fading across the region about what the fall of communism might have led to . the result has been that many of the region 's directors have been retracing the events surrounding the fall of communism and the new social values that have taken shape . this became clear from the films screened at this year 's karlovy vary film festival , which showcases films from cee . these include movies such as " dolina " by hungarian director zoltan kamondi , about the takeover of a town by authoritarian forces , " simple things " by russian director alexey popogrebsky , on personal turmoil set against urban life in st. petersburg , and " hope " by polish director stanislaw mucha . hope portrays a struggle between money and a less materialist view of the world as a young man tries to negotiate with the thief who stole a rare painting from a warsaw church to return the work of art . another polish film screened in karlovy vary is " saviour 's square " from directors krzysztof krauze and joanna kos-krauze , which touched on the role of women in post-communist eastern europe . the communist legacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today there are few traces of communism left in europe zoltan kamondi believes that , despite having lived under democracy , the basic instincts of many people in everyday life have not changed since the days when they were still living in a dictatorship . celebrations last year marking the 50th anniversary of the hungarian revolution also gave the nation 's film-makers the chance to look back on their country 's battle to chart a more independent course . even directors such as elke hauck , who grew up under the communism in east germany have sought to explore how east germans have managed to adjust to the new world that emerged following the fall of theberlin wall . in her debut film , " karger , " the hero finds he needs to make some radical changes to his life after it lurches into a crisis . but drawing on largely unprofessional cast , one of the main characters told a press conference following a screening of the film in karlovy vary that she found it relatively easy to play her role . like her character , anja dietrich said : ' i am looking for a job right now .

europeans face the specter of a growing terrorist threat in their midst .
on the two-year anniversary of the london train bombings , great britain can no longer ignore its disaffected muslim communities . the united kingdom has faced more attacks than any other eu country or the united states .
since september 11 , 2001 , islamic extremists have carried out at least four major terrorist attacks on british soil . in the us , by contrast , only one successful attack motivated by islamic jihad was carried out in late 2001 , when letters tainted with a lethal strain of the anthrax virus killed five people . in an effort to explain why the uk has become a more frequent target of terrorism than the us , analysts have cited the failure of european states to integrate their muslim populations into mainstream society . " these are not terror cells operating across borders or exporting holy warriors from the middle east , " said professor hans giessmann of the university of hamburg .
the incidents in london , glasgow , madrid and other european cities " have been carried out across the board by homegrown terrorists . " " what we are dealing with here is a spill-over of extremist ideologies into disenfranchised communities within our midst , " giessmann said , suggesting that many of the two million arabs living in the uk have failed to adapt to the british way of life . parallel societies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breeding ground : a tight-knit muslim community in leeds , england a security expert at the london-based limehouse group , hazhir teimourian , blames england 's liberal immigration policies .
" this government has done enormous damage with its lax policy on immigration , " he said . teimourian said the labor government under former prime minister tony blair " has given islamists from all over the world the freedom to set up shop in england . " " the result , " he says , " is an increasing ghettoization and alienation of these communities , " rendering them highly susceptible to radical islamic ideologies such as the brand of suicidal jihad -lrb- holy war -rrb- preached by al qaeda . giessmann agrees that a false sense of tolerance in europe has led to the emergence of parallel societies where many do n't speak the national language . " these communities do n't have an integrated existence , and that makes them susceptible to various forms of radicalization , " he said . especially the second and third-generation immigrants - children of the original migrants who came to england after world war two - have become increasingly sensitized by 9/11 and the wars in iraq and afghanistan .
teimourian said some of these youths were even turning on their parents for " not being islamic enough . " indeed , none of the seven suspects arrested in connection with last week 's attempted car bomb attacks in london and glasgow are older than 30 . " in germany , too , we have finally recognized that integration does n't function on autopilot , " giessmann said .
" the ' clash of civilizations ' is happening within our own fragmented society , and we have not succeeded in defining a collective identity in the context of a multi-ethnic nation-state . " germany has a large number of muslim immigrants , most of them of turkish descent , who often live in secluded and low-income neighborhoods and have little or no contact with their german peers . in addition , many muslims come from rural backgrounds .
in britain , teimourian observes that " they have a high degree of hatred for western culture because they do n't understand it and feel threatened by it . " teimourian , who himself is an iranian kurd who emigrated to the uk over 50 years ago , decided to raise his own children as christians under the church of england " so that they feel more attached to the european identity . " no " islam town " in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 9/11 raised the profile of america 's 2.35 million muslims american muslim communities are different .
" america is much less tolerant of alienation , " teimourian said , adding that american muslims " are told , at least implicitly , that they must become american . " as a result , american muslims by and large do not live together as entities , according to giessmann .
in that regard , muslims are unlike their chinese , italian or other immigrant counterparts , who came to the us much earlier and formed isolated clusters - " chinatown " or " little italy , " for example .
there is no " islam town " in america . historically speaking , the american muslim community is still in its infancy .
and it is being shaped by community leaders such as zaid shakir , a progressive imam in california who has gained widespread popularity by preaching a moderate brand of islam that meshes well with the american way of life . in a recent interview with us journalist bill moyers , shakir said there was " an american muslim culture emerging , which is very important , because then you can get a unique understanding of the religion that would allow the american muslim to take his or her rightful place amongst the various muslim communities of the world . " but as a percentage of the population , the muslim minority in the us is far smaller than in the uk - 2.35 million muslims live in the continental united states , or less than one percent of the total population .
muslims in great britain make up three percent of the population . furthermore , america 's muslim population is more affluent than in the uk .

since september 11 , 2001 , islamic extremists have carried out at least four major terrorist attacks on british soil . in the us , by contrast , only one successful attack motivated by islamic jihad was carried out in late 2001 , when letters tainted with a lethal strain of the anthrax virus killed five people . in an effort to explain why the uk has become a more frequent target of terrorism than the us , analysts have cited the failure of european states to integrate their muslim populations into mainstream society . " these are not terror cells operating across borders or exporting holy warriors from the middle east , " said professor hans giessmann of the university of hamburg .
the incidents in london , glasgow , madrid and other european cities " have been carried out across the board by homegrown terrorists . " " what we are dealing with here is a spill-over of extremist ideologies into disenfranchised communities within our midst , " giessmann said , suggesting that many of the two million arabs living in the uk have failed to adapt to the british way of life . parallel societies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breeding ground : a tight-knit muslim community in leeds , england a security expert at the london-based limehouse group , hazhir teimourian , blames england 's liberal immigration policies .
" this government has done enormous damage with its lax policy on immigration , " he said . teimourian said the labor government under former prime minister tony blair " has given islamists from all over the world the freedom to set up shop in england . " " the result , " he says , " is an increasing ghettoization and alienation of these communities , " rendering them highly susceptible to radical islamic ideologies such as the brand of suicidal jihad -lrb- holy war -rrb- preached by al qaeda . giessmann agrees that a false sense of tolerance in europe has led to the emergence of parallel societies where many do n't speak the national language . " these communities do n't have an integrated existence , and that makes them susceptible to various forms of radicalization , " he said . especially the second and third-generation immigrants - children of the original migrants who came to england after world war two - have become increasingly sensitized by 9/11 and the wars in iraq and afghanistan .
teimourian said some of these youths were even turning on their parents for " not being islamic enough . " indeed , none of the seven suspects arrested in connection with last week 's attempted car bomb attacks in london and glasgow are older than 30 . " in germany , too , we have finally recognized that integration does n't function on autopilot , " giessmann said .
" the ' clash of civilizations ' is happening within our own fragmented society , and we have not succeeded in defining a collective identity in the context of a multi-ethnic nation-state . " germany has a large number of muslim immigrants , most of them of turkish descent , who often live in secluded and low-income neighborhoods and have little or no contact with their german peers . in addition , many muslims come from rural backgrounds .
in britain , teimourian observes that " they have a high degree of hatred for western culture because they do n't understand it and feel threatened by it . " teimourian , who himself is an iranian kurd who emigrated to the uk over 50 years ago , decided to raise his own children as christians under the church of england " so that they feel more attached to the european identity .

in that regard , muslims are unlike their chinese , italian or other immigrant counterparts , who came to the us much earlier and formed isolated clusters - " chinatown " or " little italy , " for example .
there is no " islam town " in america . historically speaking , the american muslim community is still in its infancy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 07.07.2007 germany 's training ground for diplomats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being a diplomat is about more than just shaking hands working in various countries as a diplomat is a dream career for many german university graduates .
but the road there is a rocky one .
the selection process is tough and only the very best applicants get a position . it does n't get more idyllic than this .
the german foreign ministry 's training academy is based along the woods and fields on the shores of lake tegel in berlin .
it 's there that the country 's prospective diplomats get their final polish before they head off to the embassies in rome , minsk or addis ababa . but do n't be deceived by the scenery .
there 's a lot of hard work at the academy and the timetable is full to the brink . christian doktor is one of the 35 attachés here .
for one year , the academy is intensely preparing him and the other future diplomats for their job serving germany 's foreign policies . whoever has made it here already has a university degree - and gets a one-year crash course in diplomacy on top of it .
according to doktor , it started off with learning how to communicate within a group and in public .
then rhetoric and language courses in english and french were on the schedule . " we had a history block , a run in eight days through german history from 1871 through today , " doktor said . but doktor does n't consider the compact instruction as stress , but rather as a privilege .
after completing his studies in law , the 28-year-old worked in the foreign office for a year - and got hooked . " the ministry of foreign affairs is , of course , an amazing employer , " doktor said .
" there 's no other profession which takes you to so many countries in the world . " being a diplomat is a life decision in order to get one of the 35 spots at the academy , doktor had to compete with some 1,500 other applicants .
he also had to prove in a multi-stage selection process that he is suitable for the diplomatic profession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is germany 's most well-known diplomat " this does n't just include intellectual capabilities and the creativity needed for this job , but also social and intercultural competence , as well as self-confident appearance and motivation , " said head trainer stefan biedermann .
whoever wants to become a diplomat also has to be willing to work in a different country every three years . " that 's why we always speak of a life decision and not a career decision , " biedermann said .
" it affects your private life , your family , relatives and friends so completely , that you should n't talk about a simple career or a job in this case . " doktor has long since made this decision for himself .
he wants to see the world and get to know various cultures .
the thought of living with moving boxes does n't scare him . parties are part of it , too the 35 attachés also spend a lot of their free time together .
doktor said he hoped that the group will go through their respective careers and support and help each other . " you need contacts , not just professionally , but also on a human and social level , " doktor said .
" that is a very important goal that is reached with this training , because we are all here together , celebrating together and doing sports together . " the prospective diplomats thus should n't just be getting to know the finer points of consular work during their year at the academy in tegel , but rather also the other attachés .
trainer biedermann therefore does n't at all object to the many wild parties . " they often go into the early hours of the morning , " biedermann said .
" the training supervisors only demand that at eight the next morning , everyone is back in the classroom in tie and suit , keeping a stiff upper lip - or countenance , as the diplomat calls it .

europeans face the specter of a growing terrorist threat in their midst .
on the two-year anniversary of the london train bombings , great britain can no longer ignore its disaffected muslim communities . the united kingdom has faced more attacks than any other eu country or the united states .
since september 11 , 2001 , islamic extremists have carried out at least four major terrorist attacks on british soil . in the us , by contrast , only one successful attack motivated by islamic jihad was carried out in late 2001 , when letters tainted with a lethal strain of the anthrax virus killed five people . in an effort to explain why the uk has become a more frequent target of terrorism than the us , analysts have cited the failure of european states to integrate their muslim populations into mainstream society . " these are not terror cells operating across borders or exporting holy warriors from the middle east , " said professor hans giessmann of the university of hamburg .
the incidents in london , glasgow , madrid and other european cities " have been carried out across the board by homegrown terrorists . " " what we are dealing with here is a spill-over of extremist ideologies into disenfranchised communities within our midst , " giessmann said , suggesting that many of the two million arabs living in the uk have failed to adapt to the british way of life . parallel societies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breeding ground : a tight-knit muslim community in leeds , england a security expert at the london-based limehouse group , hazhir teimourian , blames england 's liberal immigration policies .
" this government has done enormous damage with its lax policy on immigration , " he said . teimourian said the labor government under former prime minister tony blair " has given islamists from all over the world the freedom to set up shop in england . " " the result , " he says , " is an increasing ghettoization and alienation of these communities , " rendering them highly susceptible to radical islamic ideologies such as the brand of suicidal jihad -lrb- holy war -rrb- preached by al qaeda . giessmann agrees that a false sense of tolerance in europe has led to the emergence of parallel societies where many do n't speak the national language . " these communities do n't have an integrated existence , and that makes them susceptible to various forms of radicalization , " he said . especially the second and third-generation immigrants - children of the original migrants who came to england after world war two - have become increasingly sensitized by 9/11 and the wars in iraq and afghanistan .
teimourian said some of these youths were even turning on their parents for " not being islamic enough . " indeed , none of the seven suspects arrested in connection with last week 's attempted car bomb attacks in london and glasgow are older than 30 . " in germany , too , we have finally recognized that integration does n't function on autopilot , " giessmann said .
" the ' clash of civilizations ' is happening within our own fragmented society , and we have not succeeded in defining a collective identity in the context of a multi-ethnic nation-state . " germany has a large number of muslim immigrants , most of them of turkish descent , who often live in secluded and low-income neighborhoods and have little or no contact with their german peers . in addition , many muslims come from rural backgrounds .
in britain , teimourian observes that " they have a high degree of hatred for western culture because they do n't understand it and feel threatened by it . " teimourian , who himself is an iranian kurd who emigrated to the uk over 50 years ago , decided to raise his own children as christians under the church of england " so that they feel more attached to the european identity . " no " islam town " in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 9/11 raised the profile of america 's 2.35 million muslims american muslim communities are different .
" america is much less tolerant of alienation , " teimourian said , adding that american muslims " are told , at least implicitly , that they must become american . " as a result , american muslims by and large do not live together as entities , according to giessmann .
in that regard , muslims are unlike their chinese , italian or other immigrant counterparts , who came to the us much earlier and formed isolated clusters - " chinatown " or " little italy , " for example .
there is no " islam town " in america . historically speaking , the american muslim community is still in its infancy .
and it is being shaped by community leaders such as zaid shakir , a progressive imam in california who has gained widespread popularity by preaching a moderate brand of islam that meshes well with the american way of life . in a recent interview with us journalist bill moyers , shakir said there was " an american muslim culture emerging , which is very important , because then you can get a unique understanding of the religion that would allow the american muslim to take his or her rightful place amongst the various muslim communities of the world . " but as a percentage of the population , the muslim minority in the us is far smaller than in the uk - 2.35 million muslims live in the continental united states , or less than one percent of the total population .
muslims in great britain make up three percent of the population . furthermore , america 's muslim population is more affluent than in the uk .
" they are more professional and less like peasants , " as teimourian put it .

europeans face the specter of a growing terrorist threat in their midst .
on the two-year anniversary of the london train bombings , great britain can no longer ignore its disaffected muslim communities . the united kingdom has faced more attacks than any other eu country or the united states .
since september 11 , 2001 , islamic extremists have carried out at least four major terrorist attacks on british soil . in the us , by contrast , only one successful attack motivated by islamic jihad was carried out in late 2001 , when letters tainted with a lethal strain of the anthrax virus killed five people . in an effort to explain why the uk has become a more frequent target of terrorism than the us , analysts have cited the failure of european states to integrate their muslim populations into mainstream society . " these are not terror cells operating across borders or exporting holy warriors from the middle east , " said professor hans giessmann of the university of hamburg .
the incidents in london , glasgow , madrid and other european cities " have been carried out across the board by homegrown terrorists . " " what we are dealing with here is a spill-over of extremist ideologies into disenfranchised communities within our midst , " giessmann said , suggesting that many of the two million arabs living in the uk have failed to adapt to the british way of life . parallel societies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breeding ground : a tight-knit muslim community in leeds , england a security expert at the london-based limehouse group , hazhir teimourian , blames england 's liberal immigration policies .
" this government has done enormous damage with its lax policy on immigration , " he said . teimourian said the labor government under former prime minister tony blair " has given islamists from all over the world the freedom to set up shop in england . " " the result , " he says , " is an increasing ghettoization and alienation of these communities , " rendering them highly susceptible to radical islamic ideologies such as the brand of suicidal jihad -lrb- holy war -rrb- preached by al qaeda . giessmann agrees that a false sense of tolerance in europe has led to the emergence of parallel societies where many do n't speak the national language . " these communities do n't have an integrated existence , and that makes them susceptible to various forms of radicalization , " he said . especially the second and third-generation immigrants - children of the original migrants who came to england after world war two - have become increasingly sensitized by 9/11 and the wars in iraq and afghanistan .
teimourian said some of these youths were even turning on their parents for " not being islamic enough . " indeed , none of the seven suspects arrested in connection with last week 's attempted car bomb attacks in london and glasgow are older than 30 . " in germany , too , we have finally recognized that integration does n't function on autopilot , " giessmann said .
" the ' clash of civilizations ' is happening within our own fragmented society , and we have not succeeded in defining a collective identity in the context of a multi-ethnic nation-state . " germany has a large number of muslim immigrants , most of them of turkish descent , who often live in secluded and low-income neighborhoods and have little or no contact with their german peers . in addition , many muslims come from rural backgrounds .
in britain , teimourian observes that " they have a high degree of hatred for western culture because they do n't understand it and feel threatened by it . " teimourian , who himself is an iranian kurd who emigrated to the uk over 50 years ago , decided to raise his own children as christians under the church of england " so that they feel more attached to the european identity . " no " islam town " in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 9/11 raised the profile of america 's 2.35 million muslims american muslim communities are different .
" america is much less tolerant of alienation , " teimourian said , adding that american muslims " are told , at least implicitly , that they must become american . " as a result , american muslims by and large do not live together as entities , according to giessmann .
in that regard , muslims are unlike their chinese , italian or other immigrant counterparts , who came to the us much earlier and formed isolated clusters - " chinatown " or " little italy , " for example .
there is no " islam town " in america . historically speaking , the american muslim community is still in its infancy .
and it is being shaped by community leaders such as zaid shakir , a progressive imam in california who has gained widespread popularity by preaching a moderate brand of islam that meshes well with the american way of life . in a recent interview with us journalist bill moyers , shakir said there was " an american muslim culture emerging , which is very important , because then you can get a unique understanding of the religion that would allow the american muslim to take his or her rightful place amongst the various muslim communities of the world . " but as a percentage of the population , the muslim minority in the us is far smaller than in the uk - 2.35 million muslims live in the continental united states , or less than one percent of the total population .
muslims in great britain make up three percent of the population . furthermore , america 's muslim population is more affluent than in the uk .
" they are more professional and less like peasants , " as teimourian put it .
and giessmann claims that on average , " these people have been better assimilated into american society . " alex bakst send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the road there is a rocky one .
the selection process is tough and only the very best applicants get a position . it does n't get more idyllic than this .
the german foreign ministry 's training academy is based along the woods and fields on the shores of lake tegel in berlin .
it 's there that the country 's prospective diplomats get their final polish before they head off to the embassies in rome , minsk or addis ababa . but do n't be deceived by the scenery .
there 's a lot of hard work at the academy and the timetable is full to the brink . christian doktor is one of the 35 attachés here .
for one year , the academy is intensely preparing him and the other future diplomats for their job serving germany 's foreign policies . whoever has made it here already has a university degree - and gets a one-year crash course in diplomacy on top of it .
according to doktor , it started off with learning how to communicate within a group and in public .
then rhetoric and language courses in english and french were on the schedule . " we had a history block , a run in eight days through german history from 1871 through today , " doktor said . but doktor does n't consider the compact instruction as stress , but rather as a privilege .
after completing his studies in law , the 28-year-old worked in the foreign office for a year - and got hooked . " the ministry of foreign affairs is , of course , an amazing employer , " doktor said .
" there 's no other profession which takes you to so many countries in the world . " being a diplomat is a life decision in order to get one of the 35 spots at the academy , doktor had to compete with some 1,500 other applicants .
he also had to prove in a multi-stage selection process that he is suitable for the diplomatic profession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is germany 's most well-known diplomat " this does n't just include intellectual capabilities and the creativity needed for this job , but also social and intercultural competence , as well as self-confident appearance and motivation , " said head trainer stefan biedermann .
whoever wants to become a diplomat also has to be willing to work in a different country every three years . " that 's why we always speak of a life decision and not a career decision , " biedermann said .
" it affects your private life , your family , relatives and friends so completely , that you should n't talk about a simple career or a job in this case . " doktor has long since made this decision for himself .
he wants to see the world and get to know various cultures .
the thought of living with moving boxes does n't scare him . parties are part of it , too the 35 attachés also spend a lot of their free time together .
doktor said he hoped that the group will go through their respective careers and support and help each other . " you need contacts , not just professionally , but also on a human and social level , " doktor said .
" that is a very important goal that is reached with this training , because we are all here together , celebrating together and doing sports together . " the prospective diplomats thus should n't just be getting to know the finer points of consular work during their year at the academy in tegel , but rather also the other attachés .
trainer biedermann therefore does n't at all object to the many wild parties . " they often go into the early hours of the morning , " biedermann said .
" the training supervisors only demand that at eight the next morning , everyone is back in the classroom in tie and suit , keeping a stiff upper lip - or countenance , as the diplomat calls it .

but many have refused to let themselves be cowed . first , the collapse of the soviet union dragged movie-making throughout the region to the brink of a financial abyss .
then , as privatization took off , cinemas began closing and were converted to sex clubs and discos . a short time later , a new and potentially more lethal rival appeared on the scene , with hollywood movies starting to fill up the cinemas that had survived the end of communism , further undercutting hopes of an early rebound in the local film business . but as the more recent years have shown , filmmakers in central and eastern europe -lrb- cee -rrb- have been remarkably resilient .
a new generation of directors is now emerging to help shape a modern cinema that in many cases explore the changes that were unleashed by the revolutions that swept away decades of stalinism in 1989 . romania leads the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's come a long way since communism " many of these filmmakers accumulated ideas and frustrations , " said mihai gligor of the romanian film promotion association . " even after the revolution it was hard to get money , " he said .
" in many cases it was a fight with a system that was very corrupt .
it was a continuing fight .

but the road there is a rocky one .
the selection process is tough and only the very best applicants get a position . it does n't get more idyllic than this .
the german foreign ministry 's training academy is based along the woods and fields on the shores of lake tegel in berlin .
it 's there that the country 's prospective diplomats get their final polish before they head off to the embassies in rome , minsk or addis ababa . but do n't be deceived by the scenery .
there 's a lot of hard work at the academy and the timetable is full to the brink . christian doktor is one of the 35 attachés here .
for one year , the academy is intensely preparing him and the other future diplomats for their job serving germany 's foreign policies . whoever has made it here already has a university degree - and gets a one-year crash course in diplomacy on top of it .
according to doktor , it started off with learning how to communicate within a group and in public .
then rhetoric and language courses in english and french were on the schedule . " we had a history block , a run in eight days through german history from 1871 through today , " doktor said . but doktor does n't consider the compact instruction as stress , but rather as a privilege .
after completing his studies in law , the 28-year-old worked in the foreign office for a year - and got hooked . " the ministry of foreign affairs is , of course , an amazing employer , " doktor said .
" there 's no other profession which takes you to so many countries in the world . " being a diplomat is a life decision in order to get one of the 35 spots at the academy , doktor had to compete with some 1,500 other applicants .
he also had to prove in a multi-stage selection process that he is suitable for the diplomatic profession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is germany 's most well-known diplomat " this does n't just include intellectual capabilities and the creativity needed for this job , but also social and intercultural competence , as well as self-confident appearance and motivation , " said head trainer stefan biedermann .
whoever wants to become a diplomat also has to be willing to work in a different country every three years . " that 's why we always speak of a life decision and not a career decision , " biedermann said .
" it affects your private life , your family , relatives and friends so completely , that you should n't talk about a simple career or a job in this case . " doktor has long since made this decision for himself .
he wants to see the world and get to know various cultures .
the thought of living with moving boxes does n't scare him . parties are part of it , too the 35 attachés also spend a lot of their free time together .
doktor said he hoped that the group will go through their respective careers and support and help each other . " you need contacts , not just professionally , but also on a human and social level , " doktor said .
" that is a very important goal that is reached with this training , because we are all here together , celebrating together and doing sports together . " the prospective diplomats thus should n't just be getting to know the finer points of consular work during their year at the academy in tegel , but rather also the other attachés .
trainer biedermann therefore does n't at all object to the many wild parties . " they often go into the early hours of the morning , " biedermann said .
" the training supervisors only demand that at eight the next morning , everyone is back in the classroom in tie and suit , keeping a stiff upper lip - or countenance , as the diplomat calls it .

europeans face the specter of a growing terrorist threat in their midst .
on the two-year anniversary of the london train bombings , great britain can no longer ignore its disaffected muslim communities . the united kingdom has faced more attacks than any other eu country or the united states .
since september 11 , 2001 , islamic extremists have carried out at least four major terrorist attacks on british soil . in the us , by contrast , only one successful attack motivated by islamic jihad was carried out in late 2001 , when letters tainted with a lethal strain of the anthrax virus killed five people . in an effort to explain why the uk has become a more frequent target of terrorism than the us , analysts have cited the failure of european states to integrate their muslim populations into mainstream society . " these are not terror cells operating across borders or exporting holy warriors from the middle east , " said professor hans giessmann of the university of hamburg .
the incidents in london , glasgow , madrid and other european cities " have been carried out across the board by homegrown terrorists . " " what we are dealing with here is a spill-over of extremist ideologies into disenfranchised communities within our midst , " giessmann said , suggesting that many of the two million arabs living in the uk have failed to adapt to the british way of life . parallel societies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breeding ground : a tight-knit muslim community in leeds , england a security expert at the london-based limehouse group , hazhir teimourian , blames england 's liberal immigration policies .
" this government has done enormous damage with its lax policy on immigration , " he said . teimourian said the labor government under former prime minister tony blair " has given islamists from all over the world the freedom to set up shop in england . " " the result , " he says , " is an increasing ghettoization and alienation of these communities , " rendering them highly susceptible to radical islamic ideologies such as the brand of suicidal jihad -lrb- holy war -rrb- preached by al qaeda . giessmann agrees that a false sense of tolerance in europe has led to the emergence of parallel societies where many do n't speak the national language . " these communities do n't have an integrated existence , and that makes them susceptible to various forms of radicalization , " he said . especially the second and third-generation immigrants - children of the original migrants who came to england after world war two - have become increasingly sensitized by 9/11 and the wars in iraq and afghanistan .

europeans face the specter of a growing terrorist threat in their midst .
on the two-year anniversary of the london train bombings , great britain can no longer ignore its disaffected muslim communities . the united kingdom has faced more attacks than any other eu country or the united states .
since september 11 , 2001 , islamic extremists have carried out at least four major terrorist attacks on british soil . in the us , by contrast , only one successful attack motivated by islamic jihad was carried out in late 2001 , when letters tainted with a lethal strain of the anthrax virus killed five people . in an effort to explain why the uk has become a more frequent target of terrorism than the us , analysts have cited the failure of european states to integrate their muslim populations into mainstream society . " these are not terror cells operating across borders or exporting holy warriors from the middle east , " said professor hans giessmann of the university of hamburg .
the incidents in london , glasgow , madrid and other european cities " have been carried out across the board by homegrown terrorists . " " what we are dealing with here is a spill-over of extremist ideologies into disenfranchised communities within our midst , " giessmann said , suggesting that many of the two million arabs living in the uk have failed to adapt to the british way of life . parallel societies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breeding ground : a tight-knit muslim community in leeds , england a security expert at the london-based limehouse group , hazhir teimourian , blames england 's liberal immigration policies .
" this government has done enormous damage with its lax policy on immigration , " he said . teimourian said the labor government under former prime minister tony blair " has given islamists from all over the world the freedom to set up shop in england . " " the result , " he says , " is an increasing ghettoization and alienation of these communities , " rendering them highly susceptible to radical islamic ideologies such as the brand of suicidal jihad -lrb- holy war -rrb- preached by al qaeda . giessmann agrees that a false sense of tolerance in europe has led to the emergence of parallel societies where many do n't speak the national language . " these communities do n't have an integrated existence , and that makes them susceptible to various forms of radicalization , " he said . especially the second and third-generation immigrants - children of the original migrants who came to england after world war two - have become increasingly sensitized by 9/11 and the wars in iraq and afghanistan .
teimourian said some of these youths were even turning on their parents for " not being islamic enough . " indeed , none of the seven suspects arrested in connection with last week 's attempted car bomb attacks in london and glasgow are older than 30 . " in germany , too , we have finally recognized that integration does n't function on autopilot , " giessmann said .
" the ' clash of civilizations ' is happening within our own fragmented society , and we have not succeeded in defining a collective identity in the context of a multi-ethnic nation-state .

" however , romania has been helping to lead a revival in filmmaking in the region and a renewed global interest in a movie business that has produced some of the most pioneering figures in global cinema . in particular , this follows the success of cristian mungiu 's " 4 months , 3 weeks , 2 days " in winning the prestigious palme d 'or prize at cannes , which has also helped generate renewed interest among local audiences across cee in films made by national directors . seven years ago , no films were being made in romania , yet now the nation manages to pump out between 10 and 20 feature films a year . fresh and innovative underscoring the arrival of cee 's new generation of filmmakers , three czech feature movies and two animated films were included in the official program of this year 's berlin film festival .
poland 's gdynia film festival last year included 30 entries from debut directors . " they have a fresh and innovative approach towards filmmaking .
some of them have even invented a new film language , " said eva vezer , general manager of magyar filmunio , hungary 's film promotion board and a member of the european film promotion board , describing the region 's new wave of filmmakers . dashed hopes what is more , the new cee cinema appears to have emerged just as the dreams were fading across the region about what the fall of communism might have led to . the result has been that many of the region 's directors have been retracing the events surrounding the fall of communism and the new social values that have taken shape . this became clear from the films screened at this year 's karlovy vary film festival , which showcases films from cee . these include movies such as " dolina " by hungarian director zoltan kamondi , about the takeover of a town by authoritarian forces , " simple things " by russian director alexey popogrebsky , on personal turmoil set against urban life in st. petersburg , and " hope " by polish director stanislaw mucha . hope portrays a struggle between money and a less materialist view of the world as a young man tries to negotiate with the thief who stole a rare painting from a warsaw church to return the work of art . another polish film screened in karlovy vary is " saviour 's square " from directors krzysztof krauze and joanna kos-krauze , which touched on the role of women in post-communist eastern europe . the communist legacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today there are few traces of communism left in europe zoltan kamondi believes that , despite having lived under democracy , the basic instincts of many people in everyday life have not changed since the days when they were still living in a dictatorship . celebrations last year marking the 50th anniversary of the hungarian revolution also gave the nation 's film-makers the chance to look back on their country 's battle to chart a more independent course . even directors such as elke hauck , who grew up under the communism in east germany have sought to explore how east germans have managed to adjust to the new world that emerged following the fall of theberlin wall . in her debut film , " karger , " the hero finds he needs to make some radical changes to his life after it lurches into a crisis . but drawing on largely unprofessional cast , one of the main characters told a press conference following a screening of the film in karlovy vary that she found it relatively easy to play her role . like her character , anja dietrich said : ' i am looking for a job right now .

europeans face the specter of a growing terrorist threat in their midst .
on the two-year anniversary of the london train bombings , great britain can no longer ignore its disaffected muslim communities . the united kingdom has faced more attacks than any other eu country or the united states .
since september 11 , 2001 , islamic extremists have carried out at least four major terrorist attacks on british soil . in the us , by contrast , only one successful attack motivated by islamic jihad was carried out in late 2001 , when letters tainted with a lethal strain of the anthrax virus killed five people . in an effort to explain why the uk has become a more frequent target of terrorism than the us , analysts have cited the failure of european states to integrate their muslim populations into mainstream society . " these are not terror cells operating across borders or exporting holy warriors from the middle east , " said professor hans giessmann of the university of hamburg .
the incidents in london , glasgow , madrid and other european cities " have been carried out across the board by homegrown terrorists . " " what we are dealing with here is a spill-over of extremist ideologies into disenfranchised communities within our midst , " giessmann said , suggesting that many of the two million arabs living in the uk have failed to adapt to the british way of life . parallel societies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breeding ground : a tight-knit muslim community in leeds , england a security expert at the london-based limehouse group , hazhir teimourian , blames england 's liberal immigration policies .
" this government has done enormous damage with its lax policy on immigration , " he said . teimourian said the labor government under former prime minister tony blair " has given islamists from all over the world the freedom to set up shop in england . " " the result , " he says , " is an increasing ghettoization and alienation of these communities , " rendering them highly susceptible to radical islamic ideologies such as the brand of suicidal jihad -lrb- holy war -rrb- preached by al qaeda . giessmann agrees that a false sense of tolerance in europe has led to the emergence of parallel societies where many do n't speak the national language . " these communities do n't have an integrated existence , and that makes them susceptible to various forms of radicalization , " he said . especially the second and third-generation immigrants - children of the original migrants who came to england after world war two - have become increasingly sensitized by 9/11 and the wars in iraq and afghanistan .
teimourian said some of these youths were even turning on their parents for " not being islamic enough . " indeed , none of the seven suspects arrested in connection with last week 's attempted car bomb attacks in london and glasgow are older than 30 . " in germany , too , we have finally recognized that integration does n't function on autopilot , " giessmann said .
" the ' clash of civilizations ' is happening within our own fragmented society , and we have not succeeded in defining a collective identity in the context of a multi-ethnic nation-state . " germany has a large number of muslim immigrants , most of them of turkish descent , who often live in secluded and low-income neighborhoods and have little or no contact with their german peers . in addition , many muslims come from rural backgrounds .

but the road there is a rocky one .
the selection process is tough and only the very best applicants get a position . it does n't get more idyllic than this .
the german foreign ministry 's training academy is based along the woods and fields on the shores of lake tegel in berlin .
it 's there that the country 's prospective diplomats get their final polish before they head off to the embassies in rome , minsk or addis ababa . but do n't be deceived by the scenery .
there 's a lot of hard work at the academy and the timetable is full to the brink . christian doktor is one of the 35 attachés here .
for one year , the academy is intensely preparing him and the other future diplomats for their job serving germany 's foreign policies . whoever has made it here already has a university degree - and gets a one-year crash course in diplomacy on top of it .
according to doktor , it started off with learning how to communicate within a group and in public .
then rhetoric and language courses in english and french were on the schedule . " we had a history block , a run in eight days through german history from 1871 through today , " doktor said . but doktor does n't consider the compact instruction as stress , but rather as a privilege .
after completing his studies in law , the 28-year-old worked in the foreign office for a year - and got hooked . " the ministry of foreign affairs is , of course , an amazing employer , " doktor said .
" there 's no other profession which takes you to so many countries in the world . " being a diplomat is a life decision in order to get one of the 35 spots at the academy , doktor had to compete with some 1,500 other applicants .
he also had to prove in a multi-stage selection process that he is suitable for the diplomatic profession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is germany 's most well-known diplomat " this does n't just include intellectual capabilities and the creativity needed for this job , but also social and intercultural competence , as well as self-confident appearance and motivation , " said head trainer stefan biedermann .
whoever wants to become a diplomat also has to be willing to work in a different country every three years . " that 's why we always speak of a life decision and not a career decision , " biedermann said .
" it affects your private life , your family , relatives and friends so completely , that you should n't talk about a simple career or a job in this case . " doktor has long since made this decision for himself .
he wants to see the world and get to know various cultures .
the thought of living with moving boxes does n't scare him . parties are part of it , too the 35 attachés also spend a lot of their free time together .
doktor said he hoped that the group will go through their respective careers and support and help each other . " you need contacts , not just professionally , but also on a human and social level , " doktor said .
" that is a very important goal that is reached with this training , because we are all here together , celebrating together and doing sports together . " the prospective diplomats thus should n't just be getting to know the finer points of consular work during their year at the academy in tegel , but rather also the other attachés .
trainer biedermann therefore does n't at all object to the many wild parties . " they often go into the early hours of the morning , " biedermann said .
" the training supervisors only demand that at eight the next morning , everyone is back in the classroom in tie and suit , keeping a stiff upper lip - or countenance , as the diplomat calls it .

but the road there is a rocky one .
the selection process is tough and only the very best applicants get a position . it does n't get more idyllic than this .
the german foreign ministry 's training academy is based along the woods and fields on the shores of lake tegel in berlin .
it 's there that the country 's prospective diplomats get their final polish before they head off to the embassies in rome , minsk or addis ababa . but do n't be deceived by the scenery .
there 's a lot of hard work at the academy and the timetable is full to the brink . christian doktor is one of the 35 attachés here .
for one year , the academy is intensely preparing him and the other future diplomats for their job serving germany 's foreign policies . whoever has made it here already has a university degree - and gets a one-year crash course in diplomacy on top of it .
according to doktor , it started off with learning how to communicate within a group and in public .
then rhetoric and language courses in english and french were on the schedule . " we had a history block , a run in eight days through german history from 1871 through today , " doktor said . but doktor does n't consider the compact instruction as stress , but rather as a privilege .
after completing his studies in law , the 28-year-old worked in the foreign office for a year - and got hooked . " the ministry of foreign affairs is , of course , an amazing employer , " doktor said .
" there 's no other profession which takes you to so many countries in the world . " being a diplomat is a life decision in order to get one of the 35 spots at the academy , doktor had to compete with some 1,500 other applicants .
he also had to prove in a multi-stage selection process that he is suitable for the diplomatic profession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is germany 's most well-known diplomat " this does n't just include intellectual capabilities and the creativity needed for this job , but also social and intercultural competence , as well as self-confident appearance and motivation , " said head trainer stefan biedermann .
whoever wants to become a diplomat also has to be willing to work in a different country every three years . " that 's why we always speak of a life decision and not a career decision , " biedermann said .
" it affects your private life , your family , relatives and friends so completely , that you should n't talk about a simple career or a job in this case . " doktor has long since made this decision for himself .
he wants to see the world and get to know various cultures .
the thought of living with moving boxes does n't scare him . parties are part of it , too the 35 attachés also spend a lot of their free time together .
doktor said he hoped that the group will go through their respective careers and support and help each other . " you need contacts , not just professionally , but also on a human and social level , " doktor said .
" that is a very important goal that is reached with this training , because we are all here together , celebrating together and doing sports together . " the prospective diplomats thus should n't just be getting to know the finer points of consular work during their year at the academy in tegel , but rather also the other attachés .
trainer biedermann therefore does n't at all object to the many wild parties . " they often go into the early hours of the morning , " biedermann said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 07.07.2007 germany 's training ground for diplomats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being a diplomat is about more than just shaking hands working in various countries as a diplomat is a dream career for many german university graduates .
but the road there is a rocky one .
the selection process is tough and only the very best applicants get a position . it does n't get more idyllic than this .
the german foreign ministry 's training academy is based along the woods and fields on the shores of lake tegel in berlin .
it 's there that the country 's prospective diplomats get their final polish before they head off to the embassies in rome , minsk or addis ababa . but do n't be deceived by the scenery .
there 's a lot of hard work at the academy and the timetable is full to the brink . christian doktor is one of the 35 attachés here .
for one year , the academy is intensely preparing him and the other future diplomats for their job serving germany 's foreign policies . whoever has made it here already has a university degree - and gets a one-year crash course in diplomacy on top of it .
according to doktor , it started off with learning how to communicate within a group and in public .
then rhetoric and language courses in english and french were on the schedule . " we had a history block , a run in eight days through german history from 1871 through today , " doktor said . but doktor does n't consider the compact instruction as stress , but rather as a privilege .
after completing his studies in law , the 28-year-old worked in the foreign office for a year - and got hooked . " the ministry of foreign affairs is , of course , an amazing employer , " doktor said .
" there 's no other profession which takes you to so many countries in the world . " being a diplomat is a life decision in order to get one of the 35 spots at the academy , doktor had to compete with some 1,500 other applicants .
he also had to prove in a multi-stage selection process that he is suitable for the diplomatic profession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is germany 's most well-known diplomat " this does n't just include intellectual capabilities and the creativity needed for this job , but also social and intercultural competence , as well as self-confident appearance and motivation , " said head trainer stefan biedermann .
whoever wants to become a diplomat also has to be willing to work in a different country every three years . " that 's why we always speak of a life decision and not a career decision , " biedermann said .
" it affects your private life , your family , relatives and friends so completely , that you should n't talk about a simple career or a job in this case . " doktor has long since made this decision for himself .
he wants to see the world and get to know various cultures .
the thought of living with moving boxes does n't scare him . parties are part of it , too the 35 attachés also spend a lot of their free time together .
doktor said he hoped that the group will go through their respective careers and support and help each other . " you need contacts , not just professionally , but also on a human and social level , " doktor said .
" that is a very important goal that is reached with this training , because we are all here together , celebrating together and doing sports together . " the prospective diplomats thus should n't just be getting to know the finer points of consular work during their year at the academy in tegel , but rather also the other attachés .
trainer biedermann therefore does n't at all object to the many wild parties . " they often go into the early hours of the morning , " biedermann said .
" the training supervisors only demand that at eight the next morning , everyone is back in the classroom in tie and suit , keeping a stiff upper lip - or countenance , as the diplomat calls it .

but the road there is a rocky one .
the selection process is tough and only the very best applicants get a position . it does n't get more idyllic than this .
the german foreign ministry 's training academy is based along the woods and fields on the shores of lake tegel in berlin .
it 's there that the country 's prospective diplomats get their final polish before they head off to the embassies in rome , minsk or addis ababa . but do n't be deceived by the scenery .
there 's a lot of hard work at the academy and the timetable is full to the brink . christian doktor is one of the 35 attachés here .
for one year , the academy is intensely preparing him and the other future diplomats for their job serving germany 's foreign policies . whoever has made it here already has a university degree - and gets a one-year crash course in diplomacy on top of it .
according to doktor , it started off with learning how to communicate within a group and in public .
then rhetoric and language courses in english and french were on the schedule . " we had a history block , a run in eight days through german history from 1871 through today , " doktor said . but doktor does n't consider the compact instruction as stress , but rather as a privilege .
after completing his studies in law , the 28-year-old worked in the foreign office for a year - and got hooked . " the ministry of foreign affairs is , of course , an amazing employer , " doktor said .
" there 's no other profession which takes you to so many countries in the world . " being a diplomat is a life decision in order to get one of the 35 spots at the academy , doktor had to compete with some 1,500 other applicants .

whoever wants to become a diplomat also has to be willing to work in a different country every three years . " that 's why we always speak of a life decision and not a career decision , " biedermann said .
" it affects your private life , your family , relatives and friends so completely , that you should n't talk about a simple career or a job in this case . " doktor has long since made this decision for himself .
he wants to see the world and get to know various cultures .
the thought of living with moving boxes does n't scare him . parties are part of it , too the 35 attachés also spend a lot of their free time together .
doktor said he hoped that the group will go through their respective careers and support and help each other . " you need contacts , not just professionally , but also on a human and social level , " doktor said .
" that is a very important goal that is reached with this training , because we are all here together , celebrating together and doing sports together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 07.07.2007 new generation revitalizes eastern european film industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cristian mungiu in cannes , proving there 's no shortage of talent in romania for filmmakers across central and eastern europe , the last 18 years following the implosion of communism have been a sobering and at times dispiriting experience .
but many have refused to let themselves be cowed . first , the collapse of the soviet union dragged movie-making throughout the region to the brink of a financial abyss .
then , as privatization took off , cinemas began closing and were converted to sex clubs and discos . a short time later , a new and potentially more lethal rival appeared on the scene , with hollywood movies starting to fill up the cinemas that had survived the end of communism , further undercutting hopes of an early rebound in the local film business . but as the more recent years have shown , filmmakers in central and eastern europe -lrb- cee -rrb- have been remarkably resilient .
a new generation of directors is now emerging to help shape a modern cinema that in many cases explore the changes that were unleashed by the revolutions that swept away decades of stalinism in 1989 . romania leads the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's come a long way since communism " many of these filmmakers accumulated ideas and frustrations , " said mihai gligor of the romanian film promotion association . " even after the revolution it was hard to get money , " he said .
" in many cases it was a fight with a system that was very corrupt .
it was a continuing fight . " however , romania has been helping to lead a revival in filmmaking in the region and a renewed global interest in a movie business that has produced some of the most pioneering figures in global cinema . in particular , this follows the success of cristian mungiu 's " 4 months , 3 weeks , 2 days " in winning the prestigious palme d 'or prize at cannes , which has also helped generate renewed interest among local audiences across cee in films made by national directors . seven years ago , no films were being made in romania , yet now the nation manages to pump out between 10 and 20 feature films a year . fresh and innovative underscoring the arrival of cee 's new generation of filmmakers , three czech feature movies and two animated films were included in the official program of this year 's berlin film festival .
poland 's gdynia film festival last year included 30 entries from debut directors . " they have a fresh and innovative approach towards filmmaking .
some of them have even invented a new film language , " said eva vezer , general manager of magyar filmunio , hungary 's film promotion board and a member of the european film promotion board , describing the region 's new wave of filmmakers . dashed hopes what is more , the new cee cinema appears to have emerged just as the dreams were fading across the region about what the fall of communism might have led to . the result has been that many of the region 's directors have been retracing the events surrounding the fall of communism and the new social values that have taken shape . this became clear from the films screened at this year 's karlovy vary film festival , which showcases films from cee . these include movies such as " dolina " by hungarian director zoltan kamondi , about the takeover of a town by authoritarian forces , " simple things " by russian director alexey popogrebsky , on personal turmoil set against urban life in st. petersburg , and " hope " by polish director stanislaw mucha . hope portrays a struggle between money and a less materialist view of the world as a young man tries to negotiate with the thief who stole a rare painting from a warsaw church to return the work of art . another polish film screened in karlovy vary is " saviour 's square " from directors krzysztof krauze and joanna kos-krauze , which touched on the role of women in post-communist eastern europe . the communist legacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today there are few traces of communism left in europe zoltan kamondi believes that , despite having lived under democracy , the basic instincts of many people in everyday life have not changed since the days when they were still living in a dictatorship . celebrations last year marking the 50th anniversary of the hungarian revolution also gave the nation 's film-makers the chance to look back on their country 's battle to chart a more independent course . even directors such as elke hauck , who grew up under the communism in east germany have sought to explore how east germans have managed to adjust to the new world that emerged following the fall of theberlin wall . in her debut film , " karger , " the hero finds he needs to make some radical changes to his life after it lurches into a crisis . but drawing on largely unprofessional cast , one of the main characters told a press conference following a screening of the film in karlovy vary that she found it relatively easy to play her role . like her character , anja dietrich said : ' i am looking for a job right now .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 07.07.2007 new generation revitalizes eastern european film industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cristian mungiu in cannes , proving there 's no shortage of talent in romania for filmmakers across central and eastern europe , the last 18 years following the implosion of communism have been a sobering and at times dispiriting experience .
but many have refused to let themselves be cowed . first , the collapse of the soviet union dragged movie-making throughout the region to the brink of a financial abyss .
then , as privatization took off , cinemas began closing and were converted to sex clubs and discos . a short time later , a new and potentially more lethal rival appeared on the scene , with hollywood movies starting to fill up the cinemas that had survived the end of communism , further undercutting hopes of an early rebound in the local film business . but as the more recent years have shown , filmmakers in central and eastern europe -lrb- cee -rrb- have been remarkably resilient .
a new generation of directors is now emerging to help shape a modern cinema that in many cases explore the changes that were unleashed by the revolutions that swept away decades of stalinism in 1989 . romania leads the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's come a long way since communism " many of these filmmakers accumulated ideas and frustrations , " said mihai gligor of the romanian film promotion association . " even after the revolution it was hard to get money , " he said .
" in many cases it was a fight with a system that was very corrupt .
it was a continuing fight . " however , romania has been helping to lead a revival in filmmaking in the region and a renewed global interest in a movie business that has produced some of the most pioneering figures in global cinema . in particular , this follows the success of cristian mungiu 's " 4 months , 3 weeks , 2 days " in winning the prestigious palme d 'or prize at cannes , which has also helped generate renewed interest among local audiences across cee in films made by national directors . seven years ago , no films were being made in romania , yet now the nation manages to pump out between 10 and 20 feature films a year . fresh and innovative underscoring the arrival of cee 's new generation of filmmakers , three czech feature movies and two animated films were included in the official program of this year 's berlin film festival .
poland 's gdynia film festival last year included 30 entries from debut directors . " they have a fresh and innovative approach towards filmmaking .
some of them have even invented a new film language , " said eva vezer , general manager of magyar filmunio , hungary 's film promotion board and a member of the european film promotion board , describing the region 's new wave of filmmakers . dashed hopes what is more , the new cee cinema appears to have emerged just as the dreams were fading across the region about what the fall of communism might have led to . the result has been that many of the region 's directors have been retracing the events surrounding the fall of communism and the new social values that have taken shape . this became clear from the films screened at this year 's karlovy vary film festival , which showcases films from cee . these include movies such as " dolina " by hungarian director zoltan kamondi , about the takeover of a town by authoritarian forces , " simple things " by russian director alexey popogrebsky , on personal turmoil set against urban life in st. petersburg , and " hope " by polish director stanislaw mucha . hope portrays a struggle between money and a less materialist view of the world as a young man tries to negotiate with the thief who stole a rare painting from a warsaw church to return the work of art . another polish film screened in karlovy vary is " saviour 's square " from directors krzysztof krauze and joanna kos-krauze , which touched on the role of women in post-communist eastern europe . the communist legacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today there are few traces of communism left in europe zoltan kamondi believes that , despite having lived under democracy , the basic instincts of many people in everyday life have not changed since the days when they were still living in a dictatorship . celebrations last year marking the 50th anniversary of the hungarian revolution also gave the nation 's film-makers the chance to look back on their country 's battle to chart a more independent course . even directors such as elke hauck , who grew up under the communism in east germany have sought to explore how east germans have managed to adjust to the new world that emerged following the fall of theberlin wall . in her debut film , " karger , " the hero finds he needs to make some radical changes to his life after it lurches into a crisis . but drawing on largely unprofessional cast , one of the main characters told a press conference following a screening of the film in karlovy vary that she found it relatively easy to play her role . like her character , anja dietrich said : ' i am looking for a job right now .

europeans face the specter of a growing terrorist threat in their midst .
on the two-year anniversary of the london train bombings , great britain can no longer ignore its disaffected muslim communities . the united kingdom has faced more attacks than any other eu country or the united states .
since september 11 , 2001 , islamic extremists have carried out at least four major terrorist attacks on british soil . in the us , by contrast , only one successful attack motivated by islamic jihad was carried out in late 2001 , when letters tainted with a lethal strain of the anthrax virus killed five people . in an effort to explain why the uk has become a more frequent target of terrorism than the us , analysts have cited the failure of european states to integrate their muslim populations into mainstream society . " these are not terror cells operating across borders or exporting holy warriors from the middle east , " said professor hans giessmann of the university of hamburg .
the incidents in london , glasgow , madrid and other european cities " have been carried out across the board by homegrown terrorists . " " what we are dealing with here is a spill-over of extremist ideologies into disenfranchised communities within our midst , " giessmann said , suggesting that many of the two million arabs living in the uk have failed to adapt to the british way of life . parallel societies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breeding ground : a tight-knit muslim community in leeds , england a security expert at the london-based limehouse group , hazhir teimourian , blames england 's liberal immigration policies .
" this government has done enormous damage with its lax policy on immigration , " he said . teimourian said the labor government under former prime minister tony blair " has given islamists from all over the world the freedom to set up shop in england . " " the result , " he says , " is an increasing ghettoization and alienation of these communities , " rendering them highly susceptible to radical islamic ideologies such as the brand of suicidal jihad -lrb- holy war -rrb- preached by al qaeda . giessmann agrees that a false sense of tolerance in europe has led to the emergence of parallel societies where many do n't speak the national language . " these communities do n't have an integrated existence , and that makes them susceptible to various forms of radicalization , " he said . especially the second and third-generation immigrants - children of the original migrants who came to england after world war two - have become increasingly sensitized by 9/11 and the wars in iraq and afghanistan .
teimourian said some of these youths were even turning on their parents for " not being islamic enough . " indeed , none of the seven suspects arrested in connection with last week 's attempted car bomb attacks in london and glasgow are older than 30 . " in germany , too , we have finally recognized that integration does n't function on autopilot , " giessmann said .
" the ' clash of civilizations ' is happening within our own fragmented society , and we have not succeeded in defining a collective identity in the context of a multi-ethnic nation-state . " germany has a large number of muslim immigrants , most of them of turkish descent , who often live in secluded and low-income neighborhoods and have little or no contact with their german peers . in addition , many muslims come from rural backgrounds .
in britain , teimourian observes that " they have a high degree of hatred for western culture because they do n't understand it and feel threatened by it . " teimourian , who himself is an iranian kurd who emigrated to the uk over 50 years ago , decided to raise his own children as christians under the church of england " so that they feel more attached to the european identity .

there is no " islam town " in america . historically speaking , the american muslim community is still in its infancy .
and it is being shaped by community leaders such as zaid shakir , a progressive imam in california who has gained widespread popularity by preaching a moderate brand of islam that meshes well with the american way of life . in a recent interview with us journalist bill moyers , shakir said there was " an american muslim culture emerging , which is very important , because then you can get a unique understanding of the religion that would allow the american muslim to take his or her rightful place amongst the various muslim communities of the world .

europeans face the specter of a growing terrorist threat in their midst .
on the two-year anniversary of the london train bombings , great britain can no longer ignore its disaffected muslim communities . the united kingdom has faced more attacks than any other eu country or the united states .
since september 11 , 2001 , islamic extremists have carried out at least four major terrorist attacks on british soil . in the us , by contrast , only one successful attack motivated by islamic jihad was carried out in late 2001 , when letters tainted with a lethal strain of the anthrax virus killed five people . in an effort to explain why the uk has become a more frequent target of terrorism than the us , analysts have cited the failure of european states to integrate their muslim populations into mainstream society . " these are not terror cells operating across borders or exporting holy warriors from the middle east , " said professor hans giessmann of the university of hamburg .
the incidents in london , glasgow , madrid and other european cities " have been carried out across the board by homegrown terrorists . " " what we are dealing with here is a spill-over of extremist ideologies into disenfranchised communities within our midst , " giessmann said , suggesting that many of the two million arabs living in the uk have failed to adapt to the british way of life . parallel societies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breeding ground : a tight-knit muslim community in leeds , england a security expert at the london-based limehouse group , hazhir teimourian , blames england 's liberal immigration policies .
" this government has done enormous damage with its lax policy on immigration , " he said . teimourian said the labor government under former prime minister tony blair " has given islamists from all over the world the freedom to set up shop in england . " " the result , " he says , " is an increasing ghettoization and alienation of these communities , " rendering them highly susceptible to radical islamic ideologies such as the brand of suicidal jihad -lrb- holy war -rrb- preached by al qaeda . giessmann agrees that a false sense of tolerance in europe has led to the emergence of parallel societies where many do n't speak the national language . " these communities do n't have an integrated existence , and that makes them susceptible to various forms of radicalization , " he said . especially the second and third-generation immigrants - children of the original migrants who came to england after world war two - have become increasingly sensitized by 9/11 and the wars in iraq and afghanistan .
teimourian said some of these youths were even turning on their parents for " not being islamic enough . " indeed , none of the seven suspects arrested in connection with last week 's attempted car bomb attacks in london and glasgow are older than 30 . " in germany , too , we have finally recognized that integration does n't function on autopilot , " giessmann said .
" the ' clash of civilizations ' is happening within our own fragmented society , and we have not succeeded in defining a collective identity in the context of a multi-ethnic nation-state . " germany has a large number of muslim immigrants , most of them of turkish descent , who often live in secluded and low-income neighborhoods and have little or no contact with their german peers . in addition , many muslims come from rural backgrounds .
in britain , teimourian observes that " they have a high degree of hatred for western culture because they do n't understand it and feel threatened by it . " teimourian , who himself is an iranian kurd who emigrated to the uk over 50 years ago , decided to raise his own children as christians under the church of england " so that they feel more attached to the european identity . " no " islam town " in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 9/11 raised the profile of america 's 2.35 million muslims american muslim communities are different .
" america is much less tolerant of alienation , " teimourian said , adding that american muslims " are told , at least implicitly , that they must become american . " as a result , american muslims by and large do not live together as entities , according to giessmann .
in that regard , muslims are unlike their chinese , italian or other immigrant counterparts , who came to the us much earlier and formed isolated clusters - " chinatown " or " little italy , " for example .
there is no " islam town " in america . historically speaking , the american muslim community is still in its infancy .
and it is being shaped by community leaders such as zaid shakir , a progressive imam in california who has gained widespread popularity by preaching a moderate brand of islam that meshes well with the american way of life . in a recent interview with us journalist bill moyers , shakir said there was " an american muslim culture emerging , which is very important , because then you can get a unique understanding of the religion that would allow the american muslim to take his or her rightful place amongst the various muslim communities of the world . " but as a percentage of the population , the muslim minority in the us is far smaller than in the uk - 2.35 million muslims live in the continental united states , or less than one percent of the total population .
muslims in great britain make up three percent of the population . furthermore , america 's muslim population is more affluent than in the uk .
" they are more professional and less like peasants , " as teimourian put it .
and giessmann claims that on average , " these people have been better assimilated into american society . " alex bakst send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 07.07.2007 new generation revitalizes eastern european film industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cristian mungiu in cannes , proving there 's no shortage of talent in romania for filmmakers across central and eastern europe , the last 18 years following the implosion of communism have been a sobering and at times dispiriting experience .
but many have refused to let themselves be cowed . first , the collapse of the soviet union dragged movie-making throughout the region to the brink of a financial abyss .
then , as privatization took off , cinemas began closing and were converted to sex clubs and discos . a short time later , a new and potentially more lethal rival appeared on the scene , with hollywood movies starting to fill up the cinemas that had survived the end of communism , further undercutting hopes of an early rebound in the local film business . but as the more recent years have shown , filmmakers in central and eastern europe -lrb- cee -rrb- have been remarkably resilient .
a new generation of directors is now emerging to help shape a modern cinema that in many cases explore the changes that were unleashed by the revolutions that swept away decades of stalinism in 1989 . romania leads the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's come a long way since communism " many of these filmmakers accumulated ideas and frustrations , " said mihai gligor of the romanian film promotion association . " even after the revolution it was hard to get money , " he said .
" in many cases it was a fight with a system that was very corrupt .
it was a continuing fight . " however , romania has been helping to lead a revival in filmmaking in the region and a renewed global interest in a movie business that has produced some of the most pioneering figures in global cinema . in particular , this follows the success of cristian mungiu 's " 4 months , 3 weeks , 2 days " in winning the prestigious palme d 'or prize at cannes , which has also helped generate renewed interest among local audiences across cee in films made by national directors . seven years ago , no films were being made in romania , yet now the nation manages to pump out between 10 and 20 feature films a year . fresh and innovative underscoring the arrival of cee 's new generation of filmmakers , three czech feature movies and two animated films were included in the official program of this year 's berlin film festival .
poland 's gdynia film festival last year included 30 entries from debut directors . " they have a fresh and innovative approach towards filmmaking .
some of them have even invented a new film language , " said eva vezer , general manager of magyar filmunio , hungary 's film promotion board and a member of the european film promotion board , describing the region 's new wave of filmmakers . dashed hopes what is more , the new cee cinema appears to have emerged just as the dreams were fading across the region about what the fall of communism might have led to . the result has been that many of the region 's directors have been retracing the events surrounding the fall of communism and the new social values that have taken shape . this became clear from the films screened at this year 's karlovy vary film festival , which showcases films from cee . these include movies such as " dolina " by hungarian director zoltan kamondi , about the takeover of a town by authoritarian forces , " simple things " by russian director alexey popogrebsky , on personal turmoil set against urban life in st. petersburg , and " hope " by polish director stanislaw mucha . hope portrays a struggle between money and a less materialist view of the world as a young man tries to negotiate with the thief who stole a rare painting from a warsaw church to return the work of art . another polish film screened in karlovy vary is " saviour 's square " from directors krzysztof krauze and joanna kos-krauze , which touched on the role of women in post-communist eastern europe . the communist legacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today there are few traces of communism left in europe zoltan kamondi believes that , despite having lived under democracy , the basic instincts of many people in everyday life have not changed since the days when they were still living in a dictatorship . celebrations last year marking the 50th anniversary of the hungarian revolution also gave the nation 's film-makers the chance to look back on their country 's battle to chart a more independent course . even directors such as elke hauck , who grew up under the communism in east germany have sought to explore how east germans have managed to adjust to the new world that emerged following the fall of theberlin wall . in her debut film , " karger , " the hero finds he needs to make some radical changes to his life after it lurches into a crisis . but drawing on largely unprofessional cast , one of the main characters told a press conference following a screening of the film in karlovy vary that she found it relatively easy to play her role . like her character , anja dietrich said : ' i am looking for a job right now .

but the road there is a rocky one .
the selection process is tough and only the very best applicants get a position . it does n't get more idyllic than this .
the german foreign ministry 's training academy is based along the woods and fields on the shores of lake tegel in berlin .
it 's there that the country 's prospective diplomats get their final polish before they head off to the embassies in rome , minsk or addis ababa . but do n't be deceived by the scenery .
there 's a lot of hard work at the academy and the timetable is full to the brink . christian doktor is one of the 35 attachés here .
for one year , the academy is intensely preparing him and the other future diplomats for their job serving germany 's foreign policies . whoever has made it here already has a university degree - and gets a one-year crash course in diplomacy on top of it .
according to doktor , it started off with learning how to communicate within a group and in public .
then rhetoric and language courses in english and french were on the schedule . " we had a history block , a run in eight days through german history from 1871 through today , " doktor said . but doktor does n't consider the compact instruction as stress , but rather as a privilege .
after completing his studies in law , the 28-year-old worked in the foreign office for a year - and got hooked . " the ministry of foreign affairs is , of course , an amazing employer , " doktor said .
" there 's no other profession which takes you to so many countries in the world . " being a diplomat is a life decision in order to get one of the 35 spots at the academy , doktor had to compete with some 1,500 other applicants .
he also had to prove in a multi-stage selection process that he is suitable for the diplomatic profession . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is germany 's most well-known diplomat " this does n't just include intellectual capabilities and the creativity needed for this job , but also social and intercultural competence , as well as self-confident appearance and motivation , " said head trainer stefan biedermann .
whoever wants to become a diplomat also has to be willing to work in a different country every three years . " that 's why we always speak of a life decision and not a career decision , " biedermann said .
" it affects your private life , your family , relatives and friends so completely , that you should n't talk about a simple career or a job in this case . " doktor has long since made this decision for himself .
he wants to see the world and get to know various cultures .
the thought of living with moving boxes does n't scare him . parties are part of it , too the 35 attachés also spend a lot of their free time together .
doktor said he hoped that the group will go through their respective careers and support and help each other . " you need contacts , not just professionally , but also on a human and social level , " doktor said .
" that is a very important goal that is reached with this training , because we are all here together , celebrating together and doing sports together . " the prospective diplomats thus should n't just be getting to know the finer points of consular work during their year at the academy in tegel , but rather also the other attachés .
trainer biedermann therefore does n't at all object to the many wild parties . " they often go into the early hours of the morning , " biedermann said .
" the training supervisors only demand that at eight the next morning , everyone is back in the classroom in tie and suit , keeping a stiff upper lip - or countenance , as the diplomat calls it .

floatation could extend their reach .
they are loathed as blights on the landscape and menaces to migrating birds .
but a new partnership between two european innovators could create wind turbines that can float on the ocean 's surface . norwegian energy group norsk hydro and german engineering firm siemens recently announced that they have joined forces to research and build a floating wind turbine .
currently , windmills have to be built on land or in shallow off-shore seabed sites , where they often generate complaints that they spoil the landscape , and concerns that the turbines batter birdlife .
a floating windmill could be placed far out at sea .
affordable and effective design bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fixed turbine off the baltic sea .
“ windmills standing in waters deeper than about 30 meters -lrb- 98 feet -rrb- become prohibitively expensive , " said henrik stiesdal , chief technology officer of siemens ' wind power unit told reuters .
hydro 's " is the most elegant and simple solution we have seen . "
hydro 's design consists of an upright steel tube with a concrete base about 200 meters long with 80 meters extending above the water and three blades that are 60 meters long .
the wind turbine is fixed to the seabed by three cables to hold it steady in seas where waves can be 30 meters high .
hydro believes it can work in waters up to 700 meters deep .
the research partnership hopes to have the first turbine generating clean energy in the north sea by 2009 .
bring together specialists hydro will bring its expertise in floatation technology , which it currently develops for north sea oil rigs and tankers .
siemens has a strong history in designing and building turbines for electricity generation .
it is expected that the floating turbines will be more expensive than land based turbines , but could supply energy to offshore oil and gas platforms and coastal communities .
the attraction of wind turbines is that they produce electricity without releasing greenhouse gases .
powering the north sea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new technology could power oil and gas platforms .
hydro hopes to have a prototype operating in the north sea by 2009 .
it is projected to cost 200 million norwegian kroner -lrb- 25.2 million euros or $ 34.3 million -rrb- , although the project 's finances have yet to be agreed on . hydro has already spent 30 million kroner on developing its floatation technology .
siemens says it will spend several million euros on the project over the next two years .
if all goes well , the partnership is hoping to have an off-shore wind energy field set up by 2013 , using 5 megawatt wind turbines . dw staff with wire services -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since september 11 , 2001 , islamic extremists have carried out at least four major terrorist attacks on british soil . in the us , by contrast , only one successful attack motivated by islamic jihad was carried out in late 2001 , when letters tainted with a lethal strain of the anthrax virus killed five people . in an effort to explain why the uk has become a more frequent target of terrorism than the us , analysts have cited the failure of european states to integrate their muslim populations into mainstream society . " these are not terror cells operating across borders or exporting holy warriors from the middle east , " said professor hans giessmann of the university of hamburg .
the incidents in london , glasgow , madrid and other european cities " have been carried out across the board by homegrown terrorists . " " what we are dealing with here is a spill-over of extremist ideologies into disenfranchised communities within our midst , " giessmann said , suggesting that many of the two million arabs living in the uk have failed to adapt to the british way of life . parallel societies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : breeding ground : a tight-knit muslim community in leeds , england a security expert at the london-based limehouse group , hazhir teimourian , blames england 's liberal immigration policies .
" this government has done enormous damage with its lax policy on immigration , " he said . teimourian said the labor government under former prime minister tony blair " has given islamists from all over the world the freedom to set up shop in england . " " the result , " he says , " is an increasing ghettoization and alienation of these communities , " rendering them highly susceptible to radical islamic ideologies such as the brand of suicidal jihad -lrb- holy war -rrb- preached by al qaeda . giessmann agrees that a false sense of tolerance in europe has led to the emergence of parallel societies where many do n't speak the national language . " these communities do n't have an integrated existence , and that makes them susceptible to various forms of radicalization , " he said . especially the second and third-generation immigrants - children of the original migrants who came to england after world war two - have become increasingly sensitized by 9/11 and the wars in iraq and afghanistan .
teimourian said some of these youths were even turning on their parents for " not being islamic enough . " indeed , none of the seven suspects arrested in connection with last week 's attempted car bomb attacks in london and glasgow are older than 30 . " in germany , too , we have finally recognized that integration does n't function on autopilot , " giessmann said .
" the ' clash of civilizations ' is happening within our own fragmented society , and we have not succeeded in defining a collective identity in the context of a multi-ethnic nation-state . " germany has a large number of muslim immigrants , most of them of turkish descent , who often live in secluded and low-income neighborhoods and have little or no contact with their german peers . in addition , many muslims come from rural backgrounds .
in britain , teimourian observes that " they have a high degree of hatred for western culture because they do n't understand it and feel threatened by it . " teimourian , who himself is an iranian kurd who emigrated to the uk over 50 years ago , decided to raise his own children as christians under the church of england " so that they feel more attached to the european identity . " no " islam town " in america bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 9/11 raised the profile of america 's 2.35 million muslims american muslim communities are different .
" america is much less tolerant of alienation , " teimourian said , adding that american muslims " are told , at least implicitly , that they must become american . " as a result , american muslims by and large do not live together as entities , according to giessmann .
in that regard , muslims are unlike their chinese , italian or other immigrant counterparts , who came to the us much earlier and formed isolated clusters - " chinatown " or " little italy , " for example .
there is no " islam town " in america . historically speaking , the american muslim community is still in its infancy .
and it is being shaped by community leaders such as zaid shakir , a progressive imam in california who has gained widespread popularity by preaching a moderate brand of islam that meshes well with the american way of life . in a recent interview with us journalist bill moyers , shakir said there was " an american muslim culture emerging , which is very important , because then you can get a unique understanding of the religion that would allow the american muslim to take his or her rightful place amongst the various muslim communities of the world . " but as a percentage of the population , the muslim minority in the us is far smaller than in the uk - 2.35 million muslims live in the continental united states , or less than one percent of the total population .
muslims in great britain make up three percent of the population . furthermore , america 's muslim population is more affluent than in the uk .
" they are more professional and less like peasants , " as teimourian put it .
and giessmann claims that on average , " these people have been better assimilated into american society . " alex bakst send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the building will be redesigned and have new lighting , a self-service terminal and automatic doors .
research has found visits to libraries in wales are increasing faster than anywhere else in the uk , but their poor state was described as a " turn-off " .
the assembly government said the money would " provide services fit for the 21st century " .
education , culture and welsh language minister carwyn jones said : " more people are now realising what a range of services our libraries offer : not only books , but dvds , free internet access , training , book clubs , mother and toddler groups - the list is endless .
" this is why the number of library visits in wales has increased by 21.8 % in the last five years , more than any other part of the uk . "
powys county librarian tudfil adams said : " we are delighted to receive this assistance from the welsh assembly government .
" powys county council has already embarked on a programme of library modernisation and this will allow us to make much greater progress . "

extra security checks were introduced after the suspected failed car bombings in london and glasgow , and terminal 4 was closed by a suspect package .
heavy rain which delayed some flights has also added to the luggage mountain .
a british airways spokesman said volunteers had been drafted in to help clear the backlog , but it could take several days to sort out .
darren woodcock of cheltenham told the bbc news website : " my wife travelled on the 29th , after the london incidents began , but before the glasgow attack and before the threat level was raised .
she is still waiting for her luggage 8 days later ... "
on tuesday , thousands of people were evacuated and 108 flights cancelled on tuesday after a suspicious bag was found .
the airport reopened after five hours and the backlog of passengers was cleared , but many people were forced to travel without their luggage .
any ba passengers who are affected are being advised to log onto the airline 's website where they can trace their bag online .
terminal 4 also serves klm , qantas , kenya airways , iberia airlines and brazilian airline tam .
