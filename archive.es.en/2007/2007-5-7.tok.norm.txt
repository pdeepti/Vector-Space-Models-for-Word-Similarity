police , protesters battle after sarkozy win opinion : sarkozy 's win means european uncertainty conservative sarkozy is france 's next president elections -pipe- 07.05.2007 merkel congratulates sarkozy , hopes for stronger ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's conservatives are pleased german chancellor angela merkel said she hoped french president-elect nicolas sarkozy would strengthen the french-german axis at the heart of the european union . congratulating her fellow conservative on his victory in the presidential runoff , merkel said she was convinced that under him " the german-french friendship will continue to be the basis to secure lasting peace , democracy and prosperity in europe . "
merkel said she was looking forward to meeting sarkozy in the near future " for a first exhange of views . "
the partnership between france and germany is often described as the " motor " of the eu and berlin is expected to be one of the first foreign visits sarkozy makes .
hopes for reviving eu constitution germany holds the rotating six-month presidency of the eu and merkel is keen to put the european bloc on track towards a revised constitutional treaty before the german presidency finishes at the end of june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the two see to it that the eu constitution is ratified ?
french voters rejected the draft constitution in a referendum in 2005.german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said shortly after sarkozy 's victory on sunday that he hoped berlin and paris would work closely together on " important european projects " under the incoming french president .
" i hope for a close german-french partnership , " steinmeier , a social democrat , said after right-wing sarkozy won sunday 's presidential election to succeed jacques chirac .
" of course i hope the cooperation will lead to progress on important european projects , " he added in a reference to the european union 's moribund draft constitution .
in a speech directly following the announcement that he won the country 's highest electoral office by a comfortable margin , sarkozy addressed france 's international agenda .
' our destiny is linked ' " i want to launch a call to our european partners , with whom our destiny is deeply linked , to tell them that i have been european all my life , that i believe deeply , that i believe sincerely , in european construction , and that tonight france is back in europe .
i beseech our european partners to hear the voices of people who want to be protected . "
another phone call came from european commission president jose manuel barroso , who congratulated sarkozy and said he was hopeful the new leader of france could help end the eu 's institutional woes . " i know nicolas sarkozy very well , and i am aware of his desire for france to take its rightful place on the european stage , " barroso said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso hopes to move the eu a step forward " i have complete confidence in nicolas sarkozy ... to play a driving role in resolving the institutional question and consolidating european politics , " he said . meanwhile , us president george w. bush also sent his wishes to the man of the hour soon after his win was sealed . " the united states and france are historic allies and partners .
president bush looks forward to working with president-elect sarkozy as we continue our strong alliance , " gordon johndroe , spokesman for the white house national security council , told afp . warning on warming following his victory , sarkozy pledged that the united states can count on a friendship with france , which " will always be at their side when they need help . " since a much-publicized us trip in september 2006 , sarkozy has fought against charges that he pandered to bush and the perception that he is too pro-american , a quality seen as unpopular with french voters . ' friendship is accepting difference ' addressing the crowd after his victory on sunday evening , he tried to get some distance form that image . " i want to tell -lrb- the united states -rrb- that france will always be by their side when they will need her .

but employers are nervous . the group of eight labor ministers , representing the world 's leading industrialized nations plus russia , convened on monday for a two-day meeting in dresden , germany . there , a new buzzword has emerged : " corporate social responsibility " - or csr for short . the idea behind this somewhat ambiguous , perhaps even euphemistic term is that big businesses - especially those operating on a global scale - should " integrate social and environmental issues into their business activities , " in the official wording of the european union commission . " economy , ecology and social action have to be carried out in a way that is fair and balanced , " german minister of labor and social affairs franz müntefering wrote in the pre-released text of a tuesday speech to his g8 colleagues .
müntefering is concurrently vice-chancellor in the cabinet of angela merkel , who currently controls the rotating eu presidency . whose responsibility is it , anyway ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will shoulder the social and environmental burden ?
the idea has rattled the nerves of business representatives , who fear that the government wants to rid itself of its own social responsibilities .
renate hornung-draus of the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- told the g8 that social commitments in the business sector " should n't be seen as a substitute for government action . " meanwhile , the german confederation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- has demanded regulations that would set out basic requirements for corporate social responsibility .
dgb chairman michael sommer told the german news service dpa that " the spoils of globalization should benefit all , not just a few " people , a statement that hornung-draus has echoed . müntefering defended csr , arguing that a socially responsible process of globalization would bring about widespread prosperity , which in turn would elicit a more accepting attitude from globalization 's skeptics . " we have to share this insight with the world : social action is a strong economic force . " but the anti-globalization network attac has accused müntefering of glossing over reality .
" in fact , the german government is enacting cutbacks to social standards - at home and worldwide , " the activists wrote in a press release .

" on the one hand , they -lrb- western corporations -rrb- want to take advantage of the cost benefits china has to offer , which result from its low wage , social and environmental standards . "
but , the author writes , companies active in china are under constant pressure from markets and the public to " protect the reputation of their brands . " the core question , according to author schoenheit , is this : " do the same principles and criteria apply to europe and china ? " contradicting approaches in europe even inside the european union , there seems to be no consensus over how to encourage more social action from business leaders .
a study commissioned by the bertelsmann foundation , germany 's largest private non-profit organization , examines the approaches of various eu-countries to csr , and finds that there is no unified concept . sweden , the united kingdom and the netherlands are at the forefront of corporate responsibility , the study finds .
in denmark , larger companies are required to present an annual environmental report to the government .

mark medlock likes to chuck swear words at his devotees and ignore their attention - and they just crave more . it seems that adoration has no bounds when it comes to the idolization of rock stars and singers .
the more violent and abusive the star , the more the fans seem to love them .
when jim morrison abused an audience of thousands at a concert in miami in 1969 by shouting , " you 're all a bunch of f * * * ing slaves ! " the cheers for the outrageous doors frontman got even louder .
less than a decade later , young punks in london would literally fight each other to get to the front of a sex pistols gig on the off chance of getting spat on by johnny rotten or having sid vicious break his bass over their heads .
music genres such as rock and punk are fuelled by the chemistry between the simmering malevolence on stage and the unleashed mayhem in the crowd .
the energy created by confrontational artists and willing victims is the stuff of legend .
it is this type of sado-masochistic , love-hate relationship which separates the edgy from the cozy - which is why you 'll never get bottles of urine thrown on stage at a take that concert .
following in the footsteps of legends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luckily medlock has n't copied jim morrison 's " snake " act but that could all change if housewives ' favorite and teeny lust object mark " bobbelsche " medlock gets his way .
the latest winner of german talent show deutschland sucht den superstar -lrb- dsds -rrb- is already beginning to blur the boundaries between insipid pop poser and raging rock behemoth .
and in the time-honored fashion , his fans are lapping up the abuse .
the r 'n'b singer from frankfurt owes his new-found fame to the thousands of dreamy and lusty teenage fans who voted by phone to award him the title of germany 's latest superstar and yet , despite the fact that each vote cost his fans 50 cents per call , he doesn ’ t appear to be too humble .
mark 's proclamation to his fans that " i love you all so f * * * ing much " could quite easily be taken as an over-enthusiastic cry of thanks but referring to his audience as " a bunch of dirty bastards " requires deeper analysis to find the remotest appreciation of their efforts .
" since i saw mark for the first time , i can no longer imagine my life without him , " wrote one fan on the superstar 's internet fan site .
" i cry if i see him on the tv and am moved profoundly if i hear him talking . "
even when he ’ s spilling lines of profanities at the devoted ?
it seems so .
abusive star " just being himself " christian maier , the operator of the fan site , laughs off mark 's earthy attitude to his fans .
" he ’ s just a witty guy , " maier told german news magazine spiegel .
" when he calls us dirty bastards , it does n't mean anything .
it 's just how he is . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pistols were witty boys too ... who liked to spit on fans maier runs the fan site from austria and he led the wave of thousands of mark devotees calling in expensive votes from outside germany .
" we were charged a lot more than those calling from germany , " he said .
" but we kept calling .
hundreds and hundreds called all through the night to help mark win . "
any words of thanks yet ?
it seems that the commitment of austrian fans has been relayed to the new superstar but he has yet to acknowledge them or even throw an insult in their direction .
the fan site almost collapsed under the amount of supporters logging on during and after the final but neither an acknowledgement nor accusation of dubious parentage has come from the bobbelsche 's finely pursed lips .
" above all , we long to hear from mark and we hope that -lrb- dsds judge -rrb- dieter bohlen can help him to become a star , " said maier , almost wistfully .

" we were charged a lot more than those calling from germany , " he said .
" but we kept calling .

any words of thanks yet ?
it seems that the commitment of austrian fans has been relayed to the new superstar but he has yet to acknowledge them or even throw an insult in their direction .
the fan site almost collapsed under the amount of supporters logging on during and after the final but neither an acknowledgement nor accusation of dubious parentage has come from the bobbelsche 's finely pursed lips .
" above all , we long to hear from mark and we hope that -lrb- dsds judge -rrb- dieter bohlen can help him to become a star , " said maier , almost wistfully .

horst v. , formerly a manager and consultant at the electronics giant , was sentenced to 18 months parole .
the two men were charged with bribing enel employees with nearly six million euros between 1999 and 2002 , in order to win siemens 450 million euros -lrb- $ 612 million -rrb- worth of contracts to deliver turbines for power generators .
senior public prosecutor ulrich busch demanded monday that siemens pay a fine of 97.7 million euros -lrb- $ 132.5 million -rrb- to the state as a penalty for the enel corruption case .
the amount is equal to the company 's gross profit from the delivery of two turbines to enel -lrb- 103.8 million euros -rrb- , minus a 6.12 million euro fine that had already been assessed during an earlier trial in milan .
re-shuffling at the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo klaus kleinfeld is n't the only siemens exec to throw in the towel the scandal at siemens continues to cause turmoil at the highest levels of management .
it is still unclear to who replace chairman klaus kleinfeld , who announced his resignation on april 25 .
the company 's head of communications , janos gönczöl , announced monday that he , too , would be resigning .
" it was n't easy organizing the communications department during this turbulent period , which was full of rumors and speculation , " said 49-year-old gönczöl .
" i hope that , with this step , the communications department will have a smoother path . "
stephan heimbach , current director of the corporate affairs department , will replace gönczöl , siemens announced .

but dw 's anke hagedorn says france 's european partners may have little reason to cheer a nationalistically inclined leader in paris . nicolas sarkozy has emerged triumphant in an election that pitted the right against the left , and a man against france 's first-ever female presidential candidate .
the vote attracted far more voters to the polls than in recent years .
the majority cast their ballots for a conservative who favors economic liberalism , a reduction in france 's gigantic state bureaucracy and limitations on immigration . sarkozy succeeded in attracting voters away from far-right candidate jean-marie le pen .
and he made the french electorate forget that under conservative leadership france has amassed the highest unemployment in the euro zone and a record level of government debt . french voters were given the choice between a cool , calculating political professional in sarkozy and an emotional , relative newcomer in socialist segolene royal .
royal and the socialists failed to convince the majority that they had any real plans to solve france 's problems . but what can europeans expect from sarkozy 's presidency ?
certainly not that he will come up with concrete solutions to european problems .
he hardly mentioned the eu in his campaign .
and when he did , the tone was one of what the eu could do for france , and not vice versa . sarkozy has a reputation of being power-hungry and reluctant to listen to advice , and in the past , he has repeatedly played the nationalist trump card .
for instance , sarkozy did n't exactly endear himself to germans by bringing up world war ii and the holocaust on a number of occasions during the campaign . sarkozy was trying to play on french national pride .
at a campaign rally in marseille , he gleefully pointed out that not all french people supported the nazi-installed occupation government during world war ii .
" there were also the heroes of a free france , " sarkozy crowed , " and the résistance . " to underscore that message , he staged his last rally at a symbolic site of the french resistance , the plateau des glières , promising , if elected , to make an annual pilgrimage there .
but how can an obsession with history help a president who has pledged to lead france into a new era ? france 's neighbors can only hope that this was empty campaign chest-thumping , and that sarkozy will remember his european responsibilities when france assumes the eu 's rotating presidency in june of next year . in his first speech after winning sunday 's election , sarkozy said he has always been a committed european .

merkel congratulates sarkozy , hopes for stronger ties police , protesters battle after sarkozy win conservative sarkozy is france 's next president elections -pipe- 07.05.2007 opinion : sarkozy 's win means european uncertainty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in electing nicolas sarkozy on sunday , the french voted for national reform .
but dw 's anke hagedorn says france 's european partners may have little reason to cheer a nationalistically inclined leader in paris . nicolas sarkozy has emerged triumphant in an election that pitted the right against the left , and a man against france 's first-ever female presidential candidate .
the vote attracted far more voters to the polls than in recent years .
the majority cast their ballots for a conservative who favors economic liberalism , a reduction in france 's gigantic state bureaucracy and limitations on immigration . sarkozy succeeded in attracting voters away from far-right candidate jean-marie le pen .
and he made the french electorate forget that under conservative leadership france has amassed the highest unemployment in the euro zone and a record level of government debt . french voters were given the choice between a cool , calculating political professional in sarkozy and an emotional , relative newcomer in socialist segolene royal .
royal and the socialists failed to convince the majority that they had any real plans to solve france 's problems . but what can europeans expect from sarkozy 's presidency ?
certainly not that he will come up with concrete solutions to european problems .
he hardly mentioned the eu in his campaign .
and when he did , the tone was one of what the eu could do for france , and not vice versa . sarkozy has a reputation of being power-hungry and reluctant to listen to advice , and in the past , he has repeatedly played the nationalist trump card .
for instance , sarkozy did n't exactly endear himself to germans by bringing up world war ii and the holocaust on a number of occasions during the campaign . sarkozy was trying to play on french national pride .
at a campaign rally in marseille , he gleefully pointed out that not all french people supported the nazi-installed occupation government during world war ii .
" there were also the heroes of a free france , " sarkozy crowed , " and the résistance . " to underscore that message , he staged his last rally at a symbolic site of the french resistance , the plateau des glières , promising , if elected , to make an annual pilgrimage there .
but how can an obsession with history help a president who has pledged to lead france into a new era ? france 's neighbors can only hope that this was empty campaign chest-thumping , and that sarkozy will remember his european responsibilities when france assumes the eu 's rotating presidency in june of next year . in his first speech after winning sunday 's election , sarkozy said he has always been a committed european .
the rest of europe now waits to see if deeds will follow those words . anke hagedorn -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police , protesters battle after sarkozy win demonstrators in city suburbs across france threw rocks and bottles as conservative nicolas sarkozy won the country 's presidential election .

köhler will decide this week over klar 's possible release . after a weekend of unprecedented verbal attacks on the german president by her ministers , chancellor angela merkel called on sunday for an end to the harsh criticism arising from horst köhler ’ s decision to consider whether to grant clemency to a former red army faction guerrilla after 24 years in prison .
köhler announced on friday , shortly after meeting with christian klar - who was convicted in 1982 for his role a series of raf killings - that he would decide on the former terrorist 's bid for freedom in the coming days .
the president 's announcement caused an outcry in merkel ’ s christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with some members calling for köhler to be denied the chance to stand for a second term in 2009 should he approve klar 's release .
merkel calls for respect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called for an end to the criticism of köhler this prompted the chancellor to release a statement calling for restraint as the criticism reached a crescendo over the weekend .
" respect for the office and person of the president must always be protected , " merkel said .
" i ask that we all , regardless of how the president decides in the end , respect the decision of horst köhler .
" -lrb- there is -rrb- no doubt that the president will handle this difficult and controversial issue after careful examination in a very conscientious way , " she added .
merkel 's words were echoed by her interior minister , wolfgang schäuble , who added : " the president and the president alone has the right to make these decisions .
he has the highest responsibility and special obligation to decide and everyone must respect that . "
the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- leader guido westerwelle also joined in with the condemnation of the criticism .
" while all opinion is allowed and in fact encouraged in this debate , the level of this criticism aimed at the federal president is absolutely unacceptable . "
he added that he expected more respect from the members of the csu who had led the attacks on köhler and by doing so had put the president and the constitution under pressure .
however , westerwelle also took the opportunity to restate his own views on klar 's potential release by saying that he should not be pardoned until he showed remorse for his actions . green party co-chairperson claudia roth also condemned the criticism and voiced her support for a pardon .
" in our constitutional state , we do not operate on revenge but reintegration , " roth said .
" the csu has no respect for horst köhler the person , and it ignores his presidential position . "
she added that the criticism over köhler ’ s meeting with klar was unfounded .
" it is important and correct that -lrb- köhler -rrb- meets with klar and holds a personal conversation with him to get his own picture of the man . "
csu hardliners talk of withdrawing support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein said klar should remian behind bars the attacks against köhler were led by senior csu politicians , including günther beckstein , the bavarian state interior minister .
beckstein said that a criminal like klar belonged behind bars and added : " it is my view of justice that a criminal who does not confess is undeserving of clemency . "
csu member of parliament andreas scheuer went further , saying , " if the federal president uses his power to pardon klar then i will have to seriously consider whether the president will have my future support . "
in the event of a presidential pardon , scheuer urged the german government not to countersign .
" this would send out a clear message that the german government does not agree with the president ’ s decision , " he said .
the move to release klar is also strongly opposed by most of the families of his victims .
klar hopes for early release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar is eligible for release in 2009 klar , 54 , has served more than 24 years of a life term for his role in several murders committed at the end of the 1970s with the urban guerrilla group .
he was jailed for a series of killings , including the shooting of federal prosecutor siegfried buback , during the raf 's violent campaign against what it called the oppressive capitalist west german state and elite in the 1970s and early 1980s .
klar is eligible for early release in 2009 but has appealed for clemency to get out sooner as it is rare for criminals to spend more than 20 years in prison in germany .

köhler will decide this week over klar 's possible release . after a weekend of unprecedented verbal attacks on the german president by her ministers , chancellor angela merkel called on sunday for an end to the harsh criticism arising from horst köhler ’ s decision to consider whether to grant clemency to a former red army faction guerrilla after 24 years in prison .
köhler announced on friday , shortly after meeting with christian klar - who was convicted in 1982 for his role a series of raf killings - that he would decide on the former terrorist 's bid for freedom in the coming days .
the president 's announcement caused an outcry in merkel ’ s christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with some members calling for köhler to be denied the chance to stand for a second term in 2009 should he approve klar 's release .
merkel calls for respect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called for an end to the criticism of köhler this prompted the chancellor to release a statement calling for restraint as the criticism reached a crescendo over the weekend .
" respect for the office and person of the president must always be protected , " merkel said .
" i ask that we all , regardless of how the president decides in the end , respect the decision of horst köhler .
" -lrb- there is -rrb- no doubt that the president will handle this difficult and controversial issue after careful examination in a very conscientious way , " she added .
merkel 's words were echoed by her interior minister , wolfgang schäuble , who added : " the president and the president alone has the right to make these decisions .
he has the highest responsibility and special obligation to decide and everyone must respect that . "
the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- leader guido westerwelle also joined in with the condemnation of the criticism .
" while all opinion is allowed and in fact encouraged in this debate , the level of this criticism aimed at the federal president is absolutely unacceptable . "
he added that he expected more respect from the members of the csu who had led the attacks on köhler and by doing so had put the president and the constitution under pressure .
however , westerwelle also took the opportunity to restate his own views on klar 's potential release by saying that he should not be pardoned until he showed remorse for his actions . green party co-chairperson claudia roth also condemned the criticism and voiced her support for a pardon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : france 's next president : nicolas sarkozy opinion : sarkozy 's win means european uncertainty merkel congratulates sarkozy , hopes for stronger ties police , protesters battle after sarkozy win conservative sarkozy is france 's next president press review -pipe- 07.05.2007 european press review : the right revolution in france ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the revolution has begun : french president-elect nicolas sarkozy european newspapers hailed nicolas sarkozy 's victory at the polls as a milestone in the history of the 5th french republic .
editorialists noted a rightward shift - some with satisfaction , others with suspicion . french editorialists across the board were full of praise for this year 's electoral process in france , which saw unprecedented voter turnout during both rounds of presidential voting and a decisive victory for former interior minister nicolas sarkozy .
but french papers were divided over the outcome of the vote . in the french daily le figaro , nicolas beytout doted on the " brilliant election of nicolas sarkozy . "
the campaign " has been exceptionally active and controversial , with massive participation in the first and second rounds , " and it " will certainly leave a permanent mark on the country 's history , " beytout wrote .
at the same time , he observed that the french right won " a score against the left that has n't been reached since general de gaulle . "
noting that for the first time in three decades , french voters elected a candidate from the outgoing camp -lrb- outgoing president jacques chirac and sarkozy both belong to the conservative ump party -rrb- , the editorialist opined that " gone are the days of systematic alternation , that frenzied back-and-forth that all too often has seen the country do and then undo that which it just created . "
as for socialist candidate ségolène royal , beytout wrote that she lost by a wide margin chiefly because " she was chosen by her own party based more on her personality than on the maturity of her project . "
france is ready for change , and the paper called sarkozy 's campaign " a victory for movement . " meanwhile , the french daily libération was not so excited about sarkozy 's victory .
despite a clear preference for the socialist candidate , laurent joffrin wrote that " france made a clean choice . "
the editorialist said sarkozy " is a legitimate president , " and that the campaign was " dignified , passionate and civil to the highest degree . "
but joffrin was concerned about sarkozy 's stated goal of " reconciling france with the dominant norm of conservative liberalism , " and wondered whether sarkozy is a " thatcher sans petticoat ? "
the editorialist conceded that the " values of competition " demand the modernization of france , but that " the values of solidarity and justice remain " as a programmatic building block for the socialist party .
" the cherry season will return , " joffrin concluded , but " for the time being , it 's pit season .
take courage . " german newspapers were hopeful that sarkozy would bring about badly needed changes in france , but also worried that he might embark on a unilateral crusade if his party wins the upcoming parliamentary elections , as well . the online edition of the popular german magazine der spiegel observed that french voters elected what they perceived as " the candidate who has announced a new beginning , a change , even a ' break ' with hardened traditions " following " the leaden times of twelve years of ' chiraquie . " '
but the editorialist , stefan simons , went on to question the integrity of sarkozy 's campaign promises : " whoops , hold on a minute , and what about the last five years ? " he asked .
as former interior minister , " was n't he -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- - number three in the government - also responsible for the slow decline of the nation ? "
the " perfect feat " of sarkozy 's campaign , according to simons , was that his team was able to " refashion jacques chirac 's long-time minister as a ' newcomer , ' an outsider , even something of an opposition leader . "
simons was concerned over sarkozy 's courting the far-right vote , saying that he " has made the slogans of -lrb- far-right -rrb- front national-leader jean-marie le pen acceptable in mainstream discourse . "
the parliamentary elections in june , so the editorialist , will prove whether sarkozy is really interested in national unity , as he has said , or whether france will be ruled by " sarkozy the terminator . " spanish observers were hopeful that sarkozy 's election would give new impetus to the european union project , which faltered after french -lrb- and dutch -rrb- voters rejected the draft eu-constitution in a referendum . spanish daily el país mirrored the widespread opinion that sarkozy 's victory " reflects a desire for change , and comes at the hands of an authentic revolution in french politics . "
the commentator was suspicious of sarkozy 's propensity for populism , but also noted with satisfaction that he " has not passed through the grandes écoles from whence most of the french elites have come . "
sarkozy 's election also indicates that " french society has moved to the right , " and that " le pen has contaminated all of french politics . "
the editorialist believed that " europe has waited a long time on france , and they can wait a little longer until june , when this country , which is key to europe , recovers much of its intellectual , social and economic vitality " following what the editorial opined will be another victory for the conservative camp at the parliamentary polls .
" sarkozy sympathizes with spain , " the daily paper wrote , and " as minister of the interior , he acted with total support and loyalty . "
that is why , in the view of the spanish editorialist , " spain and -lrb- spanish president josé luis rodríguez -rrb- zapatero have a perfectly viable ally . " finally , italian journalist massimo nava , author of an essay on nicolas sarkozy , evaluated the french election campaign for italian daily corriere della sera .
like most of his european counterparts , nava was of the opinion " the new french revolution has begun . "
he wrote that " sarkozy has disinhibited the right , freeing it from its complexes . "

editorialists noted a rightward shift - some with satisfaction , others with suspicion . french editorialists across the board were full of praise for this year 's electoral process in france , which saw unprecedented voter turnout during both rounds of presidential voting and a decisive victory for former interior minister nicolas sarkozy .
but french papers were divided over the outcome of the vote . in the french daily le figaro , nicolas beytout doted on the " brilliant election of nicolas sarkozy . "
the campaign " has been exceptionally active and controversial , with massive participation in the first and second rounds , " and it " will certainly leave a permanent mark on the country 's history , " beytout wrote .
at the same time , he observed that the french right won " a score against the left that has n't been reached since general de gaulle . "
noting that for the first time in three decades , french voters elected a candidate from the outgoing camp -lrb- outgoing president jacques chirac and sarkozy both belong to the conservative ump party -rrb- , the editorialist opined that " gone are the days of systematic alternation , that frenzied back-and-forth that all too often has seen the country do and then undo that which it just created . "
as for socialist candidate ségolène royal , beytout wrote that she lost by a wide margin chiefly because " she was chosen by her own party based more on her personality than on the maturity of her project . "
france is ready for change , and the paper called sarkozy 's campaign " a victory for movement . " meanwhile , the french daily libération was not so excited about sarkozy 's victory .
despite a clear preference for the socialist candidate , laurent joffrin wrote that " france made a clean choice . "
the editorialist said sarkozy " is a legitimate president , " and that the campaign was " dignified , passionate and civil to the highest degree . "
but joffrin was concerned about sarkozy 's stated goal of " reconciling france with the dominant norm of conservative liberalism , " and wondered whether sarkozy is a " thatcher sans petticoat ? "
the editorialist conceded that the " values of competition " demand the modernization of france , but that " the values of solidarity and justice remain " as a programmatic building block for the socialist party .
" the cherry season will return , " joffrin concluded , but " for the time being , it 's pit season .
take courage . " german newspapers were hopeful that sarkozy would bring about badly needed changes in france , but also worried that he might embark on a unilateral crusade if his party wins the upcoming parliamentary elections , as well . the online edition of the popular german magazine der spiegel observed that french voters elected what they perceived as " the candidate who has announced a new beginning , a change , even a ' break ' with hardened traditions " following " the leaden times of twelve years of ' chiraquie . " '
but the editorialist , stefan simons , went on to question the integrity of sarkozy 's campaign promises : " whoops , hold on a minute , and what about the last five years ? " he asked .

editorialists noted a rightward shift - some with satisfaction , others with suspicion . french editorialists across the board were full of praise for this year 's electoral process in france , which saw unprecedented voter turnout during both rounds of presidential voting and a decisive victory for former interior minister nicolas sarkozy .
but french papers were divided over the outcome of the vote . in the french daily le figaro , nicolas beytout doted on the " brilliant election of nicolas sarkozy . "
the campaign " has been exceptionally active and controversial , with massive participation in the first and second rounds , " and it " will certainly leave a permanent mark on the country 's history , " beytout wrote .
at the same time , he observed that the french right won " a score against the left that has n't been reached since general de gaulle . "
noting that for the first time in three decades , french voters elected a candidate from the outgoing camp -lrb- outgoing president jacques chirac and sarkozy both belong to the conservative ump party -rrb- , the editorialist opined that " gone are the days of systematic alternation , that frenzied back-and-forth that all too often has seen the country do and then undo that which it just created . "
as for socialist candidate ségolène royal , beytout wrote that she lost by a wide margin chiefly because " she was chosen by her own party based more on her personality than on the maturity of her project . "
france is ready for change , and the paper called sarkozy 's campaign " a victory for movement . " meanwhile , the french daily libération was not so excited about sarkozy 's victory .
despite a clear preference for the socialist candidate , laurent joffrin wrote that " france made a clean choice . "
the editorialist said sarkozy " is a legitimate president , " and that the campaign was " dignified , passionate and civil to the highest degree . "
but joffrin was concerned about sarkozy 's stated goal of " reconciling france with the dominant norm of conservative liberalism , " and wondered whether sarkozy is a " thatcher sans petticoat ? "
the editorialist conceded that the " values of competition " demand the modernization of france , but that " the values of solidarity and justice remain " as a programmatic building block for the socialist party .
" the cherry season will return , " joffrin concluded , but " for the time being , it 's pit season .
take courage . " german newspapers were hopeful that sarkozy would bring about badly needed changes in france , but also worried that he might embark on a unilateral crusade if his party wins the upcoming parliamentary elections , as well . the online edition of the popular german magazine der spiegel observed that french voters elected what they perceived as " the candidate who has announced a new beginning , a change , even a ' break ' with hardened traditions " following " the leaden times of twelve years of ' chiraquie . " '
but the editorialist , stefan simons , went on to question the integrity of sarkozy 's campaign promises : " whoops , hold on a minute , and what about the last five years ? " he asked .
as former interior minister , " was n't he -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- - number three in the government - also responsible for the slow decline of the nation ? "
the " perfect feat " of sarkozy 's campaign , according to simons , was that his team was able to " refashion jacques chirac 's long-time minister as a ' newcomer , ' an outsider , even something of an opposition leader . "
simons was concerned over sarkozy 's courting the far-right vote , saying that he " has made the slogans of -lrb- far-right -rrb- front national-leader jean-marie le pen acceptable in mainstream discourse . "
the parliamentary elections in june , so the editorialist , will prove whether sarkozy is really interested in national unity , as he has said , or whether france will be ruled by " sarkozy the terminator . " spanish observers were hopeful that sarkozy 's election would give new impetus to the european union project , which faltered after french -lrb- and dutch -rrb- voters rejected the draft eu-constitution in a referendum . spanish daily el país mirrored the widespread opinion that sarkozy 's victory " reflects a desire for change , and comes at the hands of an authentic revolution in french politics . "
the commentator was suspicious of sarkozy 's propensity for populism , but also noted with satisfaction that he " has not passed through the grandes écoles from whence most of the french elites have come . "
sarkozy 's election also indicates that " french society has moved to the right , " and that " le pen has contaminated all of french politics . "
the editorialist believed that " europe has waited a long time on france , and they can wait a little longer until june , when this country , which is key to europe , recovers much of its intellectual , social and economic vitality " following what the editorial opined will be another victory for the conservative camp at the parliamentary polls .
" sarkozy sympathizes with spain , " the daily paper wrote , and " as minister of the interior , he acted with total support and loyalty . "
that is why , in the view of the spanish editorialist , " spain and -lrb- spanish president josé luis rodríguez -rrb- zapatero have a perfectly viable ally . " finally , italian journalist massimo nava , author of an essay on nicolas sarkozy , evaluated the french election campaign for italian daily corriere della sera .
like most of his european counterparts , nava was of the opinion " the new french revolution has begun . "
he wrote that " sarkozy has disinhibited the right , freeing it from its complexes . "
furthermore , " he has swung the national front voters away from le pen and could become the blair of the european right . "

köhler also rejected the plea of fellow former raf terrorist birgit hogefeld .
" the federal president has decided to refrain from granting clemency to mr. christian klar , " a statement from köhler 's office said .
köhler announced on friday , shortly after meeting with klar - who was convicted in 1982 for his role in a series of raf killings - that he would decide on the former terrorist 's bid for freedom in the coming days .
the president 's announcement caused an outcry in chancellor angela merkel ’ s christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with some members calling for köhler to be denied the chance to stand for a second term in 2009 should he approve klar 's release .
the outcry prompted the chancellor to call for the attacks on köhler to stop and for the office and role of the president to be respected .
a number of prominent conservative and opposition politicians supported her statements .

editorialists noted a rightward shift - some with satisfaction , others with suspicion . french editorialists across the board were full of praise for this year 's electoral process in france , which saw unprecedented voter turnout during both rounds of presidential voting and a decisive victory for former interior minister nicolas sarkozy .
but french papers were divided over the outcome of the vote . in the french daily le figaro , nicolas beytout doted on the " brilliant election of nicolas sarkozy . "
the campaign " has been exceptionally active and controversial , with massive participation in the first and second rounds , " and it " will certainly leave a permanent mark on the country 's history , " beytout wrote .
at the same time , he observed that the french right won " a score against the left that has n't been reached since general de gaulle . "
noting that for the first time in three decades , french voters elected a candidate from the outgoing camp -lrb- outgoing president jacques chirac and sarkozy both belong to the conservative ump party -rrb- , the editorialist opined that " gone are the days of systematic alternation , that frenzied back-and-forth that all too often has seen the country do and then undo that which it just created . "
as for socialist candidate ségolène royal , beytout wrote that she lost by a wide margin chiefly because " she was chosen by her own party based more on her personality than on the maturity of her project . "
france is ready for change , and the paper called sarkozy 's campaign " a victory for movement . " meanwhile , the french daily libération was not so excited about sarkozy 's victory .
despite a clear preference for the socialist candidate , laurent joffrin wrote that " france made a clean choice . "
the editorialist said sarkozy " is a legitimate president , " and that the campaign was " dignified , passionate and civil to the highest degree . "
but joffrin was concerned about sarkozy 's stated goal of " reconciling france with the dominant norm of conservative liberalism , " and wondered whether sarkozy is a " thatcher sans petticoat ? "
the editorialist conceded that the " values of competition " demand the modernization of france , but that " the values of solidarity and justice remain " as a programmatic building block for the socialist party .
" the cherry season will return , " joffrin concluded , but " for the time being , it 's pit season .
take courage . " german newspapers were hopeful that sarkozy would bring about badly needed changes in france , but also worried that he might embark on a unilateral crusade if his party wins the upcoming parliamentary elections , as well . the online edition of the popular german magazine der spiegel observed that french voters elected what they perceived as " the candidate who has announced a new beginning , a change , even a ' break ' with hardened traditions " following " the leaden times of twelve years of ' chiraquie . " '
but the editorialist , stefan simons , went on to question the integrity of sarkozy 's campaign promises : " whoops , hold on a minute , and what about the last five years ? " he asked .
as former interior minister , " was n't he -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- - number three in the government - also responsible for the slow decline of the nation ? "
the " perfect feat " of sarkozy 's campaign , according to simons , was that his team was able to " refashion jacques chirac 's long-time minister as a ' newcomer , ' an outsider , even something of an opposition leader . "
simons was concerned over sarkozy 's courting the far-right vote , saying that he " has made the slogans of -lrb- far-right -rrb- front national-leader jean-marie le pen acceptable in mainstream discourse . "
the parliamentary elections in june , so the editorialist , will prove whether sarkozy is really interested in national unity , as he has said , or whether france will be ruled by " sarkozy the terminator . " spanish observers were hopeful that sarkozy 's election would give new impetus to the european union project , which faltered after french -lrb- and dutch -rrb- voters rejected the draft eu-constitution in a referendum . spanish daily el país mirrored the widespread opinion that sarkozy 's victory " reflects a desire for change , and comes at the hands of an authentic revolution in french politics . "
the commentator was suspicious of sarkozy 's propensity for populism , but also noted with satisfaction that he " has not passed through the grandes écoles from whence most of the french elites have come . "
sarkozy 's election also indicates that " french society has moved to the right , " and that " le pen has contaminated all of french politics . "
the editorialist believed that " europe has waited a long time on france , and they can wait a little longer until june , when this country , which is key to europe , recovers much of its intellectual , social and economic vitality " following what the editorial opined will be another victory for the conservative camp at the parliamentary polls .
" sarkozy sympathizes with spain , " the daily paper wrote , and " as minister of the interior , he acted with total support and loyalty . "
that is why , in the view of the spanish editorialist , " spain and -lrb- spanish president josé luis rodríguez -rrb- zapatero have a perfectly viable ally . " finally , italian journalist massimo nava , author of an essay on nicolas sarkozy , evaluated the french election campaign for italian daily corriere della sera .
like most of his european counterparts , nava was of the opinion " the new french revolution has begun . "
he wrote that " sarkozy has disinhibited the right , freeing it from its complexes . "
furthermore , " he has swung the national front voters away from le pen and could become the blair of the european right . "
meanwhile , ségolène royal " has shrunk the far-left to a minimum and freed the left from its archaisms and heavy machinery .

editorialists noted a rightward shift - some with satisfaction , others with suspicion . french editorialists across the board were full of praise for this year 's electoral process in france , which saw unprecedented voter turnout during both rounds of presidential voting and a decisive victory for former interior minister nicolas sarkozy .
but french papers were divided over the outcome of the vote . in the french daily le figaro , nicolas beytout doted on the " brilliant election of nicolas sarkozy . "
the campaign " has been exceptionally active and controversial , with massive participation in the first and second rounds , " and it " will certainly leave a permanent mark on the country 's history , " beytout wrote .
at the same time , he observed that the french right won " a score against the left that has n't been reached since general de gaulle . "
noting that for the first time in three decades , french voters elected a candidate from the outgoing camp -lrb- outgoing president jacques chirac and sarkozy both belong to the conservative ump party -rrb- , the editorialist opined that " gone are the days of systematic alternation , that frenzied back-and-forth that all too often has seen the country do and then undo that which it just created . "
as for socialist candidate ségolène royal , beytout wrote that she lost by a wide margin chiefly because " she was chosen by her own party based more on her personality than on the maturity of her project . "
france is ready for change , and the paper called sarkozy 's campaign " a victory for movement . " meanwhile , the french daily libération was not so excited about sarkozy 's victory .
despite a clear preference for the socialist candidate , laurent joffrin wrote that " france made a clean choice . "
the editorialist said sarkozy " is a legitimate president , " and that the campaign was " dignified , passionate and civil to the highest degree . "
but joffrin was concerned about sarkozy 's stated goal of " reconciling france with the dominant norm of conservative liberalism , " and wondered whether sarkozy is a " thatcher sans petticoat ? "
the editorialist conceded that the " values of competition " demand the modernization of france , but that " the values of solidarity and justice remain " as a programmatic building block for the socialist party .
" the cherry season will return , " joffrin concluded , but " for the time being , it 's pit season .
take courage . " german newspapers were hopeful that sarkozy would bring about badly needed changes in france , but also worried that he might embark on a unilateral crusade if his party wins the upcoming parliamentary elections , as well . the online edition of the popular german magazine der spiegel observed that french voters elected what they perceived as " the candidate who has announced a new beginning , a change , even a ' break ' with hardened traditions " following " the leaden times of twelve years of ' chiraquie . " '
but the editorialist , stefan simons , went on to question the integrity of sarkozy 's campaign promises : " whoops , hold on a minute , and what about the last five years ? " he asked .
as former interior minister , " was n't he -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- - number three in the government - also responsible for the slow decline of the nation ? "
the " perfect feat " of sarkozy 's campaign , according to simons , was that his team was able to " refashion jacques chirac 's long-time minister as a ' newcomer , ' an outsider , even something of an opposition leader . "
simons was concerned over sarkozy 's courting the far-right vote , saying that he " has made the slogans of -lrb- far-right -rrb- front national-leader jean-marie le pen acceptable in mainstream discourse . "
the parliamentary elections in june , so the editorialist , will prove whether sarkozy is really interested in national unity , as he has said , or whether france will be ruled by " sarkozy the terminator . " spanish observers were hopeful that sarkozy 's election would give new impetus to the european union project , which faltered after french -lrb- and dutch -rrb- voters rejected the draft eu-constitution in a referendum . spanish daily el país mirrored the widespread opinion that sarkozy 's victory " reflects a desire for change , and comes at the hands of an authentic revolution in french politics . "
the commentator was suspicious of sarkozy 's propensity for populism , but also noted with satisfaction that he " has not passed through the grandes écoles from whence most of the french elites have come . "
sarkozy 's election also indicates that " french society has moved to the right , " and that " le pen has contaminated all of french politics . "
the editorialist believed that " europe has waited a long time on france , and they can wait a little longer until june , when this country , which is key to europe , recovers much of its intellectual , social and economic vitality " following what the editorial opined will be another victory for the conservative camp at the parliamentary polls .
" sarkozy sympathizes with spain , " the daily paper wrote , and " as minister of the interior , he acted with total support and loyalty . "
that is why , in the view of the spanish editorialist , " spain and -lrb- spanish president josé luis rodríguez -rrb- zapatero have a perfectly viable ally . " finally , italian journalist massimo nava , author of an essay on nicolas sarkozy , evaluated the french election campaign for italian daily corriere della sera .
like most of his european counterparts , nava was of the opinion " the new french revolution has begun . "
he wrote that " sarkozy has disinhibited the right , freeing it from its complexes . "
furthermore , " he has swung the national front voters away from le pen and could become the blair of the european right . "
meanwhile , ségolène royal " has shrunk the far-left to a minimum and freed the left from its archaisms and heavy machinery .

horst v. , formerly a manager and consultant at the electronics giant , was sentenced to 18 months parole .
the two men were charged with bribing enel employees with nearly six million euros between 1999 and 2002 , in order to win siemens 450 million euros -lrb- $ 612 million -rrb- worth of contracts to deliver turbines for power generators .
senior public prosecutor ulrich busch demanded monday that siemens pay a fine of 97.7 million euros -lrb- $ 132.5 million -rrb- to the state as a penalty for the enel corruption case .
the amount is equal to the company 's gross profit from the delivery of two turbines to enel -lrb- 103.8 million euros -rrb- , minus a 6.12 million euro fine that had already been assessed during an earlier trial in milan .

köhler will decide this week over klar 's possible release . after a weekend of unprecedented verbal attacks on the german president by her ministers , chancellor angela merkel called on sunday for an end to the harsh criticism arising from horst köhler ’ s decision to consider whether to grant clemency to a former red army faction guerrilla after 24 years in prison .
köhler announced on friday , shortly after meeting with christian klar - who was convicted in 1982 for his role a series of raf killings - that he would decide on the former terrorist 's bid for freedom in the coming days .
the president 's announcement caused an outcry in merkel ’ s christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with some members calling for köhler to be denied the chance to stand for a second term in 2009 should he approve klar 's release .
merkel calls for respect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called for an end to the criticism of köhler this prompted the chancellor to release a statement calling for restraint as the criticism reached a crescendo over the weekend .
" respect for the office and person of the president must always be protected , " merkel said .
" i ask that we all , regardless of how the president decides in the end , respect the decision of horst köhler .
" -lrb- there is -rrb- no doubt that the president will handle this difficult and controversial issue after careful examination in a very conscientious way , " she added .
merkel 's words were echoed by her interior minister , wolfgang schäuble , who added : " the president and the president alone has the right to make these decisions .
he has the highest responsibility and special obligation to decide and everyone must respect that . "
the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- leader guido westerwelle also joined in with the condemnation of the criticism .
" while all opinion is allowed and in fact encouraged in this debate , the level of this criticism aimed at the federal president is absolutely unacceptable . "
he added that he expected more respect from the members of the csu who had led the attacks on köhler and by doing so had put the president and the constitution under pressure .
however , westerwelle also took the opportunity to restate his own views on klar 's potential release by saying that he should not be pardoned until he showed remorse for his actions . green party co-chairperson claudia roth also condemned the criticism and voiced her support for a pardon .
" in our constitutional state , we do not operate on revenge but reintegration , " roth said .
" the csu has no respect for horst köhler the person , and it ignores his presidential position . "
she added that the criticism over köhler ’ s meeting with klar was unfounded .
" it is important and correct that -lrb- köhler -rrb- meets with klar and holds a personal conversation with him to get his own picture of the man . "
csu hardliners talk of withdrawing support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein said klar should remian behind bars the attacks against köhler were led by senior csu politicians , including günther beckstein , the bavarian state interior minister .
beckstein said that a criminal like klar belonged behind bars and added : " it is my view of justice that a criminal who does not confess is undeserving of clemency . "
csu member of parliament andreas scheuer went further , saying , " if the federal president uses his power to pardon klar then i will have to seriously consider whether the president will have my future support . "
in the event of a presidential pardon , scheuer urged the german government not to countersign .
" this would send out a clear message that the german government does not agree with the president ’ s decision , " he said .
the move to release klar is also strongly opposed by most of the families of his victims .
klar hopes for early release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar is eligible for release in 2009 klar , 54 , has served more than 24 years of a life term for his role in several murders committed at the end of the 1970s with the urban guerrilla group .
he was jailed for a series of killings , including the shooting of federal prosecutor siegfried buback , during the raf 's violent campaign against what it called the oppressive capitalist west german state and elite in the 1970s and early 1980s .
klar is eligible for early release in 2009 but has appealed for clemency to get out sooner as it is rare for criminals to spend more than 20 years in prison in germany .

"
merkel said she was looking forward to meeting sarkozy in the near future " for a first exhange of views . "
the partnership between france and germany is often described as the " motor " of the eu and berlin is expected to be one of the first foreign visits sarkozy makes .
hopes for reviving eu constitution germany holds the rotating six-month presidency of the eu and merkel is keen to put the european bloc on track towards a revised constitutional treaty before the german presidency finishes at the end of june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the two see to it that the eu constitution is ratified ?
french voters rejected the draft constitution in a referendum in 2005.german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said shortly after sarkozy 's victory on sunday that he hoped berlin and paris would work closely together on " important european projects " under the incoming french president .
" i hope for a close german-french partnership , " steinmeier , a social democrat , said after right-wing sarkozy won sunday 's presidential election to succeed jacques chirac .
" of course i hope the cooperation will lead to progress on important european projects , " he added in a reference to the european union 's moribund draft constitution .
in a speech directly following the announcement that he won the country 's highest electoral office by a comfortable margin , sarkozy addressed france 's international agenda .
' our destiny is linked ' " i want to launch a call to our european partners , with whom our destiny is deeply linked , to tell them that i have been european all my life , that i believe deeply , that i believe sincerely , in european construction , and that tonight france is back in europe .
i beseech our european partners to hear the voices of people who want to be protected . "
another phone call came from european commission president jose manuel barroso , who congratulated sarkozy and said he was hopeful the new leader of france could help end the eu 's institutional woes .

" since a much-publicized us trip in september 2006 , sarkozy has fought against charges that he pandered to bush and the perception that he is too pro-american , a quality seen as unpopular with french voters . ' friendship is accepting difference ' addressing the crowd after his victory on sunday evening , he tried to get some distance form that image . " i want to tell -lrb- the united states -rrb- that france will always be by their side when they will need her .
but i want to tell them as well that friendship is accepting that one 's friends can act differently , and that a great nation like the united states has the duty to not obstruct the fight against global warming but on the contrary to head this struggle .
because what is at stake is the future of all humanity , " sarkozy said in his victory speech .

köhler will decide this week over klar 's possible release . after a weekend of unprecedented verbal attacks on the german president by her ministers , chancellor angela merkel called on sunday for an end to the harsh criticism arising from horst köhler ’ s decision to consider whether to grant clemency to a former red army faction guerrilla after 24 years in prison .
köhler announced on friday , shortly after meeting with christian klar - who was convicted in 1982 for his role a series of raf killings - that he would decide on the former terrorist 's bid for freedom in the coming days .
the president 's announcement caused an outcry in merkel ’ s christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with some members calling for köhler to be denied the chance to stand for a second term in 2009 should he approve klar 's release .
merkel calls for respect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called for an end to the criticism of köhler this prompted the chancellor to release a statement calling for restraint as the criticism reached a crescendo over the weekend .
" respect for the office and person of the president must always be protected , " merkel said .
" i ask that we all , regardless of how the president decides in the end , respect the decision of horst köhler .
" -lrb- there is -rrb- no doubt that the president will handle this difficult and controversial issue after careful examination in a very conscientious way , " she added .
merkel 's words were echoed by her interior minister , wolfgang schäuble , who added : " the president and the president alone has the right to make these decisions .
he has the highest responsibility and special obligation to decide and everyone must respect that . "
the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- leader guido westerwelle also joined in with the condemnation of the criticism .
" while all opinion is allowed and in fact encouraged in this debate , the level of this criticism aimed at the federal president is absolutely unacceptable . "
he added that he expected more respect from the members of the csu who had led the attacks on köhler and by doing so had put the president and the constitution under pressure .
however , westerwelle also took the opportunity to restate his own views on klar 's potential release by saying that he should not be pardoned until he showed remorse for his actions . green party co-chairperson claudia roth also condemned the criticism and voiced her support for a pardon .
" in our constitutional state , we do not operate on revenge but reintegration , " roth said .
" the csu has no respect for horst köhler the person , and it ignores his presidential position . "
she added that the criticism over köhler ’ s meeting with klar was unfounded .
" it is important and correct that -lrb- köhler -rrb- meets with klar and holds a personal conversation with him to get his own picture of the man . "
csu hardliners talk of withdrawing support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein said klar should remian behind bars the attacks against köhler were led by senior csu politicians , including günther beckstein , the bavarian state interior minister .
beckstein said that a criminal like klar belonged behind bars and added : " it is my view of justice that a criminal who does not confess is undeserving of clemency . "
csu member of parliament andreas scheuer went further , saying , " if the federal president uses his power to pardon klar then i will have to seriously consider whether the president will have my future support . "
in the event of a presidential pardon , scheuer urged the german government not to countersign .
" this would send out a clear message that the german government does not agree with the president ’ s decision , " he said .
the move to release klar is also strongly opposed by most of the families of his victims .
klar hopes for early release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar is eligible for release in 2009 klar , 54 , has served more than 24 years of a life term for his role in several murders committed at the end of the 1970s with the urban guerrilla group .
he was jailed for a series of killings , including the shooting of federal prosecutor siegfried buback , during the raf 's violent campaign against what it called the oppressive capitalist west german state and elite in the 1970s and early 1980s .
klar is eligible for early release in 2009 but has appealed for clemency to get out sooner as it is rare for criminals to spend more than 20 years in prison in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : france 's next president : nicolas sarkozy european press review : the right revolution in france ?
merkel congratulates sarkozy , hopes for stronger ties police , protesters battle after sarkozy win conservative sarkozy is france 's next president elections -pipe- 07.05.2007 opinion : sarkozy 's win means european uncertainty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in electing nicolas sarkozy on sunday , the french voted for national reform .
but dw 's anke hagedorn says france 's european partners may have little reason to cheer a nationalistically inclined leader in paris . nicolas sarkozy has emerged triumphant in an election that pitted the right against the left , and a man against france 's first-ever female presidential candidate .
the vote attracted far more voters to the polls than in recent years .
the majority cast their ballots for a conservative who favors economic liberalism , a reduction in france 's gigantic state bureaucracy and limitations on immigration . sarkozy succeeded in attracting voters away from far-right candidate jean-marie le pen .
and he made the french electorate forget that under conservative leadership france has amassed the highest unemployment in the euro zone and a record level of government debt . french voters were given the choice between a cool , calculating political professional in sarkozy and an emotional , relative newcomer in socialist segolene royal .
royal and the socialists failed to convince the majority that they had any real plans to solve france 's problems . but what can europeans expect from sarkozy 's presidency ?
certainly not that he will come up with concrete solutions to european problems .
he hardly mentioned the eu in his campaign .
and when he did , the tone was one of what the eu could do for france , and not vice versa . sarkozy has a reputation of being power-hungry and reluctant to listen to advice , and in the past , he has repeatedly played the nationalist trump card .
for instance , sarkozy did n't exactly endear himself to germans by bringing up world war ii and the holocaust on a number of occasions during the campaign . sarkozy was trying to play on french national pride .
at a campaign rally in marseille , he gleefully pointed out that not all french people supported the nazi-installed occupation government during world war ii .
" there were also the heroes of a free france , " sarkozy crowed , " and the résistance . " to underscore that message , he staged his last rally at a symbolic site of the french resistance , the plateau des glières , promising , if elected , to make an annual pilgrimage there .
but how can an obsession with history help a president who has pledged to lead france into a new era ? france 's neighbors can only hope that this was empty campaign chest-thumping , and that sarkozy will remember his european responsibilities when france assumes the eu 's rotating presidency in june of next year . in his first speech after winning sunday 's election , sarkozy said he has always been a committed european .
the rest of europe now waits to see if deeds will follow those words . anke hagedorn -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police , protesters battle after sarkozy win demonstrators in city suburbs across france threw rocks and bottles as conservative nicolas sarkozy won the country 's presidential election .
police moved in with tear gas and made scores of arrests .
-lrb- 07.05.2007 -rrb- merkel congratulates sarkozy , hopes for stronger ties german chancellor angela merkel said she hoped french president-elect nicolas sarkozy would strengthen the french-german axis at the heart of the european union .
-lrb- 07.05.2007 -rrb- conservative sarkozy is france 's next president right-wing candidate nicolas sarkozy handily won the french presidential election with 53 percent of the vote ; some 85 percent of those eligible came to the polls .
-lrb- 06.05.2007 -rrb- feedback will sarkozy be a good european ?

" it 's one of the most serious accidents in recent years , " an official from the ukrainian state gas company naftogaz told afp on condition of anonymity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the explosion tore out a 32-yard section of pipeline the official said the blast was likely due to a technical fault .
emergency services put out a fire at the scene and investigators were working to uncover the cause of the explosion , naftogaz said in a statement .
the incident immediately raised fears of gas shortfalls in europe , which relies heavily on russian supplies , but russia 's gas exporting monopoly gazprom quickly assured that deliveries would still reach clients .
assurances " there will be no disruption in supplies to our consumers .
our export supplies will continue at full volume , " sergei kupriyanov , a spokesman for gazprom , said on state television .
naftogaz also promised there would be no disruptions .

biggest foreign market the european union is the biggest foreign gas market for russia , the world 's leading natural gas producer .
nearly all of ukraine 's energy imports come via russia .
the incident revived memories of gas shortfalls throughout western europe at the start of 2006 when gazprom cut off supplies through ukraine due to a pricing dispute with the ex-soviet republic .
the 2006 crisis sparked concerns in the west over the reliability of russia as a supplier and accusations that moscow is using its huge energy reserves as a weapon against weaker ex-soviet neighbors . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bitterly disputed german-russian gas pipeline heads for estonia a controversial pipeline to carry russian gas under the baltic sea to germany could run through estonian waters , an official from the consortium behind the project said on friday .

but employers are nervous . the group of eight labor ministers , representing the world 's leading industrialized nations plus russia , convened on monday for a two-day meeting in dresden , germany . there , a new buzzword has emerged : " corporate social responsibility " - or csr for short . the idea behind this somewhat ambiguous , perhaps even euphemistic term is that big businesses - especially those operating on a global scale - should " integrate social and environmental issues into their business activities , " in the official wording of the european union commission . " economy , ecology and social action have to be carried out in a way that is fair and balanced , " german minister of labor and social affairs franz müntefering wrote in the pre-released text of a tuesday speech to his g8 colleagues .
müntefering is concurrently vice-chancellor in the cabinet of angela merkel , who currently controls the rotating eu presidency . whose responsibility is it , anyway ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will shoulder the social and environmental burden ?
the idea has rattled the nerves of business representatives , who fear that the government wants to rid itself of its own social responsibilities .
renate hornung-draus of the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- told the g8 that social commitments in the business sector " should n't be seen as a substitute for government action . " meanwhile , the german confederation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- has demanded regulations that would set out basic requirements for corporate social responsibility .
dgb chairman michael sommer told the german news service dpa that " the spoils of globalization should benefit all , not just a few " people , a statement that hornung-draus has echoed . müntefering defended csr , arguing that a socially responsible process of globalization would bring about widespread prosperity , which in turn would elicit a more accepting attitude from globalization 's skeptics . " we have to share this insight with the world : social action is a strong economic force . " but the anti-globalization network attac has accused müntefering of glossing over reality .
" in fact , the german government is enacting cutbacks to social standards - at home and worldwide , " the activists wrote in a press release .

" on the one hand , they -lrb- western corporations -rrb- want to take advantage of the cost benefits china has to offer , which result from its low wage , social and environmental standards . "
but , the author writes , companies active in china are under constant pressure from markets and the public to " protect the reputation of their brands . " the core question , according to author schoenheit , is this : " do the same principles and criteria apply to europe and china ? " contradicting approaches in europe even inside the european union , there seems to be no consensus over how to encourage more social action from business leaders .
a study commissioned by the bertelsmann foundation , germany 's largest private non-profit organization , examines the approaches of various eu-countries to csr , and finds that there is no unified concept . sweden , the united kingdom and the netherlands are at the forefront of corporate responsibility , the study finds .
in denmark , larger companies are required to present an annual environmental report to the government .
and in france , the government has put similar regulations in place , although many businesses have lobbied to remove some of them . germany , on the other hand , is behind the times , the study says .
" no strategy , no contact persons , no transparency .
the -lrb- german -rrb- federal government has a lot to catch up on . " however , germany also demonstrates that csr may be possible without potentially inhibiting state regulations .

horst v. , formerly a manager and consultant at the electronics giant , was sentenced to 18 months parole .

senior public prosecutor ulrich busch demanded monday that siemens pay a fine of 97.7 million euros -lrb- $ 132.5 million -rrb- to the state as a penalty for the enel corruption case .
the amount is equal to the company 's gross profit from the delivery of two turbines to enel -lrb- 103.8 million euros -rrb- , minus a 6.12 million euro fine that had already been assessed during an earlier trial in milan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 07.05.2007 devoted fans adore superstar 's abuse and indifference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it does n't seem to matter what this man does , his fans still think he 's a superstar the latest winner of a televised german talent contest can apparently do no wrong according to his fans .
mark medlock likes to chuck swear words at his devotees and ignore their attention - and they just crave more . it seems that adoration has no bounds when it comes to the idolization of rock stars and singers .
the more violent and abusive the star , the more the fans seem to love them .
when jim morrison abused an audience of thousands at a concert in miami in 1969 by shouting , " you 're all a bunch of f * * * ing slaves ! " the cheers for the outrageous doors frontman got even louder .
less than a decade later , young punks in london would literally fight each other to get to the front of a sex pistols gig on the off chance of getting spat on by johnny rotten or having sid vicious break his bass over their heads .
music genres such as rock and punk are fuelled by the chemistry between the simmering malevolence on stage and the unleashed mayhem in the crowd .
the energy created by confrontational artists and willing victims is the stuff of legend .
it is this type of sado-masochistic , love-hate relationship which separates the edgy from the cozy - which is why you 'll never get bottles of urine thrown on stage at a take that concert .
following in the footsteps of legends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luckily medlock has n't copied jim morrison 's " snake " act but that could all change if housewives ' favorite and teeny lust object mark " bobbelsche " medlock gets his way .
the latest winner of german talent show deutschland sucht den superstar -lrb- dsds -rrb- is already beginning to blur the boundaries between insipid pop poser and raging rock behemoth .
and in the time-honored fashion , his fans are lapping up the abuse .
the r 'n'b singer from frankfurt owes his new-found fame to the thousands of dreamy and lusty teenage fans who voted by phone to award him the title of germany 's latest superstar and yet , despite the fact that each vote cost his fans 50 cents per call , he doesn ’ t appear to be too humble .
mark 's proclamation to his fans that " i love you all so f * * * ing much " could quite easily be taken as an over-enthusiastic cry of thanks but referring to his audience as " a bunch of dirty bastards " requires deeper analysis to find the remotest appreciation of their efforts .
" since i saw mark for the first time , i can no longer imagine my life without him , " wrote one fan on the superstar 's internet fan site .
" i cry if i see him on the tv and am moved profoundly if i hear him talking . "
even when he ’ s spilling lines of profanities at the devoted ?
it seems so .
abusive star " just being himself " christian maier , the operator of the fan site , laughs off mark 's earthy attitude to his fans .
" he ’ s just a witty guy , " maier told german news magazine spiegel .
" when he calls us dirty bastards , it does n't mean anything .
it 's just how he is . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pistols were witty boys too ... who liked to spit on fans maier runs the fan site from austria and he led the wave of thousands of mark devotees calling in expensive votes from outside germany .
" we were charged a lot more than those calling from germany , " he said .
" but we kept calling .
hundreds and hundreds called all through the night to help mark win . "
any words of thanks yet ?
it seems that the commitment of austrian fans has been relayed to the new superstar but he has yet to acknowledge them or even throw an insult in their direction .
the fan site almost collapsed under the amount of supporters logging on during and after the final but neither an acknowledgement nor accusation of dubious parentage has come from the bobbelsche 's finely pursed lips .
" above all , we long to hear from mark and we hope that -lrb- dsds judge -rrb- dieter bohlen can help him to become a star , " said maier , almost wistfully .
as mark himself would probably say : do n't hold your breath , dirtbag . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany swings around eurovision in surprising national final germany has never fully recovered from its 2005 eurovision debacle when it came last .

but employers are nervous . the group of eight labor ministers , representing the world 's leading industrialized nations plus russia , convened on monday for a two-day meeting in dresden , germany . there , a new buzzword has emerged : " corporate social responsibility " - or csr for short . the idea behind this somewhat ambiguous , perhaps even euphemistic term is that big businesses - especially those operating on a global scale - should " integrate social and environmental issues into their business activities , " in the official wording of the european union commission . " economy , ecology and social action have to be carried out in a way that is fair and balanced , " german minister of labor and social affairs franz müntefering wrote in the pre-released text of a tuesday speech to his g8 colleagues .
müntefering is concurrently vice-chancellor in the cabinet of angela merkel , who currently controls the rotating eu presidency . whose responsibility is it , anyway ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will shoulder the social and environmental burden ?
the idea has rattled the nerves of business representatives , who fear that the government wants to rid itself of its own social responsibilities .
renate hornung-draus of the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- told the g8 that social commitments in the business sector " should n't be seen as a substitute for government action . " meanwhile , the german confederation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- has demanded regulations that would set out basic requirements for corporate social responsibility .
dgb chairman michael sommer told the german news service dpa that " the spoils of globalization should benefit all , not just a few " people , a statement that hornung-draus has echoed . müntefering defended csr , arguing that a socially responsible process of globalization would bring about widespread prosperity , which in turn would elicit a more accepting attitude from globalization 's skeptics . " we have to share this insight with the world : social action is a strong economic force . " but the anti-globalization network attac has accused müntefering of glossing over reality .
" in fact , the german government is enacting cutbacks to social standards - at home and worldwide , " the activists wrote in a press release .
any way you look at it - in the g8 , the eu or at the federal level - the government has been " instrumental to advancing the neoliberal globalization in the interest of corporate groups , " attac claims . different standards in china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shoe factory in china , where labor practices can be very different than in the west minimum social standards are particularly problematic for enterprises with production sites in developing countries .
there , western companies face enormous problems , including extreme poverty , inadequate medical care , corruption , child labor , sub-standard education and the absence of worker 's rights or meaningful environmental safeguards , to name a few . ingo schoenheit , managing director of the university of hanover 's institute for market / environment / society , exemplifies the difficulty of conducting business in developing countries in a recent book on corporate social responsibility in china . " on the one hand , they -lrb- western corporations -rrb- want to take advantage of the cost benefits china has to offer , which result from its low wage , social and environmental standards . "
but , the author writes , companies active in china are under constant pressure from markets and the public to " protect the reputation of their brands . " the core question , according to author schoenheit , is this : " do the same principles and criteria apply to europe and china ? " contradicting approaches in europe even inside the european union , there seems to be no consensus over how to encourage more social action from business leaders .
a study commissioned by the bertelsmann foundation , germany 's largest private non-profit organization , examines the approaches of various eu-countries to csr , and finds that there is no unified concept . sweden , the united kingdom and the netherlands are at the forefront of corporate responsibility , the study finds .
in denmark , larger companies are required to present an annual environmental report to the government .
and in france , the government has put similar regulations in place , although many businesses have lobbied to remove some of them . germany , on the other hand , is behind the times , the study says .
" no strategy , no contact persons , no transparency .
the -lrb- german -rrb- federal government has a lot to catch up on . " however , germany also demonstrates that csr may be possible without potentially inhibiting state regulations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 07.05.2007 g8 labor ministers call for more social engagement by business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 labor ministers argue that more social responsibility would change the minds of globalization critics g8 labor ministers are debating whether to require big businesses to promote social and environmental programs , with the aim of a fairer globalization .
but employers are nervous . the group of eight labor ministers , representing the world 's leading industrialized nations plus russia , convened on monday for a two-day meeting in dresden , germany . there , a new buzzword has emerged : " corporate social responsibility " - or csr for short . the idea behind this somewhat ambiguous , perhaps even euphemistic term is that big businesses - especially those operating on a global scale - should " integrate social and environmental issues into their business activities , " in the official wording of the european union commission . " economy , ecology and social action have to be carried out in a way that is fair and balanced , " german minister of labor and social affairs franz müntefering wrote in the pre-released text of a tuesday speech to his g8 colleagues .
müntefering is concurrently vice-chancellor in the cabinet of angela merkel , who currently controls the rotating eu presidency . whose responsibility is it , anyway ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will shoulder the social and environmental burden ?
the idea has rattled the nerves of business representatives , who fear that the government wants to rid itself of its own social responsibilities .
renate hornung-draus of the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- told the g8 that social commitments in the business sector " should n't be seen as a substitute for government action . " meanwhile , the german confederation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- has demanded regulations that would set out basic requirements for corporate social responsibility .
dgb chairman michael sommer told the german news service dpa that " the spoils of globalization should benefit all , not just a few " people , a statement that hornung-draus has echoed . müntefering defended csr , arguing that a socially responsible process of globalization would bring about widespread prosperity , which in turn would elicit a more accepting attitude from globalization 's skeptics . " we have to share this insight with the world : social action is a strong economic force . " but the anti-globalization network attac has accused müntefering of glossing over reality .
" in fact , the german government is enacting cutbacks to social standards - at home and worldwide , " the activists wrote in a press release .
any way you look at it - in the g8 , the eu or at the federal level - the government has been " instrumental to advancing the neoliberal globalization in the interest of corporate groups , " attac claims . different standards in china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shoe factory in china , where labor practices can be very different than in the west minimum social standards are particularly problematic for enterprises with production sites in developing countries .

police , protesters battle after sarkozy win opinion : sarkozy 's win means european uncertainty conservative sarkozy is france 's next president elections -pipe- 07.05.2007 merkel congratulates sarkozy , hopes for stronger ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's conservatives are pleased german chancellor angela merkel said she hoped french president-elect nicolas sarkozy would strengthen the french-german axis at the heart of the european union . congratulating her fellow conservative on his victory in the presidential runoff , merkel said she was convinced that under him " the german-french friendship will continue to be the basis to secure lasting peace , democracy and prosperity in europe . "
merkel said she was looking forward to meeting sarkozy in the near future " for a first exhange of views . "
the partnership between france and germany is often described as the " motor " of the eu and berlin is expected to be one of the first foreign visits sarkozy makes .
hopes for reviving eu constitution germany holds the rotating six-month presidency of the eu and merkel is keen to put the european bloc on track towards a revised constitutional treaty before the german presidency finishes at the end of june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the two see to it that the eu constitution is ratified ?
french voters rejected the draft constitution in a referendum in 2005.german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said shortly after sarkozy 's victory on sunday that he hoped berlin and paris would work closely together on " important european projects " under the incoming french president .
" i hope for a close german-french partnership , " steinmeier , a social democrat , said after right-wing sarkozy won sunday 's presidential election to succeed jacques chirac .
" of course i hope the cooperation will lead to progress on important european projects , " he added in a reference to the european union 's moribund draft constitution .
in a speech directly following the announcement that he won the country 's highest electoral office by a comfortable margin , sarkozy addressed france 's international agenda .
' our destiny is linked ' " i want to launch a call to our european partners , with whom our destiny is deeply linked , to tell them that i have been european all my life , that i believe deeply , that i believe sincerely , in european construction , and that tonight france is back in europe .
i beseech our european partners to hear the voices of people who want to be protected . "
another phone call came from european commission president jose manuel barroso , who congratulated sarkozy and said he was hopeful the new leader of france could help end the eu 's institutional woes . " i know nicolas sarkozy very well , and i am aware of his desire for france to take its rightful place on the european stage , " barroso said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso hopes to move the eu a step forward " i have complete confidence in nicolas sarkozy ... to play a driving role in resolving the institutional question and consolidating european politics , " he said . meanwhile , us president george w. bush also sent his wishes to the man of the hour soon after his win was sealed . " the united states and france are historic allies and partners .
president bush looks forward to working with president-elect sarkozy as we continue our strong alliance , " gordon johndroe , spokesman for the white house national security council , told afp . warning on warming following his victory , sarkozy pledged that the united states can count on a friendship with france , which " will always be at their side when they need help . " since a much-publicized us trip in september 2006 , sarkozy has fought against charges that he pandered to bush and the perception that he is too pro-american , a quality seen as unpopular with french voters . ' friendship is accepting difference ' addressing the crowd after his victory on sunday evening , he tried to get some distance form that image . " i want to tell -lrb- the united states -rrb- that france will always be by their side when they will need her .
but i want to tell them as well that friendship is accepting that one 's friends can act differently , and that a great nation like the united states has the duty to not obstruct the fight against global warming but on the contrary to head this struggle .
because what is at stake is the future of all humanity , " sarkozy said in his victory speech . " france will make this struggle its first struggle , " he added . but sarkozy has also made emphatic calls for friendship between the two nations . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : sarkozy 's win means european uncertainty in electing nicolas sarkozy on sunday , the french voted for national reform .

editorialists noted a rightward shift - some with satisfaction , others with suspicion . french editorialists across the board were full of praise for this year 's electoral process in france , which saw unprecedented voter turnout during both rounds of presidential voting and a decisive victory for former interior minister nicolas sarkozy .
but french papers were divided over the outcome of the vote . in the french daily le figaro , nicolas beytout doted on the " brilliant election of nicolas sarkozy . "
the campaign " has been exceptionally active and controversial , with massive participation in the first and second rounds , " and it " will certainly leave a permanent mark on the country 's history , " beytout wrote .
at the same time , he observed that the french right won " a score against the left that has n't been reached since general de gaulle . "
noting that for the first time in three decades , french voters elected a candidate from the outgoing camp -lrb- outgoing president jacques chirac and sarkozy both belong to the conservative ump party -rrb- , the editorialist opined that " gone are the days of systematic alternation , that frenzied back-and-forth that all too often has seen the country do and then undo that which it just created . "
as for socialist candidate ségolène royal , beytout wrote that she lost by a wide margin chiefly because " she was chosen by her own party based more on her personality than on the maturity of her project . "
france is ready for change , and the paper called sarkozy 's campaign " a victory for movement . " meanwhile , the french daily libération was not so excited about sarkozy 's victory .
despite a clear preference for the socialist candidate , laurent joffrin wrote that " france made a clean choice . "
the editorialist said sarkozy " is a legitimate president , " and that the campaign was " dignified , passionate and civil to the highest degree . "
but joffrin was concerned about sarkozy 's stated goal of " reconciling france with the dominant norm of conservative liberalism , " and wondered whether sarkozy is a " thatcher sans petticoat ? "
the editorialist conceded that the " values of competition " demand the modernization of france , but that " the values of solidarity and justice remain " as a programmatic building block for the socialist party .
" the cherry season will return , " joffrin concluded , but " for the time being , it 's pit season .
take courage . " german newspapers were hopeful that sarkozy would bring about badly needed changes in france , but also worried that he might embark on a unilateral crusade if his party wins the upcoming parliamentary elections , as well . the online edition of the popular german magazine der spiegel observed that french voters elected what they perceived as " the candidate who has announced a new beginning , a change , even a ' break ' with hardened traditions " following " the leaden times of twelve years of ' chiraquie . " '
but the editorialist , stefan simons , went on to question the integrity of sarkozy 's campaign promises : " whoops , hold on a minute , and what about the last five years ? " he asked .
as former interior minister , " was n't he -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- - number three in the government - also responsible for the slow decline of the nation ? "
the " perfect feat " of sarkozy 's campaign , according to simons , was that his team was able to " refashion jacques chirac 's long-time minister as a ' newcomer , ' an outsider , even something of an opposition leader . "
simons was concerned over sarkozy 's courting the far-right vote , saying that he " has made the slogans of -lrb- far-right -rrb- front national-leader jean-marie le pen acceptable in mainstream discourse . "
the parliamentary elections in june , so the editorialist , will prove whether sarkozy is really interested in national unity , as he has said , or whether france will be ruled by " sarkozy the terminator . " spanish observers were hopeful that sarkozy 's election would give new impetus to the european union project , which faltered after french -lrb- and dutch -rrb- voters rejected the draft eu-constitution in a referendum . spanish daily el país mirrored the widespread opinion that sarkozy 's victory " reflects a desire for change , and comes at the hands of an authentic revolution in french politics . "
the commentator was suspicious of sarkozy 's propensity for populism , but also noted with satisfaction that he " has not passed through the grandes écoles from whence most of the french elites have come . "
sarkozy 's election also indicates that " french society has moved to the right , " and that " le pen has contaminated all of french politics . "
the editorialist believed that " europe has waited a long time on france , and they can wait a little longer until june , when this country , which is key to europe , recovers much of its intellectual , social and economic vitality " following what the editorial opined will be another victory for the conservative camp at the parliamentary polls .
" sarkozy sympathizes with spain , " the daily paper wrote , and " as minister of the interior , he acted with total support and loyalty . "
that is why , in the view of the spanish editorialist , " spain and -lrb- spanish president josé luis rodríguez -rrb- zapatero have a perfectly viable ally . " finally , italian journalist massimo nava , author of an essay on nicolas sarkozy , evaluated the french election campaign for italian daily corriere della sera .
like most of his european counterparts , nava was of the opinion " the new french revolution has begun . "
he wrote that " sarkozy has disinhibited the right , freeing it from its complexes . "
furthermore , " he has swung the national front voters away from le pen and could become the blair of the european right . "
meanwhile , ségolène royal " has shrunk the far-left to a minimum and freed the left from its archaisms and heavy machinery .

editorialists noted a rightward shift - some with satisfaction , others with suspicion . french editorialists across the board were full of praise for this year 's electoral process in france , which saw unprecedented voter turnout during both rounds of presidential voting and a decisive victory for former interior minister nicolas sarkozy .
but french papers were divided over the outcome of the vote . in the french daily le figaro , nicolas beytout doted on the " brilliant election of nicolas sarkozy . "
the campaign " has been exceptionally active and controversial , with massive participation in the first and second rounds , " and it " will certainly leave a permanent mark on the country 's history , " beytout wrote .
at the same time , he observed that the french right won " a score against the left that has n't been reached since general de gaulle . "
noting that for the first time in three decades , french voters elected a candidate from the outgoing camp -lrb- outgoing president jacques chirac and sarkozy both belong to the conservative ump party -rrb- , the editorialist opined that " gone are the days of systematic alternation , that frenzied back-and-forth that all too often has seen the country do and then undo that which it just created . "
as for socialist candidate ségolène royal , beytout wrote that she lost by a wide margin chiefly because " she was chosen by her own party based more on her personality than on the maturity of her project . "
france is ready for change , and the paper called sarkozy 's campaign " a victory for movement . " meanwhile , the french daily libération was not so excited about sarkozy 's victory .
despite a clear preference for the socialist candidate , laurent joffrin wrote that " france made a clean choice . "
the editorialist said sarkozy " is a legitimate president , " and that the campaign was " dignified , passionate and civil to the highest degree . "
but joffrin was concerned about sarkozy 's stated goal of " reconciling france with the dominant norm of conservative liberalism , " and wondered whether sarkozy is a " thatcher sans petticoat ? "
the editorialist conceded that the " values of competition " demand the modernization of france , but that " the values of solidarity and justice remain " as a programmatic building block for the socialist party .
" the cherry season will return , " joffrin concluded , but " for the time being , it 's pit season .
take courage . " german newspapers were hopeful that sarkozy would bring about badly needed changes in france , but also worried that he might embark on a unilateral crusade if his party wins the upcoming parliamentary elections , as well . the online edition of the popular german magazine der spiegel observed that french voters elected what they perceived as " the candidate who has announced a new beginning , a change , even a ' break ' with hardened traditions " following " the leaden times of twelve years of ' chiraquie . " '
but the editorialist , stefan simons , went on to question the integrity of sarkozy 's campaign promises : " whoops , hold on a minute , and what about the last five years ? " he asked .
as former interior minister , " was n't he -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- - number three in the government - also responsible for the slow decline of the nation ? "
the " perfect feat " of sarkozy 's campaign , according to simons , was that his team was able to " refashion jacques chirac 's long-time minister as a ' newcomer , ' an outsider , even something of an opposition leader . "
simons was concerned over sarkozy 's courting the far-right vote , saying that he " has made the slogans of -lrb- far-right -rrb- front national-leader jean-marie le pen acceptable in mainstream discourse . "
the parliamentary elections in june , so the editorialist , will prove whether sarkozy is really interested in national unity , as he has said , or whether france will be ruled by " sarkozy the terminator . " spanish observers were hopeful that sarkozy 's election would give new impetus to the european union project , which faltered after french -lrb- and dutch -rrb- voters rejected the draft eu-constitution in a referendum . spanish daily el país mirrored the widespread opinion that sarkozy 's victory " reflects a desire for change , and comes at the hands of an authentic revolution in french politics . "
the commentator was suspicious of sarkozy 's propensity for populism , but also noted with satisfaction that he " has not passed through the grandes écoles from whence most of the french elites have come . "
sarkozy 's election also indicates that " french society has moved to the right , " and that " le pen has contaminated all of french politics . "
the editorialist believed that " europe has waited a long time on france , and they can wait a little longer until june , when this country , which is key to europe , recovers much of its intellectual , social and economic vitality " following what the editorial opined will be another victory for the conservative camp at the parliamentary polls .
" sarkozy sympathizes with spain , " the daily paper wrote , and " as minister of the interior , he acted with total support and loyalty . "
that is why , in the view of the spanish editorialist , " spain and -lrb- spanish president josé luis rodríguez -rrb- zapatero have a perfectly viable ally . " finally , italian journalist massimo nava , author of an essay on nicolas sarkozy , evaluated the french election campaign for italian daily corriere della sera .
like most of his european counterparts , nava was of the opinion " the new french revolution has begun . "
he wrote that " sarkozy has disinhibited the right , freeing it from its complexes . "
furthermore , " he has swung the national front voters away from le pen and could become the blair of the european right . "
meanwhile , ségolène royal " has shrunk the far-left to a minimum and freed the left from its archaisms and heavy machinery .

köhler will decide this week over klar 's possible release . after a weekend of unprecedented verbal attacks on the german president by her ministers , chancellor angela merkel called on sunday for an end to the harsh criticism arising from horst köhler ’ s decision to consider whether to grant clemency to a former red army faction guerrilla after 24 years in prison .
köhler announced on friday , shortly after meeting with christian klar - who was convicted in 1982 for his role a series of raf killings - that he would decide on the former terrorist 's bid for freedom in the coming days .
the president 's announcement caused an outcry in merkel ’ s christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with some members calling for köhler to be denied the chance to stand for a second term in 2009 should he approve klar 's release .
merkel calls for respect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called for an end to the criticism of köhler this prompted the chancellor to release a statement calling for restraint as the criticism reached a crescendo over the weekend .
" respect for the office and person of the president must always be protected , " merkel said .
" i ask that we all , regardless of how the president decides in the end , respect the decision of horst köhler .
" -lrb- there is -rrb- no doubt that the president will handle this difficult and controversial issue after careful examination in a very conscientious way , " she added .
merkel 's words were echoed by her interior minister , wolfgang schäuble , who added : " the president and the president alone has the right to make these decisions .
he has the highest responsibility and special obligation to decide and everyone must respect that . "
the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- leader guido westerwelle also joined in with the condemnation of the criticism .
" while all opinion is allowed and in fact encouraged in this debate , the level of this criticism aimed at the federal president is absolutely unacceptable . "
he added that he expected more respect from the members of the csu who had led the attacks on köhler and by doing so had put the president and the constitution under pressure .
however , westerwelle also took the opportunity to restate his own views on klar 's potential release by saying that he should not be pardoned until he showed remorse for his actions . green party co-chairperson claudia roth also condemned the criticism and voiced her support for a pardon .
" in our constitutional state , we do not operate on revenge but reintegration , " roth said .
" the csu has no respect for horst köhler the person , and it ignores his presidential position . "
she added that the criticism over köhler ’ s meeting with klar was unfounded .
" it is important and correct that -lrb- köhler -rrb- meets with klar and holds a personal conversation with him to get his own picture of the man . "
csu hardliners talk of withdrawing support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein said klar should remian behind bars the attacks against köhler were led by senior csu politicians , including günther beckstein , the bavarian state interior minister .
beckstein said that a criminal like klar belonged behind bars and added : " it is my view of justice that a criminal who does not confess is undeserving of clemency . "
csu member of parliament andreas scheuer went further , saying , " if the federal president uses his power to pardon klar then i will have to seriously consider whether the president will have my future support . "
in the event of a presidential pardon , scheuer urged the german government not to countersign .
" this would send out a clear message that the german government does not agree with the president ’ s decision , " he said .
the move to release klar is also strongly opposed by most of the families of his victims .
klar hopes for early release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar is eligible for release in 2009 klar , 54 , has served more than 24 years of a life term for his role in several murders committed at the end of the 1970s with the urban guerrilla group .
he was jailed for a series of killings , including the shooting of federal prosecutor siegfried buback , during the raf 's violent campaign against what it called the oppressive capitalist west german state and elite in the 1970s and early 1980s .
klar is eligible for early release in 2009 but has appealed for clemency to get out sooner as it is rare for criminals to spend more than 20 years in prison in germany .

köhler will decide this week over klar 's possible release . after a weekend of unprecedented verbal attacks on the german president by her ministers , chancellor angela merkel called on sunday for an end to the harsh criticism arising from horst köhler ’ s decision to consider whether to grant clemency to a former red army faction guerrilla after 24 years in prison .
köhler announced on friday , shortly after meeting with christian klar - who was convicted in 1982 for his role a series of raf killings - that he would decide on the former terrorist 's bid for freedom in the coming days .
the president 's announcement caused an outcry in merkel ’ s christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with some members calling for köhler to be denied the chance to stand for a second term in 2009 should he approve klar 's release .
merkel calls for respect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called for an end to the criticism of köhler this prompted the chancellor to release a statement calling for restraint as the criticism reached a crescendo over the weekend .
" respect for the office and person of the president must always be protected , " merkel said .
" i ask that we all , regardless of how the president decides in the end , respect the decision of horst köhler .
" -lrb- there is -rrb- no doubt that the president will handle this difficult and controversial issue after careful examination in a very conscientious way , " she added .
merkel 's words were echoed by her interior minister , wolfgang schäuble , who added : " the president and the president alone has the right to make these decisions .
he has the highest responsibility and special obligation to decide and everyone must respect that . "
the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- leader guido westerwelle also joined in with the condemnation of the criticism .
" while all opinion is allowed and in fact encouraged in this debate , the level of this criticism aimed at the federal president is absolutely unacceptable . "
he added that he expected more respect from the members of the csu who had led the attacks on köhler and by doing so had put the president and the constitution under pressure .
however , westerwelle also took the opportunity to restate his own views on klar 's potential release by saying that he should not be pardoned until he showed remorse for his actions . green party co-chairperson claudia roth also condemned the criticism and voiced her support for a pardon .
" in our constitutional state , we do not operate on revenge but reintegration , " roth said .
" the csu has no respect for horst köhler the person , and it ignores his presidential position . "
she added that the criticism over köhler ’ s meeting with klar was unfounded .
" it is important and correct that -lrb- köhler -rrb- meets with klar and holds a personal conversation with him to get his own picture of the man . "
csu hardliners talk of withdrawing support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein said klar should remian behind bars the attacks against köhler were led by senior csu politicians , including günther beckstein , the bavarian state interior minister .
beckstein said that a criminal like klar belonged behind bars and added : " it is my view of justice that a criminal who does not confess is undeserving of clemency . "
csu member of parliament andreas scheuer went further , saying , " if the federal president uses his power to pardon klar then i will have to seriously consider whether the president will have my future support . "
in the event of a presidential pardon , scheuer urged the german government not to countersign .
" this would send out a clear message that the german government does not agree with the president ’ s decision , " he said .
the move to release klar is also strongly opposed by most of the families of his victims .
klar hopes for early release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar is eligible for release in 2009 klar , 54 , has served more than 24 years of a life term for his role in several murders committed at the end of the 1970s with the urban guerrilla group .
he was jailed for a series of killings , including the shooting of federal prosecutor siegfried buback , during the raf 's violent campaign against what it called the oppressive capitalist west german state and elite in the 1970s and early 1980s .
klar is eligible for early release in 2009 but has appealed for clemency to get out sooner as it is rare for criminals to spend more than 20 years in prison in germany .
some germans feel that klar has paid his debt to society . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president to decide on pardon for raf terrorist klar president köhler has met with christian klar , a member of the raf terrorist group that plunged the country into deep uncertainty in the 1970s , in connection with klar 's application for clemency , köhler 's office said .

mark medlock likes to chuck swear words at his devotees and ignore their attention - and they just crave more . it seems that adoration has no bounds when it comes to the idolization of rock stars and singers .
the more violent and abusive the star , the more the fans seem to love them .
when jim morrison abused an audience of thousands at a concert in miami in 1969 by shouting , " you 're all a bunch of f * * * ing slaves ! " the cheers for the outrageous doors frontman got even louder .
less than a decade later , young punks in london would literally fight each other to get to the front of a sex pistols gig on the off chance of getting spat on by johnny rotten or having sid vicious break his bass over their heads .
music genres such as rock and punk are fuelled by the chemistry between the simmering malevolence on stage and the unleashed mayhem in the crowd .
the energy created by confrontational artists and willing victims is the stuff of legend .
it is this type of sado-masochistic , love-hate relationship which separates the edgy from the cozy - which is why you 'll never get bottles of urine thrown on stage at a take that concert .
following in the footsteps of legends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luckily medlock has n't copied jim morrison 's " snake " act but that could all change if housewives ' favorite and teeny lust object mark " bobbelsche " medlock gets his way .
the latest winner of german talent show deutschland sucht den superstar -lrb- dsds -rrb- is already beginning to blur the boundaries between insipid pop poser and raging rock behemoth .
and in the time-honored fashion , his fans are lapping up the abuse .
the r 'n'b singer from frankfurt owes his new-found fame to the thousands of dreamy and lusty teenage fans who voted by phone to award him the title of germany 's latest superstar and yet , despite the fact that each vote cost his fans 50 cents per call , he doesn ’ t appear to be too humble .
mark 's proclamation to his fans that " i love you all so f * * * ing much " could quite easily be taken as an over-enthusiastic cry of thanks but referring to his audience as " a bunch of dirty bastards " requires deeper analysis to find the remotest appreciation of their efforts .
" since i saw mark for the first time , i can no longer imagine my life without him , " wrote one fan on the superstar 's internet fan site .
" i cry if i see him on the tv and am moved profoundly if i hear him talking . "
even when he ’ s spilling lines of profanities at the devoted ?
it seems so .
abusive star " just being himself " christian maier , the operator of the fan site , laughs off mark 's earthy attitude to his fans .
" he ’ s just a witty guy , " maier told german news magazine spiegel .
" when he calls us dirty bastards , it does n't mean anything .
it 's just how he is . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pistols were witty boys too ... who liked to spit on fans maier runs the fan site from austria and he led the wave of thousands of mark devotees calling in expensive votes from outside germany .
" we were charged a lot more than those calling from germany , " he said .
" but we kept calling .
hundreds and hundreds called all through the night to help mark win . "
any words of thanks yet ?
it seems that the commitment of austrian fans has been relayed to the new superstar but he has yet to acknowledge them or even throw an insult in their direction .
the fan site almost collapsed under the amount of supporters logging on during and after the final but neither an acknowledgement nor accusation of dubious parentage has come from the bobbelsche 's finely pursed lips .
" above all , we long to hear from mark and we hope that -lrb- dsds judge -rrb- dieter bohlen can help him to become a star , " said maier , almost wistfully .

mark medlock likes to chuck swear words at his devotees and ignore their attention - and they just crave more . it seems that adoration has no bounds when it comes to the idolization of rock stars and singers .
the more violent and abusive the star , the more the fans seem to love them .
when jim morrison abused an audience of thousands at a concert in miami in 1969 by shouting , " you 're all a bunch of f * * * ing slaves ! " the cheers for the outrageous doors frontman got even louder .
less than a decade later , young punks in london would literally fight each other to get to the front of a sex pistols gig on the off chance of getting spat on by johnny rotten or having sid vicious break his bass over their heads .
music genres such as rock and punk are fuelled by the chemistry between the simmering malevolence on stage and the unleashed mayhem in the crowd .
the energy created by confrontational artists and willing victims is the stuff of legend .
it is this type of sado-masochistic , love-hate relationship which separates the edgy from the cozy - which is why you 'll never get bottles of urine thrown on stage at a take that concert .
following in the footsteps of legends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luckily medlock has n't copied jim morrison 's " snake " act but that could all change if housewives ' favorite and teeny lust object mark " bobbelsche " medlock gets his way .

senior public prosecutor ulrich busch demanded monday that siemens pay a fine of 97.7 million euros -lrb- $ 132.5 million -rrb- to the state as a penalty for the enel corruption case .

and when he did , the tone was one of what the eu could do for france , and not vice versa . sarkozy has a reputation of being power-hungry and reluctant to listen to advice , and in the past , he has repeatedly played the nationalist trump card .
for instance , sarkozy did n't exactly endear himself to germans by bringing up world war ii and the holocaust on a number of occasions during the campaign . sarkozy was trying to play on french national pride .
at a campaign rally in marseille , he gleefully pointed out that not all french people supported the nazi-installed occupation government during world war ii .
" there were also the heroes of a free france , " sarkozy crowed , " and the résistance . " to underscore that message , he staged his last rally at a symbolic site of the french resistance , the plateau des glières , promising , if elected , to make an annual pilgrimage there .

"
merkel said she was looking forward to meeting sarkozy in the near future " for a first exhange of views . "
the partnership between france and germany is often described as the " motor " of the eu and berlin is expected to be one of the first foreign visits sarkozy makes .
hopes for reviving eu constitution germany holds the rotating six-month presidency of the eu and merkel is keen to put the european bloc on track towards a revised constitutional treaty before the german presidency finishes at the end of june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the two see to it that the eu constitution is ratified ?
french voters rejected the draft constitution in a referendum in 2005.german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said shortly after sarkozy 's victory on sunday that he hoped berlin and paris would work closely together on " important european projects " under the incoming french president .
" i hope for a close german-french partnership , " steinmeier , a social democrat , said after right-wing sarkozy won sunday 's presidential election to succeed jacques chirac .
" of course i hope the cooperation will lead to progress on important european projects , " he added in a reference to the european union 's moribund draft constitution .
in a speech directly following the announcement that he won the country 's highest electoral office by a comfortable margin , sarkozy addressed france 's international agenda .
' our destiny is linked ' " i want to launch a call to our european partners , with whom our destiny is deeply linked , to tell them that i have been european all my life , that i believe deeply , that i believe sincerely , in european construction , and that tonight france is back in europe .
i beseech our european partners to hear the voices of people who want to be protected . "
another phone call came from european commission president jose manuel barroso , who congratulated sarkozy and said he was hopeful the new leader of france could help end the eu 's institutional woes . " i know nicolas sarkozy very well , and i am aware of his desire for france to take its rightful place on the european stage , " barroso said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso hopes to move the eu a step forward " i have complete confidence in nicolas sarkozy ... to play a driving role in resolving the institutional question and consolidating european politics , " he said . meanwhile , us president george w. bush also sent his wishes to the man of the hour soon after his win was sealed . " the united states and france are historic allies and partners .
president bush looks forward to working with president-elect sarkozy as we continue our strong alliance , " gordon johndroe , spokesman for the white house national security council , told afp . warning on warming following his victory , sarkozy pledged that the united states can count on a friendship with france , which " will always be at their side when they need help . " since a much-publicized us trip in september 2006 , sarkozy has fought against charges that he pandered to bush and the perception that he is too pro-american , a quality seen as unpopular with french voters . ' friendship is accepting difference ' addressing the crowd after his victory on sunday evening , he tried to get some distance form that image . " i want to tell -lrb- the united states -rrb- that france will always be by their side when they will need her .
but i want to tell them as well that friendship is accepting that one 's friends can act differently , and that a great nation like the united states has the duty to not obstruct the fight against global warming but on the contrary to head this struggle .
because what is at stake is the future of all humanity , " sarkozy said in his victory speech .

but employers are nervous . the group of eight labor ministers , representing the world 's leading industrialized nations plus russia , convened on monday for a two-day meeting in dresden , germany . there , a new buzzword has emerged : " corporate social responsibility " - or csr for short . the idea behind this somewhat ambiguous , perhaps even euphemistic term is that big businesses - especially those operating on a global scale - should " integrate social and environmental issues into their business activities , " in the official wording of the european union commission . " economy , ecology and social action have to be carried out in a way that is fair and balanced , " german minister of labor and social affairs franz müntefering wrote in the pre-released text of a tuesday speech to his g8 colleagues .

there , western companies face enormous problems , including extreme poverty , inadequate medical care , corruption , child labor , sub-standard education and the absence of worker 's rights or meaningful environmental safeguards , to name a few . ingo schoenheit , managing director of the university of hanover 's institute for market / environment / society , exemplifies the difficulty of conducting business in developing countries in a recent book on corporate social responsibility in china . " on the one hand , they -lrb- western corporations -rrb- want to take advantage of the cost benefits china has to offer , which result from its low wage , social and environmental standards . "
but , the author writes , companies active in china are under constant pressure from markets and the public to " protect the reputation of their brands . " the core question , according to author schoenheit , is this : " do the same principles and criteria apply to europe and china ? " contradicting approaches in europe even inside the european union , there seems to be no consensus over how to encourage more social action from business leaders .
a study commissioned by the bertelsmann foundation , germany 's largest private non-profit organization , examines the approaches of various eu-countries to csr , and finds that there is no unified concept . sweden , the united kingdom and the netherlands are at the forefront of corporate responsibility , the study finds .
in denmark , larger companies are required to present an annual environmental report to the government .
and in france , the government has put similar regulations in place , although many businesses have lobbied to remove some of them . germany , on the other hand , is behind the times , the study says .
" no strategy , no contact persons , no transparency .
the -lrb- german -rrb- federal government has a lot to catch up on . " however , germany also demonstrates that csr may be possible without potentially inhibiting state regulations .

hoffenheim on saturday clinched promotion from the regional third division to complete a further chapter in the success story of germany 's " richest village team , " as the club has been dubbed .
as a sort of chelsea of the german lower divisions , hoffenheim have big money behind them , and a patron like the wealthy london club 's roman abramovich with ambitions to match the finance .
sap chief invests in local club bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hopp used to score goals for hoffenheim dietmar hopp , 67 , one of the co-founders of the software giant sap , is one of german 's richest men .
he also scored quite a few goals in his youth in the blue and white of his local club until he left the village in southern germany in his early 20s .
now that promotion to the second division has been achieved , the next stage in an ambitious plan can be tackled : to get the team into the top-flight bundesliga .
" we want to be a factor in the second division , " said hopp on saturday .
" the aim is getting into the bundesliga in three to five years . "
new stadium on the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no word if hoffenheim 's next stadium will also bear hopp 's name the dream of bayern munich , schalke 04 or werder bremen visiting hoffenheim is not pie in the sky for hopp , who is building a new 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 54-million -rrb- stadium with a capacity of 30,000 spectators to be ready by 2009 .
the current dietmar hopp stadium - which only dates back to 1999 - is in the meantime being extended to take 6,350 spectators .
if necessary , the team will also be able to play home games at karlsruhe 's wildparkstadion .
hopp , who is a golfing buddy of german playing great franz beckenbauer , has gone about the reformation of the club in a thoroughly professional manner .
only the best for hoffenheim former bayern player hansi flick - now co-trainer of the german national team - coached the side to promotion to the regional league in 2001 , and this season hopp has ralf rangnick , former coach of hanover , stuttgart and schalke , in charge on a five-year contract .
and rangnick has very clear goals for his team .
" that was the first step , " rangnick said .
" the second is the new stadium .
the third is promotion into the bundesliga . "
there is also plenty of other expertise at the club including the german national team psychologist hans-dieter hermann and bernhard peters , the man who led the german hockey team to the world title last september .
peters , who was wanted last year by former germany coach jürgen klinsmann as technical director for the national team , now has just that role for hoffenheim , with responsibility for sport and youth development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf rangnick held the clipboard at stuttgart , hanover and schalke " as far as youth development goes hoffenheim is ahead of many a bundesliga club , " praised klinsmann , who has close contacts with hopp .
targets , performance , return hopp sets great store in developing talent to ensure that the hoffenheim project is a lasting one .
he has invested millions in training centers , and all the club 's teams are doing well in their respective leagues .
" we want to realize a project that is unique in germany , " hopp said , falling back on the manager-speak that rules his day job .
" in the long-term we want to develop our own talent . "
the rise to the top has not been without its critics , and there are clubs who are struggling financially who may be justified in feeling envious of hoffenheim 's possibilities .
recently fc ingolstadt coach juergen press , in a spat with rangnick , said that " every verbandsliga -lrb- fifth division -rrb- coach would achieve promotion with this team of professionals . "
however rangnick believes life will be much easier for the club now that it has reached the second division .
" no longer will we be accused of being the millionaires of the regional league , " he said .
" in the second division we can take on the role of being the sympathetic village team .

hoffenheim on saturday clinched promotion from the regional third division to complete a further chapter in the success story of germany 's " richest village team , " as the club has been dubbed .
as a sort of chelsea of the german lower divisions , hoffenheim have big money behind them , and a patron like the wealthy london club 's roman abramovich with ambitions to match the finance .
sap chief invests in local club bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hopp used to score goals for hoffenheim dietmar hopp , 67 , one of the co-founders of the software giant sap , is one of german 's richest men .
he also scored quite a few goals in his youth in the blue and white of his local club until he left the village in southern germany in his early 20s .
now that promotion to the second division has been achieved , the next stage in an ambitious plan can be tackled : to get the team into the top-flight bundesliga .
" we want to be a factor in the second division , " said hopp on saturday .
" the aim is getting into the bundesliga in three to five years . "
new stadium on the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no word if hoffenheim 's next stadium will also bear hopp 's name the dream of bayern munich , schalke 04 or werder bremen visiting hoffenheim is not pie in the sky for hopp , who is building a new 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 54-million -rrb- stadium with a capacity of 30,000 spectators to be ready by 2009 .
the current dietmar hopp stadium - which only dates back to 1999 - is in the meantime being extended to take 6,350 spectators .
if necessary , the team will also be able to play home games at karlsruhe 's wildparkstadion .
hopp , who is a golfing buddy of german playing great franz beckenbauer , has gone about the reformation of the club in a thoroughly professional manner .
only the best for hoffenheim former bayern player hansi flick - now co-trainer of the german national team - coached the side to promotion to the regional league in 2001 , and this season hopp has ralf rangnick , former coach of hanover , stuttgart and schalke , in charge on a five-year contract .
and rangnick has very clear goals for his team .
" that was the first step , " rangnick said .
" the second is the new stadium .
the third is promotion into the bundesliga . "
there is also plenty of other expertise at the club including the german national team psychologist hans-dieter hermann and bernhard peters , the man who led the german hockey team to the world title last september .
peters , who was wanted last year by former germany coach jürgen klinsmann as technical director for the national team , now has just that role for hoffenheim , with responsibility for sport and youth development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf rangnick held the clipboard at stuttgart , hanover and schalke " as far as youth development goes hoffenheim is ahead of many a bundesliga club , " praised klinsmann , who has close contacts with hopp .
targets , performance , return hopp sets great store in developing talent to ensure that the hoffenheim project is a lasting one .
he has invested millions in training centers , and all the club 's teams are doing well in their respective leagues .
" we want to realize a project that is unique in germany , " hopp said , falling back on the manager-speak that rules his day job .
" in the long-term we want to develop our own talent . "
the rise to the top has not been without its critics , and there are clubs who are struggling financially who may be justified in feeling envious of hoffenheim 's possibilities .
recently fc ingolstadt coach juergen press , in a spat with rangnick , said that " every verbandsliga -lrb- fifth division -rrb- coach would achieve promotion with this team of professionals . "
however rangnick believes life will be much easier for the club now that it has reached the second division .
" no longer will we be accused of being the millionaires of the regional league , " he said .
" in the second division we can take on the role of being the sympathetic village team .

köhler will decide this week over klar 's possible release . after a weekend of unprecedented verbal attacks on the german president by her ministers , chancellor angela merkel called on sunday for an end to the harsh criticism arising from horst köhler ’ s decision to consider whether to grant clemency to a former red army faction guerrilla after 24 years in prison .
köhler announced on friday , shortly after meeting with christian klar - who was convicted in 1982 for his role a series of raf killings - that he would decide on the former terrorist 's bid for freedom in the coming days .
the president 's announcement caused an outcry in merkel ’ s christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with some members calling for köhler to be denied the chance to stand for a second term in 2009 should he approve klar 's release .
merkel calls for respect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called for an end to the criticism of köhler this prompted the chancellor to release a statement calling for restraint as the criticism reached a crescendo over the weekend .
" respect for the office and person of the president must always be protected , " merkel said .
" i ask that we all , regardless of how the president decides in the end , respect the decision of horst köhler .
" -lrb- there is -rrb- no doubt that the president will handle this difficult and controversial issue after careful examination in a very conscientious way , " she added .
merkel 's words were echoed by her interior minister , wolfgang schäuble , who added : " the president and the president alone has the right to make these decisions .
he has the highest responsibility and special obligation to decide and everyone must respect that . "
the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- leader guido westerwelle also joined in with the condemnation of the criticism .
" while all opinion is allowed and in fact encouraged in this debate , the level of this criticism aimed at the federal president is absolutely unacceptable . "
he added that he expected more respect from the members of the csu who had led the attacks on köhler and by doing so had put the president and the constitution under pressure .
however , westerwelle also took the opportunity to restate his own views on klar 's potential release by saying that he should not be pardoned until he showed remorse for his actions . green party co-chairperson claudia roth also condemned the criticism and voiced her support for a pardon .
" in our constitutional state , we do not operate on revenge but reintegration , " roth said .
" the csu has no respect for horst köhler the person , and it ignores his presidential position . "
she added that the criticism over köhler ’ s meeting with klar was unfounded .
" it is important and correct that -lrb- köhler -rrb- meets with klar and holds a personal conversation with him to get his own picture of the man . "
csu hardliners talk of withdrawing support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein said klar should remian behind bars the attacks against köhler were led by senior csu politicians , including günther beckstein , the bavarian state interior minister .
beckstein said that a criminal like klar belonged behind bars and added : " it is my view of justice that a criminal who does not confess is undeserving of clemency . "
csu member of parliament andreas scheuer went further , saying , " if the federal president uses his power to pardon klar then i will have to seriously consider whether the president will have my future support . "
in the event of a presidential pardon , scheuer urged the german government not to countersign .
" this would send out a clear message that the german government does not agree with the president ’ s decision , " he said .
the move to release klar is also strongly opposed by most of the families of his victims .
klar hopes for early release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar is eligible for release in 2009 klar , 54 , has served more than 24 years of a life term for his role in several murders committed at the end of the 1970s with the urban guerrilla group .
he was jailed for a series of killings , including the shooting of federal prosecutor siegfried buback , during the raf 's violent campaign against what it called the oppressive capitalist west german state and elite in the 1970s and early 1980s .
klar is eligible for early release in 2009 but has appealed for clemency to get out sooner as it is rare for criminals to spend more than 20 years in prison in germany .
some germans feel that klar has paid his debt to society . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president to decide on pardon for raf terrorist klar president köhler has met with christian klar , a member of the raf terrorist group that plunged the country into deep uncertainty in the 1970s , in connection with klar 's application for clemency , köhler 's office said .

köhler will decide this week over klar 's possible release . after a weekend of unprecedented verbal attacks on the german president by her ministers , chancellor angela merkel called on sunday for an end to the harsh criticism arising from horst köhler ’ s decision to consider whether to grant clemency to a former red army faction guerrilla after 24 years in prison .
köhler announced on friday , shortly after meeting with christian klar - who was convicted in 1982 for his role a series of raf killings - that he would decide on the former terrorist 's bid for freedom in the coming days .
the president 's announcement caused an outcry in merkel ’ s christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with some members calling for köhler to be denied the chance to stand for a second term in 2009 should he approve klar 's release .
merkel calls for respect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called for an end to the criticism of köhler this prompted the chancellor to release a statement calling for restraint as the criticism reached a crescendo over the weekend .
" respect for the office and person of the president must always be protected , " merkel said .
" i ask that we all , regardless of how the president decides in the end , respect the decision of horst köhler .
" -lrb- there is -rrb- no doubt that the president will handle this difficult and controversial issue after careful examination in a very conscientious way , " she added .
merkel 's words were echoed by her interior minister , wolfgang schäuble , who added : " the president and the president alone has the right to make these decisions .
he has the highest responsibility and special obligation to decide and everyone must respect that . "
the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- leader guido westerwelle also joined in with the condemnation of the criticism .
" while all opinion is allowed and in fact encouraged in this debate , the level of this criticism aimed at the federal president is absolutely unacceptable . "
he added that he expected more respect from the members of the csu who had led the attacks on köhler and by doing so had put the president and the constitution under pressure .
however , westerwelle also took the opportunity to restate his own views on klar 's potential release by saying that he should not be pardoned until he showed remorse for his actions . green party co-chairperson claudia roth also condemned the criticism and voiced her support for a pardon .
" in our constitutional state , we do not operate on revenge but reintegration , " roth said .
" the csu has no respect for horst köhler the person , and it ignores his presidential position . "
she added that the criticism over köhler ’ s meeting with klar was unfounded .
" it is important and correct that -lrb- köhler -rrb- meets with klar and holds a personal conversation with him to get his own picture of the man . "
csu hardliners talk of withdrawing support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein said klar should remian behind bars the attacks against köhler were led by senior csu politicians , including günther beckstein , the bavarian state interior minister .
beckstein said that a criminal like klar belonged behind bars and added : " it is my view of justice that a criminal who does not confess is undeserving of clemency . "
csu member of parliament andreas scheuer went further , saying , " if the federal president uses his power to pardon klar then i will have to seriously consider whether the president will have my future support . "
in the event of a presidential pardon , scheuer urged the german government not to countersign .
" this would send out a clear message that the german government does not agree with the president ’ s decision , " he said .
the move to release klar is also strongly opposed by most of the families of his victims .
klar hopes for early release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar is eligible for release in 2009 klar , 54 , has served more than 24 years of a life term for his role in several murders committed at the end of the 1970s with the urban guerrilla group .
he was jailed for a series of killings , including the shooting of federal prosecutor siegfried buback , during the raf 's violent campaign against what it called the oppressive capitalist west german state and elite in the 1970s and early 1980s .
klar is eligible for early release in 2009 but has appealed for clemency to get out sooner as it is rare for criminals to spend more than 20 years in prison in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : france 's next president : nicolas sarkozy opinion : sarkozy 's win means european uncertainty merkel congratulates sarkozy , hopes for stronger ties police , protesters battle after sarkozy win conservative sarkozy is france 's next president press review -pipe- 07.05.2007 european press review : the right revolution in france ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the revolution has begun : french president-elect nicolas sarkozy european newspapers hailed nicolas sarkozy 's victory at the polls as a milestone in the history of the 5th french republic .
editorialists noted a rightward shift - some with satisfaction , others with suspicion . french editorialists across the board were full of praise for this year 's electoral process in france , which saw unprecedented voter turnout during both rounds of presidential voting and a decisive victory for former interior minister nicolas sarkozy .
but french papers were divided over the outcome of the vote . in the french daily le figaro , nicolas beytout doted on the " brilliant election of nicolas sarkozy . "
the campaign " has been exceptionally active and controversial , with massive participation in the first and second rounds , " and it " will certainly leave a permanent mark on the country 's history , " beytout wrote .
at the same time , he observed that the french right won " a score against the left that has n't been reached since general de gaulle . "
noting that for the first time in three decades , french voters elected a candidate from the outgoing camp -lrb- outgoing president jacques chirac and sarkozy both belong to the conservative ump party -rrb- , the editorialist opined that " gone are the days of systematic alternation , that frenzied back-and-forth that all too often has seen the country do and then undo that which it just created . "
as for socialist candidate ségolène royal , beytout wrote that she lost by a wide margin chiefly because " she was chosen by her own party based more on her personality than on the maturity of her project . "
france is ready for change , and the paper called sarkozy 's campaign " a victory for movement . " meanwhile , the french daily libération was not so excited about sarkozy 's victory .
despite a clear preference for the socialist candidate , laurent joffrin wrote that " france made a clean choice . "
the editorialist said sarkozy " is a legitimate president , " and that the campaign was " dignified , passionate and civil to the highest degree . "
but joffrin was concerned about sarkozy 's stated goal of " reconciling france with the dominant norm of conservative liberalism , " and wondered whether sarkozy is a " thatcher sans petticoat ? "
the editorialist conceded that the " values of competition " demand the modernization of france , but that " the values of solidarity and justice remain " as a programmatic building block for the socialist party .
" the cherry season will return , " joffrin concluded , but " for the time being , it 's pit season .
take courage . " german newspapers were hopeful that sarkozy would bring about badly needed changes in france , but also worried that he might embark on a unilateral crusade if his party wins the upcoming parliamentary elections , as well . the online edition of the popular german magazine der spiegel observed that french voters elected what they perceived as " the candidate who has announced a new beginning , a change , even a ' break ' with hardened traditions " following " the leaden times of twelve years of ' chiraquie . " '
but the editorialist , stefan simons , went on to question the integrity of sarkozy 's campaign promises : " whoops , hold on a minute , and what about the last five years ? " he asked .
as former interior minister , " was n't he -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- - number three in the government - also responsible for the slow decline of the nation ? "
the " perfect feat " of sarkozy 's campaign , according to simons , was that his team was able to " refashion jacques chirac 's long-time minister as a ' newcomer , ' an outsider , even something of an opposition leader . "
simons was concerned over sarkozy 's courting the far-right vote , saying that he " has made the slogans of -lrb- far-right -rrb- front national-leader jean-marie le pen acceptable in mainstream discourse . "
the parliamentary elections in june , so the editorialist , will prove whether sarkozy is really interested in national unity , as he has said , or whether france will be ruled by " sarkozy the terminator . " spanish observers were hopeful that sarkozy 's election would give new impetus to the european union project , which faltered after french -lrb- and dutch -rrb- voters rejected the draft eu-constitution in a referendum . spanish daily el país mirrored the widespread opinion that sarkozy 's victory " reflects a desire for change , and comes at the hands of an authentic revolution in french politics . "
the commentator was suspicious of sarkozy 's propensity for populism , but also noted with satisfaction that he " has not passed through the grandes écoles from whence most of the french elites have come . "
sarkozy 's election also indicates that " french society has moved to the right , " and that " le pen has contaminated all of french politics . "
the editorialist believed that " europe has waited a long time on france , and they can wait a little longer until june , when this country , which is key to europe , recovers much of its intellectual , social and economic vitality " following what the editorial opined will be another victory for the conservative camp at the parliamentary polls .
" sarkozy sympathizes with spain , " the daily paper wrote , and " as minister of the interior , he acted with total support and loyalty . "
that is why , in the view of the spanish editorialist , " spain and -lrb- spanish president josé luis rodríguez -rrb- zapatero have a perfectly viable ally .

editorialists noted a rightward shift - some with satisfaction , others with suspicion . french editorialists across the board were full of praise for this year 's electoral process in france , which saw unprecedented voter turnout during both rounds of presidential voting and a decisive victory for former interior minister nicolas sarkozy .
but french papers were divided over the outcome of the vote . in the french daily le figaro , nicolas beytout doted on the " brilliant election of nicolas sarkozy . "
the campaign " has been exceptionally active and controversial , with massive participation in the first and second rounds , " and it " will certainly leave a permanent mark on the country 's history , " beytout wrote .
at the same time , he observed that the french right won " a score against the left that has n't been reached since general de gaulle . "
noting that for the first time in three decades , french voters elected a candidate from the outgoing camp -lrb- outgoing president jacques chirac and sarkozy both belong to the conservative ump party -rrb- , the editorialist opined that " gone are the days of systematic alternation , that frenzied back-and-forth that all too often has seen the country do and then undo that which it just created . "
as for socialist candidate ségolène royal , beytout wrote that she lost by a wide margin chiefly because " she was chosen by her own party based more on her personality than on the maturity of her project . "
france is ready for change , and the paper called sarkozy 's campaign " a victory for movement . " meanwhile , the french daily libération was not so excited about sarkozy 's victory .
despite a clear preference for the socialist candidate , laurent joffrin wrote that " france made a clean choice . "
the editorialist said sarkozy " is a legitimate president , " and that the campaign was " dignified , passionate and civil to the highest degree . "
but joffrin was concerned about sarkozy 's stated goal of " reconciling france with the dominant norm of conservative liberalism , " and wondered whether sarkozy is a " thatcher sans petticoat ? "
the editorialist conceded that the " values of competition " demand the modernization of france , but that " the values of solidarity and justice remain " as a programmatic building block for the socialist party .
" the cherry season will return , " joffrin concluded , but " for the time being , it 's pit season .
take courage . " german newspapers were hopeful that sarkozy would bring about badly needed changes in france , but also worried that he might embark on a unilateral crusade if his party wins the upcoming parliamentary elections , as well . the online edition of the popular german magazine der spiegel observed that french voters elected what they perceived as " the candidate who has announced a new beginning , a change , even a ' break ' with hardened traditions " following " the leaden times of twelve years of ' chiraquie . " '
but the editorialist , stefan simons , went on to question the integrity of sarkozy 's campaign promises : " whoops , hold on a minute , and what about the last five years ? " he asked .
as former interior minister , " was n't he -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- - number three in the government - also responsible for the slow decline of the nation ? "
the " perfect feat " of sarkozy 's campaign , according to simons , was that his team was able to " refashion jacques chirac 's long-time minister as a ' newcomer , ' an outsider , even something of an opposition leader . "
simons was concerned over sarkozy 's courting the far-right vote , saying that he " has made the slogans of -lrb- far-right -rrb- front national-leader jean-marie le pen acceptable in mainstream discourse . "
the parliamentary elections in june , so the editorialist , will prove whether sarkozy is really interested in national unity , as he has said , or whether france will be ruled by " sarkozy the terminator . " spanish observers were hopeful that sarkozy 's election would give new impetus to the european union project , which faltered after french -lrb- and dutch -rrb- voters rejected the draft eu-constitution in a referendum . spanish daily el país mirrored the widespread opinion that sarkozy 's victory " reflects a desire for change , and comes at the hands of an authentic revolution in french politics . "
the commentator was suspicious of sarkozy 's propensity for populism , but also noted with satisfaction that he " has not passed through the grandes écoles from whence most of the french elites have come . "
sarkozy 's election also indicates that " french society has moved to the right , " and that " le pen has contaminated all of french politics . "
the editorialist believed that " europe has waited a long time on france , and they can wait a little longer until june , when this country , which is key to europe , recovers much of its intellectual , social and economic vitality " following what the editorial opined will be another victory for the conservative camp at the parliamentary polls .
" sarkozy sympathizes with spain , " the daily paper wrote , and " as minister of the interior , he acted with total support and loyalty . "
that is why , in the view of the spanish editorialist , " spain and -lrb- spanish president josé luis rodríguez -rrb- zapatero have a perfectly viable ally .

french voters rejected the draft constitution in a referendum in 2005.german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said shortly after sarkozy 's victory on sunday that he hoped berlin and paris would work closely together on " important european projects " under the incoming french president .
" i hope for a close german-french partnership , " steinmeier , a social democrat , said after right-wing sarkozy won sunday 's presidential election to succeed jacques chirac .
" of course i hope the cooperation will lead to progress on important european projects , " he added in a reference to the european union 's moribund draft constitution .
in a speech directly following the announcement that he won the country 's highest electoral office by a comfortable margin , sarkozy addressed france 's international agenda .

merkel congratulates sarkozy , hopes for stronger ties police , protesters battle after sarkozy win conservative sarkozy is france 's next president elections -pipe- 07.05.2007 opinion : sarkozy 's win means european uncertainty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in electing nicolas sarkozy on sunday , the french voted for national reform .
but dw 's anke hagedorn says france 's european partners may have little reason to cheer a nationalistically inclined leader in paris . nicolas sarkozy has emerged triumphant in an election that pitted the right against the left , and a man against france 's first-ever female presidential candidate .
the vote attracted far more voters to the polls than in recent years .
the majority cast their ballots for a conservative who favors economic liberalism , a reduction in france 's gigantic state bureaucracy and limitations on immigration . sarkozy succeeded in attracting voters away from far-right candidate jean-marie le pen .
and he made the french electorate forget that under conservative leadership france has amassed the highest unemployment in the euro zone and a record level of government debt . french voters were given the choice between a cool , calculating political professional in sarkozy and an emotional , relative newcomer in socialist segolene royal .
royal and the socialists failed to convince the majority that they had any real plans to solve france 's problems . but what can europeans expect from sarkozy 's presidency ?
certainly not that he will come up with concrete solutions to european problems .
he hardly mentioned the eu in his campaign .
and when he did , the tone was one of what the eu could do for france , and not vice versa . sarkozy has a reputation of being power-hungry and reluctant to listen to advice , and in the past , he has repeatedly played the nationalist trump card .
for instance , sarkozy did n't exactly endear himself to germans by bringing up world war ii and the holocaust on a number of occasions during the campaign . sarkozy was trying to play on french national pride .
at a campaign rally in marseille , he gleefully pointed out that not all french people supported the nazi-installed occupation government during world war ii .
" there were also the heroes of a free france , " sarkozy crowed , " and the résistance . " to underscore that message , he staged his last rally at a symbolic site of the french resistance , the plateau des glières , promising , if elected , to make an annual pilgrimage there .
but how can an obsession with history help a president who has pledged to lead france into a new era ? france 's neighbors can only hope that this was empty campaign chest-thumping , and that sarkozy will remember his european responsibilities when france assumes the eu 's rotating presidency in june of next year . in his first speech after winning sunday 's election , sarkozy said he has always been a committed european .
the rest of europe now waits to see if deeds will follow those words . anke hagedorn -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police , protesters battle after sarkozy win demonstrators in city suburbs across france threw rocks and bottles as conservative nicolas sarkozy won the country 's presidential election .

hoffenheim on saturday clinched promotion from the regional third division to complete a further chapter in the success story of germany 's " richest village team , " as the club has been dubbed .
as a sort of chelsea of the german lower divisions , hoffenheim have big money behind them , and a patron like the wealthy london club 's roman abramovich with ambitions to match the finance .
sap chief invests in local club bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hopp used to score goals for hoffenheim dietmar hopp , 67 , one of the co-founders of the software giant sap , is one of german 's richest men .
he also scored quite a few goals in his youth in the blue and white of his local club until he left the village in southern germany in his early 20s .
now that promotion to the second division has been achieved , the next stage in an ambitious plan can be tackled : to get the team into the top-flight bundesliga .
" we want to be a factor in the second division , " said hopp on saturday .
" the aim is getting into the bundesliga in three to five years . "
new stadium on the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no word if hoffenheim 's next stadium will also bear hopp 's name the dream of bayern munich , schalke 04 or werder bremen visiting hoffenheim is not pie in the sky for hopp , who is building a new 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 54-million -rrb- stadium with a capacity of 30,000 spectators to be ready by 2009 .
the current dietmar hopp stadium - which only dates back to 1999 - is in the meantime being extended to take 6,350 spectators .
if necessary , the team will also be able to play home games at karlsruhe 's wildparkstadion .
hopp , who is a golfing buddy of german playing great franz beckenbauer , has gone about the reformation of the club in a thoroughly professional manner .
only the best for hoffenheim former bayern player hansi flick - now co-trainer of the german national team - coached the side to promotion to the regional league in 2001 , and this season hopp has ralf rangnick , former coach of hanover , stuttgart and schalke , in charge on a five-year contract .
and rangnick has very clear goals for his team .
" that was the first step , " rangnick said .
" the second is the new stadium .
the third is promotion into the bundesliga . "

but dw 's anke hagedorn says france 's european partners may have little reason to cheer a nationalistically inclined leader in paris . nicolas sarkozy has emerged triumphant in an election that pitted the right against the left , and a man against france 's first-ever female presidential candidate .
the vote attracted far more voters to the polls than in recent years .
the majority cast their ballots for a conservative who favors economic liberalism , a reduction in france 's gigantic state bureaucracy and limitations on immigration . sarkozy succeeded in attracting voters away from far-right candidate jean-marie le pen .
and he made the french electorate forget that under conservative leadership france has amassed the highest unemployment in the euro zone and a record level of government debt . french voters were given the choice between a cool , calculating political professional in sarkozy and an emotional , relative newcomer in socialist segolene royal .
royal and the socialists failed to convince the majority that they had any real plans to solve france 's problems . but what can europeans expect from sarkozy 's presidency ?
certainly not that he will come up with concrete solutions to european problems .
he hardly mentioned the eu in his campaign .
and when he did , the tone was one of what the eu could do for france , and not vice versa . sarkozy has a reputation of being power-hungry and reluctant to listen to advice , and in the past , he has repeatedly played the nationalist trump card .
for instance , sarkozy did n't exactly endear himself to germans by bringing up world war ii and the holocaust on a number of occasions during the campaign . sarkozy was trying to play on french national pride .
at a campaign rally in marseille , he gleefully pointed out that not all french people supported the nazi-installed occupation government during world war ii .
" there were also the heroes of a free france , " sarkozy crowed , " and the résistance . " to underscore that message , he staged his last rally at a symbolic site of the french resistance , the plateau des glières , promising , if elected , to make an annual pilgrimage there .
but how can an obsession with history help a president who has pledged to lead france into a new era ? france 's neighbors can only hope that this was empty campaign chest-thumping , and that sarkozy will remember his european responsibilities when france assumes the eu 's rotating presidency in june of next year . in his first speech after winning sunday 's election , sarkozy said he has always been a committed european .

but dw 's anke hagedorn says france 's european partners may have little reason to cheer a nationalistically inclined leader in paris . nicolas sarkozy has emerged triumphant in an election that pitted the right against the left , and a man against france 's first-ever female presidential candidate .
the vote attracted far more voters to the polls than in recent years .
the majority cast their ballots for a conservative who favors economic liberalism , a reduction in france 's gigantic state bureaucracy and limitations on immigration . sarkozy succeeded in attracting voters away from far-right candidate jean-marie le pen .
and he made the french electorate forget that under conservative leadership france has amassed the highest unemployment in the euro zone and a record level of government debt . french voters were given the choice between a cool , calculating political professional in sarkozy and an emotional , relative newcomer in socialist segolene royal .
royal and the socialists failed to convince the majority that they had any real plans to solve france 's problems . but what can europeans expect from sarkozy 's presidency ?
certainly not that he will come up with concrete solutions to european problems .
he hardly mentioned the eu in his campaign .
and when he did , the tone was one of what the eu could do for france , and not vice versa . sarkozy has a reputation of being power-hungry and reluctant to listen to advice , and in the past , he has repeatedly played the nationalist trump card .
for instance , sarkozy did n't exactly endear himself to germans by bringing up world war ii and the holocaust on a number of occasions during the campaign . sarkozy was trying to play on french national pride .
at a campaign rally in marseille , he gleefully pointed out that not all french people supported the nazi-installed occupation government during world war ii .
" there were also the heroes of a free france , " sarkozy crowed , " and the résistance . " to underscore that message , he staged his last rally at a symbolic site of the french resistance , the plateau des glières , promising , if elected , to make an annual pilgrimage there .
but how can an obsession with history help a president who has pledged to lead france into a new era ? france 's neighbors can only hope that this was empty campaign chest-thumping , and that sarkozy will remember his european responsibilities when france assumes the eu 's rotating presidency in june of next year . in his first speech after winning sunday 's election , sarkozy said he has always been a committed european .
the rest of europe now waits to see if deeds will follow those words . anke hagedorn -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police , protesters battle after sarkozy win demonstrators in city suburbs across france threw rocks and bottles as conservative nicolas sarkozy won the country 's presidential election .

hoffenheim on saturday clinched promotion from the regional third division to complete a further chapter in the success story of germany 's " richest village team , " as the club has been dubbed .
as a sort of chelsea of the german lower divisions , hoffenheim have big money behind them , and a patron like the wealthy london club 's roman abramovich with ambitions to match the finance .
sap chief invests in local club bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hopp used to score goals for hoffenheim dietmar hopp , 67 , one of the co-founders of the software giant sap , is one of german 's richest men .
he also scored quite a few goals in his youth in the blue and white of his local club until he left the village in southern germany in his early 20s .
now that promotion to the second division has been achieved , the next stage in an ambitious plan can be tackled : to get the team into the top-flight bundesliga .
" we want to be a factor in the second division , " said hopp on saturday .
" the aim is getting into the bundesliga in three to five years . "
new stadium on the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no word if hoffenheim 's next stadium will also bear hopp 's name the dream of bayern munich , schalke 04 or werder bremen visiting hoffenheim is not pie in the sky for hopp , who is building a new 40-million-euro -lrb- $ 54-million -rrb- stadium with a capacity of 30,000 spectators to be ready by 2009 .
the current dietmar hopp stadium - which only dates back to 1999 - is in the meantime being extended to take 6,350 spectators .
if necessary , the team will also be able to play home games at karlsruhe 's wildparkstadion .
hopp , who is a golfing buddy of german playing great franz beckenbauer , has gone about the reformation of the club in a thoroughly professional manner .
only the best for hoffenheim former bayern player hansi flick - now co-trainer of the german national team - coached the side to promotion to the regional league in 2001 , and this season hopp has ralf rangnick , former coach of hanover , stuttgart and schalke , in charge on a five-year contract .
and rangnick has very clear goals for his team .
" that was the first step , " rangnick said .
" the second is the new stadium .
the third is promotion into the bundesliga . "
there is also plenty of other expertise at the club including the german national team psychologist hans-dieter hermann and bernhard peters , the man who led the german hockey team to the world title last september .
peters , who was wanted last year by former germany coach jürgen klinsmann as technical director for the national team , now has just that role for hoffenheim , with responsibility for sport and youth development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf rangnick held the clipboard at stuttgart , hanover and schalke " as far as youth development goes hoffenheim is ahead of many a bundesliga club , " praised klinsmann , who has close contacts with hopp .
targets , performance , return hopp sets great store in developing talent to ensure that the hoffenheim project is a lasting one .
he has invested millions in training centers , and all the club 's teams are doing well in their respective leagues .
" we want to realize a project that is unique in germany , " hopp said , falling back on the manager-speak that rules his day job .
" in the long-term we want to develop our own talent . "
the rise to the top has not been without its critics , and there are clubs who are struggling financially who may be justified in feeling envious of hoffenheim 's possibilities .
recently fc ingolstadt coach juergen press , in a spat with rangnick , said that " every verbandsliga -lrb- fifth division -rrb- coach would achieve promotion with this team of professionals . "
however rangnick believes life will be much easier for the club now that it has reached the second division .
" no longer will we be accused of being the millionaires of the regional league , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 07.05.2007 g8 labor ministers call for more social engagement by business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 labor ministers argue that more social responsibility would change the minds of globalization critics g8 labor ministers are debating whether to require big businesses to promote social and environmental programs , with the aim of a fairer globalization .
but employers are nervous . the group of eight labor ministers , representing the world 's leading industrialized nations plus russia , convened on monday for a two-day meeting in dresden , germany . there , a new buzzword has emerged : " corporate social responsibility " - or csr for short . the idea behind this somewhat ambiguous , perhaps even euphemistic term is that big businesses - especially those operating on a global scale - should " integrate social and environmental issues into their business activities , " in the official wording of the european union commission . " economy , ecology and social action have to be carried out in a way that is fair and balanced , " german minister of labor and social affairs franz müntefering wrote in the pre-released text of a tuesday speech to his g8 colleagues .
müntefering is concurrently vice-chancellor in the cabinet of angela merkel , who currently controls the rotating eu presidency . whose responsibility is it , anyway ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will shoulder the social and environmental burden ?
the idea has rattled the nerves of business representatives , who fear that the government wants to rid itself of its own social responsibilities .
renate hornung-draus of the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- told the g8 that social commitments in the business sector " should n't be seen as a substitute for government action . " meanwhile , the german confederation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- has demanded regulations that would set out basic requirements for corporate social responsibility .
dgb chairman michael sommer told the german news service dpa that " the spoils of globalization should benefit all , not just a few " people , a statement that hornung-draus has echoed . müntefering defended csr , arguing that a socially responsible process of globalization would bring about widespread prosperity , which in turn would elicit a more accepting attitude from globalization 's skeptics . " we have to share this insight with the world : social action is a strong economic force . " but the anti-globalization network attac has accused müntefering of glossing over reality .
" in fact , the german government is enacting cutbacks to social standards - at home and worldwide , " the activists wrote in a press release .
any way you look at it - in the g8 , the eu or at the federal level - the government has been " instrumental to advancing the neoliberal globalization in the interest of corporate groups , " attac claims . different standards in china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shoe factory in china , where labor practices can be very different than in the west minimum social standards are particularly problematic for enterprises with production sites in developing countries .
there , western companies face enormous problems , including extreme poverty , inadequate medical care , corruption , child labor , sub-standard education and the absence of worker 's rights or meaningful environmental safeguards , to name a few . ingo schoenheit , managing director of the university of hanover 's institute for market / environment / society , exemplifies the difficulty of conducting business in developing countries in a recent book on corporate social responsibility in china . " on the one hand , they -lrb- western corporations -rrb- want to take advantage of the cost benefits china has to offer , which result from its low wage , social and environmental standards . "
but , the author writes , companies active in china are under constant pressure from markets and the public to " protect the reputation of their brands . " the core question , according to author schoenheit , is this : " do the same principles and criteria apply to europe and china ? " contradicting approaches in europe even inside the european union , there seems to be no consensus over how to encourage more social action from business leaders .
a study commissioned by the bertelsmann foundation , germany 's largest private non-profit organization , examines the approaches of various eu-countries to csr , and finds that there is no unified concept . sweden , the united kingdom and the netherlands are at the forefront of corporate responsibility , the study finds .
in denmark , larger companies are required to present an annual environmental report to the government .
and in france , the government has put similar regulations in place , although many businesses have lobbied to remove some of them . germany , on the other hand , is behind the times , the study says .
" no strategy , no contact persons , no transparency .
the -lrb- german -rrb- federal government has a lot to catch up on . " however , germany also demonstrates that csr may be possible without potentially inhibiting state regulations .

but employers are nervous . the group of eight labor ministers , representing the world 's leading industrialized nations plus russia , convened on monday for a two-day meeting in dresden , germany . there , a new buzzword has emerged : " corporate social responsibility " - or csr for short . the idea behind this somewhat ambiguous , perhaps even euphemistic term is that big businesses - especially those operating on a global scale - should " integrate social and environmental issues into their business activities , " in the official wording of the european union commission . " economy , ecology and social action have to be carried out in a way that is fair and balanced , " german minister of labor and social affairs franz müntefering wrote in the pre-released text of a tuesday speech to his g8 colleagues .
müntefering is concurrently vice-chancellor in the cabinet of angela merkel , who currently controls the rotating eu presidency . whose responsibility is it , anyway ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will shoulder the social and environmental burden ?
the idea has rattled the nerves of business representatives , who fear that the government wants to rid itself of its own social responsibilities .
renate hornung-draus of the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- told the g8 that social commitments in the business sector " should n't be seen as a substitute for government action . " meanwhile , the german confederation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- has demanded regulations that would set out basic requirements for corporate social responsibility .
dgb chairman michael sommer told the german news service dpa that " the spoils of globalization should benefit all , not just a few " people , a statement that hornung-draus has echoed . müntefering defended csr , arguing that a socially responsible process of globalization would bring about widespread prosperity , which in turn would elicit a more accepting attitude from globalization 's skeptics . " we have to share this insight with the world : social action is a strong economic force . " but the anti-globalization network attac has accused müntefering of glossing over reality .
" in fact , the german government is enacting cutbacks to social standards - at home and worldwide , " the activists wrote in a press release .
any way you look at it - in the g8 , the eu or at the federal level - the government has been " instrumental to advancing the neoliberal globalization in the interest of corporate groups , " attac claims . different standards in china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shoe factory in china , where labor practices can be very different than in the west minimum social standards are particularly problematic for enterprises with production sites in developing countries .
there , western companies face enormous problems , including extreme poverty , inadequate medical care , corruption , child labor , sub-standard education and the absence of worker 's rights or meaningful environmental safeguards , to name a few . ingo schoenheit , managing director of the university of hanover 's institute for market / environment / society , exemplifies the difficulty of conducting business in developing countries in a recent book on corporate social responsibility in china . " on the one hand , they -lrb- western corporations -rrb- want to take advantage of the cost benefits china has to offer , which result from its low wage , social and environmental standards . "
but , the author writes , companies active in china are under constant pressure from markets and the public to " protect the reputation of their brands . " the core question , according to author schoenheit , is this : " do the same principles and criteria apply to europe and china ? " contradicting approaches in europe even inside the european union , there seems to be no consensus over how to encourage more social action from business leaders .
a study commissioned by the bertelsmann foundation , germany 's largest private non-profit organization , examines the approaches of various eu-countries to csr , and finds that there is no unified concept . sweden , the united kingdom and the netherlands are at the forefront of corporate responsibility , the study finds .
in denmark , larger companies are required to present an annual environmental report to the government .
and in france , the government has put similar regulations in place , although many businesses have lobbied to remove some of them . germany , on the other hand , is behind the times , the study says .
" no strategy , no contact persons , no transparency .
the -lrb- german -rrb- federal government has a lot to catch up on . " however , germany also demonstrates that csr may be possible without potentially inhibiting state regulations .

köhler will decide this week over klar 's possible release . after a weekend of unprecedented verbal attacks on the german president by her ministers , chancellor angela merkel called on sunday for an end to the harsh criticism arising from horst köhler ’ s decision to consider whether to grant clemency to a former red army faction guerrilla after 24 years in prison .
köhler announced on friday , shortly after meeting with christian klar - who was convicted in 1982 for his role a series of raf killings - that he would decide on the former terrorist 's bid for freedom in the coming days .
the president 's announcement caused an outcry in merkel ’ s christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with some members calling for köhler to be denied the chance to stand for a second term in 2009 should he approve klar 's release .
merkel calls for respect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called for an end to the criticism of köhler this prompted the chancellor to release a statement calling for restraint as the criticism reached a crescendo over the weekend .
" respect for the office and person of the president must always be protected , " merkel said .
" i ask that we all , regardless of how the president decides in the end , respect the decision of horst köhler .
" -lrb- there is -rrb- no doubt that the president will handle this difficult and controversial issue after careful examination in a very conscientious way , " she added .
merkel 's words were echoed by her interior minister , wolfgang schäuble , who added : " the president and the president alone has the right to make these decisions .
he has the highest responsibility and special obligation to decide and everyone must respect that . "
the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- leader guido westerwelle also joined in with the condemnation of the criticism .
" while all opinion is allowed and in fact encouraged in this debate , the level of this criticism aimed at the federal president is absolutely unacceptable . "
he added that he expected more respect from the members of the csu who had led the attacks on köhler and by doing so had put the president and the constitution under pressure .
however , westerwelle also took the opportunity to restate his own views on klar 's potential release by saying that he should not be pardoned until he showed remorse for his actions . green party co-chairperson claudia roth also condemned the criticism and voiced her support for a pardon .
" in our constitutional state , we do not operate on revenge but reintegration , " roth said .
" the csu has no respect for horst köhler the person , and it ignores his presidential position . "
she added that the criticism over köhler ’ s meeting with klar was unfounded .
" it is important and correct that -lrb- köhler -rrb- meets with klar and holds a personal conversation with him to get his own picture of the man . "
csu hardliners talk of withdrawing support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein said klar should remian behind bars the attacks against köhler were led by senior csu politicians , including günther beckstein , the bavarian state interior minister .
beckstein said that a criminal like klar belonged behind bars and added : " it is my view of justice that a criminal who does not confess is undeserving of clemency . "
csu member of parliament andreas scheuer went further , saying , " if the federal president uses his power to pardon klar then i will have to seriously consider whether the president will have my future support . "
in the event of a presidential pardon , scheuer urged the german government not to countersign .
" this would send out a clear message that the german government does not agree with the president ’ s decision , " he said .
the move to release klar is also strongly opposed by most of the families of his victims .
klar hopes for early release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar is eligible for release in 2009 klar , 54 , has served more than 24 years of a life term for his role in several murders committed at the end of the 1970s with the urban guerrilla group .
he was jailed for a series of killings , including the shooting of federal prosecutor siegfried buback , during the raf 's violent campaign against what it called the oppressive capitalist west german state and elite in the 1970s and early 1980s .
klar is eligible for early release in 2009 but has appealed for clemency to get out sooner as it is rare for criminals to spend more than 20 years in prison in germany .

"
merkel said she was looking forward to meeting sarkozy in the near future " for a first exhange of views . "
the partnership between france and germany is often described as the " motor " of the eu and berlin is expected to be one of the first foreign visits sarkozy makes .

french voters rejected the draft constitution in a referendum in 2005.german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said shortly after sarkozy 's victory on sunday that he hoped berlin and paris would work closely together on " important european projects " under the incoming french president .
" i hope for a close german-french partnership , " steinmeier , a social democrat , said after right-wing sarkozy won sunday 's presidential election to succeed jacques chirac .
" of course i hope the cooperation will lead to progress on important european projects , " he added in a reference to the european union 's moribund draft constitution .
in a speech directly following the announcement that he won the country 's highest electoral office by a comfortable margin , sarkozy addressed france 's international agenda .
' our destiny is linked ' " i want to launch a call to our european partners , with whom our destiny is deeply linked , to tell them that i have been european all my life , that i believe deeply , that i believe sincerely , in european construction , and that tonight france is back in europe .
i beseech our european partners to hear the voices of people who want to be protected . "

" i want to tell -lrb- the united states -rrb- that france will always be by their side when they will need her .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the explosion tore out a 32-yard section of pipeline the official said the blast was likely due to a technical fault .
emergency services put out a fire at the scene and investigators were working to uncover the cause of the explosion , naftogaz said in a statement .
the incident immediately raised fears of gas shortfalls in europe , which relies heavily on russian supplies , but russia 's gas exporting monopoly gazprom quickly assured that deliveries would still reach clients .
assurances " there will be no disruption in supplies to our consumers .
our export supplies will continue at full volume , " sergei kupriyanov , a spokesman for gazprom , said on state television .

biggest foreign market the european union is the biggest foreign gas market for russia , the world 's leading natural gas producer .
nearly all of ukraine 's energy imports come via russia .
the incident revived memories of gas shortfalls throughout western europe at the start of 2006 when gazprom cut off supplies through ukraine due to a pricing dispute with the ex-soviet republic .

but employers are nervous . the group of eight labor ministers , representing the world 's leading industrialized nations plus russia , convened on monday for a two-day meeting in dresden , germany . there , a new buzzword has emerged : " corporate social responsibility " - or csr for short . the idea behind this somewhat ambiguous , perhaps even euphemistic term is that big businesses - especially those operating on a global scale - should " integrate social and environmental issues into their business activities , " in the official wording of the european union commission . " economy , ecology and social action have to be carried out in a way that is fair and balanced , " german minister of labor and social affairs franz müntefering wrote in the pre-released text of a tuesday speech to his g8 colleagues .
müntefering is concurrently vice-chancellor in the cabinet of angela merkel , who currently controls the rotating eu presidency . whose responsibility is it , anyway ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will shoulder the social and environmental burden ?
the idea has rattled the nerves of business representatives , who fear that the government wants to rid itself of its own social responsibilities .
renate hornung-draus of the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- told the g8 that social commitments in the business sector " should n't be seen as a substitute for government action . " meanwhile , the german confederation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- has demanded regulations that would set out basic requirements for corporate social responsibility .
dgb chairman michael sommer told the german news service dpa that " the spoils of globalization should benefit all , not just a few " people , a statement that hornung-draus has echoed . müntefering defended csr , arguing that a socially responsible process of globalization would bring about widespread prosperity , which in turn would elicit a more accepting attitude from globalization 's skeptics . " we have to share this insight with the world : social action is a strong economic force . " but the anti-globalization network attac has accused müntefering of glossing over reality .
" in fact , the german government is enacting cutbacks to social standards - at home and worldwide , " the activists wrote in a press release .
any way you look at it - in the g8 , the eu or at the federal level - the government has been " instrumental to advancing the neoliberal globalization in the interest of corporate groups , " attac claims . different standards in china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shoe factory in china , where labor practices can be very different than in the west minimum social standards are particularly problematic for enterprises with production sites in developing countries .

" on the one hand , they -lrb- western corporations -rrb- want to take advantage of the cost benefits china has to offer , which result from its low wage , social and environmental standards . "
but , the author writes , companies active in china are under constant pressure from markets and the public to " protect the reputation of their brands . " the core question , according to author schoenheit , is this : " do the same principles and criteria apply to europe and china ? " contradicting approaches in europe even inside the european union , there seems to be no consensus over how to encourage more social action from business leaders .
a study commissioned by the bertelsmann foundation , germany 's largest private non-profit organization , examines the approaches of various eu-countries to csr , and finds that there is no unified concept . sweden , the united kingdom and the netherlands are at the forefront of corporate responsibility , the study finds .

but employers are nervous . the group of eight labor ministers , representing the world 's leading industrialized nations plus russia , convened on monday for a two-day meeting in dresden , germany . there , a new buzzword has emerged : " corporate social responsibility " - or csr for short . the idea behind this somewhat ambiguous , perhaps even euphemistic term is that big businesses - especially those operating on a global scale - should " integrate social and environmental issues into their business activities , " in the official wording of the european union commission . " economy , ecology and social action have to be carried out in a way that is fair and balanced , " german minister of labor and social affairs franz müntefering wrote in the pre-released text of a tuesday speech to his g8 colleagues .
müntefering is concurrently vice-chancellor in the cabinet of angela merkel , who currently controls the rotating eu presidency . whose responsibility is it , anyway ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will shoulder the social and environmental burden ?
the idea has rattled the nerves of business representatives , who fear that the government wants to rid itself of its own social responsibilities .
renate hornung-draus of the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- told the g8 that social commitments in the business sector " should n't be seen as a substitute for government action . " meanwhile , the german confederation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- has demanded regulations that would set out basic requirements for corporate social responsibility .
dgb chairman michael sommer told the german news service dpa that " the spoils of globalization should benefit all , not just a few " people , a statement that hornung-draus has echoed . müntefering defended csr , arguing that a socially responsible process of globalization would bring about widespread prosperity , which in turn would elicit a more accepting attitude from globalization 's skeptics . " we have to share this insight with the world : social action is a strong economic force . " but the anti-globalization network attac has accused müntefering of glossing over reality .
" in fact , the german government is enacting cutbacks to social standards - at home and worldwide , " the activists wrote in a press release .
any way you look at it - in the g8 , the eu or at the federal level - the government has been " instrumental to advancing the neoliberal globalization in the interest of corporate groups , " attac claims . different standards in china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shoe factory in china , where labor practices can be very different than in the west minimum social standards are particularly problematic for enterprises with production sites in developing countries .
there , western companies face enormous problems , including extreme poverty , inadequate medical care , corruption , child labor , sub-standard education and the absence of worker 's rights or meaningful environmental safeguards , to name a few . ingo schoenheit , managing director of the university of hanover 's institute for market / environment / society , exemplifies the difficulty of conducting business in developing countries in a recent book on corporate social responsibility in china . " on the one hand , they -lrb- western corporations -rrb- want to take advantage of the cost benefits china has to offer , which result from its low wage , social and environmental standards . "
but , the author writes , companies active in china are under constant pressure from markets and the public to " protect the reputation of their brands . " the core question , according to author schoenheit , is this : " do the same principles and criteria apply to europe and china ? " contradicting approaches in europe even inside the european union , there seems to be no consensus over how to encourage more social action from business leaders .
a study commissioned by the bertelsmann foundation , germany 's largest private non-profit organization , examines the approaches of various eu-countries to csr , and finds that there is no unified concept . sweden , the united kingdom and the netherlands are at the forefront of corporate responsibility , the study finds .
in denmark , larger companies are required to present an annual environmental report to the government .
and in france , the government has put similar regulations in place , although many businesses have lobbied to remove some of them . germany , on the other hand , is behind the times , the study says .
" no strategy , no contact persons , no transparency .
the -lrb- german -rrb- federal government has a lot to catch up on . " however , germany also demonstrates that csr may be possible without potentially inhibiting state regulations .

less than a decade later , young punks in london would literally fight each other to get to the front of a sex pistols gig on the off chance of getting spat on by johnny rotten or having sid vicious break his bass over their heads .
music genres such as rock and punk are fuelled by the chemistry between the simmering malevolence on stage and the unleashed mayhem in the crowd .
the energy created by confrontational artists and willing victims is the stuff of legend .
it is this type of sado-masochistic , love-hate relationship which separates the edgy from the cozy - which is why you 'll never get bottles of urine thrown on stage at a take that concert .

mark 's proclamation to his fans that " i love you all so f * * * ing much " could quite easily be taken as an over-enthusiastic cry of thanks but referring to his audience as " a bunch of dirty bastards " requires deeper analysis to find the remotest appreciation of their efforts .
" since i saw mark for the first time , i can no longer imagine my life without him , " wrote one fan on the superstar 's internet fan site .
" i cry if i see him on the tv and am moved profoundly if i hear him talking . "

it seems that the commitment of austrian fans has been relayed to the new superstar but he has yet to acknowledge them or even throw an insult in their direction .
the fan site almost collapsed under the amount of supporters logging on during and after the final but neither an acknowledgement nor accusation of dubious parentage has come from the bobbelsche 's finely pursed lips .

police , protesters battle after sarkozy win opinion : sarkozy 's win means european uncertainty conservative sarkozy is france 's next president elections -pipe- 07.05.2007 merkel congratulates sarkozy , hopes for stronger ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's conservatives are pleased german chancellor angela merkel said she hoped french president-elect nicolas sarkozy would strengthen the french-german axis at the heart of the european union . congratulating her fellow conservative on his victory in the presidential runoff , merkel said she was convinced that under him " the german-french friendship will continue to be the basis to secure lasting peace , democracy and prosperity in europe . "
merkel said she was looking forward to meeting sarkozy in the near future " for a first exhange of views . "
the partnership between france and germany is often described as the " motor " of the eu and berlin is expected to be one of the first foreign visits sarkozy makes .
hopes for reviving eu constitution germany holds the rotating six-month presidency of the eu and merkel is keen to put the european bloc on track towards a revised constitutional treaty before the german presidency finishes at the end of june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the two see to it that the eu constitution is ratified ?
french voters rejected the draft constitution in a referendum in 2005.german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said shortly after sarkozy 's victory on sunday that he hoped berlin and paris would work closely together on " important european projects " under the incoming french president .
" i hope for a close german-french partnership , " steinmeier , a social democrat , said after right-wing sarkozy won sunday 's presidential election to succeed jacques chirac .
" of course i hope the cooperation will lead to progress on important european projects , " he added in a reference to the european union 's moribund draft constitution .
in a speech directly following the announcement that he won the country 's highest electoral office by a comfortable margin , sarkozy addressed france 's international agenda .
' our destiny is linked ' " i want to launch a call to our european partners , with whom our destiny is deeply linked , to tell them that i have been european all my life , that i believe deeply , that i believe sincerely , in european construction , and that tonight france is back in europe .
i beseech our european partners to hear the voices of people who want to be protected . "
another phone call came from european commission president jose manuel barroso , who congratulated sarkozy and said he was hopeful the new leader of france could help end the eu 's institutional woes . " i know nicolas sarkozy very well , and i am aware of his desire for france to take its rightful place on the european stage , " barroso said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso hopes to move the eu a step forward " i have complete confidence in nicolas sarkozy ... to play a driving role in resolving the institutional question and consolidating european politics , " he said . meanwhile , us president george w. bush also sent his wishes to the man of the hour soon after his win was sealed . " the united states and france are historic allies and partners .
president bush looks forward to working with president-elect sarkozy as we continue our strong alliance , " gordon johndroe , spokesman for the white house national security council , told afp . warning on warming following his victory , sarkozy pledged that the united states can count on a friendship with france , which " will always be at their side when they need help . " since a much-publicized us trip in september 2006 , sarkozy has fought against charges that he pandered to bush and the perception that he is too pro-american , a quality seen as unpopular with french voters . ' friendship is accepting difference ' addressing the crowd after his victory on sunday evening , he tried to get some distance form that image . " i want to tell -lrb- the united states -rrb- that france will always be by their side when they will need her .
but i want to tell them as well that friendship is accepting that one 's friends can act differently , and that a great nation like the united states has the duty to not obstruct the fight against global warming but on the contrary to head this struggle .
because what is at stake is the future of all humanity , " sarkozy said in his victory speech .

i beseech our european partners to hear the voices of people who want to be protected . "
another phone call came from european commission president jose manuel barroso , who congratulated sarkozy and said he was hopeful the new leader of france could help end the eu 's institutional woes . " i know nicolas sarkozy very well , and i am aware of his desire for france to take its rightful place on the european stage , " barroso said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso hopes to move the eu a step forward " i have complete confidence in nicolas sarkozy ... to play a driving role in resolving the institutional question and consolidating european politics , " he said . meanwhile , us president george w. bush also sent his wishes to the man of the hour soon after his win was sealed . " the united states and france are historic allies and partners .
president bush looks forward to working with president-elect sarkozy as we continue our strong alliance , " gordon johndroe , spokesman for the white house national security council , told afp . warning on warming following his victory , sarkozy pledged that the united states can count on a friendship with france , which " will always be at their side when they need help . " since a much-publicized us trip in september 2006 , sarkozy has fought against charges that he pandered to bush and the perception that he is too pro-american , a quality seen as unpopular with french voters . ' friendship is accepting difference ' addressing the crowd after his victory on sunday evening , he tried to get some distance form that image . " i want to tell -lrb- the united states -rrb- that france will always be by their side when they will need her .
but i want to tell them as well that friendship is accepting that one 's friends can act differently , and that a great nation like the united states has the duty to not obstruct the fight against global warming but on the contrary to head this struggle .
because what is at stake is the future of all humanity , " sarkozy said in his victory speech .

horst v. , formerly a manager and consultant at the electronics giant , was sentenced to 18 months parole .
the two men were charged with bribing enel employees with nearly six million euros between 1999 and 2002 , in order to win siemens 450 million euros -lrb- $ 612 million -rrb- worth of contracts to deliver turbines for power generators .
senior public prosecutor ulrich busch demanded monday that siemens pay a fine of 97.7 million euros -lrb- $ 132.5 million -rrb- to the state as a penalty for the enel corruption case .
the amount is equal to the company 's gross profit from the delivery of two turbines to enel -lrb- 103.8 million euros -rrb- , minus a 6.12 million euro fine that had already been assessed during an earlier trial in milan .

" i hope that , with this step , the communications department will have a smoother path . "
stephan heimbach , current director of the corporate affairs department , will replace gönczöl , siemens announced .

köhler will decide this week over klar 's possible release . after a weekend of unprecedented verbal attacks on the german president by her ministers , chancellor angela merkel called on sunday for an end to the harsh criticism arising from horst köhler ’ s decision to consider whether to grant clemency to a former red army faction guerrilla after 24 years in prison .
köhler announced on friday , shortly after meeting with christian klar - who was convicted in 1982 for his role a series of raf killings - that he would decide on the former terrorist 's bid for freedom in the coming days .
the president 's announcement caused an outcry in merkel ’ s christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with some members calling for köhler to be denied the chance to stand for a second term in 2009 should he approve klar 's release .
merkel calls for respect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called for an end to the criticism of köhler this prompted the chancellor to release a statement calling for restraint as the criticism reached a crescendo over the weekend .
" respect for the office and person of the president must always be protected , " merkel said .
" i ask that we all , regardless of how the president decides in the end , respect the decision of horst köhler .
" -lrb- there is -rrb- no doubt that the president will handle this difficult and controversial issue after careful examination in a very conscientious way , " she added .
merkel 's words were echoed by her interior minister , wolfgang schäuble , who added : " the president and the president alone has the right to make these decisions .
he has the highest responsibility and special obligation to decide and everyone must respect that . "
the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- leader guido westerwelle also joined in with the condemnation of the criticism .
" while all opinion is allowed and in fact encouraged in this debate , the level of this criticism aimed at the federal president is absolutely unacceptable . "
he added that he expected more respect from the members of the csu who had led the attacks on köhler and by doing so had put the president and the constitution under pressure .
however , westerwelle also took the opportunity to restate his own views on klar 's potential release by saying that he should not be pardoned until he showed remorse for his actions . green party co-chairperson claudia roth also condemned the criticism and voiced her support for a pardon .
" in our constitutional state , we do not operate on revenge but reintegration , " roth said .
" the csu has no respect for horst köhler the person , and it ignores his presidential position . "
she added that the criticism over köhler ’ s meeting with klar was unfounded .
" it is important and correct that -lrb- köhler -rrb- meets with klar and holds a personal conversation with him to get his own picture of the man . "
csu hardliners talk of withdrawing support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein said klar should remian behind bars the attacks against köhler were led by senior csu politicians , including günther beckstein , the bavarian state interior minister .
beckstein said that a criminal like klar belonged behind bars and added : " it is my view of justice that a criminal who does not confess is undeserving of clemency . "
csu member of parliament andreas scheuer went further , saying , " if the federal president uses his power to pardon klar then i will have to seriously consider whether the president will have my future support . "
in the event of a presidential pardon , scheuer urged the german government not to countersign .
" this would send out a clear message that the german government does not agree with the president ’ s decision , " he said .
the move to release klar is also strongly opposed by most of the families of his victims .
klar hopes for early release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar is eligible for release in 2009 klar , 54 , has served more than 24 years of a life term for his role in several murders committed at the end of the 1970s with the urban guerrilla group .
he was jailed for a series of killings , including the shooting of federal prosecutor siegfried buback , during the raf 's violent campaign against what it called the oppressive capitalist west german state and elite in the 1970s and early 1980s .
klar is eligible for early release in 2009 but has appealed for clemency to get out sooner as it is rare for criminals to spend more than 20 years in prison in germany .
some germans feel that klar has paid his debt to society . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president to decide on pardon for raf terrorist klar president köhler has met with christian klar , a member of the raf terrorist group that plunged the country into deep uncertainty in the 1970s , in connection with klar 's application for clemency , köhler 's office said .

köhler will decide this week over klar 's possible release . after a weekend of unprecedented verbal attacks on the german president by her ministers , chancellor angela merkel called on sunday for an end to the harsh criticism arising from horst köhler ’ s decision to consider whether to grant clemency to a former red army faction guerrilla after 24 years in prison .
köhler announced on friday , shortly after meeting with christian klar - who was convicted in 1982 for his role a series of raf killings - that he would decide on the former terrorist 's bid for freedom in the coming days .
the president 's announcement caused an outcry in merkel ’ s christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with some members calling for köhler to be denied the chance to stand for a second term in 2009 should he approve klar 's release .
merkel calls for respect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called for an end to the criticism of köhler this prompted the chancellor to release a statement calling for restraint as the criticism reached a crescendo over the weekend .
" respect for the office and person of the president must always be protected , " merkel said .
" i ask that we all , regardless of how the president decides in the end , respect the decision of horst köhler .
" -lrb- there is -rrb- no doubt that the president will handle this difficult and controversial issue after careful examination in a very conscientious way , " she added .
merkel 's words were echoed by her interior minister , wolfgang schäuble , who added : " the president and the president alone has the right to make these decisions .
he has the highest responsibility and special obligation to decide and everyone must respect that . "
the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- leader guido westerwelle also joined in with the condemnation of the criticism .
" while all opinion is allowed and in fact encouraged in this debate , the level of this criticism aimed at the federal president is absolutely unacceptable . "
he added that he expected more respect from the members of the csu who had led the attacks on köhler and by doing so had put the president and the constitution under pressure .
however , westerwelle also took the opportunity to restate his own views on klar 's potential release by saying that he should not be pardoned until he showed remorse for his actions . green party co-chairperson claudia roth also condemned the criticism and voiced her support for a pardon .
" in our constitutional state , we do not operate on revenge but reintegration , " roth said .
" the csu has no respect for horst köhler the person , and it ignores his presidential position . "
she added that the criticism over köhler ’ s meeting with klar was unfounded .

editorialists noted a rightward shift - some with satisfaction , others with suspicion . french editorialists across the board were full of praise for this year 's electoral process in france , which saw unprecedented voter turnout during both rounds of presidential voting and a decisive victory for former interior minister nicolas sarkozy .
but french papers were divided over the outcome of the vote . in the french daily le figaro , nicolas beytout doted on the " brilliant election of nicolas sarkozy . "
the campaign " has been exceptionally active and controversial , with massive participation in the first and second rounds , " and it " will certainly leave a permanent mark on the country 's history , " beytout wrote .
at the same time , he observed that the french right won " a score against the left that has n't been reached since general de gaulle . "
noting that for the first time in three decades , french voters elected a candidate from the outgoing camp -lrb- outgoing president jacques chirac and sarkozy both belong to the conservative ump party -rrb- , the editorialist opined that " gone are the days of systematic alternation , that frenzied back-and-forth that all too often has seen the country do and then undo that which it just created . "
as for socialist candidate ségolène royal , beytout wrote that she lost by a wide margin chiefly because " she was chosen by her own party based more on her personality than on the maturity of her project . "
france is ready for change , and the paper called sarkozy 's campaign " a victory for movement . " meanwhile , the french daily libération was not so excited about sarkozy 's victory .
despite a clear preference for the socialist candidate , laurent joffrin wrote that " france made a clean choice . "
the editorialist said sarkozy " is a legitimate president , " and that the campaign was " dignified , passionate and civil to the highest degree . "
but joffrin was concerned about sarkozy 's stated goal of " reconciling france with the dominant norm of conservative liberalism , " and wondered whether sarkozy is a " thatcher sans petticoat ? "
the editorialist conceded that the " values of competition " demand the modernization of france , but that " the values of solidarity and justice remain " as a programmatic building block for the socialist party .
" the cherry season will return , " joffrin concluded , but " for the time being , it 's pit season .
take courage . " german newspapers were hopeful that sarkozy would bring about badly needed changes in france , but also worried that he might embark on a unilateral crusade if his party wins the upcoming parliamentary elections , as well . the online edition of the popular german magazine der spiegel observed that french voters elected what they perceived as " the candidate who has announced a new beginning , a change , even a ' break ' with hardened traditions " following " the leaden times of twelve years of ' chiraquie . " '
but the editorialist , stefan simons , went on to question the integrity of sarkozy 's campaign promises : " whoops , hold on a minute , and what about the last five years ? " he asked .
as former interior minister , " was n't he -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- - number three in the government - also responsible for the slow decline of the nation ? "
the " perfect feat " of sarkozy 's campaign , according to simons , was that his team was able to " refashion jacques chirac 's long-time minister as a ' newcomer , ' an outsider , even something of an opposition leader . "
simons was concerned over sarkozy 's courting the far-right vote , saying that he " has made the slogans of -lrb- far-right -rrb- front national-leader jean-marie le pen acceptable in mainstream discourse . "
the parliamentary elections in june , so the editorialist , will prove whether sarkozy is really interested in national unity , as he has said , or whether france will be ruled by " sarkozy the terminator . " spanish observers were hopeful that sarkozy 's election would give new impetus to the european union project , which faltered after french -lrb- and dutch -rrb- voters rejected the draft eu-constitution in a referendum . spanish daily el país mirrored the widespread opinion that sarkozy 's victory " reflects a desire for change , and comes at the hands of an authentic revolution in french politics . "
the commentator was suspicious of sarkozy 's propensity for populism , but also noted with satisfaction that he " has not passed through the grandes écoles from whence most of the french elites have come . "
sarkozy 's election also indicates that " french society has moved to the right , " and that " le pen has contaminated all of french politics . "
the editorialist believed that " europe has waited a long time on france , and they can wait a little longer until june , when this country , which is key to europe , recovers much of its intellectual , social and economic vitality " following what the editorial opined will be another victory for the conservative camp at the parliamentary polls .
" sarkozy sympathizes with spain , " the daily paper wrote , and " as minister of the interior , he acted with total support and loyalty . "
that is why , in the view of the spanish editorialist , " spain and -lrb- spanish president josé luis rodríguez -rrb- zapatero have a perfectly viable ally . " finally , italian journalist massimo nava , author of an essay on nicolas sarkozy , evaluated the french election campaign for italian daily corriere della sera .
like most of his european counterparts , nava was of the opinion " the new french revolution has begun . "
he wrote that " sarkozy has disinhibited the right , freeing it from its complexes . "
furthermore , " he has swung the national front voters away from le pen and could become the blair of the european right . "

editorialists noted a rightward shift - some with satisfaction , others with suspicion . french editorialists across the board were full of praise for this year 's electoral process in france , which saw unprecedented voter turnout during both rounds of presidential voting and a decisive victory for former interior minister nicolas sarkozy .
but french papers were divided over the outcome of the vote . in the french daily le figaro , nicolas beytout doted on the " brilliant election of nicolas sarkozy . "
the campaign " has been exceptionally active and controversial , with massive participation in the first and second rounds , " and it " will certainly leave a permanent mark on the country 's history , " beytout wrote .
at the same time , he observed that the french right won " a score against the left that has n't been reached since general de gaulle . "
noting that for the first time in three decades , french voters elected a candidate from the outgoing camp -lrb- outgoing president jacques chirac and sarkozy both belong to the conservative ump party -rrb- , the editorialist opined that " gone are the days of systematic alternation , that frenzied back-and-forth that all too often has seen the country do and then undo that which it just created . "
as for socialist candidate ségolène royal , beytout wrote that she lost by a wide margin chiefly because " she was chosen by her own party based more on her personality than on the maturity of her project . "
france is ready for change , and the paper called sarkozy 's campaign " a victory for movement . " meanwhile , the french daily libération was not so excited about sarkozy 's victory .
despite a clear preference for the socialist candidate , laurent joffrin wrote that " france made a clean choice . "
the editorialist said sarkozy " is a legitimate president , " and that the campaign was " dignified , passionate and civil to the highest degree . "
but joffrin was concerned about sarkozy 's stated goal of " reconciling france with the dominant norm of conservative liberalism , " and wondered whether sarkozy is a " thatcher sans petticoat ? "
the editorialist conceded that the " values of competition " demand the modernization of france , but that " the values of solidarity and justice remain " as a programmatic building block for the socialist party .
" the cherry season will return , " joffrin concluded , but " for the time being , it 's pit season .
take courage . " german newspapers were hopeful that sarkozy would bring about badly needed changes in france , but also worried that he might embark on a unilateral crusade if his party wins the upcoming parliamentary elections , as well . the online edition of the popular german magazine der spiegel observed that french voters elected what they perceived as " the candidate who has announced a new beginning , a change , even a ' break ' with hardened traditions " following " the leaden times of twelve years of ' chiraquie . " '
but the editorialist , stefan simons , went on to question the integrity of sarkozy 's campaign promises : " whoops , hold on a minute , and what about the last five years ? " he asked .
as former interior minister , " was n't he -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- - number three in the government - also responsible for the slow decline of the nation ? "
the " perfect feat " of sarkozy 's campaign , according to simons , was that his team was able to " refashion jacques chirac 's long-time minister as a ' newcomer , ' an outsider , even something of an opposition leader . "
simons was concerned over sarkozy 's courting the far-right vote , saying that he " has made the slogans of -lrb- far-right -rrb- front national-leader jean-marie le pen acceptable in mainstream discourse . "
the parliamentary elections in june , so the editorialist , will prove whether sarkozy is really interested in national unity , as he has said , or whether france will be ruled by " sarkozy the terminator . " spanish observers were hopeful that sarkozy 's election would give new impetus to the european union project , which faltered after french -lrb- and dutch -rrb- voters rejected the draft eu-constitution in a referendum . spanish daily el país mirrored the widespread opinion that sarkozy 's victory " reflects a desire for change , and comes at the hands of an authentic revolution in french politics . "
the commentator was suspicious of sarkozy 's propensity for populism , but also noted with satisfaction that he " has not passed through the grandes écoles from whence most of the french elites have come . "
sarkozy 's election also indicates that " french society has moved to the right , " and that " le pen has contaminated all of french politics . "
the editorialist believed that " europe has waited a long time on france , and they can wait a little longer until june , when this country , which is key to europe , recovers much of its intellectual , social and economic vitality " following what the editorial opined will be another victory for the conservative camp at the parliamentary polls .
" sarkozy sympathizes with spain , " the daily paper wrote , and " as minister of the interior , he acted with total support and loyalty . "
that is why , in the view of the spanish editorialist , " spain and -lrb- spanish president josé luis rodríguez -rrb- zapatero have a perfectly viable ally . " finally , italian journalist massimo nava , author of an essay on nicolas sarkozy , evaluated the french election campaign for italian daily corriere della sera .
like most of his european counterparts , nava was of the opinion " the new french revolution has begun . "
he wrote that " sarkozy has disinhibited the right , freeing it from its complexes . "
furthermore , " he has swung the national front voters away from le pen and could become the blair of the european right . "
meanwhile , ségolène royal " has shrunk the far-left to a minimum and freed the left from its archaisms and heavy machinery .

but joffrin was concerned about sarkozy 's stated goal of " reconciling france with the dominant norm of conservative liberalism , " and wondered whether sarkozy is a " thatcher sans petticoat ? "
the editorialist conceded that the " values of competition " demand the modernization of france , but that " the values of solidarity and justice remain " as a programmatic building block for the socialist party .
" the cherry season will return , " joffrin concluded , but " for the time being , it 's pit season .
take courage . " german newspapers were hopeful that sarkozy would bring about badly needed changes in france , but also worried that he might embark on a unilateral crusade if his party wins the upcoming parliamentary elections , as well . the online edition of the popular german magazine der spiegel observed that french voters elected what they perceived as " the candidate who has announced a new beginning , a change , even a ' break ' with hardened traditions " following " the leaden times of twelve years of ' chiraquie . " '
but the editorialist , stefan simons , went on to question the integrity of sarkozy 's campaign promises : " whoops , hold on a minute , and what about the last five years ? " he asked .
as former interior minister , " was n't he -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- - number three in the government - also responsible for the slow decline of the nation ? "
the " perfect feat " of sarkozy 's campaign , according to simons , was that his team was able to " refashion jacques chirac 's long-time minister as a ' newcomer , ' an outsider , even something of an opposition leader . "
simons was concerned over sarkozy 's courting the far-right vote , saying that he " has made the slogans of -lrb- far-right -rrb- front national-leader jean-marie le pen acceptable in mainstream discourse . "
the parliamentary elections in june , so the editorialist , will prove whether sarkozy is really interested in national unity , as he has said , or whether france will be ruled by " sarkozy the terminator . " spanish observers were hopeful that sarkozy 's election would give new impetus to the european union project , which faltered after french -lrb- and dutch -rrb- voters rejected the draft eu-constitution in a referendum . spanish daily el país mirrored the widespread opinion that sarkozy 's victory " reflects a desire for change , and comes at the hands of an authentic revolution in french politics . "
the commentator was suspicious of sarkozy 's propensity for populism , but also noted with satisfaction that he " has not passed through the grandes écoles from whence most of the french elites have come . "
sarkozy 's election also indicates that " french society has moved to the right , " and that " le pen has contaminated all of french politics . "
the editorialist believed that " europe has waited a long time on france , and they can wait a little longer until june , when this country , which is key to europe , recovers much of its intellectual , social and economic vitality " following what the editorial opined will be another victory for the conservative camp at the parliamentary polls .
" sarkozy sympathizes with spain , " the daily paper wrote , and " as minister of the interior , he acted with total support and loyalty . "
that is why , in the view of the spanish editorialist , " spain and -lrb- spanish president josé luis rodríguez -rrb- zapatero have a perfectly viable ally . " finally , italian journalist massimo nava , author of an essay on nicolas sarkozy , evaluated the french election campaign for italian daily corriere della sera .
like most of his european counterparts , nava was of the opinion " the new french revolution has begun . "
he wrote that " sarkozy has disinhibited the right , freeing it from its complexes . "
furthermore , " he has swung the national front voters away from le pen and could become the blair of the european right . "
meanwhile , ségolène royal " has shrunk the far-left to a minimum and freed the left from its archaisms and heavy machinery .

less than a decade later , young punks in london would literally fight each other to get to the front of a sex pistols gig on the off chance of getting spat on by johnny rotten or having sid vicious break his bass over their heads .
music genres such as rock and punk are fuelled by the chemistry between the simmering malevolence on stage and the unleashed mayhem in the crowd .
the energy created by confrontational artists and willing victims is the stuff of legend .
it is this type of sado-masochistic , love-hate relationship which separates the edgy from the cozy - which is why you 'll never get bottles of urine thrown on stage at a take that concert .

it seems that the commitment of austrian fans has been relayed to the new superstar but he has yet to acknowledge them or even throw an insult in their direction .
the fan site almost collapsed under the amount of supporters logging on during and after the final but neither an acknowledgement nor accusation of dubious parentage has come from the bobbelsche 's finely pursed lips .

mark 's proclamation to his fans that " i love you all so f * * * ing much " could quite easily be taken as an over-enthusiastic cry of thanks but referring to his audience as " a bunch of dirty bastards " requires deeper analysis to find the remotest appreciation of their efforts .
" since i saw mark for the first time , i can no longer imagine my life without him , " wrote one fan on the superstar 's internet fan site .
" i cry if i see him on the tv and am moved profoundly if i hear him talking . "

it seems so .
abusive star " just being himself " christian maier , the operator of the fan site , laughs off mark 's earthy attitude to his fans .

" when he calls us dirty bastards , it does n't mean anything .

" we were charged a lot more than those calling from germany , " he said .
" but we kept calling .

it seems that the commitment of austrian fans has been relayed to the new superstar but he has yet to acknowledge them or even throw an insult in their direction .
the fan site almost collapsed under the amount of supporters logging on during and after the final but neither an acknowledgement nor accusation of dubious parentage has come from the bobbelsche 's finely pursed lips .
" above all , we long to hear from mark and we hope that -lrb- dsds judge -rrb- dieter bohlen can help him to become a star , " said maier , almost wistfully .

mark medlock likes to chuck swear words at his devotees and ignore their attention - and they just crave more . it seems that adoration has no bounds when it comes to the idolization of rock stars and singers .
the more violent and abusive the star , the more the fans seem to love them .
when jim morrison abused an audience of thousands at a concert in miami in 1969 by shouting , " you 're all a bunch of f * * * ing slaves ! " the cheers for the outrageous doors frontman got even louder .
less than a decade later , young punks in london would literally fight each other to get to the front of a sex pistols gig on the off chance of getting spat on by johnny rotten or having sid vicious break his bass over their heads .
music genres such as rock and punk are fuelled by the chemistry between the simmering malevolence on stage and the unleashed mayhem in the crowd .
the energy created by confrontational artists and willing victims is the stuff of legend .
it is this type of sado-masochistic , love-hate relationship which separates the edgy from the cozy - which is why you 'll never get bottles of urine thrown on stage at a take that concert .
following in the footsteps of legends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luckily medlock has n't copied jim morrison 's " snake " act but that could all change if housewives ' favorite and teeny lust object mark " bobbelsche " medlock gets his way .

köhler also rejected the plea of fellow former raf terrorist birgit hogefeld .
" the federal president has decided to refrain from granting clemency to mr. christian klar , " a statement from köhler 's office said .
köhler announced on friday , shortly after meeting with klar - who was convicted in 1982 for his role in a series of raf killings - that he would decide on the former terrorist 's bid for freedom in the coming days .
the president 's announcement caused an outcry in chancellor angela merkel ’ s christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with some members calling for köhler to be denied the chance to stand for a second term in 2009 should he approve klar 's release .
the outcry prompted the chancellor to call for the attacks on köhler to stop and for the office and role of the president to be respected .
a number of prominent conservative and opposition politicians supported her statements .
no remorse , no release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public and political opposition to klar 's release has been fierce there has been strong opposition in germany to klar 's premature release , not least because he and other members of the red army faction , better known outside germany as the baader-meinhoff gang , refuse to this day to reveal details of the killings .

editorialists noted a rightward shift - some with satisfaction , others with suspicion . french editorialists across the board were full of praise for this year 's electoral process in france , which saw unprecedented voter turnout during both rounds of presidential voting and a decisive victory for former interior minister nicolas sarkozy .
but french papers were divided over the outcome of the vote . in the french daily le figaro , nicolas beytout doted on the " brilliant election of nicolas sarkozy . "
the campaign " has been exceptionally active and controversial , with massive participation in the first and second rounds , " and it " will certainly leave a permanent mark on the country 's history , " beytout wrote .
at the same time , he observed that the french right won " a score against the left that has n't been reached since general de gaulle . "
noting that for the first time in three decades , french voters elected a candidate from the outgoing camp -lrb- outgoing president jacques chirac and sarkozy both belong to the conservative ump party -rrb- , the editorialist opined that " gone are the days of systematic alternation , that frenzied back-and-forth that all too often has seen the country do and then undo that which it just created . "
as for socialist candidate ségolène royal , beytout wrote that she lost by a wide margin chiefly because " she was chosen by her own party based more on her personality than on the maturity of her project . "
france is ready for change , and the paper called sarkozy 's campaign " a victory for movement . " meanwhile , the french daily libération was not so excited about sarkozy 's victory .
despite a clear preference for the socialist candidate , laurent joffrin wrote that " france made a clean choice . "
the editorialist said sarkozy " is a legitimate president , " and that the campaign was " dignified , passionate and civil to the highest degree . "
but joffrin was concerned about sarkozy 's stated goal of " reconciling france with the dominant norm of conservative liberalism , " and wondered whether sarkozy is a " thatcher sans petticoat ? "
the editorialist conceded that the " values of competition " demand the modernization of france , but that " the values of solidarity and justice remain " as a programmatic building block for the socialist party .
" the cherry season will return , " joffrin concluded , but " for the time being , it 's pit season .
take courage . " german newspapers were hopeful that sarkozy would bring about badly needed changes in france , but also worried that he might embark on a unilateral crusade if his party wins the upcoming parliamentary elections , as well . the online edition of the popular german magazine der spiegel observed that french voters elected what they perceived as " the candidate who has announced a new beginning , a change , even a ' break ' with hardened traditions " following " the leaden times of twelve years of ' chiraquie . " '
but the editorialist , stefan simons , went on to question the integrity of sarkozy 's campaign promises : " whoops , hold on a minute , and what about the last five years ? " he asked .
as former interior minister , " was n't he -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- - number three in the government - also responsible for the slow decline of the nation ? "
the " perfect feat " of sarkozy 's campaign , according to simons , was that his team was able to " refashion jacques chirac 's long-time minister as a ' newcomer , ' an outsider , even something of an opposition leader . "
simons was concerned over sarkozy 's courting the far-right vote , saying that he " has made the slogans of -lrb- far-right -rrb- front national-leader jean-marie le pen acceptable in mainstream discourse . "
the parliamentary elections in june , so the editorialist , will prove whether sarkozy is really interested in national unity , as he has said , or whether france will be ruled by " sarkozy the terminator . " spanish observers were hopeful that sarkozy 's election would give new impetus to the european union project , which faltered after french -lrb- and dutch -rrb- voters rejected the draft eu-constitution in a referendum . spanish daily el país mirrored the widespread opinion that sarkozy 's victory " reflects a desire for change , and comes at the hands of an authentic revolution in french politics . "
the commentator was suspicious of sarkozy 's propensity for populism , but also noted with satisfaction that he " has not passed through the grandes écoles from whence most of the french elites have come . "
sarkozy 's election also indicates that " french society has moved to the right , " and that " le pen has contaminated all of french politics . "
the editorialist believed that " europe has waited a long time on france , and they can wait a little longer until june , when this country , which is key to europe , recovers much of its intellectual , social and economic vitality " following what the editorial opined will be another victory for the conservative camp at the parliamentary polls .
" sarkozy sympathizes with spain , " the daily paper wrote , and " as minister of the interior , he acted with total support and loyalty . "
that is why , in the view of the spanish editorialist , " spain and -lrb- spanish president josé luis rodríguez -rrb- zapatero have a perfectly viable ally . " finally , italian journalist massimo nava , author of an essay on nicolas sarkozy , evaluated the french election campaign for italian daily corriere della sera .
like most of his european counterparts , nava was of the opinion " the new french revolution has begun . "
he wrote that " sarkozy has disinhibited the right , freeing it from its complexes . "
furthermore , " he has swung the national front voters away from le pen and could become the blair of the european right . "

editorialists noted a rightward shift - some with satisfaction , others with suspicion . french editorialists across the board were full of praise for this year 's electoral process in france , which saw unprecedented voter turnout during both rounds of presidential voting and a decisive victory for former interior minister nicolas sarkozy .
but french papers were divided over the outcome of the vote . in the french daily le figaro , nicolas beytout doted on the " brilliant election of nicolas sarkozy . "
the campaign " has been exceptionally active and controversial , with massive participation in the first and second rounds , " and it " will certainly leave a permanent mark on the country 's history , " beytout wrote .
at the same time , he observed that the french right won " a score against the left that has n't been reached since general de gaulle . "
noting that for the first time in three decades , french voters elected a candidate from the outgoing camp -lrb- outgoing president jacques chirac and sarkozy both belong to the conservative ump party -rrb- , the editorialist opined that " gone are the days of systematic alternation , that frenzied back-and-forth that all too often has seen the country do and then undo that which it just created . "
as for socialist candidate ségolène royal , beytout wrote that she lost by a wide margin chiefly because " she was chosen by her own party based more on her personality than on the maturity of her project . "
france is ready for change , and the paper called sarkozy 's campaign " a victory for movement . " meanwhile , the french daily libération was not so excited about sarkozy 's victory .
despite a clear preference for the socialist candidate , laurent joffrin wrote that " france made a clean choice . "
the editorialist said sarkozy " is a legitimate president , " and that the campaign was " dignified , passionate and civil to the highest degree . "
but joffrin was concerned about sarkozy 's stated goal of " reconciling france with the dominant norm of conservative liberalism , " and wondered whether sarkozy is a " thatcher sans petticoat ? "
the editorialist conceded that the " values of competition " demand the modernization of france , but that " the values of solidarity and justice remain " as a programmatic building block for the socialist party .
" the cherry season will return , " joffrin concluded , but " for the time being , it 's pit season .
take courage . " german newspapers were hopeful that sarkozy would bring about badly needed changes in france , but also worried that he might embark on a unilateral crusade if his party wins the upcoming parliamentary elections , as well . the online edition of the popular german magazine der spiegel observed that french voters elected what they perceived as " the candidate who has announced a new beginning , a change , even a ' break ' with hardened traditions " following " the leaden times of twelve years of ' chiraquie . " '
but the editorialist , stefan simons , went on to question the integrity of sarkozy 's campaign promises : " whoops , hold on a minute , and what about the last five years ? " he asked .
as former interior minister , " was n't he -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- - number three in the government - also responsible for the slow decline of the nation ? "
the " perfect feat " of sarkozy 's campaign , according to simons , was that his team was able to " refashion jacques chirac 's long-time minister as a ' newcomer , ' an outsider , even something of an opposition leader . "
simons was concerned over sarkozy 's courting the far-right vote , saying that he " has made the slogans of -lrb- far-right -rrb- front national-leader jean-marie le pen acceptable in mainstream discourse . "
the parliamentary elections in june , so the editorialist , will prove whether sarkozy is really interested in national unity , as he has said , or whether france will be ruled by " sarkozy the terminator . " spanish observers were hopeful that sarkozy 's election would give new impetus to the european union project , which faltered after french -lrb- and dutch -rrb- voters rejected the draft eu-constitution in a referendum . spanish daily el país mirrored the widespread opinion that sarkozy 's victory " reflects a desire for change , and comes at the hands of an authentic revolution in french politics . "
the commentator was suspicious of sarkozy 's propensity for populism , but also noted with satisfaction that he " has not passed through the grandes écoles from whence most of the french elites have come . "
sarkozy 's election also indicates that " french society has moved to the right , " and that " le pen has contaminated all of french politics . "
the editorialist believed that " europe has waited a long time on france , and they can wait a little longer until june , when this country , which is key to europe , recovers much of its intellectual , social and economic vitality " following what the editorial opined will be another victory for the conservative camp at the parliamentary polls .
" sarkozy sympathizes with spain , " the daily paper wrote , and " as minister of the interior , he acted with total support and loyalty . "
that is why , in the view of the spanish editorialist , " spain and -lrb- spanish president josé luis rodríguez -rrb- zapatero have a perfectly viable ally . " finally , italian journalist massimo nava , author of an essay on nicolas sarkozy , evaluated the french election campaign for italian daily corriere della sera .
like most of his european counterparts , nava was of the opinion " the new french revolution has begun . "
he wrote that " sarkozy has disinhibited the right , freeing it from its complexes . "
furthermore , " he has swung the national front voters away from le pen and could become the blair of the european right . "
meanwhile , ségolène royal " has shrunk the far-left to a minimum and freed the left from its archaisms and heavy machinery .

köhler will decide this week over klar 's possible release . after a weekend of unprecedented verbal attacks on the german president by her ministers , chancellor angela merkel called on sunday for an end to the harsh criticism arising from horst köhler ’ s decision to consider whether to grant clemency to a former red army faction guerrilla after 24 years in prison .
köhler announced on friday , shortly after meeting with christian klar - who was convicted in 1982 for his role a series of raf killings - that he would decide on the former terrorist 's bid for freedom in the coming days .
the president 's announcement caused an outcry in merkel ’ s christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with some members calling for köhler to be denied the chance to stand for a second term in 2009 should he approve klar 's release .
merkel calls for respect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called for an end to the criticism of köhler this prompted the chancellor to release a statement calling for restraint as the criticism reached a crescendo over the weekend .
" respect for the office and person of the president must always be protected , " merkel said .
" i ask that we all , regardless of how the president decides in the end , respect the decision of horst köhler .
" -lrb- there is -rrb- no doubt that the president will handle this difficult and controversial issue after careful examination in a very conscientious way , " she added .
merkel 's words were echoed by her interior minister , wolfgang schäuble , who added : " the president and the president alone has the right to make these decisions .
he has the highest responsibility and special obligation to decide and everyone must respect that . "
the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- leader guido westerwelle also joined in with the condemnation of the criticism .
" while all opinion is allowed and in fact encouraged in this debate , the level of this criticism aimed at the federal president is absolutely unacceptable . "
he added that he expected more respect from the members of the csu who had led the attacks on köhler and by doing so had put the president and the constitution under pressure .
however , westerwelle also took the opportunity to restate his own views on klar 's potential release by saying that he should not be pardoned until he showed remorse for his actions . green party co-chairperson claudia roth also condemned the criticism and voiced her support for a pardon .
" in our constitutional state , we do not operate on revenge but reintegration , " roth said .
" the csu has no respect for horst köhler the person , and it ignores his presidential position . "
she added that the criticism over köhler ’ s meeting with klar was unfounded .
" it is important and correct that -lrb- köhler -rrb- meets with klar and holds a personal conversation with him to get his own picture of the man . "
csu hardliners talk of withdrawing support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein said klar should remian behind bars the attacks against köhler were led by senior csu politicians , including günther beckstein , the bavarian state interior minister .
beckstein said that a criminal like klar belonged behind bars and added : " it is my view of justice that a criminal who does not confess is undeserving of clemency . "
csu member of parliament andreas scheuer went further , saying , " if the federal president uses his power to pardon klar then i will have to seriously consider whether the president will have my future support . "
in the event of a presidential pardon , scheuer urged the german government not to countersign .
" this would send out a clear message that the german government does not agree with the president ’ s decision , " he said .
the move to release klar is also strongly opposed by most of the families of his victims .
klar hopes for early release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar is eligible for release in 2009 klar , 54 , has served more than 24 years of a life term for his role in several murders committed at the end of the 1970s with the urban guerrilla group .
he was jailed for a series of killings , including the shooting of federal prosecutor siegfried buback , during the raf 's violent campaign against what it called the oppressive capitalist west german state and elite in the 1970s and early 1980s .
klar is eligible for early release in 2009 but has appealed for clemency to get out sooner as it is rare for criminals to spend more than 20 years in prison in germany .

köhler will decide this week over klar 's possible release . after a weekend of unprecedented verbal attacks on the german president by her ministers , chancellor angela merkel called on sunday for an end to the harsh criticism arising from horst köhler ’ s decision to consider whether to grant clemency to a former red army faction guerrilla after 24 years in prison .
köhler announced on friday , shortly after meeting with christian klar - who was convicted in 1982 for his role a series of raf killings - that he would decide on the former terrorist 's bid for freedom in the coming days .
the president 's announcement caused an outcry in merkel ’ s christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with some members calling for köhler to be denied the chance to stand for a second term in 2009 should he approve klar 's release .
merkel calls for respect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called for an end to the criticism of köhler this prompted the chancellor to release a statement calling for restraint as the criticism reached a crescendo over the weekend .
" respect for the office and person of the president must always be protected , " merkel said .
" i ask that we all , regardless of how the president decides in the end , respect the decision of horst köhler .
" -lrb- there is -rrb- no doubt that the president will handle this difficult and controversial issue after careful examination in a very conscientious way , " she added .
merkel 's words were echoed by her interior minister , wolfgang schäuble , who added : " the president and the president alone has the right to make these decisions .
he has the highest responsibility and special obligation to decide and everyone must respect that . "
the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- leader guido westerwelle also joined in with the condemnation of the criticism .
" while all opinion is allowed and in fact encouraged in this debate , the level of this criticism aimed at the federal president is absolutely unacceptable . "
he added that he expected more respect from the members of the csu who had led the attacks on köhler and by doing so had put the president and the constitution under pressure .
however , westerwelle also took the opportunity to restate his own views on klar 's potential release by saying that he should not be pardoned until he showed remorse for his actions . green party co-chairperson claudia roth also condemned the criticism and voiced her support for a pardon .
" in our constitutional state , we do not operate on revenge but reintegration , " roth said .
" the csu has no respect for horst köhler the person , and it ignores his presidential position . "
she added that the criticism over köhler ’ s meeting with klar was unfounded .
" it is important and correct that -lrb- köhler -rrb- meets with klar and holds a personal conversation with him to get his own picture of the man . "
csu hardliners talk of withdrawing support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein said klar should remian behind bars the attacks against köhler were led by senior csu politicians , including günther beckstein , the bavarian state interior minister .
beckstein said that a criminal like klar belonged behind bars and added : " it is my view of justice that a criminal who does not confess is undeserving of clemency . "
csu member of parliament andreas scheuer went further , saying , " if the federal president uses his power to pardon klar then i will have to seriously consider whether the president will have my future support . "
in the event of a presidential pardon , scheuer urged the german government not to countersign .
" this would send out a clear message that the german government does not agree with the president ’ s decision , " he said .
the move to release klar is also strongly opposed by most of the families of his victims .
klar hopes for early release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar is eligible for release in 2009 klar , 54 , has served more than 24 years of a life term for his role in several murders committed at the end of the 1970s with the urban guerrilla group .
he was jailed for a series of killings , including the shooting of federal prosecutor siegfried buback , during the raf 's violent campaign against what it called the oppressive capitalist west german state and elite in the 1970s and early 1980s .
klar is eligible for early release in 2009 but has appealed for clemency to get out sooner as it is rare for criminals to spend more than 20 years in prison in germany .

merkel congratulates sarkozy , hopes for stronger ties police , protesters battle after sarkozy win conservative sarkozy is france 's next president elections -pipe- 07.05.2007 opinion : sarkozy 's win means european uncertainty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in electing nicolas sarkozy on sunday , the french voted for national reform .
but dw 's anke hagedorn says france 's european partners may have little reason to cheer a nationalistically inclined leader in paris . nicolas sarkozy has emerged triumphant in an election that pitted the right against the left , and a man against france 's first-ever female presidential candidate .
the vote attracted far more voters to the polls than in recent years .
the majority cast their ballots for a conservative who favors economic liberalism , a reduction in france 's gigantic state bureaucracy and limitations on immigration . sarkozy succeeded in attracting voters away from far-right candidate jean-marie le pen .
and he made the french electorate forget that under conservative leadership france has amassed the highest unemployment in the euro zone and a record level of government debt . french voters were given the choice between a cool , calculating political professional in sarkozy and an emotional , relative newcomer in socialist segolene royal .
royal and the socialists failed to convince the majority that they had any real plans to solve france 's problems . but what can europeans expect from sarkozy 's presidency ?
certainly not that he will come up with concrete solutions to european problems .
he hardly mentioned the eu in his campaign .
and when he did , the tone was one of what the eu could do for france , and not vice versa . sarkozy has a reputation of being power-hungry and reluctant to listen to advice , and in the past , he has repeatedly played the nationalist trump card .
for instance , sarkozy did n't exactly endear himself to germans by bringing up world war ii and the holocaust on a number of occasions during the campaign . sarkozy was trying to play on french national pride .
at a campaign rally in marseille , he gleefully pointed out that not all french people supported the nazi-installed occupation government during world war ii .
" there were also the heroes of a free france , " sarkozy crowed , " and the résistance . " to underscore that message , he staged his last rally at a symbolic site of the french resistance , the plateau des glières , promising , if elected , to make an annual pilgrimage there .
but how can an obsession with history help a president who has pledged to lead france into a new era ? france 's neighbors can only hope that this was empty campaign chest-thumping , and that sarkozy will remember his european responsibilities when france assumes the eu 's rotating presidency in june of next year . in his first speech after winning sunday 's election , sarkozy said he has always been a committed european .
the rest of europe now waits to see if deeds will follow those words . anke hagedorn -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police , protesters battle after sarkozy win demonstrators in city suburbs across france threw rocks and bottles as conservative nicolas sarkozy won the country 's presidential election .
police moved in with tear gas and made scores of arrests .
-lrb- 07.05.2007 -rrb- merkel congratulates sarkozy , hopes for stronger ties german chancellor angela merkel said she hoped french president-elect nicolas sarkozy would strengthen the french-german axis at the heart of the european union .

but employers are nervous . the group of eight labor ministers , representing the world 's leading industrialized nations plus russia , convened on monday for a two-day meeting in dresden , germany . there , a new buzzword has emerged : " corporate social responsibility " - or csr for short . the idea behind this somewhat ambiguous , perhaps even euphemistic term is that big businesses - especially those operating on a global scale - should " integrate social and environmental issues into their business activities , " in the official wording of the european union commission . " economy , ecology and social action have to be carried out in a way that is fair and balanced , " german minister of labor and social affairs franz müntefering wrote in the pre-released text of a tuesday speech to his g8 colleagues .
müntefering is concurrently vice-chancellor in the cabinet of angela merkel , who currently controls the rotating eu presidency . whose responsibility is it , anyway ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will shoulder the social and environmental burden ?
the idea has rattled the nerves of business representatives , who fear that the government wants to rid itself of its own social responsibilities .
renate hornung-draus of the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- told the g8 that social commitments in the business sector " should n't be seen as a substitute for government action . " meanwhile , the german confederation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- has demanded regulations that would set out basic requirements for corporate social responsibility .
dgb chairman michael sommer told the german news service dpa that " the spoils of globalization should benefit all , not just a few " people , a statement that hornung-draus has echoed . müntefering defended csr , arguing that a socially responsible process of globalization would bring about widespread prosperity , which in turn would elicit a more accepting attitude from globalization 's skeptics . " we have to share this insight with the world : social action is a strong economic force . " but the anti-globalization network attac has accused müntefering of glossing over reality .
" in fact , the german government is enacting cutbacks to social standards - at home and worldwide , " the activists wrote in a press release .
any way you look at it - in the g8 , the eu or at the federal level - the government has been " instrumental to advancing the neoliberal globalization in the interest of corporate groups , " attac claims . different standards in china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shoe factory in china , where labor practices can be very different than in the west minimum social standards are particularly problematic for enterprises with production sites in developing countries .

" on the one hand , they -lrb- western corporations -rrb- want to take advantage of the cost benefits china has to offer , which result from its low wage , social and environmental standards . "
but , the author writes , companies active in china are under constant pressure from markets and the public to " protect the reputation of their brands . " the core question , according to author schoenheit , is this : " do the same principles and criteria apply to europe and china ? " contradicting approaches in europe even inside the european union , there seems to be no consensus over how to encourage more social action from business leaders .
a study commissioned by the bertelsmann foundation , germany 's largest private non-profit organization , examines the approaches of various eu-countries to csr , and finds that there is no unified concept . sweden , the united kingdom and the netherlands are at the forefront of corporate responsibility , the study finds .
in denmark , larger companies are required to present an annual environmental report to the government .
and in france , the government has put similar regulations in place , although many businesses have lobbied to remove some of them . germany , on the other hand , is behind the times , the study says .
" no strategy , no contact persons , no transparency .

but employers are nervous . the group of eight labor ministers , representing the world 's leading industrialized nations plus russia , convened on monday for a two-day meeting in dresden , germany . there , a new buzzword has emerged : " corporate social responsibility " - or csr for short . the idea behind this somewhat ambiguous , perhaps even euphemistic term is that big businesses - especially those operating on a global scale - should " integrate social and environmental issues into their business activities , " in the official wording of the european union commission . " economy , ecology and social action have to be carried out in a way that is fair and balanced , " german minister of labor and social affairs franz müntefering wrote in the pre-released text of a tuesday speech to his g8 colleagues .

french voters rejected the draft constitution in a referendum in 2005.german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said shortly after sarkozy 's victory on sunday that he hoped berlin and paris would work closely together on " important european projects " under the incoming french president .
" i hope for a close german-french partnership , " steinmeier , a social democrat , said after right-wing sarkozy won sunday 's presidential election to succeed jacques chirac .
" of course i hope the cooperation will lead to progress on important european projects , " he added in a reference to the european union 's moribund draft constitution .
in a speech directly following the announcement that he won the country 's highest electoral office by a comfortable margin , sarkozy addressed france 's international agenda .
' our destiny is linked ' " i want to launch a call to our european partners , with whom our destiny is deeply linked , to tell them that i have been european all my life , that i believe deeply , that i believe sincerely , in european construction , and that tonight france is back in europe .
i beseech our european partners to hear the voices of people who want to be protected . "
another phone call came from european commission president jose manuel barroso , who congratulated sarkozy and said he was hopeful the new leader of france could help end the eu 's institutional woes .

" the united states and france are historic allies and partners .
president bush looks forward to working with president-elect sarkozy as we continue our strong alliance , " gordon johndroe , spokesman for the white house national security council , told afp . warning on warming following his victory , sarkozy pledged that the united states can count on a friendship with france , which " will always be at their side when they need help . " since a much-publicized us trip in september 2006 , sarkozy has fought against charges that he pandered to bush and the perception that he is too pro-american , a quality seen as unpopular with french voters . ' friendship is accepting difference ' addressing the crowd after his victory on sunday evening , he tried to get some distance form that image . " i want to tell -lrb- the united states -rrb- that france will always be by their side when they will need her .
but i want to tell them as well that friendship is accepting that one 's friends can act differently , and that a great nation like the united states has the duty to not obstruct the fight against global warming but on the contrary to head this struggle .
because what is at stake is the future of all humanity , " sarkozy said in his victory speech .

but employers are nervous . the group of eight labor ministers , representing the world 's leading industrialized nations plus russia , convened on monday for a two-day meeting in dresden , germany . there , a new buzzword has emerged : " corporate social responsibility " - or csr for short . the idea behind this somewhat ambiguous , perhaps even euphemistic term is that big businesses - especially those operating on a global scale - should " integrate social and environmental issues into their business activities , " in the official wording of the european union commission . " economy , ecology and social action have to be carried out in a way that is fair and balanced , " german minister of labor and social affairs franz müntefering wrote in the pre-released text of a tuesday speech to his g8 colleagues .
müntefering is concurrently vice-chancellor in the cabinet of angela merkel , who currently controls the rotating eu presidency . whose responsibility is it , anyway ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will shoulder the social and environmental burden ?
the idea has rattled the nerves of business representatives , who fear that the government wants to rid itself of its own social responsibilities .
renate hornung-draus of the confederation of german employers ' associations -lrb- bda -rrb- told the g8 that social commitments in the business sector " should n't be seen as a substitute for government action . " meanwhile , the german confederation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- has demanded regulations that would set out basic requirements for corporate social responsibility .
dgb chairman michael sommer told the german news service dpa that " the spoils of globalization should benefit all , not just a few " people , a statement that hornung-draus has echoed . müntefering defended csr , arguing that a socially responsible process of globalization would bring about widespread prosperity , which in turn would elicit a more accepting attitude from globalization 's skeptics . " we have to share this insight with the world : social action is a strong economic force . " but the anti-globalization network attac has accused müntefering of glossing over reality .
" in fact , the german government is enacting cutbacks to social standards - at home and worldwide , " the activists wrote in a press release .
any way you look at it - in the g8 , the eu or at the federal level - the government has been " instrumental to advancing the neoliberal globalization in the interest of corporate groups , " attac claims . different standards in china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shoe factory in china , where labor practices can be very different than in the west minimum social standards are particularly problematic for enterprises with production sites in developing countries .
there , western companies face enormous problems , including extreme poverty , inadequate medical care , corruption , child labor , sub-standard education and the absence of worker 's rights or meaningful environmental safeguards , to name a few . ingo schoenheit , managing director of the university of hanover 's institute for market / environment / society , exemplifies the difficulty of conducting business in developing countries in a recent book on corporate social responsibility in china . " on the one hand , they -lrb- western corporations -rrb- want to take advantage of the cost benefits china has to offer , which result from its low wage , social and environmental standards . "
but , the author writes , companies active in china are under constant pressure from markets and the public to " protect the reputation of their brands . " the core question , according to author schoenheit , is this : " do the same principles and criteria apply to europe and china ? " contradicting approaches in europe even inside the european union , there seems to be no consensus over how to encourage more social action from business leaders .
a study commissioned by the bertelsmann foundation , germany 's largest private non-profit organization , examines the approaches of various eu-countries to csr , and finds that there is no unified concept . sweden , the united kingdom and the netherlands are at the forefront of corporate responsibility , the study finds .
in denmark , larger companies are required to present an annual environmental report to the government .
and in france , the government has put similar regulations in place , although many businesses have lobbied to remove some of them . germany , on the other hand , is behind the times , the study says .
" no strategy , no contact persons , no transparency .
the -lrb- german -rrb- federal government has a lot to catch up on . " however , germany also demonstrates that csr may be possible without potentially inhibiting state regulations .

the blast occurred at about 1125 gmt close to the village of luka on a section south of the ukrainian capital kiev , tearing out a 30-meter -lrb- 32-yards -rrb- length of pipeline and hurling debris 150 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- , she said .
" it 's one of the most serious accidents in recent years , " an official from the ukrainian state gas company naftogaz told afp on condition of anonymity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the explosion tore out a 32-yard section of pipeline the official said the blast was likely due to a technical fault .
emergency services put out a fire at the scene and investigators were working to uncover the cause of the explosion , naftogaz said in a statement .
the incident immediately raised fears of gas shortfalls in europe , which relies heavily on russian supplies , but russia 's gas exporting monopoly gazprom quickly assured that deliveries would still reach clients .
assurances " there will be no disruption in supplies to our consumers .
our export supplies will continue at full volume , " sergei kupriyanov , a spokesman for gazprom , said on state television .
naftogaz also promised there would be no disruptions .
" ukraine 's commitments on transit of natural gas to european customers are being completely respected , " a company statement said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western europe has been worried in the past about the dependability of russian natural gas supplies the emergency situations ministry initially said that gas supplies had been cut following the blast but later added that a bypass route was used to ensure continued supplies .
in poland , a spokesman for gas company pgnig said the early signs were positive .
" there was no disruption to gas supplies , " tomasz fill said .
" it is difficult to foresee the consequences of the explosion for poland .
we are waiting for official information from kiev . "
the urengoi-uzhgorod pipeline has a capacity of 27.9 billion cubic meters -lrb- bcm -rrb- of gas a year , interfax news agency reported - a sizeable share of the 87.8 bcm exported to western europe , according to 2002 figures from gazprom .
the pipeline runs more than 4,000 kilometres -lrb- 2,500 miles -rrb- from siberia .
biggest foreign market the european union is the biggest foreign gas market for russia , the world 's leading natural gas producer .
nearly all of ukraine 's energy imports come via russia .
the incident revived memories of gas shortfalls throughout western europe at the start of 2006 when gazprom cut off supplies through ukraine due to a pricing dispute with the ex-soviet republic .
the 2006 crisis sparked concerns in the west over the reliability of russia as a supplier and accusations that moscow is using its huge energy reserves as a weapon against weaker ex-soviet neighbors . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bitterly disputed german-russian gas pipeline heads for estonia a controversial pipeline to carry russian gas under the baltic sea to germany could run through estonian waters , an official from the consortium behind the project said on friday .

köhler will decide this week over klar 's possible release . after a weekend of unprecedented verbal attacks on the german president by her ministers , chancellor angela merkel called on sunday for an end to the harsh criticism arising from horst köhler ’ s decision to consider whether to grant clemency to a former red army faction guerrilla after 24 years in prison .
köhler announced on friday , shortly after meeting with christian klar - who was convicted in 1982 for his role a series of raf killings - that he would decide on the former terrorist 's bid for freedom in the coming days .
the president 's announcement caused an outcry in merkel ’ s christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with some members calling for köhler to be denied the chance to stand for a second term in 2009 should he approve klar 's release .
merkel calls for respect bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel called for an end to the criticism of köhler this prompted the chancellor to release a statement calling for restraint as the criticism reached a crescendo over the weekend .
" respect for the office and person of the president must always be protected , " merkel said .
" i ask that we all , regardless of how the president decides in the end , respect the decision of horst köhler .
" -lrb- there is -rrb- no doubt that the president will handle this difficult and controversial issue after careful examination in a very conscientious way , " she added .
merkel 's words were echoed by her interior minister , wolfgang schäuble , who added : " the president and the president alone has the right to make these decisions .
he has the highest responsibility and special obligation to decide and everyone must respect that . "
the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- leader guido westerwelle also joined in with the condemnation of the criticism .
" while all opinion is allowed and in fact encouraged in this debate , the level of this criticism aimed at the federal president is absolutely unacceptable . "
he added that he expected more respect from the members of the csu who had led the attacks on köhler and by doing so had put the president and the constitution under pressure .
however , westerwelle also took the opportunity to restate his own views on klar 's potential release by saying that he should not be pardoned until he showed remorse for his actions . green party co-chairperson claudia roth also condemned the criticism and voiced her support for a pardon .
" in our constitutional state , we do not operate on revenge but reintegration , " roth said .
" the csu has no respect for horst köhler the person , and it ignores his presidential position . "
she added that the criticism over köhler ’ s meeting with klar was unfounded .
" it is important and correct that -lrb- köhler -rrb- meets with klar and holds a personal conversation with him to get his own picture of the man . "
csu hardliners talk of withdrawing support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beckstein said klar should remian behind bars the attacks against köhler were led by senior csu politicians , including günther beckstein , the bavarian state interior minister .
beckstein said that a criminal like klar belonged behind bars and added : " it is my view of justice that a criminal who does not confess is undeserving of clemency . "
csu member of parliament andreas scheuer went further , saying , " if the federal president uses his power to pardon klar then i will have to seriously consider whether the president will have my future support . "
in the event of a presidential pardon , scheuer urged the german government not to countersign .
" this would send out a clear message that the german government does not agree with the president ’ s decision , " he said .
the move to release klar is also strongly opposed by most of the families of his victims .
klar hopes for early release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar is eligible for release in 2009 klar , 54 , has served more than 24 years of a life term for his role in several murders committed at the end of the 1970s with the urban guerrilla group .
he was jailed for a series of killings , including the shooting of federal prosecutor siegfried buback , during the raf 's violent campaign against what it called the oppressive capitalist west german state and elite in the 1970s and early 1980s .
klar is eligible for early release in 2009 but has appealed for clemency to get out sooner as it is rare for criminals to spend more than 20 years in prison in germany .

köhler also rejected the plea of fellow former raf terrorist birgit hogefeld .
" the federal president has decided to refrain from granting clemency to mr. christian klar , " a statement from köhler 's office said .
köhler announced on friday , shortly after meeting with klar - who was convicted in 1982 for his role in a series of raf killings - that he would decide on the former terrorist 's bid for freedom in the coming days .
the president 's announcement caused an outcry in chancellor angela merkel ’ s christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , with some members calling for köhler to be denied the chance to stand for a second term in 2009 should he approve klar 's release .
the outcry prompted the chancellor to call for the attacks on köhler to stop and for the office and role of the president to be respected .
a number of prominent conservative and opposition politicians supported her statements .
no remorse , no release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : public and political opposition to klar 's release has been fierce there has been strong opposition in germany to klar 's premature release , not least because he and other members of the red army faction , better known outside germany as the baader-meinhoff gang , refuse to this day to reveal details of the killings .

the blast occurred at about 1125 gmt close to the village of luka on a section south of the ukrainian capital kiev , tearing out a 30-meter -lrb- 32-yards -rrb- length of pipeline and hurling debris 150 meters -lrb- yards -rrb- , she said .
" it 's one of the most serious accidents in recent years , " an official from the ukrainian state gas company naftogaz told afp on condition of anonymity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the explosion tore out a 32-yard section of pipeline the official said the blast was likely due to a technical fault .
emergency services put out a fire at the scene and investigators were working to uncover the cause of the explosion , naftogaz said in a statement .
the incident immediately raised fears of gas shortfalls in europe , which relies heavily on russian supplies , but russia 's gas exporting monopoly gazprom quickly assured that deliveries would still reach clients .
assurances " there will be no disruption in supplies to our consumers .
our export supplies will continue at full volume , " sergei kupriyanov , a spokesman for gazprom , said on state television .
naftogaz also promised there would be no disruptions .
" ukraine 's commitments on transit of natural gas to european customers are being completely respected , " a company statement said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western europe has been worried in the past about the dependability of russian natural gas supplies the emergency situations ministry initially said that gas supplies had been cut following the blast but later added that a bypass route was used to ensure continued supplies .

" there was no disruption to gas supplies , " tomasz fill said .
" it is difficult to foresee the consequences of the explosion for poland .
we are waiting for official information from kiev . "
the urengoi-uzhgorod pipeline has a capacity of 27.9 billion cubic meters -lrb- bcm -rrb- of gas a year , interfax news agency reported - a sizeable share of the 87.8 bcm exported to western europe , according to 2002 figures from gazprom .
the pipeline runs more than 4,000 kilometres -lrb- 2,500 miles -rrb- from siberia .
biggest foreign market the european union is the biggest foreign gas market for russia , the world 's leading natural gas producer .
nearly all of ukraine 's energy imports come via russia .
the incident revived memories of gas shortfalls throughout western europe at the start of 2006 when gazprom cut off supplies through ukraine due to a pricing dispute with the ex-soviet republic .
the 2006 crisis sparked concerns in the west over the reliability of russia as a supplier and accusations that moscow is using its huge energy reserves as a weapon against weaker ex-soviet neighbors . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : bitterly disputed german-russian gas pipeline heads for estonia a controversial pipeline to carry russian gas under the baltic sea to germany could run through estonian waters , an official from the consortium behind the project said on friday .

scottish lib dem leader nicol stephen said the fundamental stumbling block was the nationalists ' demand for a referendum on independence .
snp deputy leader nicola sturgeon urged the lib dems to sit at the negotiating table in the interests of scotland .
she insisted there was no alternative to alex salmond as first minister .
mr stephen predicted there would now be an snp minority government at holyrood following thursday 's election .
earlier , the lib dems ruled out a coalition deal with labour .
' fundamental barrier ' the 47 seats won by the snp made them the largest party in the 129-member scottish parliament , but this falls short of a majority , for which 65 seats are needed .
labour won 46 seats , the conservatives 17 and the lib dems 16 , with the greens on two and one independent .
more than 100,000 ballots were counted as spoiled in the election and in one seat - cunninghame north - former labour minister allan wilson is considering a legal challenge after losing by 48 votes .
a lawyer is also preparing to contest the outcome of the glasgow region .
mr stephen said he had held talks with the snp leader alex salmond but these had failed to resolve their differences over the referendum .
in these circumstances it seems likely there will be a minority snp government nicol stephen " i made it clear to him that unless and until the snp removes the fundamental barrier of a referendum on independence during the next four years , there can be no coalition , " mr stephen added in a statement .
" we consistently stated to people across scotland at all times during the campaign that this was our position and it will not change .
" in these circumstances it seems likely there will be a minority snp government .
" the scottish liberal democrats will work constructively to promote our positive policies in the new parliament . "
' progressive coalition ' ms sturgeon said : " the snp is inviting the liberal democrats to get around the table to see if we can resolve the differences we have and build upon the things that we agree about .
" scotland voted for a new government last thursday and i think it is now incumbent on all parties to see if we can put together that new progressive coalition to take the country forward . "
she said there had been informal talks between mr salmond and mr stephen in which the snp leader had said there was scope for compromise on the independence issue .
the last eight years of the scottish parliament have seen scotland run by a labour-led coalition with the liberal democrats .

scottish lib dem leader nicol stephen said the fundamental stumbling block was the nationalists ' demand for a referendum on independence .
snp deputy leader nicola sturgeon urged the lib dems to sit at the negotiating table in the interests of scotland .
she insisted there was no alternative to alex salmond as first minister .
mr stephen predicted there would now be an snp minority government at holyrood following thursday 's election .
earlier , the lib dems ruled out a coalition deal with labour .
' fundamental barrier ' the 47 seats won by the snp made them the largest party in the 129-member scottish parliament , but this falls short of a majority , for which 65 seats are needed .
labour won 46 seats , the conservatives 17 and the lib dems 16 , with the greens on two and one independent .
more than 100,000 ballots were counted as spoiled in the election and in one seat - cunninghame north - former labour minister allan wilson is considering a legal challenge after losing by 48 votes .
a lawyer is also preparing to contest the outcome of the glasgow region .
mr stephen said he had held talks with the snp leader alex salmond but these had failed to resolve their differences over the referendum .
in these circumstances it seems likely there will be a minority snp government nicol stephen " i made it clear to him that unless and until the snp removes the fundamental barrier of a referendum on independence during the next four years , there can be no coalition , " mr stephen added in a statement .
" we consistently stated to people across scotland at all times during the campaign that this was our position and it will not change .
" in these circumstances it seems likely there will be a minority snp government .
" the scottish liberal democrats will work constructively to promote our positive policies in the new parliament . "
' progressive coalition ' ms sturgeon said : " the snp is inviting the liberal democrats to get around the table to see if we can resolve the differences we have and build upon the things that we agree about .
" scotland voted for a new government last thursday and i think it is now incumbent on all parties to see if we can put together that new progressive coalition to take the country forward . "
she said there had been informal talks between mr salmond and mr stephen in which the snp leader had said there was scope for compromise on the independence issue .
the last eight years of the scottish parliament have seen scotland run by a labour-led coalition with the liberal democrats .

the widening wealth gap could lead to a rise in birth rates , zhang weiqing , from the national population and family planning commission , told state media .
newly rich couples can afford to pay fines to have more than one child , while rural couples are marrying earlier , he told xinhua news agency .
china has about 1.3 billion people , 20 % of the world 's total .
it is keen to curb its population growth , and the controversial family planning policy , implemented in the late 1970s , is meant to limit urban couples to one child and rural families to two .
but rising incomes mean that some newly rich couples in urban areas can easily afford to break the rules and pay the resulting fines .
in fact , last month , a survey by the national population and family planning commission found that the number of rich people and celebrities having more than one child was on a rapid increase , and nearly 10 % of people in this category had three children .
rural trends in the countryside , too , the rules are being flouted .
china 's constitution says that men may marry at 22 and women at 20 , with late marriages and later childbearing encouraged .
but according to mr zhang , " early marriages are still prevailing in some parts of the country , especially in rural areas , which goes against the family planning policy " .
part of the reason why rural families refuse to comply is because of the traditional preference for sons .
experts say this preference has led to the under-reporting of female births , as well as abortion of female foetuses and female infanticide .
by the end of 2006 , china 's population stood at 1,314,480,000 , according to the national bureau of statistics , with males accounting for 51.5 % of the population .

the widening wealth gap could lead to a rise in birth rates , zhang weiqing , from the national population and family planning commission , told state media .
newly rich couples can afford to pay fines to have more than one child , while rural couples are marrying earlier , he told xinhua news agency .
china has about 1.3 billion people , 20 % of the world 's total .
it is keen to curb its population growth , and the controversial family planning policy , implemented in the late 1970s , is meant to limit urban couples to one child and rural families to two .
but rising incomes mean that some newly rich couples in urban areas can easily afford to break the rules and pay the resulting fines .
in fact , last month , a survey by the national population and family planning commission found that the number of rich people and celebrities having more than one child was on a rapid increase , and nearly 10 % of people in this category had three children .
rural trends in the countryside , too , the rules are being flouted .
china 's constitution says that men may marry at 22 and women at 20 , with late marriages and later childbearing encouraged .
but according to mr zhang , " early marriages are still prevailing in some parts of the country , especially in rural areas , which goes against the family planning policy " .
part of the reason why rural families refuse to comply is because of the traditional preference for sons .

kevin lamb wants to develop the garden as an educational and scientific institution with the extra money .
three years ago , the £ 43m attraction in carmarthenshire was within hours of having to call in administrators .
it was saved by a package of public funding , but this money will come to an end in 2009 .
the welsh assembly government , carmarthenshire council and the millennium commission pledged to put £ 1.5m into the garden as part of a five-year recovery strategy when it was in danger of closure in 2004 .
a new plan to take the garden on when this money comes to an end in 2009 has been implemented by mr lamb , who is hoping to see a 20,000 increase in visitor numbers between now and then . "
if the garden is here for education and science , those things cost and do n't necessarily generate the sorts of revenue needed to sustain " kevin lamb however , increased takings alone will not be enough to fund science and education projects , mr lamb told bbc radio 's eye on wales .
" we have a successful business strategy that is delivering revenue into the garden so the amount we need is far less as a proportion than botanic gardens elsewhere , " he said .
" but if the garden is here for education and science , those things cost and do n't necessarily generate the sorts of revenue needed to sustain . "
in 2006 , 120,000 visitors went through the turnstiles of the gardens at llanarthe .
these figures are forecast to increase further with the opening later this year of a tropical house designed by acclaimed welsh architect john belle .
plans by a pharmaceutical company to create more than 40 jobs when it moves to the purpose-built science centre in a few months have has also bolstered confidence at the gardens .
it is this success that has led carmarthenshire council chief executive mark james to believe that the issue of financial support should be re-visited by politicians .
" i think there 's far more realism around the table and a belief that we can work together and continue to work together to develop the gardens , " he told eye on wales .
mr lamb 's plans also have backing from the scientific world .
professor denis murphy , head of biotechnology at the university of glamorgan , said public money spent bolstering the garden 's science could help scientists study the effects of climate change in wales . " it might be that we 'll be looking at different kinds of plants growing in wales in the next 10 years , " he said .
" the garden really could contribute an awful lot to that .
that 's real good public work . "

kevin lamb wants to develop the garden as an educational and scientific institution with the extra money .
three years ago , the £ 43m attraction in carmarthenshire was within hours of having to call in administrators .
it was saved by a package of public funding , but this money will come to an end in 2009 .
the welsh assembly government , carmarthenshire council and the millennium commission pledged to put £ 1.5m into the garden as part of a five-year recovery strategy when it was in danger of closure in 2004 .
a new plan to take the garden on when this money comes to an end in 2009 has been implemented by mr lamb , who is hoping to see a 20,000 increase in visitor numbers between now and then .
if the garden is here for education and science , those things cost and do n't necessarily generate the sorts of revenue needed to sustain kevin lamb however , increased takings alone will not be enough to fund science and education projects , mr lamb told bbc radio 's eye on wales .
" we have a successful business strategy that is delivering revenue into the garden so the amount we need is far less as a proportion than botanic gardens elsewhere , " he said .
" but if the garden is here for education and science , those things cost and do n't necessarily generate the sorts of revenue needed to sustain . "
in 2006 , 120,000 visitors went through the turnstiles of the gardens at llanarthe .
these figures are forecast to increase further with the opening later this year of a tropical house designed by acclaimed welsh architect john belle .
plans by a pharmaceutical company to create more than 40 jobs when it moves to the purpose-built science centre in a few months have has also bolstered confidence at the gardens .
a glasshouse designed by john belle will open later this year it is this success that has led carmarthenshire council chief executive mark james to believe that the issue of financial support should be re-visited by politicians .
" i think there 's far more realism around the table and a belief that we can work together and continue to work together to develop the gardens , " he told eye on wales .
mr lamb 's plans also have backing from the scientific world .
professor denis murphy , head of biotechnology at the university of glamorgan , said public money spent bolstering the garden 's science could help scientists study the effects of climate change in wales . " it might be that we 'll be looking at different kinds of plants growing in wales in the next 10 years , " he said .
" the garden really could contribute an awful lot to that .
that 's real good public work . "

teams of viking wannabes are taking part in the seventh annual childline viking boat races .
the bank holiday event helps support the work of childline ni , which has recently joined forces with the nspcc .

their song , making your mind up , went to number one in nine countries , and was followed by hit singles including my camera never lies and land of make believe .
singer jay aston left in 1985 , a year after the band 's tour bus was involved in a horrific crash which seriously injured founder member mike nolan .
she was replaced by 21-year-old shelley preston , who still tours with original members nolan and cheryl baker as the original bucks fizz .
the group discuss their eurovision memories and how they reunited for peter kay 's comic relief video .
what are your memories of the eurovision song contest ?
cheryl : it was just manic .
we were only put together about eight weeks before the competition and we had to record the single , learn the routine , sort out our outfits , do all the press and promotion for it .
it was really non-stop .
what was the atmosphere in dublin like , where you scored your famous victory ?
mike : we were very protected over there .
we had police guards following us everywhere .
cheryl , mike and shelley tour as the original bucks fizz q : was that because of the security situation in ireland ?
cheryl : it was because we were british .
the ira had a big presence at the time and i think there 'd been some kind of attempt on the prime minister 's life so we had to stay in a separate hotel from everybody .
we would drive through red lights and around all the other traffic , as if we were the queen .
and stupidly , because we were young , we thought it was exciting .
did you think you would win ?
mike : my attitude when i got there was that we would walk it .
but when you rehearse for five days you get to know all the other songs , and by the night i was convinced we would come fifth .
cheryl : we won by four points - but only on the last votes .
and was it a gift or a curse ?
cheryl : a gift , definitely .
mike : sometimes you think : " i wish to god i 'd never done it " because people give you a hard time .
but in the end , if it had n't have happened we would n't be together .
the band 's original line-up scored nine top 20 hits shelley , you beat 1,400 other people to win a place in bucks fizz .
what was it like to suddenly be part of this famous pop group ?
shelley : the first thing we did was wogan , which was the biggest tv show around .
i 'd been kept in hiding for four or five weeks so people could n't find out who the new girl was .
cheryl : even her parents did n't know .
shelley : nobody was allowed to know because if any paper had printed who the new girl was , wogan was going to cancel .
i remember they put a blanket over my head , and carried me in past all the photographers so people could n't see who it was .
it sounds a bit like pop idol .
shelley : well , i did my apprenticeship back to front .
when i left the band i went off and learnt about songwriting and did backing vocals for people like inxs and michael bolton and went on tour with guns n ' roses .
bucks fizz reformed in 2005 for a 1980s retro tour do you still do the skirt-ripping routine when you perform making your mind up ?
shelley : yes , but we had to rework it because it 's just the three of us and mike has to take both our skirts off .
mike : it 's hard because if you pull with both arms at the same time you kind of grunt involuntarily .
so you ca n't sing .
cheryl : we could have pulled our own skirts off .
shelley : ca n't we just take his trousers off ?
you were reunited with the other two bucks fizz members for this year 's comic relief video with the proclaimers .
how did that come about ?
cheryl : they approached each of us individually .
i had n't seen jay since she left in 1985 .
it was quite difficult .
i just did n't know what to say .
but we actually got on fine after a while .
what do you think of scooch 's chances in this year 's eurovision ?
cheryl : i did n't think they were the best song .
shelley : they 're a novelty act , are n't they ?
mike : it does n't deserve to win but it would n't surprise me if they went off and won - it 's that bad .
bucks fizz release a greatest hits cd and dvd on 14 may .
they were talking to bbc news entertainment reporter mark savage .

their song , making your mind up , went to number one in nine countries , and was followed by hit singles including my camera never lies and land of make believe .
singer jay aston left in 1985 , a year after the band 's tour bus was involved in a horrific crash which seriously injured founder member mike nolan .
she was replaced by 21-year-old shelley preston , who still tours with original members nolan and cheryl baker as the original bucks fizz .
the group discuss their eurovision memories and how they reunited for peter kay 's comic relief video .
what are your memories of the eurovision song contest ?
cheryl : it was just manic .
we were only put together about eight weeks before the competition and we had to record the single , learn the routine , sort out our outfits , do all the press and promotion for it .
it was really non-stop .
what was the atmosphere in dublin like , where you scored your famous victory ?
mike : we were very protected over there .
we had police guards following us everywhere .
cheryl , mike and shelley tour as the original bucks fizz q : was that because of the security situation in ireland ?
cheryl : it was because we were british .
the ira had a big presence at the time and i think there 'd been some kind of attempt on the prime minister 's life so we had to stay in a separate hotel from everybody .
we would drive through red lights and around all the other traffic , as if we were the queen .
and stupidly , because we were young , we thought it was exciting .
did you think you would win ?
mike : my attitude when i got there was that we would walk it .
but when you rehearse for five days you get to know all the other songs , and by the night i was convinced we would come fifth .
cheryl : we won by four points - but only on the last votes .
and was it a gift or a curse ?
cheryl : a gift , definitely .
mike : sometimes you think : " i wish to god i 'd never done it " because people give you a hard time .
but in the end , if it had n't have happened we would n't be together .
the band 's original line-up scored nine top 20 hits shelley , you beat 1,400 other people to win a place in bucks fizz .
what was it like to suddenly be part of this famous pop group ?
shelley : the first thing we did was wogan , which was the biggest tv show around .
i 'd been kept in hiding for four or five weeks so people could n't find out who the new girl was .
cheryl : even her parents did n't know .
shelley : nobody was allowed to know because if any paper had printed who the new girl was , wogan was going to cancel .
i remember they put a blanket over my head , and carried me in past all the photographers so people could n't see who it was .
it sounds a bit like pop idol .

we are entering the age of the trillion but who apart from seasoned number crunchers knows what it is ?
mortgage debt in the uk is nearly a trillion pounds while computers can store terabytes .
yet making this number meaningful to ordinary people is a major challenge .
michael blastland , series producer for bbc radio 4 's more or less programme , and his team are rising to the challenge .
although there are still those who argue over the us and " former uk " definitions of figures such as a billion and trillion , according to michael there is now basic agreement that a trillion is a thousand billion and a billion is a thousand million .
" when you hear a politician , business leader of economist using the word trillion , they are talking about a number with 12 zeros , " he said .
so what does a trillion look like ?
" it is estimated you can get 50,000 pennies into a cubic foot - a trillion pennies would fill two st paul 's cathedrals . "
alternatively you may want to compare a million to a trillion by placing a credit card next to ben nevis .
then again you can illustrate the scale of this number by comparing the fact that a million seconds equals 11.5 days , a billion seconds is 32 years and a trillion is 32,000 years .
or , if your brain has not exploded already , there is another calculation you can make , according to michael .
" if you take the typical annual salary as £ 25,000 a year - how long would it take you to spend a trillion pounds if you spent £ 25,000 a day .
" the answer is 109,000 years . "

an snp-lib dem coalition looks increasingly doubtful however , the parties do n't seem to be making an awful lot of progress .
the snp is the biggest party with 47 seats , just one ahead of scottish labour .
the scottish conservatives have 17 msps and the scots liberal democrats 16 .
the scottish greens returned two msps and the colourful independent margo macdonald was re-elected .
the snp are the biggest party so they 're in charge , right ?
actually , it 's not that simple .
in a parliament with 129 msps , a ruling administration wanting a majority needs at least 65 under its belt .
the last eight years of the parliament have seen scotland run by a labour-led coalition with the liberal democrats .
the most straightforward coalition deal seemed to be an snp-dominated scottish executive involving the lib dems and the greens .
no deal there are problems here .
the lib dems say the nationalists ' scottish independence referendum proposal is a major stumbling block to a power-sharing administration - and have now knocked them back .
the lib dems say they will not do a deal with labour and the conservatives have said they will not do a deal with anyone .
the greens have agreed to talks with the snp on forming a new government and have not ruled out being in coalition .
however , they favour a system of " confidence and supply " where they would back a first minister and a budget and deal with other issues on a case-by-case basis .
so it seems increasingly likely that the nationalists will have to go it alone - but with only 47 guaranteed votes in the chamber an snp minority government may find it tough to pass legislation .
and when it comes to the question of voting in snp leader alex salmond as first minister , the nationalists may also find it difficult to gain enough msp support for the move , even with the greens on board .
it may come down to asking other parties to abstain , for the sake of getting a new administration up and running .
the clock is ticking for msps to elect a first minister and there is another factor .
msps will be required to elect one of their own as holyrood 's presiding officer , meaning a party will have to give someone up - along with a vote in parliament .
margo macdonald - one of the arch critics of the problems with the scottish parliament building project - says she is considering a bid for the position or a candidate may emerge from the tory benches .
leader annabel goldie had been touted as a possible name , but she seems to have ruled herself out .
as the parties continue to see if a deal can be struck , members of the civil service will be on hand to advise .
meanwhile , the clock is ticking .
under the scotland act , a new first minister has to be appointed within 28 days of the election , making the deadline 30 may .
if not , a fresh election will have to be held .

the most straightforward coalition deal seemed to be an snp-dominated scottish executive involving the lib dems and the greens .
no deal there are problems here .
the lib dems say the nationalists ' scottish independence referendum proposal is a major stumbling block to a power-sharing administration - and have now knocked them back .
the lib dems say they will not do a deal with labour and the conservatives have said they will not do a deal with anyone .
the greens have agreed to talks with the snp on forming a new government and have not ruled out being in coalition .
however , they favour a system of " confidence and supply " where they would back a first minister and a budget and deal with other issues on a case-by-case basis .
so it seems increasingly likely that the nationalists will have to go it alone - but with only 47 guaranteed votes in the chamber an snp minority government may find it tough to pass legislation .
and when it comes to the question of voting in snp leader alex salmond as first minister , the nationalists may also find it difficult to gain enough msp support for the move , even with the greens on board .
it may come down to asking other parties to abstain , for the sake of getting a new administration up and running .
the clock is ticking for msps to elect a first minister and there is another factor .
msps will be required to elect one of their own as holyrood 's presiding officer , meaning a party will have to give someone up - along with a vote in parliament .
margo macdonald - one of the arch critics of the problems with the scottish parliament building project - says she is considering a bid for the position or a candidate may emerge from the tory benches .
leader annabel goldie had been touted as a possible name , but she seems to have ruled herself out .
as the parties continue to see if a deal can be struck , members of the civil service will be on hand to advise .
meanwhile , the clock is ticking .
under the scotland act , a new first minister has to be appointed within 28 days of the election , making the deadline 30 may .
if not , a fresh election will have to be held .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- beating warcraft at its own game bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- monday , 7 may 2007 , 08:55 gmt 09:55 uk beating warcraft at its own game by mark ward technology correspondent , bbc news website with more than eight million subscribers , world of warcraft dominates the online gaming market but some strong rivals are gearing up to take it on .
gaute godoger , game director at funcom , said succeeding was important for the health of the online gaming world .
" the industry so needs competition to world of warcraft , " he said .
" we need other strong games that can make people understand that there 's more to it than wow . "
funcom is developing an mmo based on the iconic hero conan who was originally the creation of us author robert e howard .
mr godoger said funcom was trying hard to make age of conan stand out when it launched in october 2007 .
the whole tone of the game would be darker than many others to reflect howard 's vision of a corrupt lost age of europe , he said .
this means it is likely to have a very different audience .
" it 's for adults , " he said .
" we did not want to be a teen-rated game , we wanted to have the possibility of making a game that takes the licence seriously . "
combat will also be different and success will depend on a player 's skill on the keyboard .
" players want to be more active in combat and know that their skill as a player matters , " said mr godoger .
" there 's no auto combat , you have to do all the running and attacking as you sit there . "
alongside the bloody sword-play will be areas in which guilds can create their own cities that they police and run .
in areas set aside for player-versus-player combat , guilds will be able to construct castles that others , perhaps hundreds of others , will be able to lay siege to .
they will even be able to build siege engines to batter down walls .
ring bearer another game with a strong background to draw on is the lord of the rings online -lrb- lotro -rrb- , which launched on 24 april .
it has perhaps the biggest chance of all the newcomers , thanks to the interest in peter jackson 's films and the huge numbers who have read the books .
" having that brand or licence is very valuable for getting a ready-made audience , " said david solari , vice president and general manager of codemasters online gaming which is running and publishing the game in europe .
but , he said , getting hold of such a licence was just the beginning .
" the very least you have to do is make a great game , " he said .
key to building up interest in the game was the community created around it .
this usually means using the beta , or test , period as a way to let people take their first steps in the virtual world before it launches .
" the beta is like a demo in the regular games business , " he said .
more than one million people signed up to take part in the lotro beta , said mr solari , and many of those testers have already packed their bags and moved to middle earth by buying the finished game .
letting potential players loose in the world helps game makers fine tune the game and gives players a real sense that they are shaping the future of lotro , he said .
" for the first time we have allowed players to shape tolkein 's middle earth , " said mr solari .
" players want something they can feel they can own themselves . "
lotro has also learned from the bad experiences seen in other games , he said .
for instance , lotro rewards the repetitive actions often required in online games .
in return for slaughtering large numbers of one type of creature players will become more powerful or gain a fancy title to demonstrates their prowess .
in this way , he said , lotro hopes to avoid the " grind " that afflicts the middle ranks of those adventuring in wow .
mr solari said the game world was 50 million square meters in size and the first free expansion , shores of evendim , will add many more quests to the thousands found in the launch game .
he said codemasters had found regular updates were a great way to keep players enthused .
old favourite some older games are taking on wow too .
star wars galaxies is revamping to be more fun for both existing and new players .
wow 's success , said jake neri , producer for galaxies at lucasarts , has meant everyone is seeing more players sign up .
" the player base for mmo games has exploded , " he said .
" we see new people trying the game all the time . "
" and , " he added " we have some die-hard folks that will never play anything but galaxies . "
the strong licence and offline following is also a big help as is the fact the game is set in a science fiction rather than fantasy world .
galaxies launched in 2003 and has been tweaked a few times since as its creators realised what people wanted to do .
" galaxies was one of the first mmos , " said mr neri .
" there was no handbook on how to do these things . "
the series of changes has aligned the game more closely with what players actually do .
for instance it has led to the number of available professions being cut from 32 to nine .
the extensive tweaking has given lucas arts a " baseline " to keep everything balanced , said mr neri .
with that done , mr neri said , lucas arts had plans for a series of updates which included a beast master expertise system that would let players train and breed pets in the game .
during the gestation process players would be able to tweak the creatures to produce strains never before seen .
also coming was a storyteller system that would let players set up and run their own themed events in game .
the events could just be a party or a specially-designed combat encounter .
the game , said mr neri , was all about the players and what they do with it .
" they make the place come alive , just by their playing style , " he said .

funcom is developing an mmo based on the iconic hero conan who was originally the creation of us author robert e howard .
mr godoger said funcom was trying hard to make age of conan stand out when it launched in october 2007 .
the whole tone of the game would be darker than many others to reflect howard 's vision of a corrupt lost age of europe , he said .
this means it is likely to have a very different audience .
" it 's for adults , " he said .
" we did not want to be a teen-rated game , we wanted to have the possibility of making a game that takes the licence seriously . "
combat will also be different and success will depend on a player 's skill on the keyboard .
" players want to be more active in combat and know that their skill as a player matters , " said mr godoger .
" there 's no auto combat , you have to do all the running and attacking as you sit there . "
alongside the bloody sword-play will be areas in which guilds can create their own cities that they police and run .
in areas set aside for player-versus-player combat , guilds will be able to construct castles that others , perhaps hundreds of others , will be able to lay siege to .
they will even be able to build siege engines to batter down walls .
ring bearer another game with a strong background to draw on is the lord of the rings online -lrb- lotro -rrb- , which launched on 24 april .
it has perhaps the biggest chance of all the newcomers , thanks to the interest in peter jackson 's films and the huge numbers who have read the books .
in lotro players can take on barrow wights " having that brand or licence is very valuable for getting a ready-made audience , " said david solari , vice president and general manager of codemasters online gaming which is running and publishing the game in europe .
but , he said , getting hold of such a licence was just the beginning .
" the very least you have to do is make a great game , " he said .
key to building up interest in the game was the community created around it .
this usually means using the beta , or test , period as a way to let people take their first steps in the virtual world before it launches .
" the beta is like a demo in the regular games business , " he said .
more than one million people signed up to take part in the lotro beta , said mr solari , and many of those testers have already packed their bags and moved to middle earth by buying the finished game .
letting potential players loose in the world helps game makers fine tune the game and gives players a real sense that they are shaping the future of lotro , he said .
" for the first time we have allowed players to shape tolkein 's middle earth , " said mr solari .
" players want something they can feel they can own themselves . "
the game features some well-known foes lotro has also learned from the bad experiences seen in other games , he said .
for instance , lotro rewards the repetitive actions often required in online games .
in return for slaughtering large numbers of one type of creature players will become more powerful or gain a fancy title to demonstrates their prowess .
in this way , he said , lotro hopes to avoid the " grind " that afflicts the middle ranks of those adventuring in wow .
mr solari said the game world was 50 million square meters in size and the first free expansion , shores of evendim , will add many more quests to the thousands found in the launch game .
he said codemasters had found regular updates were a great way to keep players enthused .
old favourite some older games are taking on wow too .
star wars galaxies is revamping to be more fun for both existing and new players .
wow 's success , said jake neri , producer for galaxies at lucasarts , has meant everyone is seeing more players sign up .
" the player base for mmo games has exploded , " he said .
" we see new people trying the game all the time . "
" and , " he added " we have some die-hard folks that will never play anything but galaxies . "
galaxies gives players more than one planet to play on the strong licence and offline following is also a big help as is the fact the game is set in a science fiction rather than fantasy world .
galaxies launched in 2003 and has been tweaked a few times since as its creators realised what people wanted to do .
" galaxies was one of the first mmos , " said mr neri .
" there was no handbook on how to do these things . "
the series of changes has aligned the game more closely with what players actually do .
for instance it has led to the number of available professions being cut from 32 to nine .
the extensive tweaking has given lucas arts a " baseline " to keep everything balanced , said mr neri .
with that done , mr neri said , lucas arts had plans for a series of updates which included a beast master expertise system that would let players train and breed pets in the game .
during the gestation process players would be able to tweak the creatures to produce strains never before seen .
also coming was a storyteller system that would let players set up and run their own themed events in game .
the events could just be a party or a specially-designed combat encounter .
the game , said mr neri , was all about the players and what they do with it .
" they make the place come alive , just by their playing style , " he said .

ring bearer another game with a strong background to draw on is the lord of the rings online -lrb- lotro -rrb- , which launched on 24 april .
it has perhaps the biggest chance of all the newcomers , thanks to the interest in peter jackson 's films and the huge numbers who have read the books .
in lotro players can take on barrow wights " having that brand or licence is very valuable for getting a ready-made audience , " said david solari , vice president and general manager of codemasters online gaming which is running and publishing the game in europe .
but , he said , getting hold of such a licence was just the beginning .
" the very least you have to do is make a great game , " he said .
key to building up interest in the game was the community created around it .
this usually means using the beta , or test , period as a way to let people take their first steps in the virtual world before it launches .
" the beta is like a demo in the regular games business , " he said .
more than one million people signed up to take part in the lotro beta , said mr solari , and many of those testers have already packed their bags and moved to middle earth by buying the finished game .
letting potential players loose in the world helps game makers fine tune the game and gives players a real sense that they are shaping the future of lotro , he said .
" for the first time we have allowed players to shape tolkein 's middle earth , " said mr solari .
" players want something they can feel they can own themselves . "
the game features some well-known foes lotro has also learned from the bad experiences seen in other games , he said .
for instance , lotro rewards the repetitive actions often required in online games .
in return for slaughtering large numbers of one type of creature players will become more powerful or gain a fancy title to demonstrates their prowess .
in this way , he said , lotro hopes to avoid the " grind " that afflicts the middle ranks of those adventuring in wow .
mr solari said the game world was 50 million square meters in size and the first free expansion , shores of evendim , will add many more quests to the thousands found in the launch game .
he said codemasters had found regular updates were a great way to keep players enthused .
old favourite some older games are taking on wow too .
star wars galaxies is revamping to be more fun for both existing and new players .
wow 's success , said jake neri , producer for galaxies at lucasarts , has meant everyone is seeing more players sign up .
" the player base for mmo games has exploded , " he said .
" we see new people trying the game all the time . "
" and , " he added " we have some die-hard folks that will never play anything but galaxies . "
galaxies gives players more than one planet to play on the strong licence and offline following is also a big help as is the fact the game is set in a science fiction rather than fantasy world .
galaxies launched in 2003 and has been tweaked a few times since as its creators realised what people wanted to do .
" galaxies was one of the first mmos , " said mr neri .
" there was no handbook on how to do these things . "
the series of changes has aligned the game more closely with what players actually do .
for instance it has led to the number of available professions being cut from 32 to nine .
the extensive tweaking has given lucas arts a " baseline " to keep everything balanced , said mr neri .
with that done , mr neri said , lucas arts had plans for a series of updates which included a beast master expertise system that would let players train and breed pets in the game .
during the gestation process players would be able to tweak the creatures to produce strains never before seen .
also coming was a storyteller system that would let players set up and run their own themed events in game .
the events could just be a party or a specially-designed combat encounter .
the game , said mr neri , was all about the players and what they do with it .
" they make the place come alive , just by their playing style , " he said .

" players want something they can feel they can own themselves . "
the game features some well-known foes lotro has also learned from the bad experiences seen in other games , he said .
for instance , lotro rewards the repetitive actions often required in online games .
in return for slaughtering large numbers of one type of creature players will become more powerful or gain a fancy title to demonstrates their prowess .
in this way , he said , lotro hopes to avoid the " grind " that afflicts the middle ranks of those adventuring in wow .
mr solari said the game world was 50 million square meters in size and the first free expansion , shores of evendim , will add many more quests to the thousands found in the launch game .
he said codemasters had found regular updates were a great way to keep players enthused .
old favourite some older games are taking on wow too .
star wars galaxies is revamping to be more fun for both existing and new players .
wow 's success , said jake neri , producer for galaxies at lucasarts , has meant everyone is seeing more players sign up .
" the player base for mmo games has exploded , " he said .
" we see new people trying the game all the time . "
" and , " he added " we have some die-hard folks that will never play anything but galaxies . "
galaxies gives players more than one planet to play on the strong licence and offline following is also a big help as is the fact the game is set in a science fiction rather than fantasy world .
galaxies launched in 2003 and has been tweaked a few times since as its creators realised what people wanted to do .
" galaxies was one of the first mmos , " said mr neri .
" there was no handbook on how to do these things . "
the series of changes has aligned the game more closely with what players actually do .
for instance it has led to the number of available professions being cut from 32 to nine .
the extensive tweaking has given lucas arts a " baseline " to keep everything balanced , said mr neri .
with that done , mr neri said , lucas arts had plans for a series of updates which included a beast master expertise system that would let players train and breed pets in the game .
during the gestation process players would be able to tweak the creatures to produce strains never before seen .
also coming was a storyteller system that would let players set up and run their own themed events in game .
the events could just be a party or a specially-designed combat encounter .
the game , said mr neri , was all about the players and what they do with it .
" they make the place come alive , just by their playing style , " he said .

gaute godoger , game director at funcom , said succeeding was important for the health of the online gaming world .
" the industry so needs competition to world of warcraft , " he said .
" we need other strong games that can make people understand that there 's more to it than wow . "
funcom is developing an mmo based on the iconic hero conan who was originally the creation of us author robert e howard .
mr godoger said funcom was trying hard to make age of conan stand out when it launched in october 2007 .
the whole tone of the game would be darker than many others to reflect howard 's vision of a corrupt lost age of europe , he said .
this means it is likely to have a very different audience .
" it 's for adults , " he said .
" we did not want to be a teen-rated game , we wanted to have the possibility of making a game that takes the licence seriously . "
combat will also be different and success will depend on a player 's skill on the keyboard .
" players want to be more active in combat and know that their skill as a player matters , " said mr godoger .
" there 's no auto combat , you have to do all the running and attacking as you sit there . "
alongside the bloody sword-play will be areas in which guilds can create their own cities that they police and run .
in areas set aside for player-versus-player combat , guilds will be able to construct castles that others , perhaps hundreds of others , will be able to lay siege to .
they will even be able to build siege engines to batter down walls .
ring bearer another game with a strong background to draw on is the lord of the rings online -lrb- lotro -rrb- , which launched on 24 april .
it has perhaps the biggest chance of all the newcomers , thanks to the interest in peter jackson 's films and the huge numbers who have read the books .
in lotro players can take on barrow wights " having that brand or licence is very valuable for getting a ready-made audience , " said david solari , vice president and general manager of codemasters online gaming which is running and publishing the game in europe .
but , he said , getting hold of such a licence was just the beginning .
" the very least you have to do is make a great game , " he said .
key to building up interest in the game was the community created around it .
this usually means using the beta , or test , period as a way to let people take their first steps in the virtual world before it launches .
" the beta is like a demo in the regular games business , " he said .
more than one million people signed up to take part in the lotro beta , said mr solari , and many of those testers have already packed their bags and moved to middle earth by buying the finished game .
letting potential players loose in the world helps game makers fine tune the game and gives players a real sense that they are shaping the future of lotro , he said .

labour 's failure to win enough seats at the election means it must rely on support from rivals to stay in power .
welsh liberal democrat leader lembit opik did not rule out a coalition with labour despite some opposition within his party .
the new assembly meets for the first time on wednesday , but it still may not be clear who will be in charge .
labour is the biggest party , with 26 out of the 60 seats , and its ams will meet on tuesday to discuss its options .
but senior labour am huw lewis said his party must take care before making any decisions .
the merthyr tydfil and rhymney am said labour was facing some " unappealing prospects , " including lib dems tearing themselves apart , and plaid cymru , with whom labour supporters had a huge ideological problem . "
we have to make sure we do n't compromise ourselves in the pursuit of power " lembit opik mp , welsh lib dem leader " wales needs stable government and we have to work towards that , " he said .
" this is the grim reality even if we have to hold our noses .
" what was the message the electorate sent us ?
i think they clearly said ' we want labour to govern , ' but there was also an enormous ' but ... ' hanging over it . "
mr lewis , who was deputy minister for social justice and regeneration in the last assembly , told bbc wales ' the politics show that he personally could not work in government with plaid ministers .
lembit opik mp , leader of the welsh liberal democrats said : " there are attractions to being in a coalition for wales as well - the only period of stabiliity for the assembly , the only really progressive time , was the coalition between labour and the lib dems .
" but we have to make sure we do n't compromise ourselves in the pursuit of power , it 's all about outcomes and we want what 's best for the people of wales . "
mr opik said discussions within the party on sunday looked at the " big picture " but he acknowledged that they would have to move fast over the next couple of days .
several prominent lib dems have spoken out against coalition , including the leaders of four welsh councils and south wales west am peter black .
meanwhile , mr opik said there was also " overwhelming " support for the party 's assembly leader mike german .
" it 's quite clear that mike german is the right person to lead us in these negotiations , " he told bbc radio wales .
if lib dems did refuse to support labour , they would be following their colleagues in scotland .
at the weekend lib dems ruled out a coalition deal with labour in the scottish parliament - although the situation in holyrood is different , because the scottish national party is the biggest group .
plaid leader ieuan wyn jones , whose 15 ams are the second largest group , has said an informal agreement with labour is a possibility .
asked about an informal deal with plaid , mr lewis said labour would have to listen to all groups in order to have stability , but leaders would have to take party members with them .
' go it alone ' senior plaid am dafydd elis thomas said his preferred option would be for labour to go it alone , which " might not be comfortable but it might be good for the institution . "
lord elis thomas , who has been presiding officer since the assembly was founded in 1999 , said " specific measures and policy decisions could be supported by other parties " .
he said he was sure " that we as plaid would like to be in that position so that we could influence government . "
another option in wales is for a " rainbow coalition " of non-labour parties .
but leading conservative am alun cairns said that while that was still possible , it was less likely .
the new assembly government has to be formed by 24 may .
if not , there is the possibility of another election .

we have to make sure we do n't compromise ourselves in the pursuit of power lembit opik mp , welsh lib dem leader " wales needs stable government and we have to work towards that , " he said .
" this is the grim reality even if we have to hold our noses .
" what was the message the electorate sent us ?
i think they clearly said ' we want labour to govern , ' but there was also an enormous ' but ... ' hanging over it . "
mr lewis , who was deputy minister for social justice and regeneration in the last assembly , told bbc wales ' the politics show that he personally could not work in government with plaid ministers .
lembit opik mp , leader of the welsh liberal democrats said : " there are attractions to being in a coalition for wales as well - the only period of stabiliity for the assembly , the only really progressive time , was the coalition between labour and the lib dems .
" but we have to make sure we do n't compromise ourselves in the pursuit of power , it 's all about outcomes and we want what 's best for the people of wales . "
mr opik said discussions within the party on sunday looked at the " big picture " but he acknowledged that they would have to move fast over the next couple of days .
several prominent lib dems have spoken out against coalition , including the leaders of four welsh councils and south wales west am peter black .
meanwhile , mr opik said there was also " overwhelming " support for the party 's assembly leader mike german .
" it 's quite clear that mike german is the right person to lead us in these negotiations , " he told bbc radio wales .
huw lewis says voters wanted labour , with an added ' but ... '
if lib dems did refuse to support labour , they would be following their colleagues in scotland .
at the weekend lib dems ruled out a coalition deal with labour in the scottish parliament - although the situation in holyrood is different , because the scottish national party is the biggest group .
plaid leader ieuan wyn jones , whose 15 ams are the second largest group , has said an informal agreement with labour is a possibility .
asked about an informal deal with plaid , mr lewis said labour would have to listen to all groups in order to have stability , but leaders would have to take party members with them .
' go it alone ' senior plaid am dafydd elis thomas said his preferred option would be for labour to go it alone , which " might not be comfortable but it might be good for the institution . "
lord elis thomas , who has been presiding officer since the assembly was founded in 1999 , said " specific measures and policy decisions could be supported by other parties " .
he said he was sure " that we as plaid would like to be in that position so that we could influence government . "
another option in wales is for a " rainbow coalition " of non-labour parties .
but leading conservative am alun cairns said that while that was still possible , it was less likely .
the new assembly government has to be formed by 24 may .
if not , there is the possibility of another election .
