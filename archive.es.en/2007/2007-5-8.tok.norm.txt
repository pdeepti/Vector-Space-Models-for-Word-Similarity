bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klm is now part of air france sander rietveld from dutch program netwerk told the times newspaper that although one of the documents showed that the klm representative 's request had been refused by the swiss border police , many germans were allowed to enter switzerland without permission .
" the point is that it shows klm actively approached the swiss police , " he said .
argentina a safe haven for war criminals suspected war criminals were forbidden from leaving germany after the end of the war by the allied powers .
however argentina harbored several of them when president juan peron was in power between 1945 and 1955 .

" however , it can not be excluded that klm representatives were not involved at a local level . "
klm under pressure since the airing of the documentary last week , the issue has been the subject of intense debate in the netherlands .
the affair is a sensitive one because of the possible involvement of a dutch royal family member . prince bernhard , the father of queen beatrix , was the director of klm at the time .
some dutch politicians , historians and jewish groups are urging the airline to conduct an independent probe into the allegations and come clean about its past .
klm has indicated it will likely begin such an investigation .
" we take these signals seriously and if we are a responsible company , we should also be responsible for what has been done in the past , " koster told news agency reuters .

on tuesday , the airline said it would likely seek an independent investigation into the matter .
the dutch filmmakers said they had unearthed documents which showed that a local klm representative asked the swiss border police in 1948 to allow passengers from germany to enter the country without proper papers so that they could fly on to argentina .

" the united nations has asked the german government to stay on in its commanding role for another rotation period , " foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner told a press conference .
" we understand from new york that the request is based on a desire for continuity regarding the mission in lebanon . "
unifil was deployed in the aftermath of israel 's devastating 34-day war last summer on hezbollah guerrillas in lebanon .
its naval component is meant to prevent arms being smuggled to hezbollah by sea and has been headed since october by a contingent of some 850 german sailors .

a prolongation of germany 's mandate , which is due to expire on august 31 , would have to be approved by the cabinet and the lower house of parliament , the bundestag .
under the current mandate , berlin can deploy up to 1,500 sailors , 400 support staff , 100 air troops and 100 training officers off the lebanese coast .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt 's brush workshop in the 1940s weidt hired jewish workers - among them blind and disabled employees - in order to save them from deportation to nazi death camps .
since 1999 , the museum has been home to a documentary show of the factory 's history .
this week , the opening of a new permanent exhibition adds further details about factory owner weidt and his string of friends and helpers who rallied to hire jews and even hide some of them in the workshop rooms to save them from the nazis .
weidt 's efforts prove that " it was possible even for apparently powerless people to resist an inhuman regime , " bernd naumann , germany 's deputy culture minister , said during the unveiling of the new exhibition on monday .
" little schindler " weidt 's efforts to aid jews contains echoes of the story of oskar schindler , a german industrialist whose efforts and successes in saving over a thousand jews from the nazis are the subject of oscar-winning film " schindler 's list . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt is sometimes referred to as the " little schindler " sometimes referred to as " little schindler , " weidt 's efforts are believed to have directly saved some 27 lives .
a passionate pacifist who managed to avoid being drafted in the first world war on account of a bad ear , weidt set up his factory in the rosenthalerstrasse in berlin in the early 1940s .
since it mainly supplied its brushes and brooms to hitler 's army , the wehrmacht , and was deemed to be supplying " war essentials , " the factory enjoyed special status at the time - a fact which enabled weidt to bribe nazi officials and falsify documents in order to hire jews .
weidt also smuggled in food packages to jewish families living underground and also helped one former employee flee from the theresienstadt concentration camp .
on occasion , weidt , with the help of friends , also hid entire jewish families in the rooms of his workshop for months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room at the former workshop which served as a hideout one of the centerpieces of the new exhibition is a small windowless room in its original condition which served as a hideout for months for a jewish family .
they were however discovered by the gestapo , the nazi secret police , in 1943 and deported to the auschwitz concentration camp .
remembering " silent heroes " weidt died in 1947 , soon after the end of the second world war , and his and his friends ' efforts to save jewish lives were largely forgotten in the decades after the war .
it was only in the 1990s that the german public became aware of their contribution to nazi-era resistance thanks to inge deutschkron , an 84-year-old german-jewish journalist and writer .
deutschkron , who spent two years in the early 1940s in weidt 's workshop working as a secretary and was given forged documents to escape detection by the nazis , campaigned in 1993 to set up a memorial plaque at the former brush factory .
she has also written extensively about weidt 's life in a series of acclaimed books and articles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inge deutschkron speaking at the opening of the new exhibition in berlin this week , deutschkron said it remained the only authentic site in the german capital where the suffering of the jews during the holocaust could be fully understood .

this week , the opening of a new permanent exhibition adds further details about factory owner weidt and his string of friends and helpers who rallied to hire jews and even hide some of them in the workshop rooms to save them from the nazis .
weidt 's efforts prove that " it was possible even for apparently powerless people to resist an inhuman regime , " bernd naumann , germany 's deputy culture minister , said during the unveiling of the new exhibition on monday .
" little schindler " weidt 's efforts to aid jews contains echoes of the story of oskar schindler , a german industrialist whose efforts and successes in saving over a thousand jews from the nazis are the subject of oscar-winning film " schindler 's list . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt is sometimes referred to as the " little schindler " sometimes referred to as " little schindler , " weidt 's efforts are believed to have directly saved some 27 lives .
a passionate pacifist who managed to avoid being drafted in the first world war on account of a bad ear , weidt set up his factory in the rosenthalerstrasse in berlin in the early 1940s .
since it mainly supplied its brushes and brooms to hitler 's army , the wehrmacht , and was deemed to be supplying " war essentials , " the factory enjoyed special status at the time - a fact which enabled weidt to bribe nazi officials and falsify documents in order to hire jews .
weidt also smuggled in food packages to jewish families living underground and also helped one former employee flee from the theresienstadt concentration camp .
on occasion , weidt , with the help of friends , also hid entire jewish families in the rooms of his workshop for months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room at the former workshop which served as a hideout one of the centerpieces of the new exhibition is a small windowless room in its original condition which served as a hideout for months for a jewish family .
they were however discovered by the gestapo , the nazi secret police , in 1943 and deported to the auschwitz concentration camp .
remembering " silent heroes " weidt died in 1947 , soon after the end of the second world war , and his and his friends ' efforts to save jewish lives were largely forgotten in the decades after the war .
it was only in the 1990s that the german public became aware of their contribution to nazi-era resistance thanks to inge deutschkron , an 84-year-old german-jewish journalist and writer .
deutschkron , who spent two years in the early 1940s in weidt 's workshop working as a secretary and was given forged documents to escape detection by the nazis , campaigned in 1993 to set up a memorial plaque at the former brush factory .
she has also written extensively about weidt 's life in a series of acclaimed books and articles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inge deutschkron speaking at the opening of the new exhibition in berlin this week , deutschkron said it remained the only authentic site in the german capital where the suffering of the jews during the holocaust could be fully understood .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 08.05.2007 eu takes over galileo global navigation system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo is europe 's answer to gps tired of the bickering and lack of progress on one of europe 's premier projects , the european commission has decided to take the reins of control for the galileo satellite navigation system away from private industry . the european commission has proposed that the public sector , rather than industry , assume the responsibility for a european union satellite navigation system that has been stalled due to legal , financial and technical problems .
german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee , who currently serves as the responsible eu minister for the program under germany 's eu presidency , expressed his exasperation at a meeting in brussels on monday .
" this monumental project must not suffer any more harm by falling further behind the competition , or , by being threatened altogether , " tiefensee said .
little headway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting around at the push of a button almost two years after being named , a private consortium of industry giants has made so little progress on the project that it is threatening to end up in the airbus a380 category of botched industrial endeavors .
the umbrella group of industry heavyweights includes aena and hispasat of spain , thales and alcatel-lucent from france , european aerospace company eads , italy 's finmeccanica , britain 's inmarsat , deutsche telekom and the german aerospace center , dlr .
the eu commission 's preference now is to take over the project and issue a new tender to operate the system once it is built and launched into space .
this would get the system operating by the end of 2012 - a year , or even two , faster than any other option .
dr. hubert reile , program director for space operations at the german aerospace center , said this will not affect control of the navigation network by the dlr from its oberpfaffenhofen space center in bavaria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax payers will primarily cover galileo costs " for the dlr and for germany , this decision wo n't make much of a difference , " he said .
" it is foreseen that we will have a control center near munich in oberpfaffenhofen , and it makes no difference if it is financed purely by a government or by a private group , " he added .
european version of gps galileo is supposed to be the european answer to the us gps system used as a navigation aid in cars , boats and aircraft .
the four-billion-euro -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- system has suffered a number of setbacks , due to technical problems , which can be solved , said reile , and financial and legal responsibility issues , which none of the private industry participants are willing to shoulder .
" what is really difficult for this project is that more partners are on board than in a normal , big european project , " said reile .

his arrest in november 1982 sent a wave of relief through the public - and it 's no wonder , considering the trail of blood the raf had already left behind .
christian klar has not been pardoned .
he will remain in prison for the rest of his minimum term of 26 years , until january 2009 .
german president horst köhler no doubt gave his decision careful consideration .
he consulted with german justice minister brigitte zypries and chief federal prosecutor monika harms about the issue .
he reviewed an expert report on klar .
he spoke with family members of raf victims , and he spoke with klar himself .
not the easy route köhler did not take the easy way out , and that in itself is reason to wish that he would not have reaped the senseless criticism that he did from his own christian democratic party , as well as the threats that he would not be re-elected if he pardoned klar .
so köhler denied klar clemency , and even though the president is free to make his own choices , one could consider this one a mistake .
the expert who evaluated klar considered it unlikely that the 54-year-old former terrorist would use weapons again against representatives of the economic and political elite .
it is also improbable that that estimation will change in the next year and a half when klar becomes eligible for parole .
one may consider klar to be blinded by his aversion to the capitalistic system - a stance he will presumably keep - but that is not a crime .
tumult what of course remains significant are the feelings of the families of raf victims .
however , a human life can never be valued in numbers - not with 24 , but also not with the 26-year jail term that the culprit received for extinguishing that life .
german society was indeed thrown into a crisis by the terrorist acts of the raf 30 years ago .
the terrorists , the murderers and the kidnappers all came from the heart of that society .
and given the force of the debate about klar 's plea for clemency , a sense of the rift of those former times can still be felt today .
perhaps a pardon for klar could have helped to bridge that gap .
after all , it 's bit ironic that , of all people , a decisive enemy of the state would appeal to the highest ranking individual of this state once so bloodily contested .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the red army faction - 10 years after its dissolution judge issues arrest warrants for former raf terrorists former red army faction leader mohnhaupt wants new identity german court orders former raf terrorist released on parole german president rejects ex-raf terrorist 's plea for clemency society -pipe- 08.05.2007 opinion : clemency for ex-terrorist could have bridged gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after thoughtful deliberation , says dw correspondent heinz dylong , german president horst köhler denied former red army faction terrorist christian klar 's request for clemency - but will it make a difference ? there 's no question that christian klar was one of the most determined and brutal of all the red army faction terrorists .
his arrest in november 1982 sent a wave of relief through the public - and it 's no wonder , considering the trail of blood the raf had already left behind .
christian klar has not been pardoned .
he will remain in prison for the rest of his minimum term of 26 years , until january 2009 .
german president horst köhler no doubt gave his decision careful consideration .
he consulted with german justice minister brigitte zypries and chief federal prosecutor monika harms about the issue .
he reviewed an expert report on klar .
he spoke with family members of raf victims , and he spoke with klar himself .
not the easy route köhler did not take the easy way out , and that in itself is reason to wish that he would not have reaped the senseless criticism that he did from his own christian democratic party , as well as the threats that he would not be re-elected if he pardoned klar .
so köhler denied klar clemency , and even though the president is free to make his own choices , one could consider this one a mistake .
the expert who evaluated klar considered it unlikely that the 54-year-old former terrorist would use weapons again against representatives of the economic and political elite .
it is also improbable that that estimation will change in the next year and a half when klar becomes eligible for parole .
one may consider klar to be blinded by his aversion to the capitalistic system - a stance he will presumably keep - but that is not a crime .
tumult what of course remains significant are the feelings of the families of raf victims .
however , a human life can never be valued in numbers - not with 24 , but also not with the 26-year jail term that the culprit received for extinguishing that life .
german society was indeed thrown into a crisis by the terrorist acts of the raf 30 years ago .
the terrorists , the murderers and the kidnappers all came from the heart of that society .
and given the force of the debate about klar 's plea for clemency , a sense of the rift of those former times can still be felt today .
perhaps a pardon for klar could have helped to bridge that gap .
after all , it 's bit ironic that , of all people , a decisive enemy of the state would appeal to the highest ranking individual of this state once so bloodily contested .

" but we need dialogue and respect instead of violence , " he added . during the night , a crowd of some 200 youths clashed with police in paris ' place de la bastille .
they broke windows , destroyed telephone booths and set four cars on fire .
similar incidents were reported in the cities of lyon , lille , toulouse , rennes and nantes . but the unrest was less than the night before , which saw 730 vehicles torched and 592 people arrested . sarkozy angered many in 2005 when , as interior minister , he referred to rioting youth in france 's poor , largely minority , suburban housing projects as " rabble " and " scum . " recuperation in malta bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is regrouping before assuming his new office meanwhile , the president-elect was taking a brief vacation in malta to recover from the campaign and plan strategy for when he takes office on may 16 . high on sarkozy 's agenda will be the appointment of a cabinet and most importantly a prime minister .
former social affairs minister francois fillon and current employment and social cohesion minister jean-louis borloo have both been tipped for that post . sarkozy also plans to draft an initial package of reforms to present to the french national assembly . they include cuts in france 's inheritance tax , rules mandating that the jobless to accept work offered to them , and a minimum service guarantee during transportation strikes - measures all likely to attract the ire of french trade unions . stony silence from russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's election could end a period of close russian-french-german cooperation french youths are not the only ones displeased by sarkozy 's triumph .
russia has thus far refused to offer the customary congratulations usually offered to new heads of state . the kremlin has issued no official reaction at all to the election .
but the pro-government newspaper izvestia wrote that a sarkozy presidency could negatively impact french-russian relations . the paper objected to the fact that lawmaker pierre lellouche , a critic of russia 's war against separatist rebels in chechnya , was one of sarkozy 's major advisors .
lellouche was " particularly malicious toward russia , " izvestia wrote , adding that it would be " catastrophic " if he were appointed france 's foreign minister . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : the right revolution in france ?

his arrest in november 1982 sent a wave of relief through the public - and it 's no wonder , considering the trail of blood the raf had already left behind .
christian klar has not been pardoned .
he will remain in prison for the rest of his minimum term of 26 years , until january 2009 .
german president horst köhler no doubt gave his decision careful consideration .
he consulted with german justice minister brigitte zypries and chief federal prosecutor monika harms about the issue .
he reviewed an expert report on klar .
he spoke with family members of raf victims , and he spoke with klar himself .

so köhler denied klar clemency , and even though the president is free to make his own choices , one could consider this one a mistake .
the expert who evaluated klar considered it unlikely that the 54-year-old former terrorist would use weapons again against representatives of the economic and political elite .
it is also improbable that that estimation will change in the next year and a half when klar becomes eligible for parole .
one may consider klar to be blinded by his aversion to the capitalistic system - a stance he will presumably keep - but that is not a crime .
tumult what of course remains significant are the feelings of the families of raf victims .
however , a human life can never be valued in numbers - not with 24 , but also not with the 26-year jail term that the culprit received for extinguishing that life .
german society was indeed thrown into a crisis by the terrorist acts of the raf 30 years ago .
the terrorists , the murderers and the kidnappers all came from the heart of that society .
and given the force of the debate about klar 's plea for clemency , a sense of the rift of those former times can still be felt today .
perhaps a pardon for klar could have helped to bridge that gap .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the red army faction - 10 years after its dissolution judge issues arrest warrants for former raf terrorists former red army faction leader mohnhaupt wants new identity german court orders former raf terrorist released on parole german president rejects ex-raf terrorist 's plea for clemency society -pipe- 08.05.2007 opinion : clemency for ex-terrorist could have bridged gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after thoughtful deliberation , says dw correspondent heinz dylong , german president horst köhler denied former red army faction terrorist christian klar 's request for clemency - but will it make a difference ? there 's no question that christian klar was one of the most determined and brutal of all the red army faction terrorists .
his arrest in november 1982 sent a wave of relief through the public - and it 's no wonder , considering the trail of blood the raf had already left behind .
christian klar has not been pardoned .
he will remain in prison for the rest of his minimum term of 26 years , until january 2009 .
german president horst köhler no doubt gave his decision careful consideration .
he consulted with german justice minister brigitte zypries and chief federal prosecutor monika harms about the issue .
he reviewed an expert report on klar .
he spoke with family members of raf victims , and he spoke with klar himself .
not the easy route köhler did not take the easy way out , and that in itself is reason to wish that he would not have reaped the senseless criticism that he did from his own christian democratic party , as well as the threats that he would not be re-elected if he pardoned klar .
so köhler denied klar clemency , and even though the president is free to make his own choices , one could consider this one a mistake .
the expert who evaluated klar considered it unlikely that the 54-year-old former terrorist would use weapons again against representatives of the economic and political elite .
it is also improbable that that estimation will change in the next year and a half when klar becomes eligible for parole .
one may consider klar to be blinded by his aversion to the capitalistic system - a stance he will presumably keep - but that is not a crime .
tumult what of course remains significant are the feelings of the families of raf victims .
however , a human life can never be valued in numbers - not with 24 , but also not with the 26-year jail term that the culprit received for extinguishing that life .
german society was indeed thrown into a crisis by the terrorist acts of the raf 30 years ago .
the terrorists , the murderers and the kidnappers all came from the heart of that society .
and given the force of the debate about klar 's plea for clemency , a sense of the rift of those former times can still be felt today .
perhaps a pardon for klar could have helped to bridge that gap .
after all , it 's bit ironic that , of all people , a decisive enemy of the state would appeal to the highest ranking individual of this state once so bloodily contested .

german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee , who currently serves as the responsible eu minister for the program under germany 's eu presidency , expressed his exasperation at a meeting in brussels on monday .
" this monumental project must not suffer any more harm by falling further behind the competition , or , by being threatened altogether , " tiefensee said .
little headway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting around at the push of a button almost two years after being named , a private consortium of industry giants has made so little progress on the project that it is threatening to end up in the airbus a380 category of botched industrial endeavors .
the umbrella group of industry heavyweights includes aena and hispasat of spain , thales and alcatel-lucent from france , european aerospace company eads , italy 's finmeccanica , britain 's inmarsat , deutsche telekom and the german aerospace center , dlr .
the eu commission 's preference now is to take over the project and issue a new tender to operate the system once it is built and launched into space .
this would get the system operating by the end of 2012 - a year , or even two , faster than any other option .

it says it will likely seek an independent investigation . a documentary on dutch television has accused the country 's national airline , now part of air france , of helping nazis with falsified documents or without proper papers to escape to argentina via switzerland after world war two .
on tuesday , the airline said it would likely seek an independent investigation into the matter .
the dutch filmmakers said they had unearthed documents which showed that a local klm representative asked the swiss border police in 1948 to allow passengers from germany to enter the country without proper papers so that they could fly on to argentina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klm is now part of air france sander rietveld from dutch program netwerk told the times newspaper that although one of the documents showed that the klm representative 's request had been refused by the swiss border police , many germans were allowed to enter switzerland without permission .
" the point is that it shows klm actively approached the swiss police , " he said .
argentina a safe haven for war criminals suspected war criminals were forbidden from leaving germany after the end of the war by the allied powers .
however argentina harbored several of them when president juan peron was in power between 1945 and 1955 .
among the more than 150 nazis who were offered refuge in the country were adolf eichmann , considered the chief mastermind of the holocaust as well as josef mengele , the notorious nazi camp doctor dubbed the " angel of death . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef mengele also found refuge in argentina klm has said it has never found evidence in its own archives of flying nazis to argentina .
the airline however has not ruled out being possibly involved in the affair .
a klm spokesman , bart koster , told the bbc that the airline had no record of the former employee in switzerland mentioned in the television documentary .
" we have no information whatsoever that our board was actively involved , " koster said .
" however , it can not be excluded that klm representatives were not involved at a local level . "
klm under pressure since the airing of the documentary last week , the issue has been the subject of intense debate in the netherlands .
the affair is a sensitive one because of the possible involvement of a dutch royal family member . prince bernhard , the father of queen beatrix , was the director of klm at the time .
some dutch politicians , historians and jewish groups are urging the airline to conduct an independent probe into the allegations and come clean about its past .
klm has indicated it will likely begin such an investigation .
" we take these signals seriously and if we are a responsible company , we should also be responsible for what has been done in the past , " koster told news agency reuters .
the allegations against klm come a year after the dutch national railway company apologized for its role in deporting thousands of jews to nazi death camps . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us lawmakers urge opening of vast holocaust archive a us panel has approved a resolution calling for the world 's largest holocaust archive to be quickly opened to the public , saying it could help help counter holocaust deniers like iranian president mohammed ahmadinejad .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt 's brush workshop in the 1940s weidt hired jewish workers - among them blind and disabled employees - in order to save them from deportation to nazi death camps .
since 1999 , the museum has been home to a documentary show of the factory 's history .
this week , the opening of a new permanent exhibition adds further details about factory owner weidt and his string of friends and helpers who rallied to hire jews and even hide some of them in the workshop rooms to save them from the nazis .
weidt 's efforts prove that " it was possible even for apparently powerless people to resist an inhuman regime , " bernd naumann , germany 's deputy culture minister , said during the unveiling of the new exhibition on monday .
" little schindler " weidt 's efforts to aid jews contains echoes of the story of oskar schindler , a german industrialist whose efforts and successes in saving over a thousand jews from the nazis are the subject of oscar-winning film " schindler 's list . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt is sometimes referred to as the " little schindler " sometimes referred to as " little schindler , " weidt 's efforts are believed to have directly saved some 27 lives .
a passionate pacifist who managed to avoid being drafted in the first world war on account of a bad ear , weidt set up his factory in the rosenthalerstrasse in berlin in the early 1940s .
since it mainly supplied its brushes and brooms to hitler 's army , the wehrmacht , and was deemed to be supplying " war essentials , " the factory enjoyed special status at the time - a fact which enabled weidt to bribe nazi officials and falsify documents in order to hire jews .
weidt also smuggled in food packages to jewish families living underground and also helped one former employee flee from the theresienstadt concentration camp .
on occasion , weidt , with the help of friends , also hid entire jewish families in the rooms of his workshop for months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room at the former workshop which served as a hideout one of the centerpieces of the new exhibition is a small windowless room in its original condition which served as a hideout for months for a jewish family .
they were however discovered by the gestapo , the nazi secret police , in 1943 and deported to the auschwitz concentration camp .
remembering " silent heroes " weidt died in 1947 , soon after the end of the second world war , and his and his friends ' efforts to save jewish lives were largely forgotten in the decades after the war .
it was only in the 1990s that the german public became aware of their contribution to nazi-era resistance thanks to inge deutschkron , an 84-year-old german-jewish journalist and writer .
deutschkron , who spent two years in the early 1940s in weidt 's workshop working as a secretary and was given forged documents to escape detection by the nazis , campaigned in 1993 to set up a memorial plaque at the former brush factory .
she has also written extensively about weidt 's life in a series of acclaimed books and articles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inge deutschkron speaking at the opening of the new exhibition in berlin this week , deutschkron said it remained the only authentic site in the german capital where the suffering of the jews during the holocaust could be fully understood .
andre schmitz , berlin 's deputy culture minister , said the remembrance of the " silent heroes " as well as extensive academic research on their efforts had closed a " painful gap " in germany 's collective memory . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us lawmakers urge opening of vast holocaust archive a us panel has approved a resolution calling for the world 's largest holocaust archive to be quickly opened to the public , saying it could help help counter holocaust deniers like iranian president mohammed ahmadinejad .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt 's brush workshop in the 1940s weidt hired jewish workers - among them blind and disabled employees - in order to save them from deportation to nazi death camps .
since 1999 , the museum has been home to a documentary show of the factory 's history .
this week , the opening of a new permanent exhibition adds further details about factory owner weidt and his string of friends and helpers who rallied to hire jews and even hide some of them in the workshop rooms to save them from the nazis .
weidt 's efforts prove that " it was possible even for apparently powerless people to resist an inhuman regime , " bernd naumann , germany 's deputy culture minister , said during the unveiling of the new exhibition on monday .
" little schindler " weidt 's efforts to aid jews contains echoes of the story of oskar schindler , a german industrialist whose efforts and successes in saving over a thousand jews from the nazis are the subject of oscar-winning film " schindler 's list . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt is sometimes referred to as the " little schindler " sometimes referred to as " little schindler , " weidt 's efforts are believed to have directly saved some 27 lives .
a passionate pacifist who managed to avoid being drafted in the first world war on account of a bad ear , weidt set up his factory in the rosenthalerstrasse in berlin in the early 1940s .
since it mainly supplied its brushes and brooms to hitler 's army , the wehrmacht , and was deemed to be supplying " war essentials , " the factory enjoyed special status at the time - a fact which enabled weidt to bribe nazi officials and falsify documents in order to hire jews .
weidt also smuggled in food packages to jewish families living underground and also helped one former employee flee from the theresienstadt concentration camp .
on occasion , weidt , with the help of friends , also hid entire jewish families in the rooms of his workshop for months .

officials said germany 's performance in 2006 was much better than expected .
the commission had originally said the german budget deficit in 2006 would stand at three percent of gdp .

steinbrück also said that the additional tax take for the whole country - including the federal government , the 16 states and the local authorities - could amount to 200 billion euros .
the minister warned , however , that the additional revenue had to be devoted primarily to consolidating the budget after years of running deficits that exceeded of european union norms .

" the news magazine documented that juvenile alter egos in the virtual community second life , called avatars , were being used to simulate child sex - and being sold for virtual profits within the alternate reality platform . robin harper , vice president of linden lab , which runs second life , told the television program that the company would investigate who was behind the images and pass on the information to the police . but child-protection activists have criticized linden lab for not programming its site to reject child-sex images , and psychologists worry that such role playing could encourage real cases of child abuse . cyber-rape ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german law prohibits not only real , but " realistic " child porn this is n't the first sex-related controversy surrounding second life .
in recent months , objections have been raised to the alleged " cyber-raping " of users ' avatars . but the presence of depictions of juveniles makes this an especially sensitive case .
the story was picked up by most major german papers , and readers responding to it online have engaged in a heated debate about the legal ramifications . roughly half of the respondents do not think sexual depictions of juvenile avatars warrant police action . " as disgusting as i find the idea of someone enjoying virtual sex with children , " wrote an online reader of the daily newspaper die welt , " we should n't forget one thing : this is about something fictional , a virtual world , and thank god no real child has actually suffered . " some think prosecutors should concentrate on real cases of child abuse and accuse police of an orwellian attempt to punish thoughtcrime .
other users point out that while virtual child sex is illegal in germany , it is n't in the united states . slippery slope ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police have been cracking down on child porn but users on the other side of the issue say that child-sex role playing online could be a first step leading to real child abuse . " if measures to prevent virtual child pornography can protect even one child from being harmed by a pedophile who has made the jump from the virtual to the real , " wrote one online reader of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , " then i would welcome them in any form . " a welt user concurred : " it 's disgusting that this sort of thing is portrayed as harmless , and blame shifted to the prosecutors . " and a fellow respondent simply wrote , " second life is a platform for people who have no first lives .

" there is no plan b .
if we open for changes and new proposals we are opening a pandora 's box , " ahtisaari told a news conference in stockholm .
the former finnish president has presented a plan that would give kosovo and the territory 's ethnic albanian majority internationally supervised independence .
nato troops would provide security while economic assistance would come from the european union .
ahtisaari said he hoped none of the permanent members of the security council would use their veto when the plan comes up for discussion in a few weeks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many outside kosovo 's biggest city , pristina , are farmers the plan has the backing of the eu , the united states and the leaders of the ethnic albanians , who comprise around 90 percent of kosovo 's two million inhabitants .
the eu has said it would only take on the role of supervisor from the un if the security council passes a resolution .
opposition but serbia and russia oppose the plan .
serbia sees the province as its historic heartland and has proposed that kosovo be given monitored autonomy instead .
moscow rejects the plan as a violation of serbia 's territorial integrity and has threatened to use its veto and prevent full un security council backing of the proposal .
russia has said serbia and kosovo should continue talks until they reach a compromise .
however , ahtisaari told the news conference that he thought russia was starting to recognize that a negotiated settlement between serbia and kosovo was impossible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ethnic serb woman leaving her home burned by ethnic albanians in kosovo " if i had proposed independence without any international presence , then i would accept the -lrb- russian -rrb- criticism , " he said .
" but the un will be replaced by the eu ... so it really is a compromise . "
in addition , ahtisaari said he would not consider any changes to his proposal .
tough talks " i have done my duty , " he said .
" now it 's up to the security council to see how it can actually get the process through . "
the peace broker can boast a long list of achievements .

steinbrück also said that the additional tax take for the whole country - including the federal government , the 16 states and the local authorities - could amount to 200 billion euros .
the minister warned , however , that the additional revenue had to be devoted primarily to consolidating the budget after years of running deficits that exceeded of european union norms .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt 's brush workshop in the 1940s weidt hired jewish workers - among them blind and disabled employees - in order to save them from deportation to nazi death camps .
since 1999 , the museum has been home to a documentary show of the factory 's history .
this week , the opening of a new permanent exhibition adds further details about factory owner weidt and his string of friends and helpers who rallied to hire jews and even hide some of them in the workshop rooms to save them from the nazis .
weidt 's efforts prove that " it was possible even for apparently powerless people to resist an inhuman regime , " bernd naumann , germany 's deputy culture minister , said during the unveiling of the new exhibition on monday .
" little schindler " weidt 's efforts to aid jews contains echoes of the story of oskar schindler , a german industrialist whose efforts and successes in saving over a thousand jews from the nazis are the subject of oscar-winning film " schindler 's list . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt is sometimes referred to as the " little schindler " sometimes referred to as " little schindler , " weidt 's efforts are believed to have directly saved some 27 lives .
a passionate pacifist who managed to avoid being drafted in the first world war on account of a bad ear , weidt set up his factory in the rosenthalerstrasse in berlin in the early 1940s .
since it mainly supplied its brushes and brooms to hitler 's army , the wehrmacht , and was deemed to be supplying " war essentials , " the factory enjoyed special status at the time - a fact which enabled weidt to bribe nazi officials and falsify documents in order to hire jews .
weidt also smuggled in food packages to jewish families living underground and also helped one former employee flee from the theresienstadt concentration camp .
on occasion , weidt , with the help of friends , also hid entire jewish families in the rooms of his workshop for months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room at the former workshop which served as a hideout one of the centerpieces of the new exhibition is a small windowless room in its original condition which served as a hideout for months for a jewish family .
they were however discovered by the gestapo , the nazi secret police , in 1943 and deported to the auschwitz concentration camp .
remembering " silent heroes " weidt died in 1947 , soon after the end of the second world war , and his and his friends ' efforts to save jewish lives were largely forgotten in the decades after the war .
it was only in the 1990s that the german public became aware of their contribution to nazi-era resistance thanks to inge deutschkron , an 84-year-old german-jewish journalist and writer .
deutschkron , who spent two years in the early 1940s in weidt 's workshop working as a secretary and was given forged documents to escape detection by the nazis , campaigned in 1993 to set up a memorial plaque at the former brush factory .
she has also written extensively about weidt 's life in a series of acclaimed books and articles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inge deutschkron speaking at the opening of the new exhibition in berlin this week , deutschkron said it remained the only authentic site in the german capital where the suffering of the jews during the holocaust could be fully understood .

it says it will likely seek an independent investigation . a documentary on dutch television has accused the country 's national airline , now part of air france , of helping nazis with falsified documents or without proper papers to escape to argentina via switzerland after world war two .
on tuesday , the airline said it would likely seek an independent investigation into the matter .
the dutch filmmakers said they had unearthed documents which showed that a local klm representative asked the swiss border police in 1948 to allow passengers from germany to enter the country without proper papers so that they could fly on to argentina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klm is now part of air france sander rietveld from dutch program netwerk told the times newspaper that although one of the documents showed that the klm representative 's request had been refused by the swiss border police , many germans were allowed to enter switzerland without permission .
" the point is that it shows klm actively approached the swiss police , " he said .
argentina a safe haven for war criminals suspected war criminals were forbidden from leaving germany after the end of the war by the allied powers .
however argentina harbored several of them when president juan peron was in power between 1945 and 1955 .
among the more than 150 nazis who were offered refuge in the country were adolf eichmann , considered the chief mastermind of the holocaust as well as josef mengele , the notorious nazi camp doctor dubbed the " angel of death . "

a klm spokesman , bart koster , told the bbc that the airline had no record of the former employee in switzerland mentioned in the television documentary .
" we have no information whatsoever that our board was actively involved , " koster said .
" however , it can not be excluded that klm representatives were not involved at a local level . "
klm under pressure since the airing of the documentary last week , the issue has been the subject of intense debate in the netherlands .
the affair is a sensitive one because of the possible involvement of a dutch royal family member . prince bernhard , the father of queen beatrix , was the director of klm at the time .
some dutch politicians , historians and jewish groups are urging the airline to conduct an independent probe into the allegations and come clean about its past .
klm has indicated it will likely begin such an investigation .
" we take these signals seriously and if we are a responsible company , we should also be responsible for what has been done in the past , " koster told news agency reuters .

officials said germany 's performance in 2006 was much better than expected .
the commission had originally said the german budget deficit in 2006 would stand at three percent of gdp .

steinbrück also said that the additional tax take for the whole country - including the federal government , the 16 states and the local authorities - could amount to 200 billion euros .

it says it will likely seek an independent investigation . a documentary on dutch television has accused the country 's national airline , now part of air france , of helping nazis with falsified documents or without proper papers to escape to argentina via switzerland after world war two .
on tuesday , the airline said it would likely seek an independent investigation into the matter .
the dutch filmmakers said they had unearthed documents which showed that a local klm representative asked the swiss border police in 1948 to allow passengers from germany to enter the country without proper papers so that they could fly on to argentina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klm is now part of air france sander rietveld from dutch program netwerk told the times newspaper that although one of the documents showed that the klm representative 's request had been refused by the swiss border police , many germans were allowed to enter switzerland without permission .
" the point is that it shows klm actively approached the swiss police , " he said .
argentina a safe haven for war criminals suspected war criminals were forbidden from leaving germany after the end of the war by the allied powers .
however argentina harbored several of them when president juan peron was in power between 1945 and 1955 .
among the more than 150 nazis who were offered refuge in the country were adolf eichmann , considered the chief mastermind of the holocaust as well as josef mengele , the notorious nazi camp doctor dubbed the " angel of death . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef mengele also found refuge in argentina klm has said it has never found evidence in its own archives of flying nazis to argentina .
the airline however has not ruled out being possibly involved in the affair .
a klm spokesman , bart koster , told the bbc that the airline had no record of the former employee in switzerland mentioned in the television documentary .
" we have no information whatsoever that our board was actively involved , " koster said .
" however , it can not be excluded that klm representatives were not involved at a local level . "
klm under pressure since the airing of the documentary last week , the issue has been the subject of intense debate in the netherlands .
the affair is a sensitive one because of the possible involvement of a dutch royal family member . prince bernhard , the father of queen beatrix , was the director of klm at the time .
some dutch politicians , historians and jewish groups are urging the airline to conduct an independent probe into the allegations and come clean about its past .
klm has indicated it will likely begin such an investigation .
" we take these signals seriously and if we are a responsible company , we should also be responsible for what has been done in the past , " koster told news agency reuters .

his arrest in november 1982 sent a wave of relief through the public - and it 's no wonder , considering the trail of blood the raf had already left behind .
christian klar has not been pardoned .
he will remain in prison for the rest of his minimum term of 26 years , until january 2009 .
german president horst köhler no doubt gave his decision careful consideration .
he consulted with german justice minister brigitte zypries and chief federal prosecutor monika harms about the issue .
he reviewed an expert report on klar .
he spoke with family members of raf victims , and he spoke with klar himself .
not the easy route köhler did not take the easy way out , and that in itself is reason to wish that he would not have reaped the senseless criticism that he did from his own christian democratic party , as well as the threats that he would not be re-elected if he pardoned klar .
so köhler denied klar clemency , and even though the president is free to make his own choices , one could consider this one a mistake .
the expert who evaluated klar considered it unlikely that the 54-year-old former terrorist would use weapons again against representatives of the economic and political elite .
it is also improbable that that estimation will change in the next year and a half when klar becomes eligible for parole .
one may consider klar to be blinded by his aversion to the capitalistic system - a stance he will presumably keep - but that is not a crime .
tumult what of course remains significant are the feelings of the families of raf victims .
however , a human life can never be valued in numbers - not with 24 , but also not with the 26-year jail term that the culprit received for extinguishing that life .
german society was indeed thrown into a crisis by the terrorist acts of the raf 30 years ago .
the terrorists , the murderers and the kidnappers all came from the heart of that society .
and given the force of the debate about klar 's plea for clemency , a sense of the rift of those former times can still be felt today .
perhaps a pardon for klar could have helped to bridge that gap .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the red army faction - 10 years after its dissolution judge issues arrest warrants for former raf terrorists former red army faction leader mohnhaupt wants new identity german court orders former raf terrorist released on parole german president rejects ex-raf terrorist 's plea for clemency society -pipe- 08.05.2007 opinion : clemency for ex-terrorist could have bridged gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after thoughtful deliberation , says dw correspondent heinz dylong , german president horst köhler denied former red army faction terrorist christian klar 's request for clemency - but will it make a difference ? there 's no question that christian klar was one of the most determined and brutal of all the red army faction terrorists .
his arrest in november 1982 sent a wave of relief through the public - and it 's no wonder , considering the trail of blood the raf had already left behind .
christian klar has not been pardoned .
he will remain in prison for the rest of his minimum term of 26 years , until january 2009 .
german president horst köhler no doubt gave his decision careful consideration .
he consulted with german justice minister brigitte zypries and chief federal prosecutor monika harms about the issue .
he reviewed an expert report on klar .
he spoke with family members of raf victims , and he spoke with klar himself .
not the easy route köhler did not take the easy way out , and that in itself is reason to wish that he would not have reaped the senseless criticism that he did from his own christian democratic party , as well as the threats that he would not be re-elected if he pardoned klar .
so köhler denied klar clemency , and even though the president is free to make his own choices , one could consider this one a mistake .
the expert who evaluated klar considered it unlikely that the 54-year-old former terrorist would use weapons again against representatives of the economic and political elite .
it is also improbable that that estimation will change in the next year and a half when klar becomes eligible for parole .
one may consider klar to be blinded by his aversion to the capitalistic system - a stance he will presumably keep - but that is not a crime .
tumult what of course remains significant are the feelings of the families of raf victims .
however , a human life can never be valued in numbers - not with 24 , but also not with the 26-year jail term that the culprit received for extinguishing that life .
german society was indeed thrown into a crisis by the terrorist acts of the raf 30 years ago .
the terrorists , the murderers and the kidnappers all came from the heart of that society .
and given the force of the debate about klar 's plea for clemency , a sense of the rift of those former times can still be felt today .
perhaps a pardon for klar could have helped to bridge that gap .
after all , it 's bit ironic that , of all people , a decisive enemy of the state would appeal to the highest ranking individual of this state once so bloodily contested .

prosecutors in halle are investigating " persons unknown " with a view toward bringing charges . " we 'll try to find out the name of the person responsible , " senior prosecutor peter vogt of the division for the prevention of child pornography told the tv news magazine report mainz .
" this sort of criminal activity is punishable by a term of imprisonment of between three months and five years . " the news magazine documented that juvenile alter egos in the virtual community second life , called avatars , were being used to simulate child sex - and being sold for virtual profits within the alternate reality platform . robin harper , vice president of linden lab , which runs second life , told the television program that the company would investigate who was behind the images and pass on the information to the police . but child-protection activists have criticized linden lab for not programming its site to reject child-sex images , and psychologists worry that such role playing could encourage real cases of child abuse . cyber-rape ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german law prohibits not only real , but " realistic " child porn this is n't the first sex-related controversy surrounding second life .
in recent months , objections have been raised to the alleged " cyber-raping " of users ' avatars . but the presence of depictions of juveniles makes this an especially sensitive case .
the story was picked up by most major german papers , and readers responding to it online have engaged in a heated debate about the legal ramifications . roughly half of the respondents do not think sexual depictions of juvenile avatars warrant police action . " as disgusting as i find the idea of someone enjoying virtual sex with children , " wrote an online reader of the daily newspaper die welt , " we should n't forget one thing : this is about something fictional , a virtual world , and thank god no real child has actually suffered . " some think prosecutors should concentrate on real cases of child abuse and accuse police of an orwellian attempt to punish thoughtcrime .
other users point out that while virtual child sex is illegal in germany , it is n't in the united states . slippery slope ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police have been cracking down on child porn but users on the other side of the issue say that child-sex role playing online could be a first step leading to real child abuse . " if measures to prevent virtual child pornography can protect even one child from being harmed by a pedophile who has made the jump from the virtual to the real , " wrote one online reader of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , " then i would welcome them in any form . " a welt user concurred : " it 's disgusting that this sort of thing is portrayed as harmless , and blame shifted to the prosecutors . " and a fellow respondent simply wrote , " second life is a platform for people who have no first lives .

" there is no plan b .
if we open for changes and new proposals we are opening a pandora 's box , " ahtisaari told a news conference in stockholm .
the former finnish president has presented a plan that would give kosovo and the territory 's ethnic albanian majority internationally supervised independence .
nato troops would provide security while economic assistance would come from the european union .
ahtisaari said he hoped none of the permanent members of the security council would use their veto when the plan comes up for discussion in a few weeks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many outside kosovo 's biggest city , pristina , are farmers the plan has the backing of the eu , the united states and the leaders of the ethnic albanians , who comprise around 90 percent of kosovo 's two million inhabitants .
the eu has said it would only take on the role of supervisor from the un if the security council passes a resolution .
opposition but serbia and russia oppose the plan .
serbia sees the province as its historic heartland and has proposed that kosovo be given monitored autonomy instead .
moscow rejects the plan as a violation of serbia 's territorial integrity and has threatened to use its veto and prevent full un security council backing of the proposal .
russia has said serbia and kosovo should continue talks until they reach a compromise .
however , ahtisaari told the news conference that he thought russia was starting to recognize that a negotiated settlement between serbia and kosovo was impossible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ethnic serb woman leaving her home burned by ethnic albanians in kosovo " if i had proposed independence without any international presence , then i would accept the -lrb- russian -rrb- criticism , " he said .
" but the un will be replaced by the eu ... so it really is a compromise . "
in addition , ahtisaari said he would not consider any changes to his proposal .
tough talks " i have done my duty , " he said .
" now it 's up to the security council to see how it can actually get the process through . "
the peace broker can boast a long list of achievements .
he participated in talks that saw namibia become independent from south africa , and organized negotiations between indonesia and the free aceh movement .
however , the envoy said the kosovo talks were the toughest he had ever encountered .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 08.05.2007 berlin exhibition honors little-known nazi opponent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a plaque on rosenthaler strasse in berlin leads the way to the " blindenwerkstatt " museum a new exhibition at a berlin museum - a former brush factory run by a german entrepreneur during the nazi era - throws light on a network of people who tried to save jews from deportation to hitler 's death camps . tucked away in a backyard in berlin 's downtown mitte district amid art galleries , cinemas and bars , the museum " blindenwerkstatt otto weidt " is a former brush workshop run by german entrepreneur otto weidt in the 1940s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt 's brush workshop in the 1940s weidt hired jewish workers - among them blind and disabled employees - in order to save them from deportation to nazi death camps .
since 1999 , the museum has been home to a documentary show of the factory 's history .
this week , the opening of a new permanent exhibition adds further details about factory owner weidt and his string of friends and helpers who rallied to hire jews and even hide some of them in the workshop rooms to save them from the nazis .
weidt 's efforts prove that " it was possible even for apparently powerless people to resist an inhuman regime , " bernd naumann , germany 's deputy culture minister , said during the unveiling of the new exhibition on monday .
" little schindler " weidt 's efforts to aid jews contains echoes of the story of oskar schindler , a german industrialist whose efforts and successes in saving over a thousand jews from the nazis are the subject of oscar-winning film " schindler 's list . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt is sometimes referred to as the " little schindler " sometimes referred to as " little schindler , " weidt 's efforts are believed to have directly saved some 27 lives .
a passionate pacifist who managed to avoid being drafted in the first world war on account of a bad ear , weidt set up his factory in the rosenthalerstrasse in berlin in the early 1940s .
since it mainly supplied its brushes and brooms to hitler 's army , the wehrmacht , and was deemed to be supplying " war essentials , " the factory enjoyed special status at the time - a fact which enabled weidt to bribe nazi officials and falsify documents in order to hire jews .
weidt also smuggled in food packages to jewish families living underground and also helped one former employee flee from the theresienstadt concentration camp .
on occasion , weidt , with the help of friends , also hid entire jewish families in the rooms of his workshop for months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room at the former workshop which served as a hideout one of the centerpieces of the new exhibition is a small windowless room in its original condition which served as a hideout for months for a jewish family .
they were however discovered by the gestapo , the nazi secret police , in 1943 and deported to the auschwitz concentration camp .
remembering " silent heroes " weidt died in 1947 , soon after the end of the second world war , and his and his friends ' efforts to save jewish lives were largely forgotten in the decades after the war .
it was only in the 1990s that the german public became aware of their contribution to nazi-era resistance thanks to inge deutschkron , an 84-year-old german-jewish journalist and writer .
deutschkron , who spent two years in the early 1940s in weidt 's workshop working as a secretary and was given forged documents to escape detection by the nazis , campaigned in 1993 to set up a memorial plaque at the former brush factory .

his arrest in november 1982 sent a wave of relief through the public - and it 's no wonder , considering the trail of blood the raf had already left behind .
christian klar has not been pardoned .
he will remain in prison for the rest of his minimum term of 26 years , until january 2009 .
german president horst köhler no doubt gave his decision careful consideration .
he consulted with german justice minister brigitte zypries and chief federal prosecutor monika harms about the issue .
he reviewed an expert report on klar .
he spoke with family members of raf victims , and he spoke with klar himself .
not the easy route köhler did not take the easy way out , and that in itself is reason to wish that he would not have reaped the senseless criticism that he did from his own christian democratic party , as well as the threats that he would not be re-elected if he pardoned klar .
so köhler denied klar clemency , and even though the president is free to make his own choices , one could consider this one a mistake .
the expert who evaluated klar considered it unlikely that the 54-year-old former terrorist would use weapons again against representatives of the economic and political elite .
it is also improbable that that estimation will change in the next year and a half when klar becomes eligible for parole .
one may consider klar to be blinded by his aversion to the capitalistic system - a stance he will presumably keep - but that is not a crime .
tumult what of course remains significant are the feelings of the families of raf victims .
however , a human life can never be valued in numbers - not with 24 , but also not with the 26-year jail term that the culprit received for extinguishing that life .
german society was indeed thrown into a crisis by the terrorist acts of the raf 30 years ago .
the terrorists , the murderers and the kidnappers all came from the heart of that society .
and given the force of the debate about klar 's plea for clemency , a sense of the rift of those former times can still be felt today .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the red army faction - 10 years after its dissolution judge issues arrest warrants for former raf terrorists former red army faction leader mohnhaupt wants new identity german court orders former raf terrorist released on parole german president rejects ex-raf terrorist 's plea for clemency society -pipe- 08.05.2007 opinion : clemency for ex-terrorist could have bridged gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after thoughtful deliberation , says dw correspondent heinz dylong , german president horst köhler denied former red army faction terrorist christian klar 's request for clemency - but will it make a difference ? there 's no question that christian klar was one of the most determined and brutal of all the red army faction terrorists .
his arrest in november 1982 sent a wave of relief through the public - and it 's no wonder , considering the trail of blood the raf had already left behind .
christian klar has not been pardoned .
he will remain in prison for the rest of his minimum term of 26 years , until january 2009 .
german president horst köhler no doubt gave his decision careful consideration .
he consulted with german justice minister brigitte zypries and chief federal prosecutor monika harms about the issue .
he reviewed an expert report on klar .
he spoke with family members of raf victims , and he spoke with klar himself .
not the easy route köhler did not take the easy way out , and that in itself is reason to wish that he would not have reaped the senseless criticism that he did from his own christian democratic party , as well as the threats that he would not be re-elected if he pardoned klar .
so köhler denied klar clemency , and even though the president is free to make his own choices , one could consider this one a mistake .
the expert who evaluated klar considered it unlikely that the 54-year-old former terrorist would use weapons again against representatives of the economic and political elite .
it is also improbable that that estimation will change in the next year and a half when klar becomes eligible for parole .
one may consider klar to be blinded by his aversion to the capitalistic system - a stance he will presumably keep - but that is not a crime .
tumult what of course remains significant are the feelings of the families of raf victims .
however , a human life can never be valued in numbers - not with 24 , but also not with the 26-year jail term that the culprit received for extinguishing that life .
german society was indeed thrown into a crisis by the terrorist acts of the raf 30 years ago .
the terrorists , the murderers and the kidnappers all came from the heart of that society .
and given the force of the debate about klar 's plea for clemency , a sense of the rift of those former times can still be felt today .
perhaps a pardon for klar could have helped to bridge that gap .
after all , it 's bit ironic that , of all people , a decisive enemy of the state would appeal to the highest ranking individual of this state once so bloodily contested .

around a hundred youths were arrested . hollande made his appeal on tuesday in paris , saying that , although disappointment and frustration at conservative nicolas sarkozy 's election was running high , the only means to effect change in a democracy was through the ballot . " everyone who indulges in these acts of violence only does those people a service who want more order and strictness , " hollande said on rtl-radio .
" but we need dialogue and respect instead of violence , " he added . during the night , a crowd of some 200 youths clashed with police in paris ' place de la bastille .
they broke windows , destroyed telephone booths and set four cars on fire .
similar incidents were reported in the cities of lyon , lille , toulouse , rennes and nantes . but the unrest was less than the night before , which saw 730 vehicles torched and 592 people arrested . sarkozy angered many in 2005 when , as interior minister , he referred to rioting youth in france 's poor , largely minority , suburban housing projects as " rabble " and " scum . " recuperation in malta bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is regrouping before assuming his new office meanwhile , the president-elect was taking a brief vacation in malta to recover from the campaign and plan strategy for when he takes office on may 16 . high on sarkozy 's agenda will be the appointment of a cabinet and most importantly a prime minister .
former social affairs minister francois fillon and current employment and social cohesion minister jean-louis borloo have both been tipped for that post . sarkozy also plans to draft an initial package of reforms to present to the french national assembly . they include cuts in france 's inheritance tax , rules mandating that the jobless to accept work offered to them , and a minimum service guarantee during transportation strikes - measures all likely to attract the ire of french trade unions . stony silence from russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's election could end a period of close russian-french-german cooperation french youths are not the only ones displeased by sarkozy 's triumph .
russia has thus far refused to offer the customary congratulations usually offered to new heads of state . the kremlin has issued no official reaction at all to the election .
but the pro-government newspaper izvestia wrote that a sarkozy presidency could negatively impact french-russian relations . the paper objected to the fact that lawmaker pierre lellouche , a critic of russia 's war against separatist rebels in chechnya , was one of sarkozy 's major advisors .
lellouche was " particularly malicious toward russia , " izvestia wrote , adding that it would be " catastrophic " if he were appointed france 's foreign minister . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : the right revolution in france ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 08.05.2007 berlin exhibition honors little-known nazi opponent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a plaque on rosenthaler strasse in berlin leads the way to the " blindenwerkstatt " museum a new exhibition at a berlin museum - a former brush factory run by a german entrepreneur during the nazi era - throws light on a network of people who tried to save jews from deportation to hitler 's death camps . tucked away in a backyard in berlin 's downtown mitte district amid art galleries , cinemas and bars , the museum " blindenwerkstatt otto weidt " is a former brush workshop run by german entrepreneur otto weidt in the 1940s .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt 's brush workshop in the 1940s weidt hired jewish workers - among them blind and disabled employees - in order to save them from deportation to nazi death camps .
since 1999 , the museum has been home to a documentary show of the factory 's history .
this week , the opening of a new permanent exhibition adds further details about factory owner weidt and his string of friends and helpers who rallied to hire jews and even hide some of them in the workshop rooms to save them from the nazis .
weidt 's efforts prove that " it was possible even for apparently powerless people to resist an inhuman regime , " bernd naumann , germany 's deputy culture minister , said during the unveiling of the new exhibition on monday .
" little schindler " weidt 's efforts to aid jews contains echoes of the story of oskar schindler , a german industrialist whose efforts and successes in saving over a thousand jews from the nazis are the subject of oscar-winning film " schindler 's list . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt is sometimes referred to as the " little schindler " sometimes referred to as " little schindler , " weidt 's efforts are believed to have directly saved some 27 lives .
a passionate pacifist who managed to avoid being drafted in the first world war on account of a bad ear , weidt set up his factory in the rosenthalerstrasse in berlin in the early 1940s .
since it mainly supplied its brushes and brooms to hitler 's army , the wehrmacht , and was deemed to be supplying " war essentials , " the factory enjoyed special status at the time - a fact which enabled weidt to bribe nazi officials and falsify documents in order to hire jews .
weidt also smuggled in food packages to jewish families living underground and also helped one former employee flee from the theresienstadt concentration camp .
on occasion , weidt , with the help of friends , also hid entire jewish families in the rooms of his workshop for months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room at the former workshop which served as a hideout one of the centerpieces of the new exhibition is a small windowless room in its original condition which served as a hideout for months for a jewish family .
they were however discovered by the gestapo , the nazi secret police , in 1943 and deported to the auschwitz concentration camp .
remembering " silent heroes " weidt died in 1947 , soon after the end of the second world war , and his and his friends ' efforts to save jewish lives were largely forgotten in the decades after the war .
it was only in the 1990s that the german public became aware of their contribution to nazi-era resistance thanks to inge deutschkron , an 84-year-old german-jewish journalist and writer .
deutschkron , who spent two years in the early 1940s in weidt 's workshop working as a secretary and was given forged documents to escape detection by the nazis , campaigned in 1993 to set up a memorial plaque at the former brush factory .
she has also written extensively about weidt 's life in a series of acclaimed books and articles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inge deutschkron speaking at the opening of the new exhibition in berlin this week , deutschkron said it remained the only authentic site in the german capital where the suffering of the jews during the holocaust could be fully understood .
andre schmitz , berlin 's deputy culture minister , said the remembrance of the " silent heroes " as well as extensive academic research on their efforts had closed a " painful gap " in germany 's collective memory . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us lawmakers urge opening of vast holocaust archive a us panel has approved a resolution calling for the world 's largest holocaust archive to be quickly opened to the public , saying it could help help counter holocaust deniers like iranian president mohammed ahmadinejad .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt 's brush workshop in the 1940s weidt hired jewish workers - among them blind and disabled employees - in order to save them from deportation to nazi death camps .
since 1999 , the museum has been home to a documentary show of the factory 's history .
this week , the opening of a new permanent exhibition adds further details about factory owner weidt and his string of friends and helpers who rallied to hire jews and even hide some of them in the workshop rooms to save them from the nazis .
weidt 's efforts prove that " it was possible even for apparently powerless people to resist an inhuman regime , " bernd naumann , germany 's deputy culture minister , said during the unveiling of the new exhibition on monday .
" little schindler " weidt 's efforts to aid jews contains echoes of the story of oskar schindler , a german industrialist whose efforts and successes in saving over a thousand jews from the nazis are the subject of oscar-winning film " schindler 's list . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt is sometimes referred to as the " little schindler " sometimes referred to as " little schindler , " weidt 's efforts are believed to have directly saved some 27 lives .
a passionate pacifist who managed to avoid being drafted in the first world war on account of a bad ear , weidt set up his factory in the rosenthalerstrasse in berlin in the early 1940s .
since it mainly supplied its brushes and brooms to hitler 's army , the wehrmacht , and was deemed to be supplying " war essentials , " the factory enjoyed special status at the time - a fact which enabled weidt to bribe nazi officials and falsify documents in order to hire jews .
weidt also smuggled in food packages to jewish families living underground and also helped one former employee flee from the theresienstadt concentration camp .
on occasion , weidt , with the help of friends , also hid entire jewish families in the rooms of his workshop for months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room at the former workshop which served as a hideout one of the centerpieces of the new exhibition is a small windowless room in its original condition which served as a hideout for months for a jewish family .
they were however discovered by the gestapo , the nazi secret police , in 1943 and deported to the auschwitz concentration camp .
remembering " silent heroes " weidt died in 1947 , soon after the end of the second world war , and his and his friends ' efforts to save jewish lives were largely forgotten in the decades after the war .
it was only in the 1990s that the german public became aware of their contribution to nazi-era resistance thanks to inge deutschkron , an 84-year-old german-jewish journalist and writer .
deutschkron , who spent two years in the early 1940s in weidt 's workshop working as a secretary and was given forged documents to escape detection by the nazis , campaigned in 1993 to set up a memorial plaque at the former brush factory .
she has also written extensively about weidt 's life in a series of acclaimed books and articles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inge deutschkron speaking at the opening of the new exhibition in berlin this week , deutschkron said it remained the only authentic site in the german capital where the suffering of the jews during the holocaust could be fully understood .
andre schmitz , berlin 's deputy culture minister , said the remembrance of the " silent heroes " as well as extensive academic research on their efforts had closed a " painful gap " in germany 's collective memory . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us lawmakers urge opening of vast holocaust archive a us panel has approved a resolution calling for the world 's largest holocaust archive to be quickly opened to the public , saying it could help help counter holocaust deniers like iranian president mohammed ahmadinejad .

the estimates " were quickly found to be unrealistic and unfounded hype , " the study published tuesday by the geneva-based international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- said .
" all data , information and expert statements that are available to date strongly indicate that an increase in human trafficking did not occur either during or after the world cup , " the report added .
report urges broader approach currently , some 1,000 people a year are believed to fall victim to sexual exploitation in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red-light district in frankfurt - prostitution is legal in germany " even if it is assumed that only one in ten cases of trafficking is discovered , the 40,000 figure is still unrealistically high , " the report said .
the study said that soccer fans were often couples or families , a fact which had reduced the need for sexual services .
the iom praised germany for the measures taken before the event to try to counter trafficking and hoped this might provide an effective model for organizers to follow at coming events such as uefa euro 2008 in switzerland , the 2010 world cup in south africa and the olympics in beijing .
however the study said that authorities had taken too narrow a perspective and recommended a broader approach in future and urged better profiling of fans .
counter-trafficking activities should also target forced labor , particularly within the construction industry , criminal activities and begging , the report said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges germany to lead in fight against global warming the eu 's environment commissioner stavros dimas has urged germany to take the lead in curbing global warming , saying berlin must be aware of its responsibility as a role model .

" the united nations has asked the german government to stay on in its commanding role for another rotation period , " foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner told a press conference .
" we understand from new york that the request is based on a desire for continuity regarding the mission in lebanon . "
unifil was deployed in the aftermath of israel 's devastating 34-day war last summer on hezbollah guerrillas in lebanon .
its naval component is meant to prevent arms being smuggled to hezbollah by sea and has been headed since october by a contingent of some 850 german sailors .
open to request chief government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said berlin received the un request for an extension in april after chancellor angela merkel indicated during a visit to beirut that germany would consider such a demand .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt 's brush workshop in the 1940s weidt hired jewish workers - among them blind and disabled employees - in order to save them from deportation to nazi death camps .
since 1999 , the museum has been home to a documentary show of the factory 's history .
this week , the opening of a new permanent exhibition adds further details about factory owner weidt and his string of friends and helpers who rallied to hire jews and even hide some of them in the workshop rooms to save them from the nazis .
weidt 's efforts prove that " it was possible even for apparently powerless people to resist an inhuman regime , " bernd naumann , germany 's deputy culture minister , said during the unveiling of the new exhibition on monday .
" little schindler " weidt 's efforts to aid jews contains echoes of the story of oskar schindler , a german industrialist whose efforts and successes in saving over a thousand jews from the nazis are the subject of oscar-winning film " schindler 's list . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt is sometimes referred to as the " little schindler " sometimes referred to as " little schindler , " weidt 's efforts are believed to have directly saved some 27 lives .
a passionate pacifist who managed to avoid being drafted in the first world war on account of a bad ear , weidt set up his factory in the rosenthalerstrasse in berlin in the early 1940s .
since it mainly supplied its brushes and brooms to hitler 's army , the wehrmacht , and was deemed to be supplying " war essentials , " the factory enjoyed special status at the time - a fact which enabled weidt to bribe nazi officials and falsify documents in order to hire jews .
weidt also smuggled in food packages to jewish families living underground and also helped one former employee flee from the theresienstadt concentration camp .
on occasion , weidt , with the help of friends , also hid entire jewish families in the rooms of his workshop for months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room at the former workshop which served as a hideout one of the centerpieces of the new exhibition is a small windowless room in its original condition which served as a hideout for months for a jewish family .
they were however discovered by the gestapo , the nazi secret police , in 1943 and deported to the auschwitz concentration camp .
remembering " silent heroes " weidt died in 1947 , soon after the end of the second world war , and his and his friends ' efforts to save jewish lives were largely forgotten in the decades after the war .
it was only in the 1990s that the german public became aware of their contribution to nazi-era resistance thanks to inge deutschkron , an 84-year-old german-jewish journalist and writer .
deutschkron , who spent two years in the early 1940s in weidt 's workshop working as a secretary and was given forged documents to escape detection by the nazis , campaigned in 1993 to set up a memorial plaque at the former brush factory .
she has also written extensively about weidt 's life in a series of acclaimed books and articles .

it says it will likely seek an independent investigation . a documentary on dutch television has accused the country 's national airline , now part of air france , of helping nazis with falsified documents or without proper papers to escape to argentina via switzerland after world war two .
on tuesday , the airline said it would likely seek an independent investigation into the matter .
the dutch filmmakers said they had unearthed documents which showed that a local klm representative asked the swiss border police in 1948 to allow passengers from germany to enter the country without proper papers so that they could fly on to argentina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klm is now part of air france sander rietveld from dutch program netwerk told the times newspaper that although one of the documents showed that the klm representative 's request had been refused by the swiss border police , many germans were allowed to enter switzerland without permission .
" the point is that it shows klm actively approached the swiss police , " he said .
argentina a safe haven for war criminals suspected war criminals were forbidden from leaving germany after the end of the war by the allied powers .
however argentina harbored several of them when president juan peron was in power between 1945 and 1955 .
among the more than 150 nazis who were offered refuge in the country were adolf eichmann , considered the chief mastermind of the holocaust as well as josef mengele , the notorious nazi camp doctor dubbed the " angel of death . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef mengele also found refuge in argentina klm has said it has never found evidence in its own archives of flying nazis to argentina .
the airline however has not ruled out being possibly involved in the affair .
a klm spokesman , bart koster , told the bbc that the airline had no record of the former employee in switzerland mentioned in the television documentary .
" we have no information whatsoever that our board was actively involved , " koster said .
" however , it can not be excluded that klm representatives were not involved at a local level . "
klm under pressure since the airing of the documentary last week , the issue has been the subject of intense debate in the netherlands .
the affair is a sensitive one because of the possible involvement of a dutch royal family member . prince bernhard , the father of queen beatrix , was the director of klm at the time .
some dutch politicians , historians and jewish groups are urging the airline to conduct an independent probe into the allegations and come clean about its past .
klm has indicated it will likely begin such an investigation .
" we take these signals seriously and if we are a responsible company , we should also be responsible for what has been done in the past , " koster told news agency reuters .

german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee , who currently serves as the responsible eu minister for the program under germany 's eu presidency , expressed his exasperation at a meeting in brussels on monday .
" this monumental project must not suffer any more harm by falling further behind the competition , or , by being threatened altogether , " tiefensee said .
little headway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting around at the push of a button almost two years after being named , a private consortium of industry giants has made so little progress on the project that it is threatening to end up in the airbus a380 category of botched industrial endeavors .
the umbrella group of industry heavyweights includes aena and hispasat of spain , thales and alcatel-lucent from france , european aerospace company eads , italy 's finmeccanica , britain 's inmarsat , deutsche telekom and the german aerospace center , dlr .
the eu commission 's preference now is to take over the project and issue a new tender to operate the system once it is built and launched into space .
this would get the system operating by the end of 2012 - a year , or even two , faster than any other option .
dr. hubert reile , program director for space operations at the german aerospace center , said this will not affect control of the navigation network by the dlr from its oberpfaffenhofen space center in bavaria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax payers will primarily cover galileo costs " for the dlr and for germany , this decision wo n't make much of a difference , " he said .
" it is foreseen that we will have a control center near munich in oberpfaffenhofen , and it makes no difference if it is financed purely by a government or by a private group , " he added .
european version of gps galileo is supposed to be the european answer to the us gps system used as a navigation aid in cars , boats and aircraft .
the four-billion-euro -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- system has suffered a number of setbacks , due to technical problems , which can be solved , said reile , and financial and legal responsibility issues , which none of the private industry participants are willing to shoulder .
" what is really difficult for this project is that more partners are on board than in a normal , big european project , " said reile .
the industries involved have voiced their dismay at such a late change of plans , but they have no one to blame but themselves .
a letter of new demands which the consortium sent to the eu commission only last week made monday 's decision a foregone conclusion .
an eu official close to the project said new conditions , more time and more money would delay satellite orders . matt hermann -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu considers running galileo gps project the european union is to consider taking over the galileo satellite system as it is faced with demands for more time and extra public funds from the project 's private builders , officials said .
-lrb- 05.05.2007 -rrb- eu warns against further delays to galileo system the european commission warned that it will examine new ways to complete the galileo satellite navigation system after the project stalled amid doubts about profitability .
-lrb- 18.03.2007 -rrb- galileo : europe 's biggest infrastructure project five hundred years ago people looked to the stars for navigation , relying on their position in the hemisphere to guide them across the continents and oceans .

german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee , who currently serves as the responsible eu minister for the program under germany 's eu presidency , expressed his exasperation at a meeting in brussels on monday .
" this monumental project must not suffer any more harm by falling further behind the competition , or , by being threatened altogether , " tiefensee said .

the umbrella group of industry heavyweights includes aena and hispasat of spain , thales and alcatel-lucent from france , european aerospace company eads , italy 's finmeccanica , britain 's inmarsat , deutsche telekom and the german aerospace center , dlr .
the eu commission 's preference now is to take over the project and issue a new tender to operate the system once it is built and launched into space .
this would get the system operating by the end of 2012 - a year , or even two , faster than any other option .
dr. hubert reile , program director for space operations at the german aerospace center , said this will not affect control of the navigation network by the dlr from its oberpfaffenhofen space center in bavaria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax payers will primarily cover galileo costs " for the dlr and for germany , this decision wo n't make much of a difference , " he said .
" it is foreseen that we will have a control center near munich in oberpfaffenhofen , and it makes no difference if it is financed purely by a government or by a private group , " he added .
european version of gps galileo is supposed to be the european answer to the us gps system used as a navigation aid in cars , boats and aircraft .
the four-billion-euro -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- system has suffered a number of setbacks , due to technical problems , which can be solved , said reile , and financial and legal responsibility issues , which none of the private industry participants are willing to shoulder .
" what is really difficult for this project is that more partners are on board than in a normal , big european project , " said reile .
the industries involved have voiced their dismay at such a late change of plans , but they have no one to blame but themselves .
a letter of new demands which the consortium sent to the eu commission only last week made monday 's decision a foregone conclusion .

it says it will likely seek an independent investigation . a documentary on dutch television has accused the country 's national airline , now part of air france , of helping nazis with falsified documents or without proper papers to escape to argentina via switzerland after world war two .
on tuesday , the airline said it would likely seek an independent investigation into the matter .
the dutch filmmakers said they had unearthed documents which showed that a local klm representative asked the swiss border police in 1948 to allow passengers from germany to enter the country without proper papers so that they could fly on to argentina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klm is now part of air france sander rietveld from dutch program netwerk told the times newspaper that although one of the documents showed that the klm representative 's request had been refused by the swiss border police , many germans were allowed to enter switzerland without permission .
" the point is that it shows klm actively approached the swiss police , " he said .
argentina a safe haven for war criminals suspected war criminals were forbidden from leaving germany after the end of the war by the allied powers .
however argentina harbored several of them when president juan peron was in power between 1945 and 1955 .
among the more than 150 nazis who were offered refuge in the country were adolf eichmann , considered the chief mastermind of the holocaust as well as josef mengele , the notorious nazi camp doctor dubbed the " angel of death . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef mengele also found refuge in argentina klm has said it has never found evidence in its own archives of flying nazis to argentina .
the airline however has not ruled out being possibly involved in the affair .
a klm spokesman , bart koster , told the bbc that the airline had no record of the former employee in switzerland mentioned in the television documentary .
" we have no information whatsoever that our board was actively involved , " koster said .
" however , it can not be excluded that klm representatives were not involved at a local level . "
klm under pressure since the airing of the documentary last week , the issue has been the subject of intense debate in the netherlands .
the affair is a sensitive one because of the possible involvement of a dutch royal family member . prince bernhard , the father of queen beatrix , was the director of klm at the time .
some dutch politicians , historians and jewish groups are urging the airline to conduct an independent probe into the allegations and come clean about its past .
klm has indicated it will likely begin such an investigation .
" we take these signals seriously and if we are a responsible company , we should also be responsible for what has been done in the past , " koster told news agency reuters .

it says it will likely seek an independent investigation . a documentary on dutch television has accused the country 's national airline , now part of air france , of helping nazis with falsified documents or without proper papers to escape to argentina via switzerland after world war two .
on tuesday , the airline said it would likely seek an independent investigation into the matter .
the dutch filmmakers said they had unearthed documents which showed that a local klm representative asked the swiss border police in 1948 to allow passengers from germany to enter the country without proper papers so that they could fly on to argentina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klm is now part of air france sander rietveld from dutch program netwerk told the times newspaper that although one of the documents showed that the klm representative 's request had been refused by the swiss border police , many germans were allowed to enter switzerland without permission .
" the point is that it shows klm actively approached the swiss police , " he said .
argentina a safe haven for war criminals suspected war criminals were forbidden from leaving germany after the end of the war by the allied powers .
however argentina harbored several of them when president juan peron was in power between 1945 and 1955 .
among the more than 150 nazis who were offered refuge in the country were adolf eichmann , considered the chief mastermind of the holocaust as well as josef mengele , the notorious nazi camp doctor dubbed the " angel of death . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef mengele also found refuge in argentina klm has said it has never found evidence in its own archives of flying nazis to argentina .
the airline however has not ruled out being possibly involved in the affair .
a klm spokesman , bart koster , told the bbc that the airline had no record of the former employee in switzerland mentioned in the television documentary .
" we have no information whatsoever that our board was actively involved , " koster said .
" however , it can not be excluded that klm representatives were not involved at a local level . "
klm under pressure since the airing of the documentary last week , the issue has been the subject of intense debate in the netherlands .
the affair is a sensitive one because of the possible involvement of a dutch royal family member . prince bernhard , the father of queen beatrix , was the director of klm at the time .
some dutch politicians , historians and jewish groups are urging the airline to conduct an independent probe into the allegations and come clean about its past .
klm has indicated it will likely begin such an investigation .
" we take these signals seriously and if we are a responsible company , we should also be responsible for what has been done in the past , " koster told news agency reuters .

german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee , who currently serves as the responsible eu minister for the program under germany 's eu presidency , expressed his exasperation at a meeting in brussels on monday .
" this monumental project must not suffer any more harm by falling further behind the competition , or , by being threatened altogether , " tiefensee said .
little headway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting around at the push of a button almost two years after being named , a private consortium of industry giants has made so little progress on the project that it is threatening to end up in the airbus a380 category of botched industrial endeavors .
the umbrella group of industry heavyweights includes aena and hispasat of spain , thales and alcatel-lucent from france , european aerospace company eads , italy 's finmeccanica , britain 's inmarsat , deutsche telekom and the german aerospace center , dlr .
the eu commission 's preference now is to take over the project and issue a new tender to operate the system once it is built and launched into space .
this would get the system operating by the end of 2012 - a year , or even two , faster than any other option .
dr. hubert reile , program director for space operations at the german aerospace center , said this will not affect control of the navigation network by the dlr from its oberpfaffenhofen space center in bavaria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax payers will primarily cover galileo costs " for the dlr and for germany , this decision wo n't make much of a difference , " he said .
" it is foreseen that we will have a control center near munich in oberpfaffenhofen , and it makes no difference if it is financed purely by a government or by a private group , " he added .
european version of gps galileo is supposed to be the european answer to the us gps system used as a navigation aid in cars , boats and aircraft .
the four-billion-euro -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- system has suffered a number of setbacks , due to technical problems , which can be solved , said reile , and financial and legal responsibility issues , which none of the private industry participants are willing to shoulder .
" what is really difficult for this project is that more partners are on board than in a normal , big european project , " said reile .
the industries involved have voiced their dismay at such a late change of plans , but they have no one to blame but themselves .
a letter of new demands which the consortium sent to the eu commission only last week made monday 's decision a foregone conclusion .
an eu official close to the project said new conditions , more time and more money would delay satellite orders . matt hermann -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu considers running galileo gps project the european union is to consider taking over the galileo satellite system as it is faced with demands for more time and extra public funds from the project 's private builders , officials said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 08.05.2007 eu takes over galileo global navigation system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : galileo is europe 's answer to gps tired of the bickering and lack of progress on one of europe 's premier projects , the european commission has decided to take the reins of control for the galileo satellite navigation system away from private industry . the european commission has proposed that the public sector , rather than industry , assume the responsibility for a european union satellite navigation system that has been stalled due to legal , financial and technical problems .
german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee , who currently serves as the responsible eu minister for the program under germany 's eu presidency , expressed his exasperation at a meeting in brussels on monday .
" this monumental project must not suffer any more harm by falling further behind the competition , or , by being threatened altogether , " tiefensee said .
little headway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting around at the push of a button almost two years after being named , a private consortium of industry giants has made so little progress on the project that it is threatening to end up in the airbus a380 category of botched industrial endeavors .
the umbrella group of industry heavyweights includes aena and hispasat of spain , thales and alcatel-lucent from france , european aerospace company eads , italy 's finmeccanica , britain 's inmarsat , deutsche telekom and the german aerospace center , dlr .
the eu commission 's preference now is to take over the project and issue a new tender to operate the system once it is built and launched into space .
this would get the system operating by the end of 2012 - a year , or even two , faster than any other option .
dr. hubert reile , program director for space operations at the german aerospace center , said this will not affect control of the navigation network by the dlr from its oberpfaffenhofen space center in bavaria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax payers will primarily cover galileo costs " for the dlr and for germany , this decision wo n't make much of a difference , " he said .
" it is foreseen that we will have a control center near munich in oberpfaffenhofen , and it makes no difference if it is financed purely by a government or by a private group , " he added .
european version of gps galileo is supposed to be the european answer to the us gps system used as a navigation aid in cars , boats and aircraft .
the four-billion-euro -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- system has suffered a number of setbacks , due to technical problems , which can be solved , said reile , and financial and legal responsibility issues , which none of the private industry participants are willing to shoulder .
" what is really difficult for this project is that more partners are on board than in a normal , big european project , " said reile .
the industries involved have voiced their dismay at such a late change of plans , but they have no one to blame but themselves .
a letter of new demands which the consortium sent to the eu commission only last week made monday 's decision a foregone conclusion .
an eu official close to the project said new conditions , more time and more money would delay satellite orders . matt hermann -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu considers running galileo gps project the european union is to consider taking over the galileo satellite system as it is faced with demands for more time and extra public funds from the project 's private builders , officials said .
-lrb- 05.05.2007 -rrb- eu warns against further delays to galileo system the european commission warned that it will examine new ways to complete the galileo satellite navigation system after the project stalled amid doubts about profitability .
-lrb- 18.03.2007 -rrb- galileo : europe 's biggest infrastructure project five hundred years ago people looked to the stars for navigation , relying on their position in the hemisphere to guide them across the continents and oceans .
today , the stars have been replaced by satellites .

the estimates " were quickly found to be unrealistic and unfounded hype , " the study published tuesday by the geneva-based international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- said .
" all data , information and expert statements that are available to date strongly indicate that an increase in human trafficking did not occur either during or after the world cup , " the report added .

the study said that soccer fans were often couples or families , a fact which had reduced the need for sexual services .
the iom praised germany for the measures taken before the event to try to counter trafficking and hoped this might provide an effective model for organizers to follow at coming events such as uefa euro 2008 in switzerland , the 2010 world cup in south africa and the olympics in beijing .
however the study said that authorities had taken too narrow a perspective and recommended a broader approach in future and urged better profiling of fans .

the estimates " were quickly found to be unrealistic and unfounded hype , " the study published tuesday by the geneva-based international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- said .
" all data , information and expert statements that are available to date strongly indicate that an increase in human trafficking did not occur either during or after the world cup , " the report added .
report urges broader approach currently , some 1,000 people a year are believed to fall victim to sexual exploitation in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red-light district in frankfurt - prostitution is legal in germany " even if it is assumed that only one in ten cases of trafficking is discovered , the 40,000 figure is still unrealistically high , " the report said .
the study said that soccer fans were often couples or families , a fact which had reduced the need for sexual services .
the iom praised germany for the measures taken before the event to try to counter trafficking and hoped this might provide an effective model for organizers to follow at coming events such as uefa euro 2008 in switzerland , the 2010 world cup in south africa and the olympics in beijing .
however the study said that authorities had taken too narrow a perspective and recommended a broader approach in future and urged better profiling of fans .
counter-trafficking activities should also target forced labor , particularly within the construction industry , criminal activities and begging , the report said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges germany to lead in fight against global warming the eu 's environment commissioner stavros dimas has urged germany to take the lead in curbing global warming , saying berlin must be aware of its responsibility as a role model .

the former finnish president has presented a plan that would give kosovo and the territory 's ethnic albanian majority internationally supervised independence .

ahtisaari said he hoped none of the permanent members of the security council would use their veto when the plan comes up for discussion in a few weeks .

serbia sees the province as its historic heartland and has proposed that kosovo be given monitored autonomy instead .
moscow rejects the plan as a violation of serbia 's territorial integrity and has threatened to use its veto and prevent full un security council backing of the proposal .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt 's brush workshop in the 1940s weidt hired jewish workers - among them blind and disabled employees - in order to save them from deportation to nazi death camps .
since 1999 , the museum has been home to a documentary show of the factory 's history .
this week , the opening of a new permanent exhibition adds further details about factory owner weidt and his string of friends and helpers who rallied to hire jews and even hide some of them in the workshop rooms to save them from the nazis .
weidt 's efforts prove that " it was possible even for apparently powerless people to resist an inhuman regime , " bernd naumann , germany 's deputy culture minister , said during the unveiling of the new exhibition on monday .
" little schindler " weidt 's efforts to aid jews contains echoes of the story of oskar schindler , a german industrialist whose efforts and successes in saving over a thousand jews from the nazis are the subject of oscar-winning film " schindler 's list . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt is sometimes referred to as the " little schindler " sometimes referred to as " little schindler , " weidt 's efforts are believed to have directly saved some 27 lives .
a passionate pacifist who managed to avoid being drafted in the first world war on account of a bad ear , weidt set up his factory in the rosenthalerstrasse in berlin in the early 1940s .
since it mainly supplied its brushes and brooms to hitler 's army , the wehrmacht , and was deemed to be supplying " war essentials , " the factory enjoyed special status at the time - a fact which enabled weidt to bribe nazi officials and falsify documents in order to hire jews .
weidt also smuggled in food packages to jewish families living underground and also helped one former employee flee from the theresienstadt concentration camp .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt 's brush workshop in the 1940s weidt hired jewish workers - among them blind and disabled employees - in order to save them from deportation to nazi death camps .
since 1999 , the museum has been home to a documentary show of the factory 's history .
this week , the opening of a new permanent exhibition adds further details about factory owner weidt and his string of friends and helpers who rallied to hire jews and even hide some of them in the workshop rooms to save them from the nazis .
weidt 's efforts prove that " it was possible even for apparently powerless people to resist an inhuman regime , " bernd naumann , germany 's deputy culture minister , said during the unveiling of the new exhibition on monday .
" little schindler " weidt 's efforts to aid jews contains echoes of the story of oskar schindler , a german industrialist whose efforts and successes in saving over a thousand jews from the nazis are the subject of oscar-winning film " schindler 's list . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt is sometimes referred to as the " little schindler " sometimes referred to as " little schindler , " weidt 's efforts are believed to have directly saved some 27 lives .
a passionate pacifist who managed to avoid being drafted in the first world war on account of a bad ear , weidt set up his factory in the rosenthalerstrasse in berlin in the early 1940s .
since it mainly supplied its brushes and brooms to hitler 's army , the wehrmacht , and was deemed to be supplying " war essentials , " the factory enjoyed special status at the time - a fact which enabled weidt to bribe nazi officials and falsify documents in order to hire jews .
weidt also smuggled in food packages to jewish families living underground and also helped one former employee flee from the theresienstadt concentration camp .
on occasion , weidt , with the help of friends , also hid entire jewish families in the rooms of his workshop for months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room at the former workshop which served as a hideout one of the centerpieces of the new exhibition is a small windowless room in its original condition which served as a hideout for months for a jewish family .
they were however discovered by the gestapo , the nazi secret police , in 1943 and deported to the auschwitz concentration camp .
remembering " silent heroes " weidt died in 1947 , soon after the end of the second world war , and his and his friends ' efforts to save jewish lives were largely forgotten in the decades after the war .
it was only in the 1990s that the german public became aware of their contribution to nazi-era resistance thanks to inge deutschkron , an 84-year-old german-jewish journalist and writer .
deutschkron , who spent two years in the early 1940s in weidt 's workshop working as a secretary and was given forged documents to escape detection by the nazis , campaigned in 1993 to set up a memorial plaque at the former brush factory .
she has also written extensively about weidt 's life in a series of acclaimed books and articles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inge deutschkron speaking at the opening of the new exhibition in berlin this week , deutschkron said it remained the only authentic site in the german capital where the suffering of the jews during the holocaust could be fully understood .

the estimates " were quickly found to be unrealistic and unfounded hype , " the study published tuesday by the geneva-based international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- said .
" all data , information and expert statements that are available to date strongly indicate that an increase in human trafficking did not occur either during or after the world cup , " the report added .
report urges broader approach currently , some 1,000 people a year are believed to fall victim to sexual exploitation in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red-light district in frankfurt - prostitution is legal in germany " even if it is assumed that only one in ten cases of trafficking is discovered , the 40,000 figure is still unrealistically high , " the report said .
the study said that soccer fans were often couples or families , a fact which had reduced the need for sexual services .
the iom praised germany for the measures taken before the event to try to counter trafficking and hoped this might provide an effective model for organizers to follow at coming events such as uefa euro 2008 in switzerland , the 2010 world cup in south africa and the olympics in beijing .
however the study said that authorities had taken too narrow a perspective and recommended a broader approach in future and urged better profiling of fans .
counter-trafficking activities should also target forced labor , particularly within the construction industry , criminal activities and begging , the report said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges germany to lead in fight against global warming the eu 's environment commissioner stavros dimas has urged germany to take the lead in curbing global warming , saying berlin must be aware of its responsibility as a role model .
-lrb- 04.02.2007 -rrb- europe mulls standard way to deal with prostitution the council of europe is looking for ways to standardize laws on prostitution on the continent .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt 's brush workshop in the 1940s weidt hired jewish workers - among them blind and disabled employees - in order to save them from deportation to nazi death camps .
since 1999 , the museum has been home to a documentary show of the factory 's history .
this week , the opening of a new permanent exhibition adds further details about factory owner weidt and his string of friends and helpers who rallied to hire jews and even hide some of them in the workshop rooms to save them from the nazis .
weidt 's efforts prove that " it was possible even for apparently powerless people to resist an inhuman regime , " bernd naumann , germany 's deputy culture minister , said during the unveiling of the new exhibition on monday .
" little schindler " weidt 's efforts to aid jews contains echoes of the story of oskar schindler , a german industrialist whose efforts and successes in saving over a thousand jews from the nazis are the subject of oscar-winning film " schindler 's list . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt is sometimes referred to as the " little schindler " sometimes referred to as " little schindler , " weidt 's efforts are believed to have directly saved some 27 lives .
a passionate pacifist who managed to avoid being drafted in the first world war on account of a bad ear , weidt set up his factory in the rosenthalerstrasse in berlin in the early 1940s .
since it mainly supplied its brushes and brooms to hitler 's army , the wehrmacht , and was deemed to be supplying " war essentials , " the factory enjoyed special status at the time - a fact which enabled weidt to bribe nazi officials and falsify documents in order to hire jews .
weidt also smuggled in food packages to jewish families living underground and also helped one former employee flee from the theresienstadt concentration camp .
on occasion , weidt , with the help of friends , also hid entire jewish families in the rooms of his workshop for months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room at the former workshop which served as a hideout one of the centerpieces of the new exhibition is a small windowless room in its original condition which served as a hideout for months for a jewish family .
they were however discovered by the gestapo , the nazi secret police , in 1943 and deported to the auschwitz concentration camp .
remembering " silent heroes " weidt died in 1947 , soon after the end of the second world war , and his and his friends ' efforts to save jewish lives were largely forgotten in the decades after the war .
it was only in the 1990s that the german public became aware of their contribution to nazi-era resistance thanks to inge deutschkron , an 84-year-old german-jewish journalist and writer .
deutschkron , who spent two years in the early 1940s in weidt 's workshop working as a secretary and was given forged documents to escape detection by the nazis , campaigned in 1993 to set up a memorial plaque at the former brush factory .
she has also written extensively about weidt 's life in a series of acclaimed books and articles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inge deutschkron speaking at the opening of the new exhibition in berlin this week , deutschkron said it remained the only authentic site in the german capital where the suffering of the jews during the holocaust could be fully understood .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt 's brush workshop in the 1940s weidt hired jewish workers - among them blind and disabled employees - in order to save them from deportation to nazi death camps .
since 1999 , the museum has been home to a documentary show of the factory 's history .
this week , the opening of a new permanent exhibition adds further details about factory owner weidt and his string of friends and helpers who rallied to hire jews and even hide some of them in the workshop rooms to save them from the nazis .
weidt 's efforts prove that " it was possible even for apparently powerless people to resist an inhuman regime , " bernd naumann , germany 's deputy culture minister , said during the unveiling of the new exhibition on monday .
" little schindler " weidt 's efforts to aid jews contains echoes of the story of oskar schindler , a german industrialist whose efforts and successes in saving over a thousand jews from the nazis are the subject of oscar-winning film " schindler 's list . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt is sometimes referred to as the " little schindler " sometimes referred to as " little schindler , " weidt 's efforts are believed to have directly saved some 27 lives .
a passionate pacifist who managed to avoid being drafted in the first world war on account of a bad ear , weidt set up his factory in the rosenthalerstrasse in berlin in the early 1940s .
since it mainly supplied its brushes and brooms to hitler 's army , the wehrmacht , and was deemed to be supplying " war essentials , " the factory enjoyed special status at the time - a fact which enabled weidt to bribe nazi officials and falsify documents in order to hire jews .
weidt also smuggled in food packages to jewish families living underground and also helped one former employee flee from the theresienstadt concentration camp .
on occasion , weidt , with the help of friends , also hid entire jewish families in the rooms of his workshop for months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room at the former workshop which served as a hideout one of the centerpieces of the new exhibition is a small windowless room in its original condition which served as a hideout for months for a jewish family .
they were however discovered by the gestapo , the nazi secret police , in 1943 and deported to the auschwitz concentration camp .
remembering " silent heroes " weidt died in 1947 , soon after the end of the second world war , and his and his friends ' efforts to save jewish lives were largely forgotten in the decades after the war .
it was only in the 1990s that the german public became aware of their contribution to nazi-era resistance thanks to inge deutschkron , an 84-year-old german-jewish journalist and writer .
deutschkron , who spent two years in the early 1940s in weidt 's workshop working as a secretary and was given forged documents to escape detection by the nazis , campaigned in 1993 to set up a memorial plaque at the former brush factory .
she has also written extensively about weidt 's life in a series of acclaimed books and articles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inge deutschkron speaking at the opening of the new exhibition in berlin this week , deutschkron said it remained the only authentic site in the german capital where the suffering of the jews during the holocaust could be fully understood .
andre schmitz , berlin 's deputy culture minister , said the remembrance of the " silent heroes " as well as extensive academic research on their efforts had closed a " painful gap " in germany 's collective memory . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us lawmakers urge opening of vast holocaust archive a us panel has approved a resolution calling for the world 's largest holocaust archive to be quickly opened to the public , saying it could help help counter holocaust deniers like iranian president mohammed ahmadinejad .

the study said that soccer fans were often couples or families , a fact which had reduced the need for sexual services .

" there is no plan b .
if we open for changes and new proposals we are opening a pandora 's box , " ahtisaari told a news conference in stockholm .
the former finnish president has presented a plan that would give kosovo and the territory 's ethnic albanian majority internationally supervised independence .
nato troops would provide security while economic assistance would come from the european union .
ahtisaari said he hoped none of the permanent members of the security council would use their veto when the plan comes up for discussion in a few weeks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many outside kosovo 's biggest city , pristina , are farmers the plan has the backing of the eu , the united states and the leaders of the ethnic albanians , who comprise around 90 percent of kosovo 's two million inhabitants .
the eu has said it would only take on the role of supervisor from the un if the security council passes a resolution .
opposition but serbia and russia oppose the plan .
serbia sees the province as its historic heartland and has proposed that kosovo be given monitored autonomy instead .
moscow rejects the plan as a violation of serbia 's territorial integrity and has threatened to use its veto and prevent full un security council backing of the proposal .
russia has said serbia and kosovo should continue talks until they reach a compromise .
however , ahtisaari told the news conference that he thought russia was starting to recognize that a negotiated settlement between serbia and kosovo was impossible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ethnic serb woman leaving her home burned by ethnic albanians in kosovo " if i had proposed independence without any international presence , then i would accept the -lrb- russian -rrb- criticism , " he said .
" but the un will be replaced by the eu ... so it really is a compromise . "
in addition , ahtisaari said he would not consider any changes to his proposal .
tough talks " i have done my duty , " he said .
" now it 's up to the security council to see how it can actually get the process through . "
the peace broker can boast a long list of achievements .
he participated in talks that saw namibia become independent from south africa , and organized negotiations between indonesia and the free aceh movement .
however , the envoy said the kosovo talks were the toughest he had ever encountered .

german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee , who currently serves as the responsible eu minister for the program under germany 's eu presidency , expressed his exasperation at a meeting in brussels on monday .
" this monumental project must not suffer any more harm by falling further behind the competition , or , by being threatened altogether , " tiefensee said .
little headway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting around at the push of a button almost two years after being named , a private consortium of industry giants has made so little progress on the project that it is threatening to end up in the airbus a380 category of botched industrial endeavors .
the umbrella group of industry heavyweights includes aena and hispasat of spain , thales and alcatel-lucent from france , european aerospace company eads , italy 's finmeccanica , britain 's inmarsat , deutsche telekom and the german aerospace center , dlr .
the eu commission 's preference now is to take over the project and issue a new tender to operate the system once it is built and launched into space .
this would get the system operating by the end of 2012 - a year , or even two , faster than any other option .
dr. hubert reile , program director for space operations at the german aerospace center , said this will not affect control of the navigation network by the dlr from its oberpfaffenhofen space center in bavaria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax payers will primarily cover galileo costs " for the dlr and for germany , this decision wo n't make much of a difference , " he said .
" it is foreseen that we will have a control center near munich in oberpfaffenhofen , and it makes no difference if it is financed purely by a government or by a private group , " he added .
european version of gps galileo is supposed to be the european answer to the us gps system used as a navigation aid in cars , boats and aircraft .
the four-billion-euro -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- system has suffered a number of setbacks , due to technical problems , which can be solved , said reile , and financial and legal responsibility issues , which none of the private industry participants are willing to shoulder .
" what is really difficult for this project is that more partners are on board than in a normal , big european project , " said reile .
the industries involved have voiced their dismay at such a late change of plans , but they have no one to blame but themselves .
a letter of new demands which the consortium sent to the eu commission only last week made monday 's decision a foregone conclusion .
an eu official close to the project said new conditions , more time and more money would delay satellite orders . matt hermann -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu considers running galileo gps project the european union is to consider taking over the galileo satellite system as it is faced with demands for more time and extra public funds from the project 's private builders , officials said .

it says it will likely seek an independent investigation . a documentary on dutch television has accused the country 's national airline , now part of air france , of helping nazis with falsified documents or without proper papers to escape to argentina via switzerland after world war two .
on tuesday , the airline said it would likely seek an independent investigation into the matter .
the dutch filmmakers said they had unearthed documents which showed that a local klm representative asked the swiss border police in 1948 to allow passengers from germany to enter the country without proper papers so that they could fly on to argentina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klm is now part of air france sander rietveld from dutch program netwerk told the times newspaper that although one of the documents showed that the klm representative 's request had been refused by the swiss border police , many germans were allowed to enter switzerland without permission .
" the point is that it shows klm actively approached the swiss police , " he said .
argentina a safe haven for war criminals suspected war criminals were forbidden from leaving germany after the end of the war by the allied powers .
however argentina harbored several of them when president juan peron was in power between 1945 and 1955 .
among the more than 150 nazis who were offered refuge in the country were adolf eichmann , considered the chief mastermind of the holocaust as well as josef mengele , the notorious nazi camp doctor dubbed the " angel of death . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef mengele also found refuge in argentina klm has said it has never found evidence in its own archives of flying nazis to argentina .
the airline however has not ruled out being possibly involved in the affair .
a klm spokesman , bart koster , told the bbc that the airline had no record of the former employee in switzerland mentioned in the television documentary .
" we have no information whatsoever that our board was actively involved , " koster said .
" however , it can not be excluded that klm representatives were not involved at a local level . "
klm under pressure since the airing of the documentary last week , the issue has been the subject of intense debate in the netherlands .
the affair is a sensitive one because of the possible involvement of a dutch royal family member . prince bernhard , the father of queen beatrix , was the director of klm at the time .
some dutch politicians , historians and jewish groups are urging the airline to conduct an independent probe into the allegations and come clean about its past .
klm has indicated it will likely begin such an investigation .
" we take these signals seriously and if we are a responsible company , we should also be responsible for what has been done in the past , " koster told news agency reuters .
the allegations against klm come a year after the dutch national railway company apologized for its role in deporting thousands of jews to nazi death camps . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us lawmakers urge opening of vast holocaust archive a us panel has approved a resolution calling for the world 's largest holocaust archive to be quickly opened to the public , saying it could help help counter holocaust deniers like iranian president mohammed ahmadinejad .

this week , the opening of a new permanent exhibition adds further details about factory owner weidt and his string of friends and helpers who rallied to hire jews and even hide some of them in the workshop rooms to save them from the nazis .
weidt 's efforts prove that " it was possible even for apparently powerless people to resist an inhuman regime , " bernd naumann , germany 's deputy culture minister , said during the unveiling of the new exhibition on monday .
" little schindler " weidt 's efforts to aid jews contains echoes of the story of oskar schindler , a german industrialist whose efforts and successes in saving over a thousand jews from the nazis are the subject of oscar-winning film " schindler 's list . "

a passionate pacifist who managed to avoid being drafted in the first world war on account of a bad ear , weidt set up his factory in the rosenthalerstrasse in berlin in the early 1940s .
since it mainly supplied its brushes and brooms to hitler 's army , the wehrmacht , and was deemed to be supplying " war essentials , " the factory enjoyed special status at the time - a fact which enabled weidt to bribe nazi officials and falsify documents in order to hire jews .
weidt also smuggled in food packages to jewish families living underground and also helped one former employee flee from the theresienstadt concentration camp .
on occasion , weidt , with the help of friends , also hid entire jewish families in the rooms of his workshop for months .

it was only in the 1990s that the german public became aware of their contribution to nazi-era resistance thanks to inge deutschkron , an 84-year-old german-jewish journalist and writer .
deutschkron , who spent two years in the early 1940s in weidt 's workshop working as a secretary and was given forged documents to escape detection by the nazis , campaigned in 1993 to set up a memorial plaque at the former brush factory .

officials said germany 's performance in 2006 was much better than expected .
the commission had originally said the german budget deficit in 2006 would stand at three percent of gdp .
the commission said the better-than-expected results were due to higher german tax revenues .

steinbrück also said that the additional tax take for the whole country - including the federal government , the 16 states and the local authorities - could amount to 200 billion euros .
the minister warned , however , that the additional revenue had to be devoted primarily to consolidating the budget after years of running deficits that exceeded of european union norms .

" a welt user concurred : " it 's disgusting that this sort of thing is portrayed as harmless , and blame shifted to the prosecutors .

german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee , who currently serves as the responsible eu minister for the program under germany 's eu presidency , expressed his exasperation at a meeting in brussels on monday .
" this monumental project must not suffer any more harm by falling further behind the competition , or , by being threatened altogether , " tiefensee said .
little headway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting around at the push of a button almost two years after being named , a private consortium of industry giants has made so little progress on the project that it is threatening to end up in the airbus a380 category of botched industrial endeavors .
the umbrella group of industry heavyweights includes aena and hispasat of spain , thales and alcatel-lucent from france , european aerospace company eads , italy 's finmeccanica , britain 's inmarsat , deutsche telekom and the german aerospace center , dlr .
the eu commission 's preference now is to take over the project and issue a new tender to operate the system once it is built and launched into space .
this would get the system operating by the end of 2012 - a year , or even two , faster than any other option .
dr. hubert reile , program director for space operations at the german aerospace center , said this will not affect control of the navigation network by the dlr from its oberpfaffenhofen space center in bavaria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax payers will primarily cover galileo costs " for the dlr and for germany , this decision wo n't make much of a difference , " he said .
" it is foreseen that we will have a control center near munich in oberpfaffenhofen , and it makes no difference if it is financed purely by a government or by a private group , " he added .
european version of gps galileo is supposed to be the european answer to the us gps system used as a navigation aid in cars , boats and aircraft .
the four-billion-euro -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- system has suffered a number of setbacks , due to technical problems , which can be solved , said reile , and financial and legal responsibility issues , which none of the private industry participants are willing to shoulder .
" what is really difficult for this project is that more partners are on board than in a normal , big european project , " said reile .
the industries involved have voiced their dismay at such a late change of plans , but they have no one to blame but themselves .
a letter of new demands which the consortium sent to the eu commission only last week made monday 's decision a foregone conclusion .
an eu official close to the project said new conditions , more time and more money would delay satellite orders . matt hermann -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu considers running galileo gps project the european union is to consider taking over the galileo satellite system as it is faced with demands for more time and extra public funds from the project 's private builders , officials said .

it says it will likely seek an independent investigation . a documentary on dutch television has accused the country 's national airline , now part of air france , of helping nazis with falsified documents or without proper papers to escape to argentina via switzerland after world war two .
on tuesday , the airline said it would likely seek an independent investigation into the matter .
the dutch filmmakers said they had unearthed documents which showed that a local klm representative asked the swiss border police in 1948 to allow passengers from germany to enter the country without proper papers so that they could fly on to argentina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klm is now part of air france sander rietveld from dutch program netwerk told the times newspaper that although one of the documents showed that the klm representative 's request had been refused by the swiss border police , many germans were allowed to enter switzerland without permission .
" the point is that it shows klm actively approached the swiss police , " he said .
argentina a safe haven for war criminals suspected war criminals were forbidden from leaving germany after the end of the war by the allied powers .
however argentina harbored several of them when president juan peron was in power between 1945 and 1955 .
among the more than 150 nazis who were offered refuge in the country were adolf eichmann , considered the chief mastermind of the holocaust as well as josef mengele , the notorious nazi camp doctor dubbed the " angel of death . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : josef mengele also found refuge in argentina klm has said it has never found evidence in its own archives of flying nazis to argentina .
the airline however has not ruled out being possibly involved in the affair .
a klm spokesman , bart koster , told the bbc that the airline had no record of the former employee in switzerland mentioned in the television documentary .
" we have no information whatsoever that our board was actively involved , " koster said .
" however , it can not be excluded that klm representatives were not involved at a local level . "
klm under pressure since the airing of the documentary last week , the issue has been the subject of intense debate in the netherlands .
the affair is a sensitive one because of the possible involvement of a dutch royal family member . prince bernhard , the father of queen beatrix , was the director of klm at the time .
some dutch politicians , historians and jewish groups are urging the airline to conduct an independent probe into the allegations and come clean about its past .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt 's brush workshop in the 1940s weidt hired jewish workers - among them blind and disabled employees - in order to save them from deportation to nazi death camps .
since 1999 , the museum has been home to a documentary show of the factory 's history .
this week , the opening of a new permanent exhibition adds further details about factory owner weidt and his string of friends and helpers who rallied to hire jews and even hide some of them in the workshop rooms to save them from the nazis .
weidt 's efforts prove that " it was possible even for apparently powerless people to resist an inhuman regime , " bernd naumann , germany 's deputy culture minister , said during the unveiling of the new exhibition on monday .
" little schindler " weidt 's efforts to aid jews contains echoes of the story of oskar schindler , a german industrialist whose efforts and successes in saving over a thousand jews from the nazis are the subject of oscar-winning film " schindler 's list . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt is sometimes referred to as the " little schindler " sometimes referred to as " little schindler , " weidt 's efforts are believed to have directly saved some 27 lives .
a passionate pacifist who managed to avoid being drafted in the first world war on account of a bad ear , weidt set up his factory in the rosenthalerstrasse in berlin in the early 1940s .
since it mainly supplied its brushes and brooms to hitler 's army , the wehrmacht , and was deemed to be supplying " war essentials , " the factory enjoyed special status at the time - a fact which enabled weidt to bribe nazi officials and falsify documents in order to hire jews .
weidt also smuggled in food packages to jewish families living underground and also helped one former employee flee from the theresienstadt concentration camp .
on occasion , weidt , with the help of friends , also hid entire jewish families in the rooms of his workshop for months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room at the former workshop which served as a hideout one of the centerpieces of the new exhibition is a small windowless room in its original condition which served as a hideout for months for a jewish family .
they were however discovered by the gestapo , the nazi secret police , in 1943 and deported to the auschwitz concentration camp .
remembering " silent heroes " weidt died in 1947 , soon after the end of the second world war , and his and his friends ' efforts to save jewish lives were largely forgotten in the decades after the war .
it was only in the 1990s that the german public became aware of their contribution to nazi-era resistance thanks to inge deutschkron , an 84-year-old german-jewish journalist and writer .
deutschkron , who spent two years in the early 1940s in weidt 's workshop working as a secretary and was given forged documents to escape detection by the nazis , campaigned in 1993 to set up a memorial plaque at the former brush factory .
she has also written extensively about weidt 's life in a series of acclaimed books and articles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inge deutschkron speaking at the opening of the new exhibition in berlin this week , deutschkron said it remained the only authentic site in the german capital where the suffering of the jews during the holocaust could be fully understood .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt 's brush workshop in the 1940s weidt hired jewish workers - among them blind and disabled employees - in order to save them from deportation to nazi death camps .
since 1999 , the museum has been home to a documentary show of the factory 's history .
this week , the opening of a new permanent exhibition adds further details about factory owner weidt and his string of friends and helpers who rallied to hire jews and even hide some of them in the workshop rooms to save them from the nazis .
weidt 's efforts prove that " it was possible even for apparently powerless people to resist an inhuman regime , " bernd naumann , germany 's deputy culture minister , said during the unveiling of the new exhibition on monday .
" little schindler " weidt 's efforts to aid jews contains echoes of the story of oskar schindler , a german industrialist whose efforts and successes in saving over a thousand jews from the nazis are the subject of oscar-winning film " schindler 's list . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt is sometimes referred to as the " little schindler " sometimes referred to as " little schindler , " weidt 's efforts are believed to have directly saved some 27 lives .
a passionate pacifist who managed to avoid being drafted in the first world war on account of a bad ear , weidt set up his factory in the rosenthalerstrasse in berlin in the early 1940s .
since it mainly supplied its brushes and brooms to hitler 's army , the wehrmacht , and was deemed to be supplying " war essentials , " the factory enjoyed special status at the time - a fact which enabled weidt to bribe nazi officials and falsify documents in order to hire jews .
weidt also smuggled in food packages to jewish families living underground and also helped one former employee flee from the theresienstadt concentration camp .
on occasion , weidt , with the help of friends , also hid entire jewish families in the rooms of his workshop for months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room at the former workshop which served as a hideout one of the centerpieces of the new exhibition is a small windowless room in its original condition which served as a hideout for months for a jewish family .
they were however discovered by the gestapo , the nazi secret police , in 1943 and deported to the auschwitz concentration camp .
remembering " silent heroes " weidt died in 1947 , soon after the end of the second world war , and his and his friends ' efforts to save jewish lives were largely forgotten in the decades after the war .
it was only in the 1990s that the german public became aware of their contribution to nazi-era resistance thanks to inge deutschkron , an 84-year-old german-jewish journalist and writer .
deutschkron , who spent two years in the early 1940s in weidt 's workshop working as a secretary and was given forged documents to escape detection by the nazis , campaigned in 1993 to set up a memorial plaque at the former brush factory .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt 's brush workshop in the 1940s weidt hired jewish workers - among them blind and disabled employees - in order to save them from deportation to nazi death camps .
since 1999 , the museum has been home to a documentary show of the factory 's history .
this week , the opening of a new permanent exhibition adds further details about factory owner weidt and his string of friends and helpers who rallied to hire jews and even hide some of them in the workshop rooms to save them from the nazis .
weidt 's efforts prove that " it was possible even for apparently powerless people to resist an inhuman regime , " bernd naumann , germany 's deputy culture minister , said during the unveiling of the new exhibition on monday .
" little schindler " weidt 's efforts to aid jews contains echoes of the story of oskar schindler , a german industrialist whose efforts and successes in saving over a thousand jews from the nazis are the subject of oscar-winning film " schindler 's list . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt is sometimes referred to as the " little schindler " sometimes referred to as " little schindler , " weidt 's efforts are believed to have directly saved some 27 lives .
a passionate pacifist who managed to avoid being drafted in the first world war on account of a bad ear , weidt set up his factory in the rosenthalerstrasse in berlin in the early 1940s .
since it mainly supplied its brushes and brooms to hitler 's army , the wehrmacht , and was deemed to be supplying " war essentials , " the factory enjoyed special status at the time - a fact which enabled weidt to bribe nazi officials and falsify documents in order to hire jews .
weidt also smuggled in food packages to jewish families living underground and also helped one former employee flee from the theresienstadt concentration camp .
on occasion , weidt , with the help of friends , also hid entire jewish families in the rooms of his workshop for months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room at the former workshop which served as a hideout one of the centerpieces of the new exhibition is a small windowless room in its original condition which served as a hideout for months for a jewish family .
they were however discovered by the gestapo , the nazi secret police , in 1943 and deported to the auschwitz concentration camp .
remembering " silent heroes " weidt died in 1947 , soon after the end of the second world war , and his and his friends ' efforts to save jewish lives were largely forgotten in the decades after the war .
it was only in the 1990s that the german public became aware of their contribution to nazi-era resistance thanks to inge deutschkron , an 84-year-old german-jewish journalist and writer .
deutschkron , who spent two years in the early 1940s in weidt 's workshop working as a secretary and was given forged documents to escape detection by the nazis , campaigned in 1993 to set up a memorial plaque at the former brush factory .
she has also written extensively about weidt 's life in a series of acclaimed books and articles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inge deutschkron speaking at the opening of the new exhibition in berlin this week , deutschkron said it remained the only authentic site in the german capital where the suffering of the jews during the holocaust could be fully understood .
andre schmitz , berlin 's deputy culture minister , said the remembrance of the " silent heroes " as well as extensive academic research on their efforts had closed a " painful gap " in germany 's collective memory . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us lawmakers urge opening of vast holocaust archive a us panel has approved a resolution calling for the world 's largest holocaust archive to be quickly opened to the public , saying it could help help counter holocaust deniers like iranian president mohammed ahmadinejad .

german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee , who currently serves as the responsible eu minister for the program under germany 's eu presidency , expressed his exasperation at a meeting in brussels on monday .
" this monumental project must not suffer any more harm by falling further behind the competition , or , by being threatened altogether , " tiefensee said .
little headway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting around at the push of a button almost two years after being named , a private consortium of industry giants has made so little progress on the project that it is threatening to end up in the airbus a380 category of botched industrial endeavors .
the umbrella group of industry heavyweights includes aena and hispasat of spain , thales and alcatel-lucent from france , european aerospace company eads , italy 's finmeccanica , britain 's inmarsat , deutsche telekom and the german aerospace center , dlr .
the eu commission 's preference now is to take over the project and issue a new tender to operate the system once it is built and launched into space .
this would get the system operating by the end of 2012 - a year , or even two , faster than any other option .
dr. hubert reile , program director for space operations at the german aerospace center , said this will not affect control of the navigation network by the dlr from its oberpfaffenhofen space center in bavaria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax payers will primarily cover galileo costs " for the dlr and for germany , this decision wo n't make much of a difference , " he said .

his arrest in november 1982 sent a wave of relief through the public - and it 's no wonder , considering the trail of blood the raf had already left behind .
christian klar has not been pardoned .
he will remain in prison for the rest of his minimum term of 26 years , until january 2009 .
german president horst köhler no doubt gave his decision careful consideration .
he consulted with german justice minister brigitte zypries and chief federal prosecutor monika harms about the issue .
he reviewed an expert report on klar .
he spoke with family members of raf victims , and he spoke with klar himself .
not the easy route köhler did not take the easy way out , and that in itself is reason to wish that he would not have reaped the senseless criticism that he did from his own christian democratic party , as well as the threats that he would not be re-elected if he pardoned klar .
so köhler denied klar clemency , and even though the president is free to make his own choices , one could consider this one a mistake .
the expert who evaluated klar considered it unlikely that the 54-year-old former terrorist would use weapons again against representatives of the economic and political elite .
it is also improbable that that estimation will change in the next year and a half when klar becomes eligible for parole .
one may consider klar to be blinded by his aversion to the capitalistic system - a stance he will presumably keep - but that is not a crime .
tumult what of course remains significant are the feelings of the families of raf victims .
however , a human life can never be valued in numbers - not with 24 , but also not with the 26-year jail term that the culprit received for extinguishing that life .
german society was indeed thrown into a crisis by the terrorist acts of the raf 30 years ago .
the terrorists , the murderers and the kidnappers all came from the heart of that society .
and given the force of the debate about klar 's plea for clemency , a sense of the rift of those former times can still be felt today .
perhaps a pardon for klar could have helped to bridge that gap .
after all , it 's bit ironic that , of all people , a decisive enemy of the state would appeal to the highest ranking individual of this state once so bloodily contested .

his arrest in november 1982 sent a wave of relief through the public - and it 's no wonder , considering the trail of blood the raf had already left behind .
christian klar has not been pardoned .
he will remain in prison for the rest of his minimum term of 26 years , until january 2009 .
german president horst köhler no doubt gave his decision careful consideration .
he consulted with german justice minister brigitte zypries and chief federal prosecutor monika harms about the issue .
he reviewed an expert report on klar .
he spoke with family members of raf victims , and he spoke with klar himself .
not the easy route köhler did not take the easy way out , and that in itself is reason to wish that he would not have reaped the senseless criticism that he did from his own christian democratic party , as well as the threats that he would not be re-elected if he pardoned klar .
so köhler denied klar clemency , and even though the president is free to make his own choices , one could consider this one a mistake .
the expert who evaluated klar considered it unlikely that the 54-year-old former terrorist would use weapons again against representatives of the economic and political elite .
it is also improbable that that estimation will change in the next year and a half when klar becomes eligible for parole .
one may consider klar to be blinded by his aversion to the capitalistic system - a stance he will presumably keep - but that is not a crime .
tumult what of course remains significant are the feelings of the families of raf victims .
however , a human life can never be valued in numbers - not with 24 , but also not with the 26-year jail term that the culprit received for extinguishing that life .
german society was indeed thrown into a crisis by the terrorist acts of the raf 30 years ago .
the terrorists , the murderers and the kidnappers all came from the heart of that society .
and given the force of the debate about klar 's plea for clemency , a sense of the rift of those former times can still be felt today .
perhaps a pardon for klar could have helped to bridge that gap .
after all , it 's bit ironic that , of all people , a decisive enemy of the state would appeal to the highest ranking individual of this state once so bloodily contested .

" everyone who indulges in these acts of violence only does those people a service who want more order and strictness , " hollande said on rtl-radio .
" but we need dialogue and respect instead of violence , " he added . during the night , a crowd of some 200 youths clashed with police in paris ' place de la bastille .
they broke windows , destroyed telephone booths and set four cars on fire .
similar incidents were reported in the cities of lyon , lille , toulouse , rennes and nantes . but the unrest was less than the night before , which saw 730 vehicles torched and 592 people arrested . sarkozy angered many in 2005 when , as interior minister , he referred to rioting youth in france 's poor , largely minority , suburban housing projects as " rabble " and " scum .

christian klar has not been pardoned .
he will remain in prison for the rest of his minimum term of 26 years , until january 2009 .
german president horst köhler no doubt gave his decision careful consideration .
he consulted with german justice minister brigitte zypries and chief federal prosecutor monika harms about the issue .
he reviewed an expert report on klar .
he spoke with family members of raf victims , and he spoke with klar himself .
not the easy route köhler did not take the easy way out , and that in itself is reason to wish that he would not have reaped the senseless criticism that he did from his own christian democratic party , as well as the threats that he would not be re-elected if he pardoned klar .
so köhler denied klar clemency , and even though the president is free to make his own choices , one could consider this one a mistake .
the expert who evaluated klar considered it unlikely that the 54-year-old former terrorist would use weapons again against representatives of the economic and political elite .
it is also improbable that that estimation will change in the next year and a half when klar becomes eligible for parole .
one may consider klar to be blinded by his aversion to the capitalistic system - a stance he will presumably keep - but that is not a crime .
tumult what of course remains significant are the feelings of the families of raf victims .
however , a human life can never be valued in numbers - not with 24 , but also not with the 26-year jail term that the culprit received for extinguishing that life .
german society was indeed thrown into a crisis by the terrorist acts of the raf 30 years ago .
the terrorists , the murderers and the kidnappers all came from the heart of that society .
and given the force of the debate about klar 's plea for clemency , a sense of the rift of those former times can still be felt today .
perhaps a pardon for klar could have helped to bridge that gap .
after all , it 's bit ironic that , of all people , a decisive enemy of the state would appeal to the highest ranking individual of this state once so bloodily contested .

around a hundred youths were arrested . hollande made his appeal on tuesday in paris , saying that , although disappointment and frustration at conservative nicolas sarkozy 's election was running high , the only means to effect change in a democracy was through the ballot . " everyone who indulges in these acts of violence only does those people a service who want more order and strictness , " hollande said on rtl-radio .
" but we need dialogue and respect instead of violence , " he added . during the night , a crowd of some 200 youths clashed with police in paris ' place de la bastille .
they broke windows , destroyed telephone booths and set four cars on fire .
similar incidents were reported in the cities of lyon , lille , toulouse , rennes and nantes . but the unrest was less than the night before , which saw 730 vehicles torched and 592 people arrested . sarkozy angered many in 2005 when , as interior minister , he referred to rioting youth in france 's poor , largely minority , suburban housing projects as " rabble " and " scum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the red army faction - 10 years after its dissolution judge issues arrest warrants for former raf terrorists former red army faction leader mohnhaupt wants new identity german court orders former raf terrorist released on parole german president rejects ex-raf terrorist 's plea for clemency society -pipe- 08.05.2007 opinion : clemency for ex-terrorist could have bridged gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after thoughtful deliberation , says dw correspondent heinz dylong , german president horst köhler denied former red army faction terrorist christian klar 's request for clemency - but will it make a difference ? there 's no question that christian klar was one of the most determined and brutal of all the red army faction terrorists .
his arrest in november 1982 sent a wave of relief through the public - and it 's no wonder , considering the trail of blood the raf had already left behind .
christian klar has not been pardoned .
he will remain in prison for the rest of his minimum term of 26 years , until january 2009 .
german president horst köhler no doubt gave his decision careful consideration .
he consulted with german justice minister brigitte zypries and chief federal prosecutor monika harms about the issue .
he reviewed an expert report on klar .
he spoke with family members of raf victims , and he spoke with klar himself .
not the easy route köhler did not take the easy way out , and that in itself is reason to wish that he would not have reaped the senseless criticism that he did from his own christian democratic party , as well as the threats that he would not be re-elected if he pardoned klar .
so köhler denied klar clemency , and even though the president is free to make his own choices , one could consider this one a mistake .
the expert who evaluated klar considered it unlikely that the 54-year-old former terrorist would use weapons again against representatives of the economic and political elite .
it is also improbable that that estimation will change in the next year and a half when klar becomes eligible for parole .
one may consider klar to be blinded by his aversion to the capitalistic system - a stance he will presumably keep - but that is not a crime .
tumult what of course remains significant are the feelings of the families of raf victims .
however , a human life can never be valued in numbers - not with 24 , but also not with the 26-year jail term that the culprit received for extinguishing that life .
german society was indeed thrown into a crisis by the terrorist acts of the raf 30 years ago .
the terrorists , the murderers and the kidnappers all came from the heart of that society .
and given the force of the debate about klar 's plea for clemency , a sense of the rift of those former times can still be felt today .
perhaps a pardon for klar could have helped to bridge that gap .
after all , it 's bit ironic that , of all people , a decisive enemy of the state would appeal to the highest ranking individual of this state once so bloodily contested .

around a hundred youths were arrested . hollande made his appeal on tuesday in paris , saying that , although disappointment and frustration at conservative nicolas sarkozy 's election was running high , the only means to effect change in a democracy was through the ballot . " everyone who indulges in these acts of violence only does those people a service who want more order and strictness , " hollande said on rtl-radio .
" but we need dialogue and respect instead of violence , " he added . during the night , a crowd of some 200 youths clashed with police in paris ' place de la bastille .
they broke windows , destroyed telephone booths and set four cars on fire .
similar incidents were reported in the cities of lyon , lille , toulouse , rennes and nantes . but the unrest was less than the night before , which saw 730 vehicles torched and 592 people arrested . sarkozy angered many in 2005 when , as interior minister , he referred to rioting youth in france 's poor , largely minority , suburban housing projects as " rabble " and " scum .

former social affairs minister francois fillon and current employment and social cohesion minister jean-louis borloo have both been tipped for that post . sarkozy also plans to draft an initial package of reforms to present to the french national assembly . they include cuts in france 's inheritance tax , rules mandating that the jobless to accept work offered to them , and a minimum service guarantee during transportation strikes - measures all likely to attract the ire of french trade unions . stony silence from russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's election could end a period of close russian-french-german cooperation french youths are not the only ones displeased by sarkozy 's triumph .
russia has thus far refused to offer the customary congratulations usually offered to new heads of state . the kremlin has issued no official reaction at all to the election .
but the pro-government newspaper izvestia wrote that a sarkozy presidency could negatively impact french-russian relations . the paper objected to the fact that lawmaker pierre lellouche , a critic of russia 's war against separatist rebels in chechnya , was one of sarkozy 's major advisors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the red army faction - 10 years after its dissolution judge issues arrest warrants for former raf terrorists former red army faction leader mohnhaupt wants new identity german court orders former raf terrorist released on parole german president rejects ex-raf terrorist 's plea for clemency society -pipe- 08.05.2007 opinion : clemency for ex-terrorist could have bridged gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after thoughtful deliberation , says dw correspondent heinz dylong , german president horst köhler denied former red army faction terrorist christian klar 's request for clemency - but will it make a difference ? there 's no question that christian klar was one of the most determined and brutal of all the red army faction terrorists .
his arrest in november 1982 sent a wave of relief through the public - and it 's no wonder , considering the trail of blood the raf had already left behind .
christian klar has not been pardoned .
he will remain in prison for the rest of his minimum term of 26 years , until january 2009 .
german president horst köhler no doubt gave his decision careful consideration .
he consulted with german justice minister brigitte zypries and chief federal prosecutor monika harms about the issue .
he reviewed an expert report on klar .
he spoke with family members of raf victims , and he spoke with klar himself .
not the easy route köhler did not take the easy way out , and that in itself is reason to wish that he would not have reaped the senseless criticism that he did from his own christian democratic party , as well as the threats that he would not be re-elected if he pardoned klar .
so köhler denied klar clemency , and even though the president is free to make his own choices , one could consider this one a mistake .
the expert who evaluated klar considered it unlikely that the 54-year-old former terrorist would use weapons again against representatives of the economic and political elite .
it is also improbable that that estimation will change in the next year and a half when klar becomes eligible for parole .
one may consider klar to be blinded by his aversion to the capitalistic system - a stance he will presumably keep - but that is not a crime .
tumult what of course remains significant are the feelings of the families of raf victims .
however , a human life can never be valued in numbers - not with 24 , but also not with the 26-year jail term that the culprit received for extinguishing that life .
german society was indeed thrown into a crisis by the terrorist acts of the raf 30 years ago .
the terrorists , the murderers and the kidnappers all came from the heart of that society .
and given the force of the debate about klar 's plea for clemency , a sense of the rift of those former times can still be felt today .
perhaps a pardon for klar could have helped to bridge that gap .
after all , it 's bit ironic that , of all people , a decisive enemy of the state would appeal to the highest ranking individual of this state once so bloodily contested .

" the united nations has asked the german government to stay on in its commanding role for another rotation period , " foreign ministry spokesman jens plötner told a press conference .
" we understand from new york that the request is based on a desire for continuity regarding the mission in lebanon . "
unifil was deployed in the aftermath of israel 's devastating 34-day war last summer on hezbollah guerrillas in lebanon .
its naval component is meant to prevent arms being smuggled to hezbollah by sea and has been headed since october by a contingent of some 850 german sailors .
open to request chief government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said berlin received the un request for an extension in april after chancellor angela merkel indicated during a visit to beirut that germany would consider such a demand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel visited the troops off the lebanese coast " she made clear that we are open to this request ...
we received a request on april 23 and we are examining it in a positive light , " he said .
a prolongation of germany 's mandate , which is due to expire on august 31 , would have to be approved by the cabinet and the lower house of parliament , the bundestag .

his arrest in november 1982 sent a wave of relief through the public - and it 's no wonder , considering the trail of blood the raf had already left behind .
christian klar has not been pardoned .
he will remain in prison for the rest of his minimum term of 26 years , until january 2009 .
german president horst köhler no doubt gave his decision careful consideration .
he consulted with german justice minister brigitte zypries and chief federal prosecutor monika harms about the issue .
he reviewed an expert report on klar .
he spoke with family members of raf victims , and he spoke with klar himself .
not the easy route köhler did not take the easy way out , and that in itself is reason to wish that he would not have reaped the senseless criticism that he did from his own christian democratic party , as well as the threats that he would not be re-elected if he pardoned klar .
so köhler denied klar clemency , and even though the president is free to make his own choices , one could consider this one a mistake .
the expert who evaluated klar considered it unlikely that the 54-year-old former terrorist would use weapons again against representatives of the economic and political elite .
it is also improbable that that estimation will change in the next year and a half when klar becomes eligible for parole .
one may consider klar to be blinded by his aversion to the capitalistic system - a stance he will presumably keep - but that is not a crime .
tumult what of course remains significant are the feelings of the families of raf victims .
however , a human life can never be valued in numbers - not with 24 , but also not with the 26-year jail term that the culprit received for extinguishing that life .
german society was indeed thrown into a crisis by the terrorist acts of the raf 30 years ago .
the terrorists , the murderers and the kidnappers all came from the heart of that society .
and given the force of the debate about klar 's plea for clemency , a sense of the rift of those former times can still be felt today .
perhaps a pardon for klar could have helped to bridge that gap .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the red army faction - 10 years after its dissolution judge issues arrest warrants for former raf terrorists former red army faction leader mohnhaupt wants new identity german court orders former raf terrorist released on parole german president rejects ex-raf terrorist 's plea for clemency society -pipe- 08.05.2007 opinion : clemency for ex-terrorist could have bridged gap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after thoughtful deliberation , says dw correspondent heinz dylong , german president horst köhler denied former red army faction terrorist christian klar 's request for clemency - but will it make a difference ? there 's no question that christian klar was one of the most determined and brutal of all the red army faction terrorists .
his arrest in november 1982 sent a wave of relief through the public - and it 's no wonder , considering the trail of blood the raf had already left behind .
christian klar has not been pardoned .
he will remain in prison for the rest of his minimum term of 26 years , until january 2009 .
german president horst köhler no doubt gave his decision careful consideration .
he consulted with german justice minister brigitte zypries and chief federal prosecutor monika harms about the issue .
he reviewed an expert report on klar .
he spoke with family members of raf victims , and he spoke with klar himself .
not the easy route köhler did not take the easy way out , and that in itself is reason to wish that he would not have reaped the senseless criticism that he did from his own christian democratic party , as well as the threats that he would not be re-elected if he pardoned klar .
so köhler denied klar clemency , and even though the president is free to make his own choices , one could consider this one a mistake .
the expert who evaluated klar considered it unlikely that the 54-year-old former terrorist would use weapons again against representatives of the economic and political elite .
it is also improbable that that estimation will change in the next year and a half when klar becomes eligible for parole .
one may consider klar to be blinded by his aversion to the capitalistic system - a stance he will presumably keep - but that is not a crime .
tumult what of course remains significant are the feelings of the families of raf victims .
however , a human life can never be valued in numbers - not with 24 , but also not with the 26-year jail term that the culprit received for extinguishing that life .
german society was indeed thrown into a crisis by the terrorist acts of the raf 30 years ago .
the terrorists , the murderers and the kidnappers all came from the heart of that society .
and given the force of the debate about klar 's plea for clemency , a sense of the rift of those former times can still be felt today .
perhaps a pardon for klar could have helped to bridge that gap .
after all , it 's bit ironic that , of all people , a decisive enemy of the state would appeal to the highest ranking individual of this state once so bloodily contested .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt 's brush workshop in the 1940s weidt hired jewish workers - among them blind and disabled employees - in order to save them from deportation to nazi death camps .
since 1999 , the museum has been home to a documentary show of the factory 's history .
this week , the opening of a new permanent exhibition adds further details about factory owner weidt and his string of friends and helpers who rallied to hire jews and even hide some of them in the workshop rooms to save them from the nazis .
weidt 's efforts prove that " it was possible even for apparently powerless people to resist an inhuman regime , " bernd naumann , germany 's deputy culture minister , said during the unveiling of the new exhibition on monday .
" little schindler " weidt 's efforts to aid jews contains echoes of the story of oskar schindler , a german industrialist whose efforts and successes in saving over a thousand jews from the nazis are the subject of oscar-winning film " schindler 's list . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt is sometimes referred to as the " little schindler " sometimes referred to as " little schindler , " weidt 's efforts are believed to have directly saved some 27 lives .
a passionate pacifist who managed to avoid being drafted in the first world war on account of a bad ear , weidt set up his factory in the rosenthalerstrasse in berlin in the early 1940s .
since it mainly supplied its brushes and brooms to hitler 's army , the wehrmacht , and was deemed to be supplying " war essentials , " the factory enjoyed special status at the time - a fact which enabled weidt to bribe nazi officials and falsify documents in order to hire jews .
weidt also smuggled in food packages to jewish families living underground and also helped one former employee flee from the theresienstadt concentration camp .
on occasion , weidt , with the help of friends , also hid entire jewish families in the rooms of his workshop for months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room at the former workshop which served as a hideout one of the centerpieces of the new exhibition is a small windowless room in its original condition which served as a hideout for months for a jewish family .
they were however discovered by the gestapo , the nazi secret police , in 1943 and deported to the auschwitz concentration camp .
remembering " silent heroes " weidt died in 1947 , soon after the end of the second world war , and his and his friends ' efforts to save jewish lives were largely forgotten in the decades after the war .
it was only in the 1990s that the german public became aware of their contribution to nazi-era resistance thanks to inge deutschkron , an 84-year-old german-jewish journalist and writer .
deutschkron , who spent two years in the early 1940s in weidt 's workshop working as a secretary and was given forged documents to escape detection by the nazis , campaigned in 1993 to set up a memorial plaque at the former brush factory .
she has also written extensively about weidt 's life in a series of acclaimed books and articles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inge deutschkron speaking at the opening of the new exhibition in berlin this week , deutschkron said it remained the only authentic site in the german capital where the suffering of the jews during the holocaust could be fully understood .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt 's brush workshop in the 1940s weidt hired jewish workers - among them blind and disabled employees - in order to save them from deportation to nazi death camps .
since 1999 , the museum has been home to a documentary show of the factory 's history .
this week , the opening of a new permanent exhibition adds further details about factory owner weidt and his string of friends and helpers who rallied to hire jews and even hide some of them in the workshop rooms to save them from the nazis .
weidt 's efforts prove that " it was possible even for apparently powerless people to resist an inhuman regime , " bernd naumann , germany 's deputy culture minister , said during the unveiling of the new exhibition on monday .
" little schindler " weidt 's efforts to aid jews contains echoes of the story of oskar schindler , a german industrialist whose efforts and successes in saving over a thousand jews from the nazis are the subject of oscar-winning film " schindler 's list . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt is sometimes referred to as the " little schindler " sometimes referred to as " little schindler , " weidt 's efforts are believed to have directly saved some 27 lives .
a passionate pacifist who managed to avoid being drafted in the first world war on account of a bad ear , weidt set up his factory in the rosenthalerstrasse in berlin in the early 1940s .
since it mainly supplied its brushes and brooms to hitler 's army , the wehrmacht , and was deemed to be supplying " war essentials , " the factory enjoyed special status at the time - a fact which enabled weidt to bribe nazi officials and falsify documents in order to hire jews .
weidt also smuggled in food packages to jewish families living underground and also helped one former employee flee from the theresienstadt concentration camp .
on occasion , weidt , with the help of friends , also hid entire jewish families in the rooms of his workshop for months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room at the former workshop which served as a hideout one of the centerpieces of the new exhibition is a small windowless room in its original condition which served as a hideout for months for a jewish family .
they were however discovered by the gestapo , the nazi secret police , in 1943 and deported to the auschwitz concentration camp .
remembering " silent heroes " weidt died in 1947 , soon after the end of the second world war , and his and his friends ' efforts to save jewish lives were largely forgotten in the decades after the war .
it was only in the 1990s that the german public became aware of their contribution to nazi-era resistance thanks to inge deutschkron , an 84-year-old german-jewish journalist and writer .
deutschkron , who spent two years in the early 1940s in weidt 's workshop working as a secretary and was given forged documents to escape detection by the nazis , campaigned in 1993 to set up a memorial plaque at the former brush factory .
she has also written extensively about weidt 's life in a series of acclaimed books and articles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inge deutschkron speaking at the opening of the new exhibition in berlin this week , deutschkron said it remained the only authentic site in the german capital where the suffering of the jews during the holocaust could be fully understood .
andre schmitz , berlin 's deputy culture minister , said the remembrance of the " silent heroes " as well as extensive academic research on their efforts had closed a " painful gap " in germany 's collective memory . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us lawmakers urge opening of vast holocaust archive a us panel has approved a resolution calling for the world 's largest holocaust archive to be quickly opened to the public , saying it could help help counter holocaust deniers like iranian president mohammed ahmadinejad .

the estimates " were quickly found to be unrealistic and unfounded hype , " the study published tuesday by the geneva-based international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- said .
" all data , information and expert statements that are available to date strongly indicate that an increase in human trafficking did not occur either during or after the world cup , " the report added .
report urges broader approach currently , some 1,000 people a year are believed to fall victim to sexual exploitation in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red-light district in frankfurt - prostitution is legal in germany " even if it is assumed that only one in ten cases of trafficking is discovered , the 40,000 figure is still unrealistically high , " the report said .
the study said that soccer fans were often couples or families , a fact which had reduced the need for sexual services .
the iom praised germany for the measures taken before the event to try to counter trafficking and hoped this might provide an effective model for organizers to follow at coming events such as uefa euro 2008 in switzerland , the 2010 world cup in south africa and the olympics in beijing .
however the study said that authorities had taken too narrow a perspective and recommended a broader approach in future and urged better profiling of fans .

on tuesday , the airline said it would likely seek an independent investigation into the matter .
the dutch filmmakers said they had unearthed documents which showed that a local klm representative asked the swiss border police in 1948 to allow passengers from germany to enter the country without proper papers so that they could fly on to argentina .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klm is now part of air france sander rietveld from dutch program netwerk told the times newspaper that although one of the documents showed that the klm representative 's request had been refused by the swiss border police , many germans were allowed to enter switzerland without permission .
" the point is that it shows klm actively approached the swiss police , " he said .
argentina a safe haven for war criminals suspected war criminals were forbidden from leaving germany after the end of the war by the allied powers .
however argentina harbored several of them when president juan peron was in power between 1945 and 1955 .
among the more than 150 nazis who were offered refuge in the country were adolf eichmann , considered the chief mastermind of the holocaust as well as josef mengele , the notorious nazi camp doctor dubbed the " angel of death . "

" we have no information whatsoever that our board was actively involved , " koster said .
" however , it can not be excluded that klm representatives were not involved at a local level . "
klm under pressure since the airing of the documentary last week , the issue has been the subject of intense debate in the netherlands .
the affair is a sensitive one because of the possible involvement of a dutch royal family member . prince bernhard , the father of queen beatrix , was the director of klm at the time .
some dutch politicians , historians and jewish groups are urging the airline to conduct an independent probe into the allegations and come clean about its past .
klm has indicated it will likely begin such an investigation .
" we take these signals seriously and if we are a responsible company , we should also be responsible for what has been done in the past , " koster told news agency reuters .

his arrest in november 1982 sent a wave of relief through the public - and it 's no wonder , considering the trail of blood the raf had already left behind .
christian klar has not been pardoned .
he will remain in prison for the rest of his minimum term of 26 years , until january 2009 .
german president horst köhler no doubt gave his decision careful consideration .
he consulted with german justice minister brigitte zypries and chief federal prosecutor monika harms about the issue .
he reviewed an expert report on klar .
he spoke with family members of raf victims , and he spoke with klar himself .
not the easy route köhler did not take the easy way out , and that in itself is reason to wish that he would not have reaped the senseless criticism that he did from his own christian democratic party , as well as the threats that he would not be re-elected if he pardoned klar .
so köhler denied klar clemency , and even though the president is free to make his own choices , one could consider this one a mistake .
the expert who evaluated klar considered it unlikely that the 54-year-old former terrorist would use weapons again against representatives of the economic and political elite .
it is also improbable that that estimation will change in the next year and a half when klar becomes eligible for parole .
one may consider klar to be blinded by his aversion to the capitalistic system - a stance he will presumably keep - but that is not a crime .
tumult what of course remains significant are the feelings of the families of raf victims .
however , a human life can never be valued in numbers - not with 24 , but also not with the 26-year jail term that the culprit received for extinguishing that life .
german society was indeed thrown into a crisis by the terrorist acts of the raf 30 years ago .
the terrorists , the murderers and the kidnappers all came from the heart of that society .
and given the force of the debate about klar 's plea for clemency , a sense of the rift of those former times can still be felt today .
perhaps a pardon for klar could have helped to bridge that gap .
after all , it 's bit ironic that , of all people , a decisive enemy of the state would appeal to the highest ranking individual of this state once so bloodily contested .

officials said germany 's performance in 2006 was much better than expected .
the commission had originally said the german budget deficit in 2006 would stand at three percent of gdp .
the commission said the better-than-expected results were due to higher german tax revenues .
major tax revenues expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister steinbrück called expected higher tax revenues " fantastic " over the weekend , german finance minister peer steinbrück announced that he expected an additional 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- in tax revenues to flow into the central government coffers over the four years to 2011 .
steinbrück also said that the additional tax take for the whole country - including the federal government , the 16 states and the local authorities - could amount to 200 billion euros .
the minister warned , however , that the additional revenue had to be devoted primarily to consolidating the budget after years of running deficits that exceeded of european union norms .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt 's brush workshop in the 1940s weidt hired jewish workers - among them blind and disabled employees - in order to save them from deportation to nazi death camps .
since 1999 , the museum has been home to a documentary show of the factory 's history .
this week , the opening of a new permanent exhibition adds further details about factory owner weidt and his string of friends and helpers who rallied to hire jews and even hide some of them in the workshop rooms to save them from the nazis .
weidt 's efforts prove that " it was possible even for apparently powerless people to resist an inhuman regime , " bernd naumann , germany 's deputy culture minister , said during the unveiling of the new exhibition on monday .
" little schindler " weidt 's efforts to aid jews contains echoes of the story of oskar schindler , a german industrialist whose efforts and successes in saving over a thousand jews from the nazis are the subject of oscar-winning film " schindler 's list . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto weidt is sometimes referred to as the " little schindler " sometimes referred to as " little schindler , " weidt 's efforts are believed to have directly saved some 27 lives .
a passionate pacifist who managed to avoid being drafted in the first world war on account of a bad ear , weidt set up his factory in the rosenthalerstrasse in berlin in the early 1940s .
since it mainly supplied its brushes and brooms to hitler 's army , the wehrmacht , and was deemed to be supplying " war essentials , " the factory enjoyed special status at the time - a fact which enabled weidt to bribe nazi officials and falsify documents in order to hire jews .
weidt also smuggled in food packages to jewish families living underground and also helped one former employee flee from the theresienstadt concentration camp .
on occasion , weidt , with the help of friends , also hid entire jewish families in the rooms of his workshop for months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a room at the former workshop which served as a hideout one of the centerpieces of the new exhibition is a small windowless room in its original condition which served as a hideout for months for a jewish family .
they were however discovered by the gestapo , the nazi secret police , in 1943 and deported to the auschwitz concentration camp .
remembering " silent heroes " weidt died in 1947 , soon after the end of the second world war , and his and his friends ' efforts to save jewish lives were largely forgotten in the decades after the war .
it was only in the 1990s that the german public became aware of their contribution to nazi-era resistance thanks to inge deutschkron , an 84-year-old german-jewish journalist and writer .
deutschkron , who spent two years in the early 1940s in weidt 's workshop working as a secretary and was given forged documents to escape detection by the nazis , campaigned in 1993 to set up a memorial plaque at the former brush factory .
she has also written extensively about weidt 's life in a series of acclaimed books and articles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inge deutschkron speaking at the opening of the new exhibition in berlin this week , deutschkron said it remained the only authentic site in the german capital where the suffering of the jews during the holocaust could be fully understood .
andre schmitz , berlin 's deputy culture minister , said the remembrance of the " silent heroes " as well as extensive academic research on their efforts had closed a " painful gap " in germany 's collective memory . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : us lawmakers urge opening of vast holocaust archive a us panel has approved a resolution calling for the world 's largest holocaust archive to be quickly opened to the public , saying it could help help counter holocaust deniers like iranian president mohammed ahmadinejad .

at a white house banquet , she said " the lesson of my lifetime " had been that the partnership " was always to be reckoned with " in defending freedom .
the monarch and her husband were guests of honour at the dinner hosted by us president george w bush and wife laura .
the five-course banquet was the first in mr bush 's presidency to demand a white tie dress code .
earlier , more than 7,000 people , including us cabinet and congress members , attended a reception on the white house lawns .
at the evening banquet , the queen toasted the uk 's friendship with the united states .
' remain united ' " administrations in your country and governments in mine may come and go , but talk we will , listen we have to , disagree from time to time we may , but united we must always remain , " she said .

" i would like to recognise that steadfast commitment your country has shown not just in the last 16 years but throughout my life in support of a europe whole and free , " she said .

in one clip , he gives a running commentary as he and a friend drive around the city in a stolen vehicle at one point stopping to hot-wire the ignition to restart it .
mobile phone footage taken of a youth stealing a car in another clip , he laughs as he watches a different stolen car blazing in a field .
he told the programme he carried out the offences because he was bored .
he said : " i 've got nothing else to do really , i have n't got a job and i 'm not in college .
" there 's nothing to do around here and anything that there is to do costs money and no one 's got money .
we just do it and if anything funny is happening we can look back and laugh . "
' shown up ' other footage found online shows a teenager being attacked on the streets of cardiff .
victim james pilcher , 18 , was chased through four lanes of traffic and is then cornered in a garden where he is seen being beaten .
the attack was filmed by a group of youths before uploading it to youtube under the " entertainment " category .
mr pilcher said he did not know it had been filmed until someone told him they had watched the attack on youtube .
hundreds have since viewed the footage online as well as people in his own neighbourhood who have been passing clips from phone to phone .
an attack on teenager james pilcher was put online mr pilcher said : " i feel a bit shown up because everyone in the world can see it .
" it 's alright for people who are doing silly stuff like for fun , but when they stick things on there , fighting and stuff like that , it 's stupid is n't it . "
criminologist keith hayward , who has studied the phenomenon of posting crime footage online , said people doing so were often motivated by gaining notoriety .

by nuala mccann bbc news website it is a great white wedding cake of a building , perched on the hills overlooking belfast .
if the walls of parliament buildings could talk , they would whisper tales of intrigue and deception , of battles royal , of brawls in the hall and snowballs flung in defiance across stormont 's lawns .
the history of northern ireland is dominated by this building and prince of wales avenue sweeping down to the statue of old-time unionist leader , edward carson : black , imperious , shaking a regal finger at the world .
the original plans were for three buildings - law courts on one side and a civil service building on the other - but in the end , the money ran out .
the big white edifice on the hill stands alone , built in 1932 to serve what unionist james craig , later lord craigavon , once boasted was " a protestant parliament and a protestant state " .
a liverpool architect dreamed up the greek classical design .
he was a precise man and the building was 365 ft long - one foot for every day of the year .
italian craftsmen made the journey to belfast to fashion the ornate marble hall which became known as the great hall .
king george v opened the ni parliament in 1921 , but sent the prince of wales to declare the actual new building open in 1932 .
artist william conor painted the original members of the parliament .
according to historical sources he was only paid £ 131 6s for his effort , far short of the original £ 200 that had been agreed .
during world war ii , there were fears that the big white house on the hill was a sure target for german bombers .
the white stone was painted black with a mix of bitumen and cow manure .
the roads in the grounds were camouflaged with ash and clinker .
the northern ireland government also considered removing lord carson from his pedestal half way down prince of wales avenue and putting him away for safe keeping .
but the sculptor reassured them that he had fashioned a spare head - just in case .
during the 51 years of the northern ireland parliament , only one bill sponsored by a non-unionist member was ever passed .
poet and academic tom paulin wrote a poem about this , called of difference does it make or the wild birds act of 1931 .
in 1965 , dup leader ian paisley pelted snowballs at the then irish prime minister sean lemass when he visited stormont .
we had sunningdale , the ulster workers ' strike - any amount of controversy captured in grainy 1970s pictures of tractors crawling up the tree-lined avenue in protest mode ; politicians shouting , gesticulating , shaking their heads or storming out the doors and storming in .
but the winds of change blew through the tree-lined avenues and kicked up heaps of leaves and great hulking bundles of entrenched thinking .
all has changed utterly .
journalists remember the day when sinn fein leader gerry adams stood at a window and shouted out to the press corps gathered below : " get me a united ireland or i 'll jump ! "
he was only joking .
but how might lord craigavon shiver at the sight of his life-size statue in stormont 's great hall , appearing over the shoulder of mr adams in televised sinn fein press conferences ?
true , the building has seen dark moments .
a fire , caused by an electrical fault , destroyed the assembly chamber on 2 january 1995 but it was carefully restored .
the last years are a-flicker with sombre images of police land rovers lining up the avenue as police went into raid sinn fein 's offices in what became known as stormontgate even more recently , the photograph of loyalist michael stone wrestled into submission in the doorway of parliament buildings , tells a story that has not fully played out .
but there were moments of lightness too .
not least , those brought by former ni secretary , the late mo mowlam , who cast aside ceremony , not to mention her wig , called her associates " babe " , indulged in widespread hugging and helped open up stormont to everyone .
those were the days of concerts .
remember the lark in the park ?
remember elton john and the eagles ?
how many of the old school politicians spun in their graves as rod stewart rasped : " if ya want my body and ya think i 'm sexy " on stormont 's lawns .
recent figures show that up to 40,000 tourists from 108 countries around the world visit parliament buildings every year .
belfast artist noel murphy immortalised the modern assembly on canvas .
his work was unveiled in february 2003 .
john hume , the former sdlp leader , proved to be his favourite sitter .
" i wish more were like him , " murphy said at the time .
" most of these politicians talked and talked , which meant it was harder to paint them .
if i could have had 107 other john humes , it would have made this painting much easier . "
in december 2005 , the old lady on the hill who seemed so far removed from the ordinary people , opened her big iron gates to thousands who travelled to stormont to pay tribute to one of northern ireland 's greatest exports , footballing legend george best .
his funeral took place in the great hall .
he was a boy from the cregagh estate who could never have dreamed his life .
and could anyone have ever dreamed a day when the democratic unionists and sinn fein would be sharing power in a new northern ireland assembly ?
mr paisley - dr no - the man who spent decades saying " never , never , never " is now poised to lead his party into a power-sharing coalition with his old enemy , sinn fein .
the honeymoon is over .
what hopes for the new assembly and these folks in their house on the hill ?
it is a big white wedding cake of a building .
but when it comes to politics , can stormont ever be the scene of a happy marriage ?

by nuala mccann bbc news website it is a great white wedding cake of a building , perched on the hills overlooking belfast .
if the walls of parliament buildings could talk , they would whisper tales of intrigue and deception , of battles royal , of brawls in the hall and snowballs flung in defiance across stormont 's lawns .
what hopes for a happy political marriage for the folks on the hill ?
the history of northern ireland is dominated by this building and prince of wales avenue sweeping down to the statue of old-time unionist leader , edward carson : black , imperious , shaking a regal finger at the world .
the original plans were for three buildings - law courts on one side and a civil service building on the other - but in the end , the money ran out .
the big white edifice on the hill stands alone , built in 1932 to serve what unionist james craig , later lord craigavon , once boasted was " a protestant parliament and a protestant state " .
a liverpool architect dreamed up the greek classical design .
he was a precise man and the building was 365 ft long - one foot for every day of the year .
italian craftsmen made the journey to belfast to fashion the ornate marble hall which became known as the great hall .
king george v opened the ni parliament in 1921 , but sent the prince of wales to declare the actual new building open in 1932 .
artist william conor painted the original members of the parliament .
according to historical sources he was only paid £ 131 6s for his effort , far short of the original £ 200 that had been agreed .
ian paisley once pelted snowballs at irish prime minister sean lemass during world war ii , there were fears that the big white house on the hill was a sure target for german bombers .
the white stone was painted black with a mix of bitumen and cow manure .
the roads in the grounds were camouflaged with ash and clinker .
the northern ireland government also considered removing lord carson from his pedestal half way down prince of wales avenue and putting him away for safe keeping .
but the sculptor reassured them that he had fashioned a spare head - just in case .
during the 51 years of the northern ireland parliament , only one bill sponsored by a non-unionist member was ever passed .

the increases , to be brought in on 20 may by south west trains -lrb- swt -rrb- , were unacceptable , passenger focus said .
it added that it wanted swt passengers to give their views on the rises .
an swt spokeswoman said the new prices would bring the company into line with other operators and allow it to " better match demand and pricing " . "
families making day trips to london will be hit hard by these changes " anthony smith , passenger focus examples of the increases , which were first announced in march , include a cheap day return from alton , in hampshire , to london rising from £ 15.80 to £ 19 - a 20.25 % increase .
a bournemouth to london cheap day return will go up from £ 36.40 to £ 43.70 - a 20.05 % rise .
anthony smith , chief executive of passenger focus , said : " these increases are unacceptable and come only a matter of months after their last price rises .
" the affordable , turn-up-and-go railway has been further eroded and swt is exploiting a monopoly market .
" families making day trips to london will be hit hard by these changes .

in modern times the conflict has centred on opposing views of the area 's status .
what is a quick guide ?
quick guides are concise explanations of topics or issues in the news .
more quick guides some people in northern ireland , especially the mainly protestant unionist community , believe it should remain part of the united kingdom .
others , particularly the mainly catholic nationalist community , believe it should leave the uk and become part of the republic of ireland .
origins since the 12th century constant revolts challenged the often brutal british rule of ireland , climaxing in the 1916 easter uprising in dublin .
it sparked a chain of events leading to civil war and partition of the island .
in the south 26 counties formed a separate state , while six counties in the north stayed within the uk .
over successive decades the catholic minority in the north suffered discrimination over housing and jobs , which fuelled bitter resentment .
the ' troubles ' begin in 1969 catholic civil rights marches and counter-protests by protestant loyalists -lrb- as in " loyal " to the british crown -rrb- spiralled into violent unrest .
british troops were sent in but soon came into conflict with the provisional ira -lrb- irish republican army -rrb- .
loyalist paramilitary groups responded with a campaign of sectarian violence against the catholic community .
as the situation worsened , northern ireland 's parliament was suspended and direct rule imposed from london .
violence on all sides throughout the 1970s , 1980s and early 1990s paramilitary groups waged violent campaigns to pursue their goals .
the ira carried out deadly bomb and gun attacks in britain and northern ireland that targeted police , soldiers , politicians and civilians .
loyalist paramilitaries targeted catholics in " tit-for-tat " killings .
police and british forces tried to keep order , sometimes amid controversy , such as the alleged co-operation of some undercover units with loyalist groups .
peace in sight in the early 1990s negotiations took place between political parties and the british and irish governments .
after several years of talks ira and loyalist ceasefires held and in 1998 the " good friday " agreement was signed .
it set up a power-sharing executive , with ministerial posts distributed by party strength , and elected assembly .
the deal was backed by voters in referendums in northern ireland and the republic , which scrapped its constitutional claim to the north .
fragile future ?
problems remain as devolution has been suspended several times since it began .
it was last suspended in october 2002 over allegations of a republican spying ring at stormont .
the case against the accused later collapsed and one of the defendants was revealed to be a british agent .
he was found shot dead in april 2006 .
want to know more ?
have we missed anything out ?
do you want to suggest a subject for a quick guide ?
send us an e-mail in september 2005 the arms decommissioning body confirmed the ira had put all its weapons beyond use .
but unionists said they remained sceptical without any photographic proof .
a deadline was set by the government for the northern ireland assembly to resolve its differences and resume power-sharing by 24 november 2006 .
however , as politicians met that day to hear if the dup and sinn fein would indicate their candidates for the first and deputy first minister jobs , loyalist killer michael stone burst into stormont .
he was later charged with attempting to murder gerry adams , martin mcguinness and two security guards .
northern ireland assembly elections were held on 7 march and the dup and sinn fein emerged as the biggest parties .
several weeks later , ian paisley and gerry adams agreed an historic power-sharing deal , naming 8 may as the date when devolution returns to northern ireland .

the competition , now in its 52nd year , regularly throws up some surprises , a little controversy - and plenty of colour .
a comedy drag act , a flourish of opera , and the legacy of last year 's monster rock winners lordi are just a few of the ones to watch in finland .
female impersonators comedy and glamour opera six tenors lordi 's legacy rock music controversy vampires and nukes veterans contest comebacks newcomers eurovision virgins female impersonators watch verka serdyuchka perform dancing lasha tumbai ukraine , who won eurovision in 2004 with fur and leather-clad star ruslana , are pinning their hopes in helsinki on verka serdyuchka .
the middle-aged self-styled " megastar " , who dresses extravagantly with a silver star perched on top of her head , is in fact the creation of male comic andriy danylko .
the 33-year-old composed the song dancing lasha tumbai , a zany , high-octane tune with lyrics in english , german , russian , ukrainian and mongolian - which his alter-ego has declared an " ode to peace and love " .
the drag queen 's presence at eurovision has angered a number of ukrainian nationalists , who find her vulgar and an insulting parody of village folk - but she remains popular across the former ussr .
denmark also voted for a female impersonator to represent the country at the eurovision song contest .
denmark 's entrant will perform the song drama queen but in stark contrast to verka serdyuchka , peter andersen 's drag creation dq is a vision of sequins , feathers and glamour , with a disco song which might be described as absolutely fabulous .
slovenian trio sestre were the most recent cross-dressing act to grace the eurovision stage in 2002 , finishing in 13th place .
eurovision act angers ukrainians return to menu opera two of this year 's eurovision entrants are making a high-brow bid for eurovision victory .
latvia are resting their hopes on an ensemble of six tenors in the mould of the internationally successful group il divo , and were formed especially for the song contest .
their name , boniparti.lv , is a reference to napoleon , who was mentioned in abba 's famous 1974 eurovision victory , waterloo .
watch boniparti.lv perform questa notte and like any self-respecting opera artists , their song questa notte will be performed entirely in italian , and is tipped to strike a chord with the contest 's older voters .
slovenia have failed to progress from eurovision 's qualifying round since it was introduced in 2004 .
the country has turned its back on pop , choosing to send soprano alenka gotar to helsinki , who will reach for the top notes with her song cvet z juga .
but the singer has yet to give up the day job - in the run-up to eurovision , she was in japan performing delibe 's lakme with slovenia 's maribor opera and ballet company .
the two countries must hope their fortunes do not emulate turkey 's 1983 entrant cetin alp , whose song opera finished last with no points .
return to menu the lordi effect it was finland 's " day of rockoning " at the eurovision song contest last year when hard rock monsters lordi romped to victory .
watch hanna pakarinen perform leave me alone while no country has dared copy their frightening masks and devilish costumes , several have decided that rock music is the key to capturing victory this year .
host nation finland has stuck with the rock theme , with hanna pakarinen singing the edgy , slightly miserable goth-pop song leave me alone .
neighbouring sweden has opted for a slice of upbeat , glam rock from the ark , a flamboyant band with an androgynous , openly bisexual lead singer .
tiny pyrenean principality andorra is offering another take on rock , with teen punk band anonymous hoping to lift the country into their first grand final with an energetic plea to save the world .
at the other end of the age scale , croatia voted to send dragonfly along with popular veteran rocker dado topic , who at 57 is one of the oldest artists ever to grace the eurovision stage .
return to menu controversy watch dj bobo perform vampires are alive monster rockers lordi caused a storm of controversy in 2006 , being branded as satanists by some groups .
the attention they received may have helped them to a famous victory .
earlier this year in switzerland , local star and eurovision hopeful dj bobo sparked a row with his song vampires are alive .
some evangelical groups organised a petition against their country 's entry , arguing the song would encourage occultist practices and even suicide .
lyrics including " from heaven to hell , enjoy the ride ... you 're here to surrender with your life " fuelled the claims .
dj bobo has called the song a fairytale , while it soared to the top end of the swiss charts .
teapacks lyrics there are some crazy rulers , they hide and try to fool us , with demonic , technologic willingness to harm this year 's explosive entry from israel , push the button , has been interpreted as containing references to iran 's nuclear programme .
but the multi-lingual song was passed by eurovision chiefs , who are careful to ensure that contest entries do not contain any political messages , while performers teapacks declared they were " not a political group " .
eurovision approves israel entry return to menu eurovision veterans eurovision performers regularly return for another whiff of musical glory , and 2007 is no exception .
watch karolina goceva perform mojot svet eirikur hauksson from iceland was a member of the group icy , the country 's first eurovision entrant in 1986 , and represented norway five years later as part of just 4 fun .
evridiki from cyprus is also hoping for third time lucky , after doing the honours in 1992 and 1994 .
her latest song will curiously be sung entirely in french .
edsilia rombley from the netherlands will hope to steer her country into the grand final for the first time since 2004 .
her fourth place in 1998 remains the best dutch result since their victory in 1975 .
karolina goceva will represent fyr macedonia for the second time in five years , aiming to gain the country a top 10 finish for the first time .
each of the veterans will have to qualify from the semi-final , in which 28 countries will be battling for just 10 berths in 12 may 's grand final .
return to menu newcomers the eurovision family continues its expansion with two new countries taking to the stage for the first time this year .
watch sopho perform visionary dream the former soviet republic of georgia pushes the contest 's boundaries eastwards , with local star sopho khalvashi holding the honour of becoming the country 's debut performer .
a nation closer to the heart of europe which has shied away from competing until now is the czech republic .
the czechs , who have always cited financial difficulties for their absence , are pinning their hopes on veteran rock band kabat .
serbia and montenegro will be taking part for the first time in their own right , after montenegro became independent last year .
as a united state , the country came second on their debut in 2004 , and finished seventh the following year .
serbia is tipped to do well with acclaimed local singer marija serifovic , with the country likely to pick up votes from its numerous balkan neighbours .

the middle-aged self-styled " megastar " , who dresses extravagantly with a silver star perched on top of her head , is in fact the creation of male comic andriy danylko .
the 33-year-old composed the song dancing lasha tumbai , a zany , high-octane tune with lyrics in english , german , russian , ukrainian and mongolian - which his alter-ego has declared an " ode to peace and love " .

by nick hood senior london partner at business rescue experts begbies traynor nick hood says football rescues often lead to false hopes administration for leeds could mean a big write-off for tax payers .
leeds united 's fall from footballing grace is finally complete , adding the insult of administration to its demotion from the championship .
but , while the administrators seem to have a ready-made rescue party in ken bates and his consortium , some of the creditors will be facing huge losses , whilst others will be paid in full .
this strange outcome is one that would be contrary to insolvency law in any other industry - except the fantasy world of football finance .
in every other type of insolvency , the creditors rank equally and they all stand to get the same payout when things go wrong .
but the football authorities will insist that the so-called " football creditors " , such as the players and other clubs owed money for transfer deals , must be paid in full .
otherwise , the insolvent club will be ejected from the professional football world and the players ' contracts will revert to the league authorities .
if that happened , the club would , in effect , be destroyed .

in 1997 shortly after burying his mother , he left dublin by helicopter for castle buildings in stormont to continue negotiating the good friday agreement .
and while the dup has insisted on some changes to the agreement in the intervening years , it remains the basis for devolution in northern ireland .
perhaps it 's because people know that he invested so much in the peace process at a difficult time for him personally that bertie ahern always gets a good reception on his visits to northern ireland .
the same ca n't be said about some of his predecessors as irish republic prime minister .
in 1965 , dup leader ian paisley protested as sean lemass made his way by car up the long avenue in stormont for a meeting with the northern ireland prime minister , captain terence o 'neill .
and in 1990 charles haughey , while addressing the institute of directors on economic matters , had to listen to noisy heckles outside the europa hotel from unionists protesting against the anglo-irish agreement and dublin having a say in northern ireland 's internal affairs .
how times have changed !
bertie ahern , who is in the middle of an election campaign , knows that his presence in stormont , his meeting with ian paisley on the banks of the boyne on 11 may and his address to both houses of parliament at westminster four days later , will do him no harm with the voters .
the three occasions will remind his electorate that he played a key role in bringing peace , devolution and normality to northern ireland .
but bertie ahern 's fianna fail party did n't always have such a cosy relationship with unionists . "
in the past , many in northern ireland believed the republic wanted to gobble them up into a united ireland , but few now hold such views " when eamon de valera , another of bertie ahern 's predecessors , founded fianna fail in 1926 he had two aims : irish unity and restoring the irish language .
neither goal has been achieved , although the party continues to pay lip-service to the desirability of both .
the violence of the troubles forced fianna fail to confront its rhetorical nationalism and to accept the principle that northern ireland would remain part of the united kingdom as long as a majority there consented to such an arrangement .
bertie ahern and albert reynolds , as former fianna fail prime ministers , were both keen to reassure unionists that their party accepted the consent principle .

uk researchers tested the effects of a range of artificial colourings on children 's behaviour .
it is understood the results back previous research linking additives to hyperactivity and poor concentration .
the food standards agency -lrb- fsa -rrb- said it would not issue formal recommendations until the findings were published .
but independent experts said parents should avoid foodstuffs containing the additives .
a team at the university of southampton tested the additives tartrazine -lrb- e102 -rrb- , ponceau 4r -lrb- e124 -rrb- , sunset yellow -lrb- e110 -rrb- , carmoisine -lrb- e122 -rrb- , quinoline yellow -lrb- e104 -rrb- and allura red ac -lrb- e129 -rrb- on both three-year olds and eight-to-nine year olds .
we are very keen to promote fresh healthy home cooked food and if you get that sort of food you do n't have to worry about additives pru leith , school food trust the amounts used in the study were those that an average child might consume in a day .
a source at the university told food industry magazine the grocer that their results supported findings first made seven years ago that linked the additives to behavioural problems such as temper tantrums , poor concentration , hyperactivity and allergic reactions .
the fsa 's committee of toxicity on chemicals looked at the original research , known as the isle of wight study , which had concluded removal of such colourings from childrens ' diet would produce " significant changes " in behaviour and not just in those children already showing hyperactive behaviour .
but the committee decided in 2002 the research was inconclusive .
at a recent closed meeting the committee noted the " public health importance " of the new findings but the results will not be acted until published in a scientific journal .
the fsa said it would be handling the findings in " the proper scientific way " and hoped they would be published in a matter of months .
choice all the additives tested in the study are approved for use in the eu and are safe but some of the colours are banned in scandinavian countries and the us .
pru leith , chair of the school food trust said she hoped the findings would be published quickly but the fsa had to follow scientific protocols before making recommendations .
" we are very keen to promote fresh healthy home cooked food and if you get that sort of food you do n't have to worry about additives .
" there is a lot of anecdotal evidence from teachers and parents about children behaving badly when they 're given sugary food stuffs so in the end i 'm sure we will have the corroborating evidence . "
professor vyvyan howard , one of the experts on the fsa 's additives and behaviour working group said it was important the findings were published but that consumers could choose not to buy products containing the additives .
" it is biologically plausible that there could be an effect from these additives .
while you are waiting for the results to come out you can choose not to expose your children to these substances .
" these compounds have no nutritional value and i personally do not feed these sorts of foods to my 15-month-old daughter . "
sainsbury 's will next month become the first supermarket to ban artificial colours and flavourings in its own-label soft drinks .
other major supermarkets are also reviewing their policies on additives due to pressure from parents .

uk researchers tested the effects of a range of artificial colourings on children 's behaviour .
it is understood the results back previous research linking additives to hyperactivity and poor concentration .
the food standards agency -lrb- fsa -rrb- said it would not issue formal recommendations until the findings were published .
but independent experts said parents should avoid foodstuffs containing the additives .
a team at the university of southampton tested the additives tartrazine -lrb- e102 -rrb- , ponceau 4r -lrb- e124 -rrb- , sunset yellow -lrb- e110 -rrb- , carmoisine -lrb- e122 -rrb- , quinoline yellow -lrb- e104 -rrb- and allura red ac -lrb- e129 -rrb- on both three-year olds and eight-to-nine year olds .
we are very keen to promote fresh healthy home cooked food and if you get that sort of food you do n't have to worry about additives pru leith , school food trust the amounts used in the study were those that an average child might consume in a day .
a source at the university told food industry magazine the grocer that their results supported findings first made seven years ago that linked the additives to behavioural problems such as temper tantrums , poor concentration , hyperactivity and allergic reactions .
the fsa 's committee of toxicity on chemicals looked at the original research , known as the isle of wight study , which had concluded removal of such colourings from childrens ' diet would produce " significant changes " in behaviour and not just in those children already showing hyperactive behaviour .
but the committee decided in 2002 the research was inconclusive .
at a recent closed meeting the committee noted the " public health importance " of the new findings but the results will not be acted until published in a scientific journal .
the fsa said it would be handling the findings in " the proper scientific way " and hoped they would be published in a matter of months .
choice all the additives tested in the study are approved for use in the eu and are safe but some of the colours are banned in scandinavian countries and the us .
pru leith , chair of the school food trust said she hoped the findings would be published quickly but the fsa had to follow scientific protocols before making recommendations .
" we are very keen to promote fresh healthy home cooked food and if you get that sort of food you do n't have to worry about additives .
" there is a lot of anecdotal evidence from teachers and parents about children behaving badly when they 're given sugary food stuffs so in the end i 'm sure we will have the corroborating evidence . "
professor vyvyan howard , one of the experts on the fsa 's additives and behaviour working group said it was important the findings were published but that consumers could choose not to buy products containing the additives .
" it is biologically plausible that there could be an effect from these additives .
while you are waiting for the results to come out you can choose not to expose your children to these substances .
" these compounds have no nutritional value and i personally do not feed these sorts of foods to my 15-month-old daughter . "

ann hathaway , 44 , from middleton , greater manchester , was given a suspended jail sentence after agreeing a deal with italian prosecutors .
she flew back to manchester airport on monday after she was released from a sicilian jail .
speaking before her departure , she said the experience had " destroyed her " .
her husband , cosa nostra boss antonio rinzivillo , was jailed for 30 years in 2001 for drug trafficking and murder .
hathaway was originally arrested at her terraced home in green street , middleton , by officers from scotland yard 's extradition unit on 18 january .
she appeared at london 's city of westminster magistrates ' court in march where she agreed to be extradited to sicily .
italian prosecutors claimed she was acting as the messenger between her husband in prison and the outside world , and charged her with mafia association .
i just want to get back to my children ann hathaway she was held in isolation at agrigento jail on the italian island of sicily and was due to stand trial as one of 88 people accused of alleged mafia activities .
but hathaway agreed a plea bargain deal in which she admitted mafia association and was given a two-year suspended jail sentence , prosecutor nicola marino said .
speaking to italian journalists after her release , hathaway was asked if she would marry her husband if she could live her life again .
she said : " of course i would .
i love him .
he is the father of my two children .
rinzivillo was said to be second to mafia boss bernardo provenzano " this experience has destroyed me .
in agrigento jail i was kept in isolation and only had a shower three times a week .
" but the worst thing was the isolation .
it was inhumane .
" in england , prison was completely different .
it was like being in a hotel - we had a pool , i was able to use the phone and my children visited me .
" now i just want to get back to my children .
" i wo n't have to work as the state will look after us and pay for us until my daughter is 16 years old . "
jail warning hathaway , who has two daughters aged five and 19 , met rinzivillo when she was working in italy and they married nearly 27 years ago .
at one stage her husband 's power was so great he was said to be the mafia 's number two behind bernardo provenzano , who was arrested earlier this year after more than 40 years on the run .
prosecutor nicolo marino said : " we spoke with her husband in jail and she has plea-bargained .
she admitted the facts of mafia association .
" it was difficult for her to do otherwise because it was all on tape from the intercepted telephone conversations .
" she has been given a suspended jail sentence but warned that she will be jailed if she commits a crime within the next five years . "

ann hathaway , 44 , from middleton , greater manchester , was given a suspended jail sentence after agreeing a deal with italian prosecutors .
she flew back to manchester airport on monday after she was released from a sicilian jail .
speaking before her departure , she said the experience had " destroyed her " .
her husband , cosa nostra boss antonio rinzivillo , was jailed for 30 years in 2001 for drug trafficking and murder .
hathaway was originally arrested at her terraced home in green street , middleton , by officers from scotland yard 's extradition unit on 18 january .
she appeared at london 's city of westminster magistrates ' court in march where she agreed to be extradited to sicily .
italian prosecutors claimed she was acting as the messenger between her husband in prison and the outside world , and charged her with mafia association .
i just want to get back to my children ann hathaway she was held in isolation at agrigento jail on the italian island of sicily and was due to stand trial as one of 88 people accused of alleged mafia activities .

i love him .
he is the father of my two children .
rinzivillo was said to be second to mafia boss bernardo provenzano " this experience has destroyed me .
in agrigento jail i was kept in isolation and only had a shower three times a week .

it was inhumane .
" in england , prison was completely different .
it was like being in a hotel - we had a pool , i was able to use the phone and my children visited me .
" now i just want to get back to my children .
" i wo n't have to work as the state will look after us and pay for us until my daughter is 16 years old . "
jail warning hathaway , who has two daughters aged five and 19 , met rinzivillo when she was working in italy and they married nearly 27 years ago .
at one stage her husband 's power was so great he was said to be the mafia 's number two behind bernardo provenzano , who was arrested earlier this year after more than 40 years on the run .
prosecutor nicolo marino said : " we spoke with her husband in jail and she has plea-bargained .
she admitted the facts of mafia association .
" it was difficult for her to do otherwise because it was all on tape from the intercepted telephone conversations .
" she has been given a suspended jail sentence but warned that she will be jailed if she commits a crime within the next five years . "

british and irish prime ministers tony blair and bertie ahern are at stormont to witness the ceremony .
direct rule over ni by london ministers officially ended at midnight , almost five years since it was brought back .
as he arrived at stormont , mr paisley said northern ireland was " on the road to prosperity " .
" i believe we 're starting on a road which will bring us back to peace and to prosperity , " he said .
quick guide : conflict in ni send us your comments " and i would challenge the people of northern ireland to rise to the challenge and be determined that , come what may , we 'll make this a country where all men and women will be equal under the law - and equally subject to the law . "
mr mcguinness said he was confident he and the dup leader could work together .
" we 've already taken joint decisions , but that was in the context of not having power , " he said .
" all of that is going to change in the next couple of hours , and by midday today , we 're going to be in charge , and we 're going to be charged with the responsibility of governing in the interests of the people . "
sinn fein president gerry adams said it was " a big day " for the people of ireland , and that his party and the dup had opened up " the potential for a new beginning " .
" i think what today proves is that dialogue and perseverance and tenacity and persistence can bring about results , " he said .

ministers from the four main parties will take their pledge of office , which includes support for the police .
the return of devolved government follows an historic meeting in march between dup leader ian paisley and sinn fein president gerry adams , where they agreed to share power .
northern ireland secretary peter hain said he was confident the parties would make a go of it .
" it 's going to stick , i believe , because the dup and sinn fein - gerry adams and martin mcguinness on the one hand , ian paisley and peter robinson on the other - these are the two most polarised forces in northern ireland 's politics , they have done the deal , " he said .
in october 2002 , allegations of intelligence gathering within stormont led to the suspension of power-sharing institutions .
a subsequent court case collapsed .
among the vip guests on tuesday will be us senator ted kennedy .
the dup leader 's wife baroness paisley and the sinn fein chief negotiator 's mother peggy mcguinness are also expected to attend .
a new speaker , the dup 's william hay , is to be elected assembly speaker along with three new deputies from the other main parties .
the first meeting of the new power-sharing executive is scheduled for later this week .
