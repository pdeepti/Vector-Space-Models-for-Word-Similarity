program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 18.12.2007 opinion : putin is an unlikely prime minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's president putin said he would become prime minister if his choice candidate dmitry medvedev wins the presidential election .
but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he ca n't see putin taking orders as second-in-command . at first glance , everything seems quite simple : vladimir putin 's presidential candidate dmitry medvedev becomes his successor and putin then stays in power as medvedev 's prime minister . it is not unthinkable that the medvedev-putin team could be governing russia as of summer 2008 .
but if we take a closer look , some loopholes become evident in the scenario . let us first imagine the following situation ?
prime minister putin goes to the kremlin each morning to report to president medvedev and give an account of the success or even failure of national projects ? would president medvedev then praise his predecessor and fatherly friend putin or correct him when he 's made a big mistake ?
in the best case , this scenario resembles a grandiose satire . in the worst case , president medvedev would destroy the myth of putin as " national leader " . it is difficult to imagine putin working as prime minister under his protégé , at least if the current division of power between the president and the prime minister in russia remains the same .
putin should know this better than anyone . medvedev needs putin putin 's intention of becoming prime minister under medvedev should not be seen right now as the final outcome .
there are other , more pressing reasons for putin announcing this plan since he has only one goal in mind that he wants reached by march 2 : dmitry medvedev should become russia 's next president . even with the propaganda machine in full gear and all the administrative resources at work , medvedev still needs all the help he can get from putin .
this is why putin has said he wants to become prime minister under medvedev as president . just as the kremlin party united russia won the duma elections with putin as their top candidate , the bland and relatively unknown medvedev is to win the presidential election with putin as his premier .
similarly , the upcoming presidential election can be turned into a referendum on putin , even if he does n't officially run , fitting the motto " elect medvedev and keep putin . " other power struggles however , putin 's support for medvedev is n't just a sign to the population and russian voters .
the scenario of medvedev as president and putin as prime minister is also a signal to the members of the kremlin who do not fully back medvedev . it 's a widely accepted rumor that there have been and still are some forces among the kremlin elite who want putin to stay on as president .
they 're afraid of losing their power - and access to the country 's coffers - should medvedev take on the presidency . putin has sent a clear signal to medvedev 's powerful opponents , who are at least theoretically capable of fabricating and spreading compromising material about the presidential candidate .
after all , putin will stay in power if only as prime minister . at the moment , the possibility can not be excluded that putin will become russia 's prime minister under medvedev but neither is a done deal .
the real decision will not be made in the kremlin until after march 2 . until then , the next act in this political drama is medvedev 's election as president - at any cost . ingo mannteufel is the director of deutsche welle 's russian online department dw-world.de / russian . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a third suspect 's trial got underway in düsseldorf . lebanese national jihad h. received a sentence of 12 years imprisonment on tuesday , dec .
18 , for his involvement in the july 2006 bomb plot .
youssef d. , on trial in absentia , had been sentenced to death but the judgment was reduced to life . three other suspects on trial in the case were found not guilty and released . meanwhile the trial of youssef mohammed e.h. , an alleged co-conspirator in the case , began tuesday in the german city of düsseldorf .
defense lawyers are expected to focus on why the devices did n't explode .
the 23-year-old could face life in prison if convicted . prosecutors claim the defendant wanted to create explosions similar to the deadly train bombings in london and madrid . " a detonation would have in both cases led to a significant wave of pressure , " prosecutors said in court documents .
" lighter fluid in the ' bomb trolleys ' could have set off a fireball . " while e.h. has refused to speak to police about his involvement in the bombing attempt , h. , 22 , has said the two were seeking revenge for the publication of caricatures of the prophet mohammed in european newspapers . suspect returned to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities say the suitcase bombs would 've been deadly surveillance videos in the cologne train station showed two men placing heaving suitcases onto trains . according to the 40-page indictment , e.h. , wearing a german soccer jersey , rode the train a short distance before abandoning the suitcase bomb .
after getting off the train , he headed immediately for the airport , where he flew to turkey . yet a week later , he returned to the northern city of kiel where he was studying , according to the report .
prosecutors say that after pictures of him appeared in german newspapers , he called his father in lebanon for advice .
his father advised him to leave the country immediately . the phone was tapped , and german authorities arrested the alleged bomber as he arrived at the kiel train station . five days later , h. turned himself in to police in the northern lebanese city of tripoli . terrorist threat continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutors want to prove the men were part of a larger conspiracy the defense lawyer in düsseldorf is expected to argue that his client never meant for the suitcases to explode .
the plot was discovered when train employees opened one of the suitcases which had been turned over to lost and found . " we see the key issue as being : why did the charges not explode ? " said bernd rosenkranz , the hamburg-based defense lawyer , according to dpa news service .
" maybe they were never meant to explode . " prosecutors are expected to argue that the two men were part of a larger islamic conspiracy . authorities have warned that germany remains a target for islamic extremists . some politicians have cited the bombing attempt as a wake-up call about the terrorist threat in germany .
there have been calls for additional monitoring of terrorism suspects . in september , three men were arrested in southern germany for allegedly plotting to bomb united states and uzbek targets .
a fourth suspect was arrested in turkey .
prosecutors say the men are part of the islamic jihad union , a group with roots in uzbekistan . german law and germany 's press codex attempt to protect the privacy of suspected and convicted criminals by only allowing publication of their first names and the first initial of their surnames .

but , the bloc 's biggest reforms planned in years wo n't take effect unless the other 26 states also agree to it . hungary 's parliament voted 325-5 on monday , dec .
17 , to adopt the eu 's much-discussed guiding document .
there were 14 abstentions . " while there are often heated debates between the parties here in hungary 's parliament ... there is fundamental agreement on the question whether hungary 's stance is to cooperate with european integration , " prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said before the vote . the lisbon treaty , which is a pared down version of the eu constitution rejected by france and the netherlands in 2005 , must be approved by all member states by june 2009 for it to take effect . ireland will hold a referendum , according to a stipulation in its constitution , while the other members , like hungary , will likely put the matter to a parliamentary vote .
it was french and dutch referendum votes in 2005 that doomed the document 's predecessor , the constitutional treaty . treaty to whittle down bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with only one vote in , it 's not yet clear how the winds will blow the deal signed by eu leaders in lisbon last week seeks to ease the decision-making process in the bloc by replacing a system of unanimity with a majority vote . it also foresees a new eu president , appointed for a term of up to five years , as an alternative to the current rotation system , where each member state trades off holding a six-month presidency .
portugal holds the presidency through the end of this year , when slovenia takes over . the lisbon treaty also reduces the number of members in the bloc 's executive body , the european commission , from one per member state to a total of 18 . hungary joined the eu together with nine other central and eastern european states on may 1 , 2004 , raising membership from 15 to 25 .
since then , bulgaria and romania have also joined . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's important that people realize that the ' ndrangheta is not a local or even regional phenomenon , but a european one , " calabria 's top anti-mafia official told news television station , skytg24 . the murdered six were all members of the pelle-romeo family which is engaged in a long-running bloody feud with the strangio-nirta clan to which the gunmen are believed to belong . tit-for-tat violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the six men were shot near duisburg railway station one of the men murdered in duisburg was the chief suspect in the 2006 murder of maria strangio , wife of 29-year-old giovanni strangio , the suspected leader of the strangio-nirta clan . strangio , who is thought to be behind the august murders , is still at large , and the italian authorities believe he is hiding out somewhere in calabria . the mobster murders in duisburg prompted italian and german police to seal a pact towards better coordinating their efforts in the fight against organized crime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 18.12.2007 opinion : putin is an unlikely prime minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's president putin said he would become prime minister if his choice candidate dmitry medvedev wins the presidential election .
but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he ca n't see putin taking orders as second-in-command . at first glance , everything seems quite simple : vladimir putin 's presidential candidate dmitry medvedev becomes his successor and putin then stays in power as medvedev 's prime minister . it is not unthinkable that the medvedev-putin team could be governing russia as of summer 2008 .
but if we take a closer look , some loopholes become evident in the scenario . let us first imagine the following situation ?
prime minister putin goes to the kremlin each morning to report to president medvedev and give an account of the success or even failure of national projects ? would president medvedev then praise his predecessor and fatherly friend putin or correct him when he 's made a big mistake ?
in the best case , this scenario resembles a grandiose satire . in the worst case , president medvedev would destroy the myth of putin as " national leader " . it is difficult to imagine putin working as prime minister under his protégé , at least if the current division of power between the president and the prime minister in russia remains the same .
putin should know this better than anyone . medvedev needs putin putin 's intention of becoming prime minister under medvedev should not be seen right now as the final outcome .
there are other , more pressing reasons for putin announcing this plan since he has only one goal in mind that he wants reached by march 2 : dmitry medvedev should become russia 's next president . even with the propaganda machine in full gear and all the administrative resources at work , medvedev still needs all the help he can get from putin .
this is why putin has said he wants to become prime minister under medvedev as president . just as the kremlin party united russia won the duma elections with putin as their top candidate , the bland and relatively unknown medvedev is to win the presidential election with putin as his premier .
similarly , the upcoming presidential election can be turned into a referendum on putin , even if he does n't officially run , fitting the motto " elect medvedev and keep putin . " other power struggles however , putin 's support for medvedev is n't just a sign to the population and russian voters .
the scenario of medvedev as president and putin as prime minister is also a signal to the members of the kremlin who do not fully back medvedev . it 's a widely accepted rumor that there have been and still are some forces among the kremlin elite who want putin to stay on as president .
they 're afraid of losing their power - and access to the country 's coffers - should medvedev take on the presidency . putin has sent a clear signal to medvedev 's powerful opponents , who are at least theoretically capable of fabricating and spreading compromising material about the presidential candidate .
after all , putin will stay in power if only as prime minister . at the moment , the possibility can not be excluded that putin will become russia 's prime minister under medvedev but neither is a done deal .
the real decision will not be made in the kremlin until after march 2 . until then , the next act in this political drama is medvedev 's election as president - at any cost . ingo mannteufel is the director of deutsche welle 's russian online department dw-world.de / russian . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he ca n't see putin taking orders as second-in-command . at first glance , everything seems quite simple : vladimir putin 's presidential candidate dmitry medvedev becomes his successor and putin then stays in power as medvedev 's prime minister . it is not unthinkable that the medvedev-putin team could be governing russia as of summer 2008 .
but if we take a closer look , some loopholes become evident in the scenario . let us first imagine the following situation ?
prime minister putin goes to the kremlin each morning to report to president medvedev and give an account of the success or even failure of national projects ? would president medvedev then praise his predecessor and fatherly friend putin or correct him when he 's made a big mistake ?
in the best case , this scenario resembles a grandiose satire . in the worst case , president medvedev would destroy the myth of putin as " national leader " . it is difficult to imagine putin working as prime minister under his protégé , at least if the current division of power between the president and the prime minister in russia remains the same .
putin should know this better than anyone . medvedev needs putin putin 's intention of becoming prime minister under medvedev should not be seen right now as the final outcome .
there are other , more pressing reasons for putin announcing this plan since he has only one goal in mind that he wants reached by march 2 : dmitry medvedev should become russia 's next president . even with the propaganda machine in full gear and all the administrative resources at work , medvedev still needs all the help he can get from putin .
this is why putin has said he wants to become prime minister under medvedev as president . just as the kremlin party united russia won the duma elections with putin as their top candidate , the bland and relatively unknown medvedev is to win the presidential election with putin as his premier .
similarly , the upcoming presidential election can be turned into a referendum on putin , even if he does n't officially run , fitting the motto " elect medvedev and keep putin . " other power struggles however , putin 's support for medvedev is n't just a sign to the population and russian voters .
the scenario of medvedev as president and putin as prime minister is also a signal to the members of the kremlin who do not fully back medvedev . it 's a widely accepted rumor that there have been and still are some forces among the kremlin elite who want putin to stay on as president .
they 're afraid of losing their power - and access to the country 's coffers - should medvedev take on the presidency . putin has sent a clear signal to medvedev 's powerful opponents , who are at least theoretically capable of fabricating and spreading compromising material about the presidential candidate .
after all , putin will stay in power if only as prime minister . at the moment , the possibility can not be excluded that putin will become russia 's prime minister under medvedev but neither is a done deal .
the real decision will not be made in the kremlin until after march 2 . until then , the next act in this political drama is medvedev 's election as president - at any cost . ingo mannteufel is the director of deutsche welle 's russian online department dw-world.de / russian . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a third suspect 's trial got underway in düsseldorf . lebanese national jihad h. received a sentence of 12 years imprisonment on tuesday , dec .
18 , for his involvement in the july 2006 bomb plot .
youssef d. , on trial in absentia , had been sentenced to death but the judgment was reduced to life . three other suspects on trial in the case were found not guilty and released . meanwhile the trial of youssef mohammed e.h. , an alleged co-conspirator in the case , began tuesday in the german city of düsseldorf .
defense lawyers are expected to focus on why the devices did n't explode .
the 23-year-old could face life in prison if convicted . prosecutors claim the defendant wanted to create explosions similar to the deadly train bombings in london and madrid . " a detonation would have in both cases led to a significant wave of pressure , " prosecutors said in court documents .
" lighter fluid in the ' bomb trolleys ' could have set off a fireball . " while e.h. has refused to speak to police about his involvement in the bombing attempt , h. , 22 , has said the two were seeking revenge for the publication of caricatures of the prophet mohammed in european newspapers . suspect returned to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities say the suitcase bombs would 've been deadly surveillance videos in the cologne train station showed two men placing heaving suitcases onto trains . according to the 40-page indictment , e.h. , wearing a german soccer jersey , rode the train a short distance before abandoning the suitcase bomb .
after getting off the train , he headed immediately for the airport , where he flew to turkey . yet a week later , he returned to the northern city of kiel where he was studying , according to the report .
prosecutors say that after pictures of him appeared in german newspapers , he called his father in lebanon for advice .
his father advised him to leave the country immediately . the phone was tapped , and german authorities arrested the alleged bomber as he arrived at the kiel train station . five days later , h. turned himself in to police in the northern lebanese city of tripoli . terrorist threat continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutors want to prove the men were part of a larger conspiracy the defense lawyer in düsseldorf is expected to argue that his client never meant for the suitcases to explode .
the plot was discovered when train employees opened one of the suitcases which had been turned over to lost and found . " we see the key issue as being : why did the charges not explode ? " said bernd rosenkranz , the hamburg-based defense lawyer , according to dpa news service .
" maybe they were never meant to explode . " prosecutors are expected to argue that the two men were part of a larger islamic conspiracy . authorities have warned that germany remains a target for islamic extremists . some politicians have cited the bombing attempt as a wake-up call about the terrorist threat in germany .
there have been calls for additional monitoring of terrorism suspects . in september , three men were arrested in southern germany for allegedly plotting to bomb united states and uzbek targets .
a fourth suspect was arrested in turkey .
prosecutors say the men are part of the islamic jihad union , a group with roots in uzbekistan . german law and germany 's press codex attempt to protect the privacy of suspected and convicted criminals by only allowing publication of their first names and the first initial of their surnames .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 18.12.2007 opinion : putin is an unlikely prime minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's president putin said he would become prime minister if his choice candidate dmitry medvedev wins the presidential election .
but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he ca n't see putin taking orders as second-in-command . at first glance , everything seems quite simple : vladimir putin 's presidential candidate dmitry medvedev becomes his successor and putin then stays in power as medvedev 's prime minister . it is not unthinkable that the medvedev-putin team could be governing russia as of summer 2008 .
but if we take a closer look , some loopholes become evident in the scenario . let us first imagine the following situation ?
prime minister putin goes to the kremlin each morning to report to president medvedev and give an account of the success or even failure of national projects ? would president medvedev then praise his predecessor and fatherly friend putin or correct him when he 's made a big mistake ?
in the best case , this scenario resembles a grandiose satire . in the worst case , president medvedev would destroy the myth of putin as " national leader " . it is difficult to imagine putin working as prime minister under his protégé , at least if the current division of power between the president and the prime minister in russia remains the same .
putin should know this better than anyone . medvedev needs putin putin 's intention of becoming prime minister under medvedev should not be seen right now as the final outcome .
there are other , more pressing reasons for putin announcing this plan since he has only one goal in mind that he wants reached by march 2 : dmitry medvedev should become russia 's next president . even with the propaganda machine in full gear and all the administrative resources at work , medvedev still needs all the help he can get from putin .
this is why putin has said he wants to become prime minister under medvedev as president . just as the kremlin party united russia won the duma elections with putin as their top candidate , the bland and relatively unknown medvedev is to win the presidential election with putin as his premier .
similarly , the upcoming presidential election can be turned into a referendum on putin , even if he does n't officially run , fitting the motto " elect medvedev and keep putin . " other power struggles however , putin 's support for medvedev is n't just a sign to the population and russian voters .
the scenario of medvedev as president and putin as prime minister is also a signal to the members of the kremlin who do not fully back medvedev . it 's a widely accepted rumor that there have been and still are some forces among the kremlin elite who want putin to stay on as president .
they 're afraid of losing their power - and access to the country 's coffers - should medvedev take on the presidency . putin has sent a clear signal to medvedev 's powerful opponents , who are at least theoretically capable of fabricating and spreading compromising material about the presidential candidate .
after all , putin will stay in power if only as prime minister . at the moment , the possibility can not be excluded that putin will become russia 's prime minister under medvedev but neither is a done deal .
the real decision will not be made in the kremlin until after march 2 . until then , the next act in this political drama is medvedev 's election as president - at any cost . ingo mannteufel is the director of deutsche welle 's russian online department dw-world.de / russian . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but , the bloc 's biggest reforms planned in years wo n't take effect unless the other 26 states also agree to it . hungary 's parliament voted 325-5 on monday , dec .
17 , to adopt the eu 's much-discussed guiding document .
there were 14 abstentions . " while there are often heated debates between the parties here in hungary 's parliament ... there is fundamental agreement on the question whether hungary 's stance is to cooperate with european integration , " prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said before the vote . the lisbon treaty , which is a pared down version of the eu constitution rejected by france and the netherlands in 2005 , must be approved by all member states by june 2009 for it to take effect . ireland will hold a referendum , according to a stipulation in its constitution , while the other members , like hungary , will likely put the matter to a parliamentary vote .
it was french and dutch referendum votes in 2005 that doomed the document 's predecessor , the constitutional treaty . treaty to whittle down bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with only one vote in , it 's not yet clear how the winds will blow the deal signed by eu leaders in lisbon last week seeks to ease the decision-making process in the bloc by replacing a system of unanimity with a majority vote . it also foresees a new eu president , appointed for a term of up to five years , as an alternative to the current rotation system , where each member state trades off holding a six-month presidency .
portugal holds the presidency through the end of this year , when slovenia takes over . the lisbon treaty also reduces the number of members in the bloc 's executive body , the european commission , from one per member state to a total of 18 . hungary joined the eu together with nine other central and eastern european states on may 1 , 2004 , raising membership from 15 to 25 .

-lrb- 14.12.2007 -rrb- leaders commit to eu 's future by signing the lisbon treaty after a long and painstaking road , the eu has a new roadmap into the future .

but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he ca n't see putin taking orders as second-in-command . at first glance , everything seems quite simple : vladimir putin 's presidential candidate dmitry medvedev becomes his successor and putin then stays in power as medvedev 's prime minister . it is not unthinkable that the medvedev-putin team could be governing russia as of summer 2008 .
but if we take a closer look , some loopholes become evident in the scenario . let us first imagine the following situation ?
prime minister putin goes to the kremlin each morning to report to president medvedev and give an account of the success or even failure of national projects ? would president medvedev then praise his predecessor and fatherly friend putin or correct him when he 's made a big mistake ?
in the best case , this scenario resembles a grandiose satire . in the worst case , president medvedev would destroy the myth of putin as " national leader " . it is difficult to imagine putin working as prime minister under his protégé , at least if the current division of power between the president and the prime minister in russia remains the same .
putin should know this better than anyone . medvedev needs putin putin 's intention of becoming prime minister under medvedev should not be seen right now as the final outcome .
there are other , more pressing reasons for putin announcing this plan since he has only one goal in mind that he wants reached by march 2 : dmitry medvedev should become russia 's next president . even with the propaganda machine in full gear and all the administrative resources at work , medvedev still needs all the help he can get from putin .
this is why putin has said he wants to become prime minister under medvedev as president . just as the kremlin party united russia won the duma elections with putin as their top candidate , the bland and relatively unknown medvedev is to win the presidential election with putin as his premier .
similarly , the upcoming presidential election can be turned into a referendum on putin , even if he does n't officially run , fitting the motto " elect medvedev and keep putin . " other power struggles however , putin 's support for medvedev is n't just a sign to the population and russian voters .
the scenario of medvedev as president and putin as prime minister is also a signal to the members of the kremlin who do not fully back medvedev . it 's a widely accepted rumor that there have been and still are some forces among the kremlin elite who want putin to stay on as president .
they 're afraid of losing their power - and access to the country 's coffers - should medvedev take on the presidency . putin has sent a clear signal to medvedev 's powerful opponents , who are at least theoretically capable of fabricating and spreading compromising material about the presidential candidate .
after all , putin will stay in power if only as prime minister . at the moment , the possibility can not be excluded that putin will become russia 's prime minister under medvedev but neither is a done deal .
the real decision will not be made in the kremlin until after march 2 . until then , the next act in this political drama is medvedev 's election as president - at any cost . ingo mannteufel is the director of deutsche welle 's russian online department dw-world.de / russian . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 18.12.2007 opinion : putin is an unlikely prime minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's president putin said he would become prime minister if his choice candidate dmitry medvedev wins the presidential election .
but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he ca n't see putin taking orders as second-in-command . at first glance , everything seems quite simple : vladimir putin 's presidential candidate dmitry medvedev becomes his successor and putin then stays in power as medvedev 's prime minister . it is not unthinkable that the medvedev-putin team could be governing russia as of summer 2008 .
but if we take a closer look , some loopholes become evident in the scenario . let us first imagine the following situation ?
prime minister putin goes to the kremlin each morning to report to president medvedev and give an account of the success or even failure of national projects ? would president medvedev then praise his predecessor and fatherly friend putin or correct him when he 's made a big mistake ?
in the best case , this scenario resembles a grandiose satire . in the worst case , president medvedev would destroy the myth of putin as " national leader " . it is difficult to imagine putin working as prime minister under his protégé , at least if the current division of power between the president and the prime minister in russia remains the same .
putin should know this better than anyone . medvedev needs putin putin 's intention of becoming prime minister under medvedev should not be seen right now as the final outcome .
there are other , more pressing reasons for putin announcing this plan since he has only one goal in mind that he wants reached by march 2 : dmitry medvedev should become russia 's next president . even with the propaganda machine in full gear and all the administrative resources at work , medvedev still needs all the help he can get from putin .
this is why putin has said he wants to become prime minister under medvedev as president . just as the kremlin party united russia won the duma elections with putin as their top candidate , the bland and relatively unknown medvedev is to win the presidential election with putin as his premier .
similarly , the upcoming presidential election can be turned into a referendum on putin , even if he does n't officially run , fitting the motto " elect medvedev and keep putin . " other power struggles however , putin 's support for medvedev is n't just a sign to the population and russian voters .
the scenario of medvedev as president and putin as prime minister is also a signal to the members of the kremlin who do not fully back medvedev . it 's a widely accepted rumor that there have been and still are some forces among the kremlin elite who want putin to stay on as president .
they 're afraid of losing their power - and access to the country 's coffers - should medvedev take on the presidency . putin has sent a clear signal to medvedev 's powerful opponents , who are at least theoretically capable of fabricating and spreading compromising material about the presidential candidate .
after all , putin will stay in power if only as prime minister . at the moment , the possibility can not be excluded that putin will become russia 's prime minister under medvedev but neither is a done deal .
the real decision will not be made in the kremlin until after march 2 . until then , the next act in this political drama is medvedev 's election as president - at any cost . ingo mannteufel is the director of deutsche welle 's russian online department dw-world.de / russian . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but , the bloc 's biggest reforms planned in years wo n't take effect unless the other 26 states also agree to it . hungary 's parliament voted 325-5 on monday , dec .

there were 14 abstentions . " while there are often heated debates between the parties here in hungary 's parliament ... there is fundamental agreement on the question whether hungary 's stance is to cooperate with european integration , " prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said before the vote . the lisbon treaty , which is a pared down version of the eu constitution rejected by france and the netherlands in 2005 , must be approved by all member states by june 2009 for it to take effect . ireland will hold a referendum , according to a stipulation in its constitution , while the other members , like hungary , will likely put the matter to a parliamentary vote .
it was french and dutch referendum votes in 2005 that doomed the document 's predecessor , the constitutional treaty . treaty to whittle down bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with only one vote in , it 's not yet clear how the winds will blow the deal signed by eu leaders in lisbon last week seeks to ease the decision-making process in the bloc by replacing a system of unanimity with a majority vote . it also foresees a new eu president , appointed for a term of up to five years , as an alternative to the current rotation system , where each member state trades off holding a six-month presidency .
portugal holds the presidency through the end of this year , when slovenia takes over . the lisbon treaty also reduces the number of members in the bloc 's executive body , the european commission , from one per member state to a total of 18 . hungary joined the eu together with nine other central and eastern european states on may 1 , 2004 , raising membership from 15 to 25 .

but , the bloc 's biggest reforms planned in years wo n't take effect unless the other 26 states also agree to it . hungary 's parliament voted 325-5 on monday , dec .
17 , to adopt the eu 's much-discussed guiding document .
there were 14 abstentions . " while there are often heated debates between the parties here in hungary 's parliament ... there is fundamental agreement on the question whether hungary 's stance is to cooperate with european integration , " prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said before the vote . the lisbon treaty , which is a pared down version of the eu constitution rejected by france and the netherlands in 2005 , must be approved by all member states by june 2009 for it to take effect . ireland will hold a referendum , according to a stipulation in its constitution , while the other members , like hungary , will likely put the matter to a parliamentary vote .
it was french and dutch referendum votes in 2005 that doomed the document 's predecessor , the constitutional treaty . treaty to whittle down bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with only one vote in , it 's not yet clear how the winds will blow the deal signed by eu leaders in lisbon last week seeks to ease the decision-making process in the bloc by replacing a system of unanimity with a majority vote . it also foresees a new eu president , appointed for a term of up to five years , as an alternative to the current rotation system , where each member state trades off holding a six-month presidency .
portugal holds the presidency through the end of this year , when slovenia takes over . the lisbon treaty also reduces the number of members in the bloc 's executive body , the european commission , from one per member state to a total of 18 . hungary joined the eu together with nine other central and eastern european states on may 1 , 2004 , raising membership from 15 to 25 .

but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he ca n't see putin taking orders as second-in-command . at first glance , everything seems quite simple : vladimir putin 's presidential candidate dmitry medvedev becomes his successor and putin then stays in power as medvedev 's prime minister . it is not unthinkable that the medvedev-putin team could be governing russia as of summer 2008 .
but if we take a closer look , some loopholes become evident in the scenario . let us first imagine the following situation ?
prime minister putin goes to the kremlin each morning to report to president medvedev and give an account of the success or even failure of national projects ? would president medvedev then praise his predecessor and fatherly friend putin or correct him when he 's made a big mistake ?
in the best case , this scenario resembles a grandiose satire . in the worst case , president medvedev would destroy the myth of putin as " national leader " . it is difficult to imagine putin working as prime minister under his protégé , at least if the current division of power between the president and the prime minister in russia remains the same .
putin should know this better than anyone . medvedev needs putin putin 's intention of becoming prime minister under medvedev should not be seen right now as the final outcome .
there are other , more pressing reasons for putin announcing this plan since he has only one goal in mind that he wants reached by march 2 : dmitry medvedev should become russia 's next president . even with the propaganda machine in full gear and all the administrative resources at work , medvedev still needs all the help he can get from putin .
this is why putin has said he wants to become prime minister under medvedev as president . just as the kremlin party united russia won the duma elections with putin as their top candidate , the bland and relatively unknown medvedev is to win the presidential election with putin as his premier .
similarly , the upcoming presidential election can be turned into a referendum on putin , even if he does n't officially run , fitting the motto " elect medvedev and keep putin . " other power struggles however , putin 's support for medvedev is n't just a sign to the population and russian voters .
the scenario of medvedev as president and putin as prime minister is also a signal to the members of the kremlin who do not fully back medvedev . it 's a widely accepted rumor that there have been and still are some forces among the kremlin elite who want putin to stay on as president .
they 're afraid of losing their power - and access to the country 's coffers - should medvedev take on the presidency . putin has sent a clear signal to medvedev 's powerful opponents , who are at least theoretically capable of fabricating and spreading compromising material about the presidential candidate .
after all , putin will stay in power if only as prime minister . at the moment , the possibility can not be excluded that putin will become russia 's prime minister under medvedev but neither is a done deal .
the real decision will not be made in the kremlin until after march 2 . until then , the next act in this political drama is medvedev 's election as president - at any cost . ingo mannteufel is the director of deutsche welle 's russian online department dw-world.de / russian . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a third suspect 's trial got underway in düsseldorf . lebanese national jihad h. received a sentence of 12 years imprisonment on tuesday , dec .

youssef d. , on trial in absentia , had been sentenced to death but the judgment was reduced to life . three other suspects on trial in the case were found not guilty and released . meanwhile the trial of youssef mohammed e.h. , an alleged co-conspirator in the case , began tuesday in the german city of düsseldorf .
defense lawyers are expected to focus on why the devices did n't explode .
the 23-year-old could face life in prison if convicted . prosecutors claim the defendant wanted to create explosions similar to the deadly train bombings in london and madrid . " a detonation would have in both cases led to a significant wave of pressure , " prosecutors said in court documents .
" lighter fluid in the ' bomb trolleys ' could have set off a fireball . " while e.h. has refused to speak to police about his involvement in the bombing attempt , h. , 22 , has said the two were seeking revenge for the publication of caricatures of the prophet mohammed in european newspapers . suspect returned to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities say the suitcase bombs would 've been deadly surveillance videos in the cologne train station showed two men placing heaving suitcases onto trains . according to the 40-page indictment , e.h. , wearing a german soccer jersey , rode the train a short distance before abandoning the suitcase bomb .
after getting off the train , he headed immediately for the airport , where he flew to turkey . yet a week later , he returned to the northern city of kiel where he was studying , according to the report .
prosecutors say that after pictures of him appeared in german newspapers , he called his father in lebanon for advice .
his father advised him to leave the country immediately . the phone was tapped , and german authorities arrested the alleged bomber as he arrived at the kiel train station . five days later , h. turned himself in to police in the northern lebanese city of tripoli . terrorist threat continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutors want to prove the men were part of a larger conspiracy the defense lawyer in düsseldorf is expected to argue that his client never meant for the suitcases to explode .
the plot was discovered when train employees opened one of the suitcases which had been turned over to lost and found . " we see the key issue as being : why did the charges not explode ? " said bernd rosenkranz , the hamburg-based defense lawyer , according to dpa news service .
" maybe they were never meant to explode . " prosecutors are expected to argue that the two men were part of a larger islamic conspiracy . authorities have warned that germany remains a target for islamic extremists . some politicians have cited the bombing attempt as a wake-up call about the terrorist threat in germany .
there have been calls for additional monitoring of terrorism suspects . in september , three men were arrested in southern germany for allegedly plotting to bomb united states and uzbek targets .
a fourth suspect was arrested in turkey .
prosecutors say the men are part of the islamic jihad union , a group with roots in uzbekistan . german law and germany 's press codex attempt to protect the privacy of suspected and convicted criminals by only allowing publication of their first names and the first initial of their surnames .

youssef d. , on trial in absentia , had been sentenced to death but the judgment was reduced to life . three other suspects on trial in the case were found not guilty and released . meanwhile the trial of youssef mohammed e.h. , an alleged co-conspirator in the case , began tuesday in the german city of düsseldorf .
defense lawyers are expected to focus on why the devices did n't explode .
the 23-year-old could face life in prison if convicted . prosecutors claim the defendant wanted to create explosions similar to the deadly train bombings in london and madrid . " a detonation would have in both cases led to a significant wave of pressure , " prosecutors said in court documents .
" lighter fluid in the ' bomb trolleys ' could have set off a fireball . " while e.h. has refused to speak to police about his involvement in the bombing attempt , h. , 22 , has said the two were seeking revenge for the publication of caricatures of the prophet mohammed in european newspapers . suspect returned to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities say the suitcase bombs would 've been deadly surveillance videos in the cologne train station showed two men placing heaving suitcases onto trains . according to the 40-page indictment , e.h. , wearing a german soccer jersey , rode the train a short distance before abandoning the suitcase bomb .
after getting off the train , he headed immediately for the airport , where he flew to turkey . yet a week later , he returned to the northern city of kiel where he was studying , according to the report .
prosecutors say that after pictures of him appeared in german newspapers , he called his father in lebanon for advice .
his father advised him to leave the country immediately . the phone was tapped , and german authorities arrested the alleged bomber as he arrived at the kiel train station . five days later , h. turned himself in to police in the northern lebanese city of tripoli . terrorist threat continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutors want to prove the men were part of a larger conspiracy the defense lawyer in düsseldorf is expected to argue that his client never meant for the suitcases to explode .
the plot was discovered when train employees opened one of the suitcases which had been turned over to lost and found . " we see the key issue as being : why did the charges not explode ? " said bernd rosenkranz , the hamburg-based defense lawyer , according to dpa news service .
" maybe they were never meant to explode . " prosecutors are expected to argue that the two men were part of a larger islamic conspiracy . authorities have warned that germany remains a target for islamic extremists . some politicians have cited the bombing attempt as a wake-up call about the terrorist threat in germany .
there have been calls for additional monitoring of terrorism suspects . in september , three men were arrested in southern germany for allegedly plotting to bomb united states and uzbek targets .
a fourth suspect was arrested in turkey .
prosecutors say the men are part of the islamic jihad union , a group with roots in uzbekistan . german law and germany 's press codex attempt to protect the privacy of suspected and convicted criminals by only allowing publication of their first names and the first initial of their surnames .

but , the bloc 's biggest reforms planned in years wo n't take effect unless the other 26 states also agree to it . hungary 's parliament voted 325-5 on monday , dec .
17 , to adopt the eu 's much-discussed guiding document .
there were 14 abstentions . " while there are often heated debates between the parties here in hungary 's parliament ... there is fundamental agreement on the question whether hungary 's stance is to cooperate with european integration , " prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said before the vote . the lisbon treaty , which is a pared down version of the eu constitution rejected by france and the netherlands in 2005 , must be approved by all member states by june 2009 for it to take effect . ireland will hold a referendum , according to a stipulation in its constitution , while the other members , like hungary , will likely put the matter to a parliamentary vote .
it was french and dutch referendum votes in 2005 that doomed the document 's predecessor , the constitutional treaty . treaty to whittle down bureaucracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with only one vote in , it 's not yet clear how the winds will blow the deal signed by eu leaders in lisbon last week seeks to ease the decision-making process in the bloc by replacing a system of unanimity with a majority vote . it also foresees a new eu president , appointed for a term of up to five years , as an alternative to the current rotation system , where each member state trades off holding a six-month presidency .
portugal holds the presidency through the end of this year , when slovenia takes over . the lisbon treaty also reduces the number of members in the bloc 's executive body , the european commission , from one per member state to a total of 18 . hungary joined the eu together with nine other central and eastern european states on may 1 , 2004 , raising membership from 15 to 25 .
since then , bulgaria and romania have also joined . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he ca n't see putin taking orders as second-in-command . at first glance , everything seems quite simple : vladimir putin 's presidential candidate dmitry medvedev becomes his successor and putin then stays in power as medvedev 's prime minister . it is not unthinkable that the medvedev-putin team could be governing russia as of summer 2008 .
but if we take a closer look , some loopholes become evident in the scenario . let us first imagine the following situation ?
prime minister putin goes to the kremlin each morning to report to president medvedev and give an account of the success or even failure of national projects ? would president medvedev then praise his predecessor and fatherly friend putin or correct him when he 's made a big mistake ?
in the best case , this scenario resembles a grandiose satire . in the worst case , president medvedev would destroy the myth of putin as " national leader " . it is difficult to imagine putin working as prime minister under his protégé , at least if the current division of power between the president and the prime minister in russia remains the same .
putin should know this better than anyone . medvedev needs putin putin 's intention of becoming prime minister under medvedev should not be seen right now as the final outcome .
there are other , more pressing reasons for putin announcing this plan since he has only one goal in mind that he wants reached by march 2 : dmitry medvedev should become russia 's next president . even with the propaganda machine in full gear and all the administrative resources at work , medvedev still needs all the help he can get from putin .
this is why putin has said he wants to become prime minister under medvedev as president . just as the kremlin party united russia won the duma elections with putin as their top candidate , the bland and relatively unknown medvedev is to win the presidential election with putin as his premier .
similarly , the upcoming presidential election can be turned into a referendum on putin , even if he does n't officially run , fitting the motto " elect medvedev and keep putin . " other power struggles however , putin 's support for medvedev is n't just a sign to the population and russian voters .
the scenario of medvedev as president and putin as prime minister is also a signal to the members of the kremlin who do not fully back medvedev . it 's a widely accepted rumor that there have been and still are some forces among the kremlin elite who want putin to stay on as president .
they 're afraid of losing their power - and access to the country 's coffers - should medvedev take on the presidency . putin has sent a clear signal to medvedev 's powerful opponents , who are at least theoretically capable of fabricating and spreading compromising material about the presidential candidate .
after all , putin will stay in power if only as prime minister . at the moment , the possibility can not be excluded that putin will become russia 's prime minister under medvedev but neither is a done deal .

but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he ca n't see putin taking orders as second-in-command . at first glance , everything seems quite simple : vladimir putin 's presidential candidate dmitry medvedev becomes his successor and putin then stays in power as medvedev 's prime minister . it is not unthinkable that the medvedev-putin team could be governing russia as of summer 2008 .
but if we take a closer look , some loopholes become evident in the scenario . let us first imagine the following situation ?
prime minister putin goes to the kremlin each morning to report to president medvedev and give an account of the success or even failure of national projects ? would president medvedev then praise his predecessor and fatherly friend putin or correct him when he 's made a big mistake ?
in the best case , this scenario resembles a grandiose satire . in the worst case , president medvedev would destroy the myth of putin as " national leader " . it is difficult to imagine putin working as prime minister under his protégé , at least if the current division of power between the president and the prime minister in russia remains the same .
putin should know this better than anyone . medvedev needs putin putin 's intention of becoming prime minister under medvedev should not be seen right now as the final outcome .
there are other , more pressing reasons for putin announcing this plan since he has only one goal in mind that he wants reached by march 2 : dmitry medvedev should become russia 's next president . even with the propaganda machine in full gear and all the administrative resources at work , medvedev still needs all the help he can get from putin .
this is why putin has said he wants to become prime minister under medvedev as president . just as the kremlin party united russia won the duma elections with putin as their top candidate , the bland and relatively unknown medvedev is to win the presidential election with putin as his premier .
similarly , the upcoming presidential election can be turned into a referendum on putin , even if he does n't officially run , fitting the motto " elect medvedev and keep putin . " other power struggles however , putin 's support for medvedev is n't just a sign to the population and russian voters .
the scenario of medvedev as president and putin as prime minister is also a signal to the members of the kremlin who do not fully back medvedev . it 's a widely accepted rumor that there have been and still are some forces among the kremlin elite who want putin to stay on as president .
they 're afraid of losing their power - and access to the country 's coffers - should medvedev take on the presidency . putin has sent a clear signal to medvedev 's powerful opponents , who are at least theoretically capable of fabricating and spreading compromising material about the presidential candidate .
after all , putin will stay in power if only as prime minister . at the moment , the possibility can not be excluded that putin will become russia 's prime minister under medvedev but neither is a done deal .
the real decision will not be made in the kremlin until after march 2 . until then , the next act in this political drama is medvedev 's election as president - at any cost . ingo mannteufel is the director of deutsche welle 's russian online department dw-world.de / russian . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a third suspect 's trial got underway in düsseldorf . lebanese national jihad h. received a sentence of 12 years imprisonment on tuesday , dec .
18 , for his involvement in the july 2006 bomb plot .
youssef d. , on trial in absentia , had been sentenced to death but the judgment was reduced to life . three other suspects on trial in the case were found not guilty and released . meanwhile the trial of youssef mohammed e.h. , an alleged co-conspirator in the case , began tuesday in the german city of düsseldorf .
defense lawyers are expected to focus on why the devices did n't explode .
the 23-year-old could face life in prison if convicted . prosecutors claim the defendant wanted to create explosions similar to the deadly train bombings in london and madrid . " a detonation would have in both cases led to a significant wave of pressure , " prosecutors said in court documents .
" lighter fluid in the ' bomb trolleys ' could have set off a fireball . " while e.h. has refused to speak to police about his involvement in the bombing attempt , h. , 22 , has said the two were seeking revenge for the publication of caricatures of the prophet mohammed in european newspapers . suspect returned to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities say the suitcase bombs would 've been deadly surveillance videos in the cologne train station showed two men placing heaving suitcases onto trains . according to the 40-page indictment , e.h. , wearing a german soccer jersey , rode the train a short distance before abandoning the suitcase bomb .
after getting off the train , he headed immediately for the airport , where he flew to turkey . yet a week later , he returned to the northern city of kiel where he was studying , according to the report .
prosecutors say that after pictures of him appeared in german newspapers , he called his father in lebanon for advice .
his father advised him to leave the country immediately . the phone was tapped , and german authorities arrested the alleged bomber as he arrived at the kiel train station . five days later , h. turned himself in to police in the northern lebanese city of tripoli . terrorist threat continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutors want to prove the men were part of a larger conspiracy the defense lawyer in düsseldorf is expected to argue that his client never meant for the suitcases to explode .
the plot was discovered when train employees opened one of the suitcases which had been turned over to lost and found . " we see the key issue as being : why did the charges not explode ? " said bernd rosenkranz , the hamburg-based defense lawyer , according to dpa news service .
" maybe they were never meant to explode . " prosecutors are expected to argue that the two men were part of a larger islamic conspiracy . authorities have warned that germany remains a target for islamic extremists . some politicians have cited the bombing attempt as a wake-up call about the terrorist threat in germany .
there have been calls for additional monitoring of terrorism suspects . in september , three men were arrested in southern germany for allegedly plotting to bomb united states and uzbek targets .
a fourth suspect was arrested in turkey .
prosecutors say the men are part of the islamic jihad union , a group with roots in uzbekistan . german law and germany 's press codex attempt to protect the privacy of suspected and convicted criminals by only allowing publication of their first names and the first initial of their surnames .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 18.12.2007 opinion : putin is an unlikely prime minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's president putin said he would become prime minister if his choice candidate dmitry medvedev wins the presidential election .
but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he ca n't see putin taking orders as second-in-command . at first glance , everything seems quite simple : vladimir putin 's presidential candidate dmitry medvedev becomes his successor and putin then stays in power as medvedev 's prime minister . it is not unthinkable that the medvedev-putin team could be governing russia as of summer 2008 .
but if we take a closer look , some loopholes become evident in the scenario . let us first imagine the following situation ?
prime minister putin goes to the kremlin each morning to report to president medvedev and give an account of the success or even failure of national projects ? would president medvedev then praise his predecessor and fatherly friend putin or correct him when he 's made a big mistake ?
in the best case , this scenario resembles a grandiose satire . in the worst case , president medvedev would destroy the myth of putin as " national leader " . it is difficult to imagine putin working as prime minister under his protégé , at least if the current division of power between the president and the prime minister in russia remains the same .
putin should know this better than anyone . medvedev needs putin putin 's intention of becoming prime minister under medvedev should not be seen right now as the final outcome .
there are other , more pressing reasons for putin announcing this plan since he has only one goal in mind that he wants reached by march 2 : dmitry medvedev should become russia 's next president . even with the propaganda machine in full gear and all the administrative resources at work , medvedev still needs all the help he can get from putin .
this is why putin has said he wants to become prime minister under medvedev as president . just as the kremlin party united russia won the duma elections with putin as their top candidate , the bland and relatively unknown medvedev is to win the presidential election with putin as his premier .
similarly , the upcoming presidential election can be turned into a referendum on putin , even if he does n't officially run , fitting the motto " elect medvedev and keep putin . " other power struggles however , putin 's support for medvedev is n't just a sign to the population and russian voters .
the scenario of medvedev as president and putin as prime minister is also a signal to the members of the kremlin who do not fully back medvedev . it 's a widely accepted rumor that there have been and still are some forces among the kremlin elite who want putin to stay on as president .
they 're afraid of losing their power - and access to the country 's coffers - should medvedev take on the presidency . putin has sent a clear signal to medvedev 's powerful opponents , who are at least theoretically capable of fabricating and spreading compromising material about the presidential candidate .
after all , putin will stay in power if only as prime minister . at the moment , the possibility can not be excluded that putin will become russia 's prime minister under medvedev but neither is a done deal .
the real decision will not be made in the kremlin until after march 2 . until then , the next act in this political drama is medvedev 's election as president - at any cost . ingo mannteufel is the director of deutsche welle 's russian online department dw-world.de / russian . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he ca n't see putin taking orders as second-in-command . at first glance , everything seems quite simple : vladimir putin 's presidential candidate dmitry medvedev becomes his successor and putin then stays in power as medvedev 's prime minister . it is not unthinkable that the medvedev-putin team could be governing russia as of summer 2008 .
but if we take a closer look , some loopholes become evident in the scenario . let us first imagine the following situation ?
prime minister putin goes to the kremlin each morning to report to president medvedev and give an account of the success or even failure of national projects ? would president medvedev then praise his predecessor and fatherly friend putin or correct him when he 's made a big mistake ?
in the best case , this scenario resembles a grandiose satire . in the worst case , president medvedev would destroy the myth of putin as " national leader " . it is difficult to imagine putin working as prime minister under his protégé , at least if the current division of power between the president and the prime minister in russia remains the same .
putin should know this better than anyone . medvedev needs putin putin 's intention of becoming prime minister under medvedev should not be seen right now as the final outcome .
there are other , more pressing reasons for putin announcing this plan since he has only one goal in mind that he wants reached by march 2 : dmitry medvedev should become russia 's next president . even with the propaganda machine in full gear and all the administrative resources at work , medvedev still needs all the help he can get from putin .
this is why putin has said he wants to become prime minister under medvedev as president . just as the kremlin party united russia won the duma elections with putin as their top candidate , the bland and relatively unknown medvedev is to win the presidential election with putin as his premier .
similarly , the upcoming presidential election can be turned into a referendum on putin , even if he does n't officially run , fitting the motto " elect medvedev and keep putin . " other power struggles however , putin 's support for medvedev is n't just a sign to the population and russian voters .
the scenario of medvedev as president and putin as prime minister is also a signal to the members of the kremlin who do not fully back medvedev . it 's a widely accepted rumor that there have been and still are some forces among the kremlin elite who want putin to stay on as president .
they 're afraid of losing their power - and access to the country 's coffers - should medvedev take on the presidency . putin has sent a clear signal to medvedev 's powerful opponents , who are at least theoretically capable of fabricating and spreading compromising material about the presidential candidate .
after all , putin will stay in power if only as prime minister . at the moment , the possibility can not be excluded that putin will become russia 's prime minister under medvedev but neither is a done deal .
the real decision will not be made in the kremlin until after march 2 . until then , the next act in this political drama is medvedev 's election as president - at any cost . ingo mannteufel is the director of deutsche welle 's russian online department dw-world.de / russian . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a third suspect 's trial got underway in düsseldorf . lebanese national jihad h. received a sentence of 12 years imprisonment on tuesday , dec .
18 , for his involvement in the july 2006 bomb plot .
youssef d. , on trial in absentia , had been sentenced to death but the judgment was reduced to life . three other suspects on trial in the case were found not guilty and released . meanwhile the trial of youssef mohammed e.h. , an alleged co-conspirator in the case , began tuesday in the german city of düsseldorf .
defense lawyers are expected to focus on why the devices did n't explode .
the 23-year-old could face life in prison if convicted . prosecutors claim the defendant wanted to create explosions similar to the deadly train bombings in london and madrid . " a detonation would have in both cases led to a significant wave of pressure , " prosecutors said in court documents .
" lighter fluid in the ' bomb trolleys ' could have set off a fireball . " while e.h. has refused to speak to police about his involvement in the bombing attempt , h. , 22 , has said the two were seeking revenge for the publication of caricatures of the prophet mohammed in european newspapers . suspect returned to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities say the suitcase bombs would 've been deadly surveillance videos in the cologne train station showed two men placing heaving suitcases onto trains . according to the 40-page indictment , e.h. , wearing a german soccer jersey , rode the train a short distance before abandoning the suitcase bomb .
after getting off the train , he headed immediately for the airport , where he flew to turkey . yet a week later , he returned to the northern city of kiel where he was studying , according to the report .
prosecutors say that after pictures of him appeared in german newspapers , he called his father in lebanon for advice .
his father advised him to leave the country immediately . the phone was tapped , and german authorities arrested the alleged bomber as he arrived at the kiel train station . five days later , h. turned himself in to police in the northern lebanese city of tripoli . terrorist threat continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutors want to prove the men were part of a larger conspiracy the defense lawyer in düsseldorf is expected to argue that his client never meant for the suitcases to explode .
the plot was discovered when train employees opened one of the suitcases which had been turned over to lost and found . " we see the key issue as being : why did the charges not explode ? " said bernd rosenkranz , the hamburg-based defense lawyer , according to dpa news service .
" maybe they were never meant to explode . " prosecutors are expected to argue that the two men were part of a larger islamic conspiracy . authorities have warned that germany remains a target for islamic extremists . some politicians have cited the bombing attempt as a wake-up call about the terrorist threat in germany .
there have been calls for additional monitoring of terrorism suspects . in september , three men were arrested in southern germany for allegedly plotting to bomb united states and uzbek targets .
a fourth suspect was arrested in turkey .
prosecutors say the men are part of the islamic jihad union , a group with roots in uzbekistan . german law and germany 's press codex attempt to protect the privacy of suspected and convicted criminals by only allowing publication of their first names and the first initial of their surnames .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 18.12.2007 opinion : putin is an unlikely prime minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's president putin said he would become prime minister if his choice candidate dmitry medvedev wins the presidential election .
but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he ca n't see putin taking orders as second-in-command . at first glance , everything seems quite simple : vladimir putin 's presidential candidate dmitry medvedev becomes his successor and putin then stays in power as medvedev 's prime minister . it is not unthinkable that the medvedev-putin team could be governing russia as of summer 2008 .
but if we take a closer look , some loopholes become evident in the scenario . let us first imagine the following situation ?
prime minister putin goes to the kremlin each morning to report to president medvedev and give an account of the success or even failure of national projects ? would president medvedev then praise his predecessor and fatherly friend putin or correct him when he 's made a big mistake ?
in the best case , this scenario resembles a grandiose satire . in the worst case , president medvedev would destroy the myth of putin as " national leader " . it is difficult to imagine putin working as prime minister under his protégé , at least if the current division of power between the president and the prime minister in russia remains the same .
putin should know this better than anyone . medvedev needs putin putin 's intention of becoming prime minister under medvedev should not be seen right now as the final outcome .
there are other , more pressing reasons for putin announcing this plan since he has only one goal in mind that he wants reached by march 2 : dmitry medvedev should become russia 's next president . even with the propaganda machine in full gear and all the administrative resources at work , medvedev still needs all the help he can get from putin .
this is why putin has said he wants to become prime minister under medvedev as president . just as the kremlin party united russia won the duma elections with putin as their top candidate , the bland and relatively unknown medvedev is to win the presidential election with putin as his premier .
similarly , the upcoming presidential election can be turned into a referendum on putin , even if he does n't officially run , fitting the motto " elect medvedev and keep putin . " other power struggles however , putin 's support for medvedev is n't just a sign to the population and russian voters .
the scenario of medvedev as president and putin as prime minister is also a signal to the members of the kremlin who do not fully back medvedev . it 's a widely accepted rumor that there have been and still are some forces among the kremlin elite who want putin to stay on as president .
they 're afraid of losing their power - and access to the country 's coffers - should medvedev take on the presidency . putin has sent a clear signal to medvedev 's powerful opponents , who are at least theoretically capable of fabricating and spreading compromising material about the presidential candidate .
after all , putin will stay in power if only as prime minister . at the moment , the possibility can not be excluded that putin will become russia 's prime minister under medvedev but neither is a done deal .
the real decision will not be made in the kremlin until after march 2 . until then , the next act in this political drama is medvedev 's election as president - at any cost . ingo mannteufel is the director of deutsche welle 's russian online department dw-world.de / russian . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a third suspect 's trial got underway in düsseldorf . lebanese national jihad h. received a sentence of 12 years imprisonment on tuesday , dec .
18 , for his involvement in the july 2006 bomb plot .
youssef d. , on trial in absentia , had been sentenced to death but the judgment was reduced to life . three other suspects on trial in the case were found not guilty and released . meanwhile the trial of youssef mohammed e.h. , an alleged co-conspirator in the case , began tuesday in the german city of düsseldorf .
defense lawyers are expected to focus on why the devices did n't explode .
the 23-year-old could face life in prison if convicted . prosecutors claim the defendant wanted to create explosions similar to the deadly train bombings in london and madrid . " a detonation would have in both cases led to a significant wave of pressure , " prosecutors said in court documents .
" lighter fluid in the ' bomb trolleys ' could have set off a fireball . " while e.h. has refused to speak to police about his involvement in the bombing attempt , h. , 22 , has said the two were seeking revenge for the publication of caricatures of the prophet mohammed in european newspapers . suspect returned to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities say the suitcase bombs would 've been deadly surveillance videos in the cologne train station showed two men placing heaving suitcases onto trains . according to the 40-page indictment , e.h. , wearing a german soccer jersey , rode the train a short distance before abandoning the suitcase bomb .
after getting off the train , he headed immediately for the airport , where he flew to turkey . yet a week later , he returned to the northern city of kiel where he was studying , according to the report .

a third suspect 's trial got underway in düsseldorf . lebanese national jihad h. received a sentence of 12 years imprisonment on tuesday , dec .
18 , for his involvement in the july 2006 bomb plot .
youssef d. , on trial in absentia , had been sentenced to death but the judgment was reduced to life . three other suspects on trial in the case were found not guilty and released . meanwhile the trial of youssef mohammed e.h. , an alleged co-conspirator in the case , began tuesday in the german city of düsseldorf .
defense lawyers are expected to focus on why the devices did n't explode .
the 23-year-old could face life in prison if convicted . prosecutors claim the defendant wanted to create explosions similar to the deadly train bombings in london and madrid . " a detonation would have in both cases led to a significant wave of pressure , " prosecutors said in court documents .
" lighter fluid in the ' bomb trolleys ' could have set off a fireball . " while e.h. has refused to speak to police about his involvement in the bombing attempt , h. , 22 , has said the two were seeking revenge for the publication of caricatures of the prophet mohammed in european newspapers . suspect returned to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities say the suitcase bombs would 've been deadly surveillance videos in the cologne train station showed two men placing heaving suitcases onto trains . according to the 40-page indictment , e.h. , wearing a german soccer jersey , rode the train a short distance before abandoning the suitcase bomb .
after getting off the train , he headed immediately for the airport , where he flew to turkey . yet a week later , he returned to the northern city of kiel where he was studying , according to the report .
prosecutors say that after pictures of him appeared in german newspapers , he called his father in lebanon for advice .
his father advised him to leave the country immediately . the phone was tapped , and german authorities arrested the alleged bomber as he arrived at the kiel train station . five days later , h. turned himself in to police in the northern lebanese city of tripoli . terrorist threat continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutors want to prove the men were part of a larger conspiracy the defense lawyer in düsseldorf is expected to argue that his client never meant for the suitcases to explode .
the plot was discovered when train employees opened one of the suitcases which had been turned over to lost and found . " we see the key issue as being : why did the charges not explode ? " said bernd rosenkranz , the hamburg-based defense lawyer , according to dpa news service .
" maybe they were never meant to explode . " prosecutors are expected to argue that the two men were part of a larger islamic conspiracy . authorities have warned that germany remains a target for islamic extremists . some politicians have cited the bombing attempt as a wake-up call about the terrorist threat in germany .
there have been calls for additional monitoring of terrorism suspects . in september , three men were arrested in southern germany for allegedly plotting to bomb united states and uzbek targets .
a fourth suspect was arrested in turkey .
prosecutors say the men are part of the islamic jihad union , a group with roots in uzbekistan . german law and germany 's press codex attempt to protect the privacy of suspected and convicted criminals by only allowing publication of their first names and the first initial of their surnames .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 18.12.2007 opinion : putin is an unlikely prime minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's president putin said he would become prime minister if his choice candidate dmitry medvedev wins the presidential election .
but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he ca n't see putin taking orders as second-in-command . at first glance , everything seems quite simple : vladimir putin 's presidential candidate dmitry medvedev becomes his successor and putin then stays in power as medvedev 's prime minister . it is not unthinkable that the medvedev-putin team could be governing russia as of summer 2008 .
but if we take a closer look , some loopholes become evident in the scenario . let us first imagine the following situation ?
prime minister putin goes to the kremlin each morning to report to president medvedev and give an account of the success or even failure of national projects ? would president medvedev then praise his predecessor and fatherly friend putin or correct him when he 's made a big mistake ?
in the best case , this scenario resembles a grandiose satire . in the worst case , president medvedev would destroy the myth of putin as " national leader " . it is difficult to imagine putin working as prime minister under his protégé , at least if the current division of power between the president and the prime minister in russia remains the same .
putin should know this better than anyone . medvedev needs putin putin 's intention of becoming prime minister under medvedev should not be seen right now as the final outcome .
there are other , more pressing reasons for putin announcing this plan since he has only one goal in mind that he wants reached by march 2 : dmitry medvedev should become russia 's next president . even with the propaganda machine in full gear and all the administrative resources at work , medvedev still needs all the help he can get from putin .
this is why putin has said he wants to become prime minister under medvedev as president . just as the kremlin party united russia won the duma elections with putin as their top candidate , the bland and relatively unknown medvedev is to win the presidential election with putin as his premier .
similarly , the upcoming presidential election can be turned into a referendum on putin , even if he does n't officially run , fitting the motto " elect medvedev and keep putin . " other power struggles however , putin 's support for medvedev is n't just a sign to the population and russian voters .
the scenario of medvedev as president and putin as prime minister is also a signal to the members of the kremlin who do not fully back medvedev . it 's a widely accepted rumor that there have been and still are some forces among the kremlin elite who want putin to stay on as president .
they 're afraid of losing their power - and access to the country 's coffers - should medvedev take on the presidency . putin has sent a clear signal to medvedev 's powerful opponents , who are at least theoretically capable of fabricating and spreading compromising material about the presidential candidate .
after all , putin will stay in power if only as prime minister . at the moment , the possibility can not be excluded that putin will become russia 's prime minister under medvedev but neither is a done deal .
the real decision will not be made in the kremlin until after march 2 . until then , the next act in this political drama is medvedev 's election as president - at any cost . ingo mannteufel is the director of deutsche welle 's russian online department dw-world.de / russian . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 18.12.2007 opinion : putin is an unlikely prime minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's president putin said he would become prime minister if his choice candidate dmitry medvedev wins the presidential election .
but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he ca n't see putin taking orders as second-in-command . at first glance , everything seems quite simple : vladimir putin 's presidential candidate dmitry medvedev becomes his successor and putin then stays in power as medvedev 's prime minister . it is not unthinkable that the medvedev-putin team could be governing russia as of summer 2008 .
but if we take a closer look , some loopholes become evident in the scenario . let us first imagine the following situation ?
prime minister putin goes to the kremlin each morning to report to president medvedev and give an account of the success or even failure of national projects ? would president medvedev then praise his predecessor and fatherly friend putin or correct him when he 's made a big mistake ?
in the best case , this scenario resembles a grandiose satire . in the worst case , president medvedev would destroy the myth of putin as " national leader " . it is difficult to imagine putin working as prime minister under his protégé , at least if the current division of power between the president and the prime minister in russia remains the same .
putin should know this better than anyone . medvedev needs putin putin 's intention of becoming prime minister under medvedev should not be seen right now as the final outcome .
there are other , more pressing reasons for putin announcing this plan since he has only one goal in mind that he wants reached by march 2 : dmitry medvedev should become russia 's next president . even with the propaganda machine in full gear and all the administrative resources at work , medvedev still needs all the help he can get from putin .
this is why putin has said he wants to become prime minister under medvedev as president . just as the kremlin party united russia won the duma elections with putin as their top candidate , the bland and relatively unknown medvedev is to win the presidential election with putin as his premier .
similarly , the upcoming presidential election can be turned into a referendum on putin , even if he does n't officially run , fitting the motto " elect medvedev and keep putin . " other power struggles however , putin 's support for medvedev is n't just a sign to the population and russian voters .
the scenario of medvedev as president and putin as prime minister is also a signal to the members of the kremlin who do not fully back medvedev . it 's a widely accepted rumor that there have been and still are some forces among the kremlin elite who want putin to stay on as president .
they 're afraid of losing their power - and access to the country 's coffers - should medvedev take on the presidency . putin has sent a clear signal to medvedev 's powerful opponents , who are at least theoretically capable of fabricating and spreading compromising material about the presidential candidate .
after all , putin will stay in power if only as prime minister . at the moment , the possibility can not be excluded that putin will become russia 's prime minister under medvedev but neither is a done deal .
the real decision will not be made in the kremlin until after march 2 . until then , the next act in this political drama is medvedev 's election as president - at any cost . ingo mannteufel is the director of deutsche welle 's russian online department dw-world.de / russian . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 18.12.2007 opinion : putin is an unlikely prime minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's president putin said he would become prime minister if his choice candidate dmitry medvedev wins the presidential election .
but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he ca n't see putin taking orders as second-in-command . at first glance , everything seems quite simple : vladimir putin 's presidential candidate dmitry medvedev becomes his successor and putin then stays in power as medvedev 's prime minister . it is not unthinkable that the medvedev-putin team could be governing russia as of summer 2008 .
but if we take a closer look , some loopholes become evident in the scenario . let us first imagine the following situation ?
prime minister putin goes to the kremlin each morning to report to president medvedev and give an account of the success or even failure of national projects ? would president medvedev then praise his predecessor and fatherly friend putin or correct him when he 's made a big mistake ?
in the best case , this scenario resembles a grandiose satire . in the worst case , president medvedev would destroy the myth of putin as " national leader " . it is difficult to imagine putin working as prime minister under his protégé , at least if the current division of power between the president and the prime minister in russia remains the same .
putin should know this better than anyone . medvedev needs putin putin 's intention of becoming prime minister under medvedev should not be seen right now as the final outcome .
there are other , more pressing reasons for putin announcing this plan since he has only one goal in mind that he wants reached by march 2 : dmitry medvedev should become russia 's next president . even with the propaganda machine in full gear and all the administrative resources at work , medvedev still needs all the help he can get from putin .
this is why putin has said he wants to become prime minister under medvedev as president . just as the kremlin party united russia won the duma elections with putin as their top candidate , the bland and relatively unknown medvedev is to win the presidential election with putin as his premier .
similarly , the upcoming presidential election can be turned into a referendum on putin , even if he does n't officially run , fitting the motto " elect medvedev and keep putin . " other power struggles however , putin 's support for medvedev is n't just a sign to the population and russian voters .
the scenario of medvedev as president and putin as prime minister is also a signal to the members of the kremlin who do not fully back medvedev . it 's a widely accepted rumor that there have been and still are some forces among the kremlin elite who want putin to stay on as president .
they 're afraid of losing their power - and access to the country 's coffers - should medvedev take on the presidency . putin has sent a clear signal to medvedev 's powerful opponents , who are at least theoretically capable of fabricating and spreading compromising material about the presidential candidate .
after all , putin will stay in power if only as prime minister . at the moment , the possibility can not be excluded that putin will become russia 's prime minister under medvedev but neither is a done deal .
the real decision will not be made in the kremlin until after march 2 . until then , the next act in this political drama is medvedev 's election as president - at any cost . ingo mannteufel is the director of deutsche welle 's russian online department dw-world.de / russian . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he ca n't see putin taking orders as second-in-command . at first glance , everything seems quite simple : vladimir putin 's presidential candidate dmitry medvedev becomes his successor and putin then stays in power as medvedev 's prime minister . it is not unthinkable that the medvedev-putin team could be governing russia as of summer 2008 .
but if we take a closer look , some loopholes become evident in the scenario . let us first imagine the following situation ?
prime minister putin goes to the kremlin each morning to report to president medvedev and give an account of the success or even failure of national projects ? would president medvedev then praise his predecessor and fatherly friend putin or correct him when he 's made a big mistake ?
in the best case , this scenario resembles a grandiose satire . in the worst case , president medvedev would destroy the myth of putin as " national leader " . it is difficult to imagine putin working as prime minister under his protégé , at least if the current division of power between the president and the prime minister in russia remains the same .
putin should know this better than anyone . medvedev needs putin putin 's intention of becoming prime minister under medvedev should not be seen right now as the final outcome .
there are other , more pressing reasons for putin announcing this plan since he has only one goal in mind that he wants reached by march 2 : dmitry medvedev should become russia 's next president . even with the propaganda machine in full gear and all the administrative resources at work , medvedev still needs all the help he can get from putin .
this is why putin has said he wants to become prime minister under medvedev as president . just as the kremlin party united russia won the duma elections with putin as their top candidate , the bland and relatively unknown medvedev is to win the presidential election with putin as his premier .
similarly , the upcoming presidential election can be turned into a referendum on putin , even if he does n't officially run , fitting the motto " elect medvedev and keep putin . " other power struggles however , putin 's support for medvedev is n't just a sign to the population and russian voters .
the scenario of medvedev as president and putin as prime minister is also a signal to the members of the kremlin who do not fully back medvedev . it 's a widely accepted rumor that there have been and still are some forces among the kremlin elite who want putin to stay on as president .
they 're afraid of losing their power - and access to the country 's coffers - should medvedev take on the presidency . putin has sent a clear signal to medvedev 's powerful opponents , who are at least theoretically capable of fabricating and spreading compromising material about the presidential candidate .
after all , putin will stay in power if only as prime minister . at the moment , the possibility can not be excluded that putin will become russia 's prime minister under medvedev but neither is a done deal .
the real decision will not be made in the kremlin until after march 2 . until then , the next act in this political drama is medvedev 's election as president - at any cost . ingo mannteufel is the director of deutsche welle 's russian online department dw-world.de / russian . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's ingo mannteufel says he ca n't see putin taking orders as second-in-command . at first glance , everything seems quite simple : vladimir putin 's presidential candidate dmitry medvedev becomes his successor and putin then stays in power as medvedev 's prime minister . it is not unthinkable that the medvedev-putin team could be governing russia as of summer 2008 .
but if we take a closer look , some loopholes become evident in the scenario . let us first imagine the following situation ?
prime minister putin goes to the kremlin each morning to report to president medvedev and give an account of the success or even failure of national projects ? would president medvedev then praise his predecessor and fatherly friend putin or correct him when he 's made a big mistake ?
in the best case , this scenario resembles a grandiose satire . in the worst case , president medvedev would destroy the myth of putin as " national leader " . it is difficult to imagine putin working as prime minister under his protégé , at least if the current division of power between the president and the prime minister in russia remains the same .
putin should know this better than anyone . medvedev needs putin putin 's intention of becoming prime minister under medvedev should not be seen right now as the final outcome .
there are other , more pressing reasons for putin announcing this plan since he has only one goal in mind that he wants reached by march 2 : dmitry medvedev should become russia 's next president . even with the propaganda machine in full gear and all the administrative resources at work , medvedev still needs all the help he can get from putin .
this is why putin has said he wants to become prime minister under medvedev as president . just as the kremlin party united russia won the duma elections with putin as their top candidate , the bland and relatively unknown medvedev is to win the presidential election with putin as his premier .
similarly , the upcoming presidential election can be turned into a referendum on putin , even if he does n't officially run , fitting the motto " elect medvedev and keep putin . " other power struggles however , putin 's support for medvedev is n't just a sign to the population and russian voters .
the scenario of medvedev as president and putin as prime minister is also a signal to the members of the kremlin who do not fully back medvedev . it 's a widely accepted rumor that there have been and still are some forces among the kremlin elite who want putin to stay on as president .
they 're afraid of losing their power - and access to the country 's coffers - should medvedev take on the presidency . putin has sent a clear signal to medvedev 's powerful opponents , who are at least theoretically capable of fabricating and spreading compromising material about the presidential candidate .
after all , putin will stay in power if only as prime minister . at the moment , the possibility can not be excluded that putin will become russia 's prime minister under medvedev but neither is a done deal .
the real decision will not be made in the kremlin until after march 2 . until then , the next act in this political drama is medvedev 's election as president - at any cost . ingo mannteufel is the director of deutsche welle 's russian online department dw-world.de / russian . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the advice aims to open up how sites are identified and engage traveller communities with the planning system .
environment minister jane davidson said she believed the guidance would go a long way to resolving the difficulties .
a travellers ' charity spokesman said they were " stereotyped as undesirable " and used as " whipping boys to kick the politicians " .
the new planning rules guidance follows councils in england being told in november last year to find more sites for travellers , amid continuing rows concerning a string of unauthorised encampments .
the guidance is that local authorities in wales should identify potential sites in advance , and can then consult local people before approving them . "
it 's almost axiomatic that if someone applies for a gypsy or travellers ' site , there 's a large public opposition " steve staines , friend , families and travellers , along with this , the assembly government wants to see gypsy and traveller communities settle only on designated sites , and so reduce any potential friction with local communities .
a report by the commission for racial equality last year said more legal sites were the only way of reducing racial tension and cutting the substantial bill for evictions .
' human pass-the-parcel ' environment minister jane davidson said public consultations on sites recommended by councils would include face-to-face consultation with gypsies and travellers .
she said : " we want to ensure that the gypsy-traveller community play their part in engaging with the planning system too .
" local residents will also be able to have their say through the local development plan process . "
in march this year , a senior north wales police officer called for more new travellers sites .
assistant chief constable ian shannon said he was left depressed at the ongoing game of " human pass-the-parcel " with traveller groups .
he said travellers faced widespread discrimination and officers could be left as " piggy in the middle " between travellers and locals .
' fundamentally racist ' steve staines , planning officer with friend , families and travellers , a charity which runs an advice line for gypsy and traveller groups , estimated wales had 130 traveller families with no official plot on which to stay .
he said : " we feel that it 's as fundamentally racist issue .
" gypsies and travellers are stereotyped as undesirable people and they 've been used in the past , locally and nationally , as a whipping boy with which to kick the politicians .
" one thing we do worry about is public opposition .
it 's almost axiomatic that if someone applies for a gypsy or travellers ' site , there 's a large public opposition . "
mr staines said evidence showed established sites caused few problems and the travelling community was no less likely to stick to the planning process than anybody else .
he added that his organisation had " plenty of examples of local authorities not meeting their duties " towards travellers .

the advice aims to open up how sites are identified and engage traveller communities with the planning system .
environment minister jane davidson said she believed the guidance would go a long way to resolving the difficulties .
a travellers ' charity spokesman said they were " stereotyped as undesirable " and used as " whipping boys to kick the politicians " .
the new planning rules guidance follows councils in england being told in november last year to find more sites for travellers , amid continuing rows concerning a string of unauthorised encampments .
the guidance is that local authorities in wales should identify potential sites in advance , and can then consult local people before approving them .
it 's almost axiomatic that if someone applies for a gypsy or travellers ' site , there 's a large public opposition steve staines , friend , families and travellers , along with this , the assembly government wants to see gypsy and traveller communities settle only on designated sites , and so reduce any potential friction with local communities .
a report by the commission for racial equality last year said more legal sites were the only way of reducing racial tension and cutting the substantial bill for evictions .
' human pass-the-parcel ' environment minister jane davidson said public consultations on sites recommended by councils would include face-to-face consultation with gypsies and travellers .
she said : " we want to ensure that the gypsy-traveller community play their part in engaging with the planning system too .
" local residents will also be able to have their say through the local development plan process . "
in march this year , a senior north wales police officer called for more new travellers sites .
assistant chief constable ian shannon said he was left depressed at the ongoing game of " human pass-the-parcel " with traveller groups .
he said travellers faced widespread discrimination and officers could be left as " piggy in the middle " between travellers and locals .
' fundamentally racist ' steve staines , planning officer with friend , families and travellers , a charity which runs an advice line for gypsy and traveller groups , estimated wales had 130 traveller families with no official plot on which to stay .
he said : " we feel that it 's as fundamentally racist issue .
" gypsies and travellers are stereotyped as undesirable people and they 've been used in the past , locally and nationally , as a whipping boy with which to kick the politicians .
" one thing we do worry about is public opposition .
it 's almost axiomatic that if someone applies for a gypsy or travellers ' site , there 's a large public opposition . "
mr staines said evidence showed established sites caused few problems and the travelling community was no less likely to stick to the planning process than anybody else .
he added that his organisation had " plenty of examples of local authorities not meeting their duties " towards travellers .

there are no official figures , but hospital records show that nearly 500 adolescents a week are treated for deliberately injuring themselves .
emma parsons , producer of born survivors : cut up kids , reveals why one woman resorted to self-harm .
tor is a country girl who grew up surrounded by ponies and public school life .
she had a normal childhood , with a normal family .
born survivors tuesday 18 december 10.30pm , bbc three but mounting pressure to achieve the entry grades for an exclusive sixth form college caused her to crack , and self-harm became a large part of her life .
" you just take a knife , " says tor .
" you just press it down on your skin and you just pull it .
you end up bleeding .
" when you drag the blade across your skin it just feels a release .
" it 's like when you hold your breath , hold your breath .
you just feel you are going to blow up .
self-harm is like when you breathe again . "
" i 'd never known or heard of anyone self-harming so it did n't occur to me that that 's what it was " her problems began whilst preparing for her gcses at the age of 15 .
she felt a large amount of pressure to do well in her exams and her parents sent her to a crammer college in oxford .
she and her school had high expectations that she would get excellent grades .
secretly ' coping ' as a way of coping with the pressure , she and her friend carved hearts into their arms with a pair of compasses .
" i think this is when it occurred to me that this could be a way of helping myself and letting the pain inside disappear , " she explains .
" it was a kind of release " .
" i 'd never known or heard of anyone self-harming so it did n't occur to me that that 's what it was . "
she would hurt herself at most once or twice a week in private in the school toilets .
she moved on from using compasses to pencil sharpener blades and scalpels taken from the art room .
she only cut on the tops of her arms to ensure that no one would see .
for tor , self-harm was private .
" it 's not fashion , it 's not attention seeking , it 's not about being cool or hard .
" it 's very secret , it 's a secret thing .
by sixth form the school and tor 's parents had started to guess something was wrong .
tor was no longer achieving academically .
she was often angry and would punch the school walls as a way of hurting her self .
" because they are all bumpy , if you punched them hard enough you end up cutting your knuckles , " she said .
the self-harm was still a secret , even as her family tried to help her .
she saw a doctor and was diagnosed with depression .
by the age of 20 , tor had dropped out of agricultural college and was homeless .
she found herself in southampton and after living in a few homeless shelters was given a bedsit in a southampton housing project run by the ymca .
it was here that her self-harm reached its peak .
she was self-harming on a daily basis .
she bought a set of kitchen knives and would also use cigarettes and lighters to burn herself .
in a single year , she was treated in hospital on over 30 occasions .
life changing she first began to turn her life round when she was given support by a community psychiatric nurse who taught her different coping strategies .
she also joined safe house , a drop-in centre for vulnerable young people in southampton .
" since being in southampton i 've not had to hide what i 'm feeling ; i can just be myself .
" when you 've had to hide everything , you kind of do n't learn everything and grow up as you should .
" you kind of have to re-start that over again .
it 's kind of what it felt like coming down to southampton - just restarting being a teenager and going through it all again . "
after nine years of self-harming and now aged 24 , tor has found a career she loves and hopes she can move forward with her life .
she was offered the chance to learn to sail and the experience had a dramatic effect on her .
she now hopes to pursue sailing professionally .
" i think sailing has really helped .
just thinking about it or doing it has been a great distraction technique for me and has taken my mind off self-harming all together . "
" it 's been tough but it 's been worth it ' cause now i 've found something i really want to do .
" if it was n't for sailing i might be back where i was . "
tor 's story features in the bbc three documentary born survivors : cut up kids which will be broadcast at 10.30pm on tuesday , 18 december .

by sixth form the school and tor 's parents had started to guess something was wrong .
tor was no longer achieving academically .
she was often angry and would punch the school walls as a way of hurting her self .
" because they are all bumpy , if you punched them hard enough you end up cutting your knuckles , " she said .
the self-harm was still a secret , even as her family tried to help her .
she saw a doctor and was diagnosed with depression .
by the age of 20 , tor had dropped out of agricultural college and was homeless .
she found herself in southampton and after living in a few homeless shelters was given a bedsit in a southampton housing project run by the ymca .
it was here that her self-harm reached its peak .
she was self-harming on a daily basis .
she bought a set of kitchen knives and would also use cigarettes and lighters to burn herself .
in a single year , she was treated in hospital on over 30 occasions .
life changing she first began to turn her life round when she was given support by a community psychiatric nurse who taught her different coping strategies .
she also joined safe house , a drop-in centre for vulnerable young people in southampton .
" since being in southampton i 've not had to hide what i 'm feeling ; i can just be myself .
" when you 've had to hide everything , you kind of do n't learn everything and grow up as you should .
" you kind of have to re-start that over again .
it 's kind of what it felt like coming down to southampton - just restarting being a teenager and going through it all again . "
after nine years of self-harming and now aged 24 , tor has found a career she loves and hopes she can move forward with her life .
she was offered the chance to learn to sail and the experience had a dramatic effect on her .
she now hopes to pursue sailing professionally .
" i think sailing has really helped .
just thinking about it or doing it has been a great distraction technique for me and has taken my mind off self-harming all together . "
" it 's been tough but it 's been worth it ' cause now i 've found something i really want to do .
" if it was n't for sailing i might be back where i was . "
tor 's story features in the bbc three documentary born survivors : cut up kids which will be broadcast at 10.30pm on tuesday , 18 december .

the regulator has questioned whether firms have the incentive to make premium content available to other retailers and platforms .
ofcom launched an investigation into the pay tv industry in march , following a submission from a group including virgin media .

premium content the regulator said it welcomed views on whether firms have the incentive to make premium content , such as sports and movies , available to other retailers and platform operators .
it also expressed concern about the practice of making customers buy a basic tv package before they are allowed to access to premium content .
earlier this year , virgin media lost access to several sky tv channels after a bruising battle during which the two failed to agree a new contract .
the national consumer council said the dispute was bad for customers .
ofcom 's investigation includes subscription and on-demand services across cable , digital terrestrial television -lrb- dtt -rrb- , satellite and the internet .
bskyb is the biggest provider of pay tv services through its satellite platform .
the 3.3 million subscribers who receive cable television from virgin media have been unable to watch some sky channels , such as sky one , since the beginning of march following the spat between the two broadcasters .

anglesey council 's executive has voted to shut ysgol llanddeusant and ysgol aberffraw in august 2009 .
however , a decision on the future of ysgol y parc and ysgol kingsland in holyhead was deferred for a year .
the council said surplus places on the island cost it £ 425,000 in 2006 , a figure set to rise to £ 625,000 by 2010 .
ysgol aberffraw has just 17 pupils , while there are 23 pupils at ysgol llanddeusant .
anglesey leader councillor gareth winston roberts said the closure decision had been " an extremely difficult " one , adding " but we have reached a point where difficult decisions have to be taken " .
" the status quo can not remain and we have had to go down the same road as numerous other authorities in wales , " mr roberts said .
their decision comes just days after gwynedd councillors agreed to move ahead with plans to close 29 schools .
mr roberts said : " the problem of surplus school places must be tackled or we will be wasting hundreds of thousands of pounds that could be better used to improve school funding .
" we believe that this was the correct decision in order to meet the future education needs of all anglesey pupils . "
the closure decisions follow a review of 22 primary schools in the bodedern and holyhead catchments areas .
schools in other areas of the island will undergo similar reviews in 2008 .
' ignoring the problem ' education portfolio holder councillor john meirion davies said : " we 've listed to the views put forward in regard to holyhead , and recognised that it 's a growth areas in terms of the economy and projected housing . "
bur mr davies warned the deferral of the decision on the holyhead schools did not mean they would be " ignoring the problem " of surplus places there .
he said this could eventually lead to closures .
council officers have been requested to hold further talks with all holyhead 's schools .
the authority will also be asking for funding from the assembly government to establish a " new system fit for purpose " , which could include a new purpose-built school .

a study by the scottish health action on alcohol problems group -lrb- shaap -rrb- calls on the scottish government to introduce minimum prices for alcoholic drinks .
it said a 10 % rise in drink prices would save an estimated 479 scottish men and 265 women every year .
the scottish government said it shared shaap 's concerns and was working to ban irresponsible drink promotions .
a government spokesperson added : " it 's simply wrong that in a country often deluged by rain , strong cider can be cheaper than water .
" there is no doubt that the availability and low cost of alcohol is fuelling the culture of " drinking to get drunk " and the mindless violence and anti-social behaviour it causes . "
read the report report into alcohol prices -lsb- 29kb -rsb- most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need adobe reader download the reader here the report , published on tuesday , said tax should be linked to alcohol strength and further limits should be put on drinks promotions .
the findings were based on international research and concluded that legislative price control was one of the most effective ways of reducing alcohol-related harm .
dr bruce ritson , chairman of shaap , said the evidence showed a clear link between alcohol price and harm .
he added : " we believe that setting minimum prices could save the lives of almost 750 scots every year .
" no single policy initiative will solve all the alcohol problems in our society , but price is a significant factor in rising consumption levels and associated harm .
' too high ' " but more importantly , it is an area in which government action could make a real difference in reducing alcohol harm in scotland which is costing us over £ 1bn every year . "
the report - alcohol : price , policy and public health - presents the findings of an expert workshop which looked at the options available to government to reduce alcohol-related harm .
dr ritson said : " the purpose of alcohol policy is to reduce levels of harm which are widely recognised as being much too high .
" the government has rightly identified alcohol as scotland 's leading public health priority .
" we urge the scottish government to implement the action outlined in the report today . "
as well as setting prices , the campaign group , established by medical royal colleges in scotland , want ministers to ask westminster for an increase in duty and for taxes to be linked to inflation and alcohol strength .
deep discounting they have also called for an end to " irresponsible " drinks promotions and consideration of the need for an independent , regulatory body .
professor ian gilmore , president of the royal college of physicians and convener of the uk alcohol health alliance , backed the recommendations .
he said : " we strongly support the public policy measures on alcohol that shaap is raising with the scottish government . "
in response to the report , the government said as well as working to ban irresponsible promotions it also wanted to look very carefully at what action could be taken to tackle pricing issues such as " deep discounting " .
it added that it recently brought forward regulations under the licensing -lrb- scotland -rrb- act 2005 which would require premises to display alcohol in separate areas to ensure it was not seen as an everyday commodity such as bread or milk .

it added that it recently brought forward regulations under the licensing -lrb- scotland -rrb- act 2005 which would require premises to display alcohol in separate areas to ensure it was not seen as an everyday commodity such as bread or milk .

by lucy rodgers bbc news personal rapid transport vehicles travel at 25mph there are no drivers , no rails , no timetables and no emissions .
but , most importantly for passengers , there are no queues .
welcome to the uk 's first personal rapid transport system -lrb- prt -rrb- .
but while these low-energy , driverless pod-shaped vehicles may look like something from sci-fi epic bladerunner , they are about to become british transport reality .
in less than two years ' time , after the opening of heathrow 's terminal 5 in march 2008 , a network of 18 of these four-seater capsules will be ferrying passengers to and from a business car park to the new terminal building .
already under construction , the first phase of the airport 's £ 25m prt will use 3.8km -lrb- 2.4 miles -rrb- of guideway - designated ground-level or raised path - to move people from car to check-in in just four minutes .
no wait but the greatest selling point of the system for users is not its speed - set to a maximum 25mph -lrb- 40kph -rrb- - but , instead , its promised convenience .
it appears to solve the often-encountered problems of mass public transit , including fixed timetabling - leading to long waiting times and queues , restricted routes and shared travel space .
see proposed route of heathrow personal rapid transport system enlarge map with prt , vehicles turn up on demand , can be programmed to go to any destination and accommodate just one group of travellers who already know each another .
according to advanced transport systems -lrb- ats -rrb- , the bristol-based company behind the heathrow system , passengers will only have to wait a maximum of 12 seconds .
and , because the vehicles have their own designated paths , there will be no congestion and no traffic lights - in principle , a non-stop journey from a to b. to those with more green concerns , the system also has the advantage of generating zero local emissions and being 70 % more energy efficient than cars and 50 % more than traditional buses .
" it offers a completely new form of public transport - one that will deliver a fast , efficient service to passengers and bring considerable environmental benefits , saving more than half of the fuel used by existing forms of public or private transport , " says mark bullock , managing director of heathrow airport .
so , how does the system work ?
the cars , powered by a battery pack , follow dedicated 1.5m-wide guideways using laser sensors embedded in the vehicles .
passengers board at designated points - not unlike bus stops or taxi ranks - where vehicles are waiting or can be called within seconds .
expansion once on board , travellers use a touch screen to select a destination .
a central control system responds by allocating the vehicle the required path and passengers are taken non-stop via the best-available route .
this , ats says , is " a new approach to travel .
this is transport for a sustainable future . "
if the first-ever public test of the technology at terminal 5 goes well , heathrow plans to expand its use across the airport .
the cars can be caught at designated points but it does n't stop there .
there are already indications that the capsules will be embraced elsewhere in britain and the world .
in the northamptonshire town of daventry , councillors are considering proposals for a prt system of up to 100 vehicles to help transport its growing population , which is expected to increase from 23,000 to 40,000 by 2021 .
and a number of other countries , including some gulf states , are also looking at similar systems .
however , although prt seems to be an ideal transport solution , critics claim it has limited applications , especially in big cities due to the required network of guideways .
some also say its efficiency has yet to be tested .
city dynamics but , those behind the heathrow project acknowledge prt , a concept which has been around since at least the 1950s , has its limits .
they say it will not compete with mass transit systems in large cities , such as the london underground , but will instead complement them .
richard teychenne , of ats , says it will work particularly well in the suburbs , linking areas together - such as transporting people between residential areas , or from rail stations and out of town car parks directly to shops and offices .
" it could really change the dynamic of a city , " he says .
another advantage of the capsules , he claims , is safety .
cctv can be in operation in every vehicle and passengers no longer have to share public transport with other unknown people .
this could offer obvious advantages to women as well as children travelling to school , he says .
when all its features are digested , prt may sound like public transport too good to be true , and it remains to be seen whether it can deliver on its promises .
mr teychenne admits the rollout does depend in how things at terminal 5 go , and all international eyes will be on the west london airport in 2009 .
" heathrow is setting a marker for the world , " he adds .

by lucy rodgers bbc news personal rapid transport vehicles travel at 25mph there are no drivers , no rails , no timetables and no emissions .
but , most importantly for passengers , there are no queues .
welcome to the uk 's first personal rapid transport system -lrb- prt -rrb- .
but while these low-energy , driverless pod-shaped vehicles may look like something from sci-fi epic bladerunner , they are about to become british transport reality .
in less than two years ' time , after the opening of heathrow 's terminal 5 in march 2008 , a network of 18 of these four-seater capsules will be ferrying passengers to and from a business car park to the new terminal building .
already under construction , the first phase of the airport 's £ 25m prt will use 3.8km -lrb- 2.4 miles -rrb- of guideway - designated ground-level or raised path - to move people from car to check-in in just four minutes .
no wait but the greatest selling point of the system for users is not its speed - set to a maximum 25mph -lrb- 40kph -rrb- - but , instead , its promised convenience .
it appears to solve the often-encountered problems of mass public transit , including fixed timetabling - leading to long waiting times and queues , restricted routes and shared travel space .
see proposed route of heathrow personal rapid transport system enlarge map with prt , vehicles turn up on demand , can be programmed to go to any destination and accommodate just one group of travellers who already know each another .
according to advanced transport systems -lrb- ats -rrb- , the bristol-based company behind the heathrow system , passengers will only have to wait a maximum of 12 seconds .
and , because the vehicles have their own designated paths , there will be no congestion and no traffic lights - in principle , a non-stop journey from a to b. to those with more green concerns , the system also has the advantage of generating zero local emissions and being 70 % more energy efficient than cars and 50 % more than traditional buses .
" it offers a completely new form of public transport - one that will deliver a fast , efficient service to passengers and bring considerable environmental benefits , saving more than half of the fuel used by existing forms of public or private transport , " says mark bullock , managing director of heathrow airport .
so , how does the system work ?
the cars , powered by a battery pack , follow dedicated 1.5m-wide guideways using laser sensors embedded in the vehicles .
passengers board at designated points - not unlike bus stops or taxi ranks - where vehicles are waiting or can be called within seconds .
expansion once on board , travellers use a touch screen to select a destination .
a central control system responds by allocating the vehicle the required path and passengers are taken non-stop via the best-available route .
this , ats says , is " a new approach to travel .
this is transport for a sustainable future . "
if the first-ever public test of the technology at terminal 5 goes well , heathrow plans to expand its use across the airport .
the cars can be caught at designated points but it does n't stop there .
there are already indications that the capsules will be embraced elsewhere in britain and the world .
in the northamptonshire town of daventry , councillors are considering proposals for a prt system of up to 100 vehicles to help transport its growing population , which is expected to increase from 23,000 to 40,000 by 2021 .
and a number of other countries , including some gulf states , are also looking at similar systems .
however , although prt seems to be an ideal transport solution , critics claim it has limited applications , especially in big cities due to the required network of guideways .
some also say its efficiency has yet to be tested .
city dynamics but , those behind the heathrow project acknowledge prt , a concept which has been around since at least the 1950s , has its limits .
they say it will not compete with mass transit systems in large cities , such as the london underground , but will instead complement them .
richard teychenne , of ats , says it will work particularly well in the suburbs , linking areas together - such as transporting people between residential areas , or from rail stations and out of town car parks directly to shops and offices .
" it could really change the dynamic of a city , " he says .
another advantage of the capsules , he claims , is safety .
cctv can be in operation in every vehicle and passengers no longer have to share public transport with other unknown people .
this could offer obvious advantages to women as well as children travelling to school , he says .
when all its features are digested , prt may sound like public transport too good to be true , and it remains to be seen whether it can deliver on its promises .
mr teychenne admits the rollout does depend in how things at terminal 5 go , and all international eyes will be on the west london airport in 2009 .

by lucy rodgers bbc news personal rapid transport vehicles travel at 25mph there are no drivers , no rails , no timetables and no emissions .
but , most importantly for passengers , there are no queues .
welcome to the uk 's first personal rapid transport system -lrb- prt -rrb- .
but while these low-energy , driverless pod-shaped vehicles may look like something from sci-fi epic bladerunner , they are about to become british transport reality .
in less than two years ' time , after the opening of heathrow 's terminal 5 in march 2008 , a network of 18 of these four-seater capsules will be ferrying passengers to and from a business car park to the new terminal building .
already under construction , the first phase of the airport 's £ 25m prt will use 3.8km -lrb- 2.4 miles -rrb- of guideway - designated ground-level or raised path - to move people from car to check-in in just four minutes .
no wait but the greatest selling point of the system for users is not its speed - set to a maximum 25mph -lrb- 40kph -rrb- - but , instead , its promised convenience .
it appears to solve the often-encountered problems of mass public transit , including fixed timetabling - leading to long waiting times and queues , restricted routes and shared travel space .
see proposed route of heathrow personal rapid transport system enlarge map with prt , vehicles turn up on demand , can be programmed to go to any destination and accommodate just one group of travellers who already know each another .
according to advanced transport systems -lrb- ats -rrb- , the bristol-based company behind the heathrow system , passengers will only have to wait a maximum of 12 seconds .
and , because the vehicles have their own designated paths , there will be no congestion and no traffic lights - in principle , a non-stop journey from a to b. to those with more green concerns , the system also has the advantage of generating zero local emissions and being 70 % more energy efficient than cars and 50 % more than traditional buses .
" it offers a completely new form of public transport - one that will deliver a fast , efficient service to passengers and bring considerable environmental benefits , saving more than half of the fuel used by existing forms of public or private transport , " says mark bullock , managing director of heathrow airport .
so , how does the system work ?
the cars , powered by a battery pack , follow dedicated 1.5m-wide guideways using laser sensors embedded in the vehicles .
passengers board at designated points - not unlike bus stops or taxi ranks - where vehicles are waiting or can be called within seconds .
expansion once on board , travellers use a touch screen to select a destination .
a central control system responds by allocating the vehicle the required path and passengers are taken non-stop via the best-available route .
this , ats says , is " a new approach to travel .
this is transport for a sustainable future . "
if the first-ever public test of the technology at terminal 5 goes well , heathrow plans to expand its use across the airport .
the cars can be caught at designated points but it does n't stop there .

by lucy rodgers bbc news personal rapid transport vehicles travel at 25mph there are no drivers , no rails , no timetables and no emissions .
but , most importantly for passengers , there are no queues .
welcome to the uk 's first personal rapid transport system -lrb- prt -rrb- .
but while these low-energy , driverless pod-shaped vehicles may look like something from sci-fi epic bladerunner , they are about to become british transport reality .
in less than two years ' time , after the opening of heathrow 's terminal 5 in march 2008 , a network of 18 of these four-seater capsules will be ferrying passengers to and from a business car park to the new terminal building .
already under construction , the first phase of the airport 's £ 25m prt will use 3.8km -lrb- 2.4 miles -rrb- of guideway - designated ground-level or raised path - to move people from car to check-in in just four minutes .
no wait but the greatest selling point of the system for users is not its speed - set to a maximum 25mph -lrb- 40kph -rrb- - but , instead , its promised convenience .
it appears to solve the often-encountered problems of mass public transit , including fixed timetabling - leading to long waiting times and queues , restricted routes and shared travel space .
see proposed route of heathrow personal rapid transport system enlarge map with prt , vehicles turn up on demand , can be programmed to go to any destination and accommodate just one group of travellers who already know each another .
according to advanced transport systems -lrb- ats -rrb- , the bristol-based company behind the heathrow system , passengers will only have to wait a maximum of 12 seconds .
and , because the vehicles have their own designated paths , there will be no congestion and no traffic lights - in principle , a non-stop journey from a to b. to those with more green concerns , the system also has the advantage of generating zero local emissions and being 70 % more energy efficient than cars and 50 % more than traditional buses .
" it offers a completely new form of public transport - one that will deliver a fast , efficient service to passengers and bring considerable environmental benefits , saving more than half of the fuel used by existing forms of public or private transport , " says mark bullock , managing director of heathrow airport .
so , how does the system work ?
the cars , powered by a battery pack , follow dedicated 1.5m-wide guideways using laser sensors embedded in the vehicles .
passengers board at designated points - not unlike bus stops or taxi ranks - where vehicles are waiting or can be called within seconds .
expansion once on board , travellers use a touch screen to select a destination .
a central control system responds by allocating the vehicle the required path and passengers are taken non-stop via the best-available route .
this , ats says , is " a new approach to travel .
this is transport for a sustainable future . "
if the first-ever public test of the technology at terminal 5 goes well , heathrow plans to expand its use across the airport .
the cars can be caught at designated points but it does n't stop there .
there are already indications that the capsules will be embraced elsewhere in britain and the world .
in the northamptonshire town of daventry , councillors are considering proposals for a prt system of up to 100 vehicles to help transport its growing population , which is expected to increase from 23,000 to 40,000 by 2021 .
and a number of other countries , including some gulf states , are also looking at similar systems .
however , although prt seems to be an ideal transport solution , critics claim it has limited applications , especially in big cities due to the required network of guideways .
some also say its efficiency has yet to be tested .
city dynamics but , those behind the heathrow project acknowledge prt , a concept which has been around since at least the 1950s , has its limits .
they say it will not compete with mass transit systems in large cities , such as the london underground , but will instead complement them .
richard teychenne , of ats , says it will work particularly well in the suburbs , linking areas together - such as transporting people between residential areas , or from rail stations and out of town car parks directly to shops and offices .
" it could really change the dynamic of a city , " he says .
another advantage of the capsules , he claims , is safety .
cctv can be in operation in every vehicle and passengers no longer have to share public transport with other unknown people .
this could offer obvious advantages to women as well as children travelling to school , he says .
when all its features are digested , prt may sound like public transport too good to be true , and it remains to be seen whether it can deliver on its promises .
mr teychenne admits the rollout does depend in how things at terminal 5 go , and all international eyes will be on the west london airport in 2009 .
" heathrow is setting a marker for the world , " he adds .

since then , though , she has largely worked on low-budget independent films and television productions like the bbc 's tsunami , the aftermath .
this week sees her back on our screens as nancy , the london thief who dreams of a better life , in the bbc 's new adaptation of oliver twist .
had you read charles dickens ' novel before landing the role ?
no , but i read it when i knew i got the part .
it 's impossible not to be familiar with it though , and i 'd certainly seen the musical and roman polanski 's film version .
i actually read half of it , then listened to the rest on a tape .
i ca n't remember the name of the actor who read it but it was fantastic - i listened to it with my daughter , aoife .
how did you approach the character of nancy ?
her co-stars in oliver twist include timothy spall and tom hardy she 's had an incredibly tough life , growing up in extreme poverty in a world where life is cheap .
yet she 's somehow managed to retain a great sense of humanity , warmth and heart .
she 's also completely and utterly in love with bill sikes , played by tom hardy ; it 's quite a dysfunctional relationship but it works .
he looks after her and she looks after him ; he slaps her around a bit but that was all part of the times .
how did you find working with oliver himself , 11-year-old william miller ?
i 've worked with children in almost everything i 've done and it 's always been an enriching experience .
william is such a mature young lad ; he makes my job very easy .
he 's a complete natural and a lovely young boy with his head very much on his shoulders .
kids say their lines so simply and truthfully - i love working with them .
hotel rwanda saw you nominated for an oscar alongside co-star don cheadle .
what are your memories of that experience ?
she played don cheadle 's wife in genocide drama hotel rwanda it was interesting ; it is a circus though , so you had to keep quite centred .
i was incredibly grateful to be honoured in that way , but the real meaning for me comes in the work i do .
my mum greatly enjoyed it , as did my stepdad and my daughter .
but i would n't be interested in that being my entire life !
were you inundated with hollywood scripts afterwards ?
i certainly had lots of offers but nothing very interesting - i tend to look for scripts that have a bit of meaning to them .
and i never had any intention of moving out of england ; my life is here .
how does working on big us films compare to smaller-budget ones in the uk ?
i have n't really experienced much big-budget film-making ; everything i do tends to be extremely low-budget , on both sides of the atlantic .
it tends to have an urgency that i love ; it 's very raw , you never know if you 're going to get the film finished and you 're running around doing loads of scenes .
but i would take that any day over a film that lasts months and months and has all the money in the world where you 're just doing a tiny bit each day .
that for me would be quite boring .

i was incredibly grateful to be honoured in that way , but the real meaning for me comes in the work i do .
my mum greatly enjoyed it , as did my stepdad and my daughter .
but i would n't be interested in that being my entire life !
were you inundated with hollywood scripts afterwards ?
i certainly had lots of offers but nothing very interesting - i tend to look for scripts that have a bit of meaning to them .
and i never had any intention of moving out of england ; my life is here .
how does working on big us films compare to smaller-budget ones in the uk ?
i have n't really experienced much big-budget film-making ; everything i do tends to be extremely low-budget , on both sides of the atlantic .
it tends to have an urgency that i love ; it 's very raw , you never know if you 're going to get the film finished and you 're running around doing loads of scenes .
but i would take that any day over a film that lasts months and months and has all the money in the world where you 're just doing a tiny bit each day .
that for me would be quite boring .

since then , though , she has largely worked on low-budget independent films and television productions like the bbc 's tsunami , the aftermath .
this week sees her back on our screens as nancy , the london thief who dreams of a better life , in the bbc 's new adaptation of oliver twist .
had you read charles dickens ' novel before landing the role ?
no , but i read it when i knew i got the part .
it 's impossible not to be familiar with it though , and i 'd certainly seen the musical and roman polanski 's film version .
i actually read half of it , then listened to the rest on a tape .
i ca n't remember the name of the actor who read it but it was fantastic - i listened to it with my daughter , aoife .
how did you approach the character of nancy ?
her co-stars in oliver twist include timothy spall and tom hardy she 's had an incredibly tough life , growing up in extreme poverty in a world where life is cheap .
yet she 's somehow managed to retain a great sense of humanity , warmth and heart .
she 's also completely and utterly in love with bill sikes , played by tom hardy ; it 's quite a dysfunctional relationship but it works .
he looks after her and she looks after him ; he slaps her around a bit but that was all part of the times .
how did you find working with oliver himself , 11-year-old william miller ?
i 've worked with children in almost everything i 've done and it 's always been an enriching experience .
william is such a mature young lad ; he makes my job very easy .
he 's a complete natural and a lovely young boy with his head very much on his shoulders .

his latest cinematic offering is closing the ring - a wartime love story spanning two continents and 50 years .
it should come as no surprise that he 's taken on yet another epic story .
he is after all the director that brought us the academy award-winning ghandi and the politically sensitive cry freedom .
it should also come as no surprise that with lord attenborough at the helm , closing the ring attracted an all-star cast including pete postlethwaite , christopher plummer and shirley maclaine .
" i think she 's an icon , " says the director of maclaine .
" i think she 's for all time .
while cinema exists , shirley maclaine will be part of cinema . "
the feeling seems to be mutual as maclaine jumped at the chance to collaborate with her old friend once again .
" if dickie had sent me the phone book i probably would have said ' okay let 's do the as and bs ' just to work with him again , " she says .
another of the film 's stars is mischa barton .
lord attenborough had n't come across the oc star before .
" i did n't know at that time of mischa barton - the oc was not in my life , " he says .
" it was only my grandchildren who said : ' pappy you can get mischa barton then you 'll really have a smash success picture . '
and she 's wonderful .
she 's as beautiful as anybody you could ever wish to meet and she 's an exquisite actress . "
closing the ring is based on a true story of a young american woman whose husband was killed during world war ii near belfast when the bomber he was flying crashed .
only when a gold ring is discovered 50 years later , can she lay to rest the past and finally look to the future .
proudest moment so just how challenging was it to make sure everything was historically accurate for america in 1944 and belfast in 1991 ?
" apart from anything else , i remember it , you see .
i know 1941 , " lord attenborough recalls .
" i was in the air force in ' 43 so it 's part of my world , as it were , so i had the advantage of sort of sniffing out things that were n't real and we had to do a tremendous amount of reconstruction and research and so on .
" and then in ' 91 when shirley was 70 odd - that was available to all of us in our immediate past memory .
" the important thing was to be able to meld those together .
with shirley playing ethel ann in her 70s and mischa playing her when she was 19 . "
lord attenborough is revered throughout the film industry but his proudest achievement cinematically might not be what would immediately spring to mind .
" i think the best film i made or was involved in was called shadowlands .
but i suppose if i 'm thinking about the impact on cinema around the world i have to think of cry freedom because mandela told me that it contributed to the end of apartheid , " he says .
with those kind of credentials it 's easy to see why people jump at the chance to be a part of a richard attenborough movie .
and while he 's behind the lens for closing the ring , he 's not yet ready to give up his first love , acting .
he can next be seen in the upcoming jurassic park iv which is currently in production .
it 's a packed schedule so would he ever consider taking things a bit easier and retiring ?
" good heavens no , " he says .
" relaxing ?
sitting back ?
i 'd be bored stiff .
oh no , i adore working .
i ca n't believe i 'm so lucky .
i just have to thank the lord god . "
closing the ring is out in cinemas across the uk from 28th december .

his latest cinematic offering is closing the ring - a wartime love story spanning two continents and 50 years .
it should come as no surprise that he 's taken on yet another epic story .
he is after all the director that brought us the academy award-winning ghandi and the politically sensitive cry freedom .
it should also come as no surprise that with lord attenborough at the helm , closing the ring attracted an all-star cast including pete postlethwaite , christopher plummer and shirley maclaine .
" i think she 's an icon , " says the director of maclaine .
" i think she 's for all time .
while cinema exists , shirley maclaine will be part of cinema . "
the feeling seems to be mutual as maclaine jumped at the chance to collaborate with her old friend once again .
" if dickie had sent me the phone book i probably would have said ' okay let 's do the as and bs ' just to work with him again , " she says .
mischa barton was recommended to the director by his grandchildren another of the film 's stars is mischa barton .
lord attenborough had n't come across the oc star before .
" i did n't know at that time of mischa barton - the oc was not in my life , " he says .
" it was only my grandchildren who said : ' pappy you can get mischa barton then you 'll really have a smash success picture . '
and she 's wonderful .
she 's as beautiful as anybody you could ever wish to meet and she 's an exquisite actress . "

she had to divert another plane as she worked at raf lossiemouth to prevent a possible collision .

flight lieutenant geisow heard his calls for help but found it difficult to understand as his english was limited .
his message was : " we are lost so we need your help . "
she managed to get the plane locked onto an electronic beam that would help him land at kinloss when the situation became much worse .
radar failed violent wind and rain blew the plane off the beam and the pilot could not find it again .
circling at 800ft , he was coming close to the radio masts less than 200ft below .
one of flight lieutenant geisow 's radars then failed and the pilot 's instruments started malfunctioning .
the flight controller was honoured at downing street a royal mail plane was also approaching and she knew she must divert it .
she stayed calm , diverted the royal mail plane , then gave the russian pilot the instructions he needed to find the beam again while avoiding the radio masts .
she knew his fuel was virtually exhausted and there may be no second chance on the landing .
the russian plane landed with only fumes in the fuel tanks .
she said : " when the call came through i was horrified , i did not know what to expect .
" it was a nightmare , he was weaving about .

nominating her for a vodafone life savers award , raf chief press officer in scotland michael mulford said there was no doubt she saved at least one life and averted a potential tragedy .
nick read , vodafone uk chief executive officer , said : " the entries this year were truly inspiring and selecting just 10 from so many deserving stories was an extremely tough task .
" however , this story shone out as a particularly inspiring example of the brave actions carried out by so many men and women in our emergency services , whose everyday work and dedication we all too often take for granted .
" without the brave efforts of anne geisow that day , the outcome would most certainly have been one of tragedy and vodafone is delighted to have the opportunity of honouring her in these national awards . "
