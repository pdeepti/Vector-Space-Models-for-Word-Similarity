csu leader and bavarian premier edmund stoiber has been one of the chief opponents of the reform , fearing that wealthy german states such as his own would carry the majority of the financial burden of the planned changes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu leader and bavarian state premier edmund stoiber stoiber , however , signaled his readiness to compromise and said he was confident the draft law would take effect on april 1 as planned . " i am optimistic that the healthcare reform will go into force as agreed , " he told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . old plans ring in new year the beginning of january is a traditional time for germany 's political parties to map out their policies for the year ahead with the spd and the free-market liberal free democrats holding important meetings over the weekend . labor markets reforms were the main policy focus of the two-day spd leadership gathering in the northern german city of bremen . among the reform proposals agreed were the introduction of a minimum wage and a scheme to reduce the amount of social contributions for low earners as a way of getting long-term unemployed back to work .
the spd also put forward an idea to guarantee all-day childcare , paid for by the government , to all children between the agea of one and five . spd to sharpen party profile the policies decided over the weekend were a clear attempt to appeal to the center-left party 's traditional base .
with many supporters complaining that the party has abandoned social principles and that its policies have become indistinct from those of the cdu , senior spd members wanted to sharpen the party 's profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chairman kurt beck spd party chairman kurt beck told the meeting that the party would focus more on ensuring that social welfare was not neglected . " people that are prepared to work have to receive special recognition , but the weak must not be allowed to drop by the wayside , " he said . the social democrats have recently been losing ground in the ratings with support dropping by 1 percent to 30 percent in one of the most recent opinion polls conducted by german public broadcaster ard .
meanwhile the cdu achieved a six-month high of 36 percent in the same survey . liberals to show social side germany 's grand coalition government came under attack at saturday 's meeting of the opposition free democrats in the southwestern german city of stuttgart .
fdp party leader guido westerwelle attacked what he sees as the sluggish pace of economic reform in germany , describing it as " slow motion " politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free democratic party head guido westerwelle westerwelle also painted a more socially oriented picture of the free-market party at the gathering . " our policies of economic reason are far more social than any red flag , whether it 's from the spd , the greens , the ex-communists or even what we 've heard lately from the cdu , " he said . westerwelle also criticized firms for their lack of social responsibility . " it is not acceptable that when company results are made public that the salaries of board members are increased by 30 percent and at the same time thousands of redundancies are announced , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jeg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel says germany must push ahead with reforms in a new year 's speech to be broadcast on german television on sunday , chancellor angela merkel said her government must push forward with further economic reforms in 2007 despite the pain they have inflicted .
-lrb- 31.12.2006 -rrb- social democrat leader warns against too many reforms the chairman of germany 's social democratic party , kurt beck , said that the painful social and economic reforms introduced by chancellor angela merkel had hurt germans badly and that people wouldn ’ t accept more .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de design -pipe- 08.01.2007 snap , crackle , pop or crunch : sound sells großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting that crunch just right as the marketplace becomes more crowded , companies are looking at new ways to make their wares attractive to consumers .
one aspect is the way a product sounds .
it may be subtle , but it can spell commercial success . when steffen weise , director of research and development at germany 's biggest cookie maker bahlsen , sees one of his firm 's products on a plate , he 's not just thinking about the sweet , buttery taste or the slight hint of orange put into one of the baker 's latest creations .
he 's thinking about mastication . " imagine you see a cookie on a plate and it looks very crunchy , " he said , frowning slightly .
" but when you bite into it you find something very soft and unpleasant . " that , he said , is not what bahlsen or most baked-goods buyers want their cookie experience to be . the hanover-based company , founded in 1891 , has been well known for its leibnitz butter cookies for decades and marketed the product 's powerful crunch in advertisements back in the 1960s .
but more recently , it decided that it wanted to add another dimension to its research and development efforts for new products .
while taste and texture had been the primary considerations , bahlsen , in an attempt to get ahead of competitors , added the auditory element .
it was one of the first food companies to take this new sensory step . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test subjects listen to crunch after cookie crunch bahlsen began testing focus groups on their reactions to the sounds of different cookie recipes .
the company developed elaborate recording systems , microphones that were placed inside testers ' ears to record as accurately as possible the sound the chewer hears while chomping down on a cookie . complicated computer programs were developed that presented individuals with a specific crunch and then asked them to rate it according to emotions it triggered or what kind of image it brought to mind .
then the cookie recipe in development could be tweaked – more butter added to soften the crunch , more sugar to make it harder – until the right crunch at the right duration for the right crowd was found . age makes a difference bahlsen found that younger people wanted a stronger crunch , something crisp , loud and exciting .
for them , that represented youth , risk taking and dynamism . for the older crowd , however , a softer , more delicate auditory experience was usually preferred .
they tended to want their sweets to evoke luxury and richness , so the butter content was increased to provide a sonically calmer event . " older people in general are not very interested in additional noisy or stressful situations , " weise said .
" they want to relax ; they want to enjoy their food .
and they do n't need any action while eating . " subtle messaging for bahlsen and other companies working with sound , it revolves around what they call " implicit coding . "
that is , they want a message to get into the consumer 's head without him or her realizing it .
that message should be positive and basically say , " buy me , and not the other one " when faced with 20 varieties of cookies or 30 brands of beer on the store shelves . " if you have the specific sound you know when you open this bottle you will already be happy before tasting the product itself , " said brigitte schulte-fortkamp , who teaches psychoacoustics at berlin 's technical university .
" it 's not really a conscious process .
you are influenced without knowing it . " while sound design in the food industry is relatively new , other sectors have been using sound engineers in their development teams for some time now .
it runs the gamut from feminine hygiene spray -lrb- which should sound soft and soothing when spraying -rrb- to mosquito repellent -lrb- which should have a little more power behind it , to keep those little monsters at bay -rrb- to electric razors . these days , sound designers are often seen as good cooks , adjusting their sonic recipes so that consumers using a product experience positive emotions , are n't too surprised and feel their needs and desires are being met . cars and corporations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a porsche should n't sound like a vw the most intensively sound designed product is likely the automobile .
the slam of a car door should sound like a safe closing , and any rattling be kept at a minimum .
a volvo driver will likely want the car 's engine to purr quietly and dependably .
the porsche buyer wants a different sound , one that communicates raw , naked power . corporations are also hiring sound designers to provide jingles and corporate music which tell the public who they are , or would at least like to be perceived as being . an insurance company like allianz wants music that communicates reliability and trust .
the audi car brand needs something that indicates motion and speed , but not recklessness . " we want to interpret the brand in the acoustic way so that people who hear it say : ' oh , that is for me : premium , or that is for me : trust ' , " said carl-frank westermann , who heads up the sound department at the berlin company metadesign and has created jingles for both companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vacuum cleaners will likely stay loud while everything can be sound designed to a certain extent , some sonic engineering has – perhaps counter-intuitively - fallen on its face .
in the past , engineers have created quieter vacuum cleaners that were auditory miles away from the high-decibel whines of most of the today 's makes . but , companies found the quieter vacuums did not sell as well .
in many people 's minds , all that headache-inducing noise equaled superior suction power .

authorities have resorted to the courts to get him to move on . it 's kind of like the guest who would n't leave , but this one wears a white collar . a polish catholic clergyman on loan to germany has been suspended from his priestly duties because he refuses to move out of a presbytery and go home , a spokesman for the german archdiocese of trier said monday . the priest had been ordered home to the diocese of lublin in poland after spending six years helping to make up for a shortage of priests in germany .
a german priest took over church services last year , but the pole , 42 , simply stayed on in his residence . in october last year , church authorities began court action to evict him from the catholic church 's house in the small town of schönecken .
the case is to be heard in february .
spokesman stephan kronenburg said it was the first time trier archdiocese had ever withdrawn a priest 's license for refusing to clear out . poland is one of the only european nations with a surplus of catholic priests and regularly lends them to its western neighbors .
in germany , ever fewer people are opting to becoming priests , forcing the country to import them . father karl kneissl , dean of the region , said last year he believed the polish priest did not want to return to the lower salary he would receive in his diocese of lublin , south of warsaw . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bureaucratic bungle ends cleric 's mayoral hopes a catholic priest recently made headlines when he announced he was running for mayor of a german state capital .

authorities have resorted to the courts to get him to move on . it 's kind of like the guest who would n't leave , but this one wears a white collar . a polish catholic clergyman on loan to germany has been suspended from his priestly duties because he refuses to move out of a presbytery and go home , a spokesman for the german archdiocese of trier said monday . the priest had been ordered home to the diocese of lublin in poland after spending six years helping to make up for a shortage of priests in germany .
a german priest took over church services last year , but the pole , 42 , simply stayed on in his residence . in october last year , church authorities began court action to evict him from the catholic church 's house in the small town of schönecken .
the case is to be heard in february .
spokesman stephan kronenburg said it was the first time trier archdiocese had ever withdrawn a priest 's license for refusing to clear out . poland is one of the only european nations with a surplus of catholic priests and regularly lends them to its western neighbors .
in germany , ever fewer people are opting to becoming priests , forcing the country to import them . father karl kneissl , dean of the region , said last year he believed the polish priest did not want to return to the lower salary he would receive in his diocese of lublin , south of warsaw . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bureaucratic bungle ends cleric 's mayoral hopes a catholic priest recently made headlines when he announced he was running for mayor of a german state capital .

" i view the closure of the important druzhba pipeline with concern , " economy minister michael glos said . " the current situation is not dramatic for germany , " he said .

however , germany has underlined that its oil supplies are safe for now . the german economics ministry on monday insisted that the country 's oil supplies were not threatened by an interruption of flows through the druzhba oil pipeline , which supplies russian oil to germany and poland via belarus .
" i view the closure of the important druzhba pipeline with concern , " economy minister michael glos said . " the current situation is not dramatic for germany , " he said . " there are sufficient reserves of crude oil at the refineries to ensure supplies even if there is a long gap in deliveries . "
glos added , saying he expected deliveries via the pipeline to be fully resumed as quickly as possible . russia stops oil exports to belarus state television in belarus , a former soviet republic , reported on monday that the transit of russian crude oil across belarus to western europe had been halted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at a gas compressor station near nesvizh , southwest of the belarussian capital minsk russia 's pipeline monopoly transneft said on monday it was forced to act because minsk had been illegally siphoning off oil from the druzhba pipeline system . " the belarusian side began taking transit oil as payment in kind for a new duty it had illegally imposed , " transneft vice-president sergei grigoryev told the reuters news agency .
" we therefore reduced transit supplies , equal to the amount being taken .
we then reached the point where we had to stop supplies completely . " belarus and russia , which have traditionally enjoyed close ties , have been locked in a bitter gas pricing row .
at the beginning of the year , belarus slapped a transit tax on russian crude oil which passes through the country in response to a russian decision to impose export duties on crude oil that belarus buys from russia . the row over transit fees came just days after belarus had narrowly averted a threatened cut-off in russian natural gas supplies by agreeing to a demand by russian monopoly gazprom that minsk pay double last year 's price for imported gas . germany says consumers wo n't be affected europe is heavily reliant on russia for its oil and gas and extremely vulnerable to russian supply cuts . about 50 million tons of crude oil pass through the druzhba pipeline each year .
of that , 18 million tons are supplied to poland and 22 million tons to the german refineries of schwedt and mider spergau . german economics minister glos said the development " shows once again that a balanced energy mix is imperative " for secure energy supply " and that one-sided dependencies must not be allowed to develop . " both germany and poland have confirmed that oil supplies to some of their refineries have been disrupted due to the russian interruption of oil exports to belarus . the mwv oil supply federation in hamburg said that " there have been limited pump interruptions on the druzhba pipeline in recent days . " the pipeline supplies the pck schwedt refinery and the mider total refinery near leuna in eastern germany . " the running of the refineries is currently not affected , " mwv said .
" nevertheless , as a precautionary move , alternative routes of supply for crude oil are being drawn up , for example , via the port of rostock . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unusually mild winter means germans wo n't be needing too much oil for heating supplies to consumers were not in jeopardy , mwv insisted .
" there is a crisis system in place to offset any interruption in supply , " it added . a spokeswoman for total , which operates the leuna refinery , said that supplies had stopped overnight .
" but supplies to customers have been safeguarded and the refineries are functioning , " she insisted . the spokeswoman also said the reasons for the stoppage were not yet clear , but insisted that the refineries had sufficient reserves , even if she declined to say how long those reserves might last . " we 're working on an alternative supply if that should become necessary , " she said . eu demands explanation the european union on monday demanded an " urgent and detailed " explanation for the interruption of oil supplies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de design -pipe- 08.01.2007 snap , crackle , pop or crunch : sound sells großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting that crunch just right as the marketplace becomes more crowded , companies are looking at new ways to make their wares attractive to consumers .
one aspect is the way a product sounds .
it may be subtle , but it can spell commercial success . when steffen weise , director of research and development at germany 's biggest cookie maker bahlsen , sees one of his firm 's products on a plate , he 's not just thinking about the sweet , buttery taste or the slight hint of orange put into one of the baker 's latest creations .
he 's thinking about mastication . " imagine you see a cookie on a plate and it looks very crunchy , " he said , frowning slightly .
" but when you bite into it you find something very soft and unpleasant . " that , he said , is not what bahlsen or most baked-goods buyers want their cookie experience to be . the hanover-based company , founded in 1891 , has been well known for its leibnitz butter cookies for decades and marketed the product 's powerful crunch in advertisements back in the 1960s .
but more recently , it decided that it wanted to add another dimension to its research and development efforts for new products .
while taste and texture had been the primary considerations , bahlsen , in an attempt to get ahead of competitors , added the auditory element .
it was one of the first food companies to take this new sensory step . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test subjects listen to crunch after cookie crunch bahlsen began testing focus groups on their reactions to the sounds of different cookie recipes .
the company developed elaborate recording systems , microphones that were placed inside testers ' ears to record as accurately as possible the sound the chewer hears while chomping down on a cookie . complicated computer programs were developed that presented individuals with a specific crunch and then asked them to rate it according to emotions it triggered or what kind of image it brought to mind .
then the cookie recipe in development could be tweaked – more butter added to soften the crunch , more sugar to make it harder – until the right crunch at the right duration for the right crowd was found . age makes a difference bahlsen found that younger people wanted a stronger crunch , something crisp , loud and exciting .
for them , that represented youth , risk taking and dynamism . for the older crowd , however , a softer , more delicate auditory experience was usually preferred .
they tended to want their sweets to evoke luxury and richness , so the butter content was increased to provide a sonically calmer event . " older people in general are not very interested in additional noisy or stressful situations , " weise said .
" they want to relax ; they want to enjoy their food .
and they do n't need any action while eating . " subtle messaging for bahlsen and other companies working with sound , it revolves around what they call " implicit coding . "
that is , they want a message to get into the consumer 's head without him or her realizing it .
that message should be positive and basically say , " buy me , and not the other one " when faced with 20 varieties of cookies or 30 brands of beer on the store shelves . " if you have the specific sound you know when you open this bottle you will already be happy before tasting the product itself , " said brigitte schulte-fortkamp , who teaches psychoacoustics at berlin 's technical university .
" it 's not really a conscious process .
you are influenced without knowing it . " while sound design in the food industry is relatively new , other sectors have been using sound engineers in their development teams for some time now .
it runs the gamut from feminine hygiene spray -lrb- which should sound soft and soothing when spraying -rrb- to mosquito repellent -lrb- which should have a little more power behind it , to keep those little monsters at bay -rrb- to electric razors . these days , sound designers are often seen as good cooks , adjusting their sonic recipes so that consumers using a product experience positive emotions , are n't too surprised and feel their needs and desires are being met . cars and corporations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a porsche should n't sound like a vw the most intensively sound designed product is likely the automobile .
the slam of a car door should sound like a safe closing , and any rattling be kept at a minimum .
a volvo driver will likely want the car 's engine to purr quietly and dependably .
the porsche buyer wants a different sound , one that communicates raw , naked power . corporations are also hiring sound designers to provide jingles and corporate music which tell the public who they are , or would at least like to be perceived as being . an insurance company like allianz wants music that communicates reliability and trust .
the audi car brand needs something that indicates motion and speed , but not recklessness . " we want to interpret the brand in the acoustic way so that people who hear it say : ' oh , that is for me : premium , or that is for me : trust ' , " said carl-frank westermann , who heads up the sound department at the berlin company metadesign and has created jingles for both companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vacuum cleaners will likely stay loud while everything can be sound designed to a certain extent , some sonic engineering has – perhaps counter-intuitively - fallen on its face .
in the past , engineers have created quieter vacuum cleaners that were auditory miles away from the high-decibel whines of most of the today 's makes . but , companies found the quieter vacuums did not sell as well .
in many people 's minds , all that headache-inducing noise equaled superior suction power .
the vacuums soon got their screams back . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de purr , squawk , chirp - animals speak out at berlin archive ever wonder what a mole has to say ?

" child pornography on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to search the internet , officers do n't need a warrant additional police specialists would be joining the state 's cyber team to match an increase in internet-related sex crimes , according to a baden-württemberg police spokesperson . some 800 cases involving child pornography passed through the state 's district attorney 's office in stuttgart in 2006 .
that number represents an increase from 690 cases in 2005 and 620 cases in 2004 . the suspects come from all parts of society , achim traichel , director of the five-person internet investigation group , said in an interview with the stuttgarter zeitung .
bankers , doctors , factory workers , and even fellow police officers have all been investigated , he added . the team 's cyber research led to a high-ranking member of stuttgart 's police force , whose computer was found to contain some 1,000 examples of child pornography . though the material was discovered in march 2006 , the police department kept the case under wraps until the press became aware of it in mid-december .
the accused officer faces up to five years in prison , according to the online edition of the stuttgarter nachrichten . police hacking still undecided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyber team has already caught perpetrators from 82 countries few cases of child pornography , however , are easy to prosecute , district attorney spokeswoman bettina vetter told the stuttgarter zeitung .
only one third of all child pornography cases are carried through to a court sentence while many cases are often abandoned for lack of evidence , she said . it can be difficult to prove " that the suspects actually viewed the pictures and did n't just erase them as they claim , " said vetter . though police have the technical ability to hack into private computers while the user is connected to the internet and view all files on the hard-drive , lawmakers are still deciding legality of this procedure . in the meantime , police will be putting pressure on pedophiles by showing up at their favorite web sites . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bits and bytes to fight child pornography european forensic scientists have developed a state-of-the-art computer program to help track down child victims of sexual exploitation on the internet .

one aspect is the way a product sounds .
it may be subtle , but it can spell commercial success . when steffen weise , director of research and development at germany 's biggest cookie maker bahlsen , sees one of his firm 's products on a plate , he 's not just thinking about the sweet , buttery taste or the slight hint of orange put into one of the baker 's latest creations .
he 's thinking about mastication . " imagine you see a cookie on a plate and it looks very crunchy , " he said , frowning slightly .
" but when you bite into it you find something very soft and unpleasant . " that , he said , is not what bahlsen or most baked-goods buyers want their cookie experience to be . the hanover-based company , founded in 1891 , has been well known for its leibnitz butter cookies for decades and marketed the product 's powerful crunch in advertisements back in the 1960s .
but more recently , it decided that it wanted to add another dimension to its research and development efforts for new products .
while taste and texture had been the primary considerations , bahlsen , in an attempt to get ahead of competitors , added the auditory element .
it was one of the first food companies to take this new sensory step . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test subjects listen to crunch after cookie crunch bahlsen began testing focus groups on their reactions to the sounds of different cookie recipes .
the company developed elaborate recording systems , microphones that were placed inside testers ' ears to record as accurately as possible the sound the chewer hears while chomping down on a cookie . complicated computer programs were developed that presented individuals with a specific crunch and then asked them to rate it according to emotions it triggered or what kind of image it brought to mind .
then the cookie recipe in development could be tweaked – more butter added to soften the crunch , more sugar to make it harder – until the right crunch at the right duration for the right crowd was found . age makes a difference bahlsen found that younger people wanted a stronger crunch , something crisp , loud and exciting .
for them , that represented youth , risk taking and dynamism . for the older crowd , however , a softer , more delicate auditory experience was usually preferred .
they tended to want their sweets to evoke luxury and richness , so the butter content was increased to provide a sonically calmer event . " older people in general are not very interested in additional noisy or stressful situations , " weise said .
" they want to relax ; they want to enjoy their food .
and they do n't need any action while eating . " subtle messaging for bahlsen and other companies working with sound , it revolves around what they call " implicit coding . "
that is , they want a message to get into the consumer 's head without him or her realizing it .
that message should be positive and basically say , " buy me , and not the other one " when faced with 20 varieties of cookies or 30 brands of beer on the store shelves .

11 hijackers to 15 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sentence brings to an end a marathon legal process spanning five years a court in hamburg on monday sentenced mounir el motassadeq , a moroccan friend of the sept .
11 , 2001 hijackers who is convicted for being an accessory to mass murder , to 15 years in prison . a hamburg court on monday handed mounir el motassadeq the maximum 15-year sentence for his role in aiding the hijackers who killed nearly 3,000 people in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 . prosecutor walter hemberger said monday that motassadeq , who was friendly with three of the suicide attackers when they were students in the northern german city of hamburg , deserved the toughest sentence possible under german law because he had committed " an immense wrong . " hemberger 's comments came after motassadeq 's lawyers filed a series of motions to halt the sentencing hearing .
they argued that the hamburg bench was " unconstitutional " and demanded a suspension of the sentencing . however , the judges rejected the challenges and pushed ahead with the hearing , saying they wanted to finish the case monday .
the sentencing court , comprising three hamburg state superior court judges , had convened on friday . marathon legal process the sentencing brings to a close a marathon legal process which has seen motassadeq in and out of german courts for five years .
the bearded 32-year-old moroccan was arrested a few months after the sept 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington that killed nearly 3,000 people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german leaders commemorate sept .
11 victims on the fifth anniversary of the attacks in 2003 , he became the first person ever to be convicted for a role in the attacks .
he was then sentenced to 15 years in prison for being an accessory to mass murder . but the german federal court in karlsruhe , in southwestern germany , overturned that verdict on the grounds that us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al qaeda suspects held in us custody .
it ordered a retrial in hamburg . in 2005 , motassadeq was given a seven-year prison sentence for the lesser crime of belonging to a terrorist organisation but was cleared of abetting mass murder .
the judges found there was no evidence to show that motassadeq had been directly involved in planning the sept .
11 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon . but he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of the hamburg-based terror cell which included the presumed ringleader mohammed atta - while the future hijackers were pursuing flight training in the united states - and to have helped cover up their tracks . motassadeq says he 's innocent that verdict was scrapped in november last year , when the karlsruhe court found that motassadeq had " facilitated and supported the attacks " and sent him for sentencing .
prosecutors successfully argued that under a " division of labor " within the group , motassadeq ran the financial affairs of other cell members and covered up their absences from germany before the attacks . motassadeq 's lawyers however maintain he was a low-tier member of the group and that he knew nothing about the plot to fly planes into targets in new york and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq with his lawyer in 2004 last friday , motassadeq vehemently protested his innocence , telling the court : " i swear before god that i did not know that they were in america .
i swear before god that i did not know what they were planning . " german authorities have indicated that they will deport motassadeq to morocco once he has served his sentence . motassadeq 's case and the perceived failure of german courts to successfully prosecute him have strained berlin 's ties with washington in recent years . motassadeq is only the second man to be convicted of a role in the sept .

11 victims on the fifth anniversary of the attacks in 2003 , he became the first person ever to be convicted for a role in the attacks .
he was then sentenced to 15 years in prison for being an accessory to mass murder . but the german federal court in karlsruhe , in southwestern germany , overturned that verdict on the grounds that us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al qaeda suspects held in us custody .
it ordered a retrial in hamburg . in 2005 , motassadeq was given a seven-year prison sentence for the lesser crime of belonging to a terrorist organisation but was cleared of abetting mass murder .
the judges found there was no evidence to show that motassadeq had been directly involved in planning the sept .
11 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon . but he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of the hamburg-based terror cell which included the presumed ringleader mohammed atta - while the future hijackers were pursuing flight training in the united states - and to have helped cover up their tracks . motassadeq says he 's innocent that verdict was scrapped in november last year , when the karlsruhe court found that motassadeq had " facilitated and supported the attacks " and sent him for sentencing .
prosecutors successfully argued that under a " division of labor " within the group , motassadeq ran the financial affairs of other cell members and covered up their absences from germany before the attacks . motassadeq 's lawyers however maintain he was a low-tier member of the group and that he knew nothing about the plot to fly planes into targets in new york and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq with his lawyer in 2004 last friday , motassadeq vehemently protested his innocence , telling the court : " i swear before god that i did not know that they were in america .
i swear before god that i did not know what they were planning . " german authorities have indicated that they will deport motassadeq to morocco once he has served his sentence . motassadeq 's case and the perceived failure of german courts to successfully prosecute him have strained berlin 's ties with washington in recent years . motassadeq is only the second man to be convicted of a role in the sept .
11 attacks .
zacarias moussaoui , a french citizen of moroccan descent who received a life sentence from a us court in may 2006 , is the only other person convicted of links to the attacks . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

he was handed over to us authorities , who took him to afghanistan and then to guantanamo bay in cuba where he was held for four years until his release in august 2006 . us investigators claimed that kurnaz , who hails from the northern german city of bremen , was an " enemy combatant " with links to al-qaeda . kurnaz was released in august 2006 because of a lack of proof that he belonged to a terrorist organization . since his return to germany , kurnaz has alleged that he was abused by german soldiers during his detainment in afghanistan .
he has also said he suffered abuse in guantanamo bay including psychological torture and undernourishment . in november , kurnaz described his ordeal at the hands of german soldiers during a meeting with members of the european parliament . " they asked me if i knew who they were and then they said , ' we are the ksk , " ' he told european mps , adding that the men had german flags on their uniforms and spoke german with him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an earlier photo of murat kurnaz dating back to before his ordeal in afghanistan " i thought they would have some questions and that they could help me , but they told me i had chosen the wrong side , " kurnaz said . kurnaz 's lawyer has said the us authorities never issued an arrest warrant for kurnaz and no legal proceedings were ever started against him . embarrassing case for germany the case is an embarrassment for germany , which also faces allegations that the previous government secretly aided a us program to kidnap and fly terrorists to third countries for interrogation . the german defense ministry has repeatedly denied kurnaz 's allegations that he was abused by german soldiers in kandahar . the kurnaz case is also being investigated by a parliamentary committee , which is currently studying whether german security agencies breached any german rules while assisting post-2001 , us anti-terrorism operations . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany split over plane deployment to afghanistan germany 's government is split over whether the decision to send spy planes to afghanistan , which could see german troops deployed in the volatile south , needs parliamentary approval .

" child pornography on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to search the internet , officers do n't need a warrant additional police specialists would be joining the state 's cyber team to match an increase in internet-related sex crimes , according to a baden-württemberg police spokesperson . some 800 cases involving child pornography passed through the state 's district attorney 's office in stuttgart in 2006 .
that number represents an increase from 690 cases in 2005 and 620 cases in 2004 . the suspects come from all parts of society , achim traichel , director of the five-person internet investigation group , said in an interview with the stuttgarter zeitung .
bankers , doctors , factory workers , and even fellow police officers have all been investigated , he added . the team 's cyber research led to a high-ranking member of stuttgart 's police force , whose computer was found to contain some 1,000 examples of child pornography . though the material was discovered in march 2006 , the police department kept the case under wraps until the press became aware of it in mid-december .
the accused officer faces up to five years in prison , according to the online edition of the stuttgarter nachrichten . police hacking still undecided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyber team has already caught perpetrators from 82 countries few cases of child pornography , however , are easy to prosecute , district attorney spokeswoman bettina vetter told the stuttgarter zeitung .
only one third of all child pornography cases are carried through to a court sentence while many cases are often abandoned for lack of evidence , she said . it can be difficult to prove " that the suspects actually viewed the pictures and did n't just erase them as they claim , " said vetter . though police have the technical ability to hack into private computers while the user is connected to the internet and view all files on the hard-drive , lawmakers are still deciding legality of this procedure . in the meantime , police will be putting pressure on pedophiles by showing up at their favorite web sites . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bits and bytes to fight child pornography european forensic scientists have developed a state-of-the-art computer program to help track down child victims of sexual exploitation on the internet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 08.01.2007 second time around for discount pharmacy chain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : docmorris ' generic drugs can save consumers up to 30 percent docmorris , the dutch discount pharmacy chain , has found a loophole to get around germany 's powerful lobby of pharmacists .
the internet retailer wants to sell its brand through 500 german affiliates . in germany , where drug prices are higher than the rest of europe , certified pharmacists have a virtual monopoly on the sale of over-the-counter and prescription drugs .
so when docmorris , europe 's first mail order pharmacy opened its first affiliate in the western city of saarbrücken last july and sold non-prescription medication at discount prices , competitors forced the state courts to shut it down in september . now , nearly four months later , the dutch internet retailer and pharmacy chain wants to get around the german pharmacy act , which does not permit corporate entities to sell drugs and limits ownership to three branches that must be in close proximity to each other , by paying pharmacy owners licensing fees to sell its products . opening 500 franchises through a legal loophole bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prescription and non-prescription drugs can only be sold in pharmacies on monday , in a second attempt to establish a franchise in the small saarland town of st. wendel , docmorris ' chief executive ralf däinghaus said he is planning to open 500 affiliates throughout germany over the next three years , with the next one scheduled to come in the northern city of bremen . he said pharmacies that choose to join his chain would be able to offer over-the-counter medication for up to 30 percent less than other established brands .
although the dutch chain has paid out 25 million euros -lrb- $ 32.5 million -rrb- in rebates to customers , its pharmaceuticals are still less expensive than those of its competitors . the price of prescription drugs , however , are fixed and will not be subject to the discounts , although däinghaus told the german press that he will push to deregulate that sector as well . pharmacy lobby not impressed " mr. däinghaus is trying out a new business model , but that does not frighten us , " said heinz-günter wolf , president of the german pharmacists association . traditional pharmacists , who have staged protests against reforms that they say threaten their existence , argue that they undergo vigorous professional training that enables them to dispense health advice to patients , whereas discounters who have no medical background pose a health hazard to the public . although paying out licensing fees reduce company profits , däinghaus told the german daily süddeutssche zeitung that he is banking on high volume sales to make up for the wafer-thin margins , adding that pharmacists are " running at us " to join . eu anti-trust law takes precedence over national law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pharmacists are trained to dispense health advice docmorris was incorporated in the netherlands , but the company 's main market is germany , where over 700,000 customers have been able to order both over-the-counter and prescription medication via the internet , telephone and mail order .
more than half of its customers are over the age of 50 and tend to live in metropolitan areas . the service is integrated in the german healthcare system and aimed at patients who have long-term or chronic illnesses , such as rheumatism , diabetes heart disorders and asthma . in his anti-trust battle with the pharmaceutical lobby , däinghaus could eventually have the final arbiter , the european court of justice , on his side .
saarland 's health minister josef hecken , who permitted the first docmorris franchise to open in saarbrücken has said that eu law entitling any european citizen to set up business anywhere in the union " takes precedence over national law .

" child pornography on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to search the internet , officers do n't need a warrant additional police specialists would be joining the state 's cyber team to match an increase in internet-related sex crimes , according to a baden-württemberg police spokesperson . some 800 cases involving child pornography passed through the state 's district attorney 's office in stuttgart in 2006 .
that number represents an increase from 690 cases in 2005 and 620 cases in 2004 . the suspects come from all parts of society , achim traichel , director of the five-person internet investigation group , said in an interview with the stuttgarter zeitung .
bankers , doctors , factory workers , and even fellow police officers have all been investigated , he added . the team 's cyber research led to a high-ranking member of stuttgart 's police force , whose computer was found to contain some 1,000 examples of child pornography . though the material was discovered in march 2006 , the police department kept the case under wraps until the press became aware of it in mid-december .
the accused officer faces up to five years in prison , according to the online edition of the stuttgarter nachrichten . police hacking still undecided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyber team has already caught perpetrators from 82 countries few cases of child pornography , however , are easy to prosecute , district attorney spokeswoman bettina vetter told the stuttgarter zeitung .
only one third of all child pornography cases are carried through to a court sentence while many cases are often abandoned for lack of evidence , she said . it can be difficult to prove " that the suspects actually viewed the pictures and did n't just erase them as they claim , " said vetter . though police have the technical ability to hack into private computers while the user is connected to the internet and view all files on the hard-drive , lawmakers are still deciding legality of this procedure . in the meantime , police will be putting pressure on pedophiles by showing up at their favorite web sites . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bits and bytes to fight child pornography european forensic scientists have developed a state-of-the-art computer program to help track down child victims of sexual exploitation on the internet .

" hemberger 's comments came after motassadeq 's lawyers filed a series of motions to halt the sentencing hearing .
they argued that the hamburg bench was " unconstitutional " and demanded a suspension of the sentencing . however , the judges rejected the challenges and pushed ahead with the hearing , saying they wanted to finish the case monday .
the sentencing court , comprising three hamburg state superior court judges , had convened on friday . marathon legal process the sentencing brings to a close a marathon legal process which has seen motassadeq in and out of german courts for five years .

however , germany has underlined that its oil supplies are safe for now . the german economics ministry on monday insisted that the country 's oil supplies were not threatened by an interruption of flows through the druzhba oil pipeline , which supplies russian oil to germany and poland via belarus .
" i view the closure of the important druzhba pipeline with concern , " economy minister michael glos said . " the current situation is not dramatic for germany , " he said . " there are sufficient reserves of crude oil at the refineries to ensure supplies even if there is a long gap in deliveries . "
glos added , saying he expected deliveries via the pipeline to be fully resumed as quickly as possible . russia stops oil exports to belarus state television in belarus , a former soviet republic , reported on monday that the transit of russian crude oil across belarus to western europe had been halted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at a gas compressor station near nesvizh , southwest of the belarussian capital minsk russia 's pipeline monopoly transneft said on monday it was forced to act because minsk had been illegally siphoning off oil from the druzhba pipeline system . " the belarusian side began taking transit oil as payment in kind for a new duty it had illegally imposed , " transneft vice-president sergei grigoryev told the reuters news agency .
" we therefore reduced transit supplies , equal to the amount being taken .
we then reached the point where we had to stop supplies completely . " belarus and russia , which have traditionally enjoyed close ties , have been locked in a bitter gas pricing row .
at the beginning of the year , belarus slapped a transit tax on russian crude oil which passes through the country in response to a russian decision to impose export duties on crude oil that belarus buys from russia . the row over transit fees came just days after belarus had narrowly averted a threatened cut-off in russian natural gas supplies by agreeing to a demand by russian monopoly gazprom that minsk pay double last year 's price for imported gas . germany says consumers wo n't be affected europe is heavily reliant on russia for its oil and gas and extremely vulnerable to russian supply cuts . about 50 million tons of crude oil pass through the druzhba pipeline each year .
of that , 18 million tons are supplied to poland and 22 million tons to the german refineries of schwedt and mider spergau . german economics minister glos said the development " shows once again that a balanced energy mix is imperative " for secure energy supply " and that one-sided dependencies must not be allowed to develop . " both germany and poland have confirmed that oil supplies to some of their refineries have been disrupted due to the russian interruption of oil exports to belarus . the mwv oil supply federation in hamburg said that " there have been limited pump interruptions on the druzhba pipeline in recent days . " the pipeline supplies the pck schwedt refinery and the mider total refinery near leuna in eastern germany . " the running of the refineries is currently not affected , " mwv said .
" nevertheless , as a precautionary move , alternative routes of supply for crude oil are being drawn up , for example , via the port of rostock . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unusually mild winter means germans wo n't be needing too much oil for heating supplies to consumers were not in jeopardy , mwv insisted .
" there is a crisis system in place to offset any interruption in supply , " it added . a spokeswoman for total , which operates the leuna refinery , said that supplies had stopped overnight .
" but supplies to customers have been safeguarded and the refineries are functioning , " she insisted . the spokeswoman also said the reasons for the stoppage were not yet clear , but insisted that the refineries had sufficient reserves , even if she declined to say how long those reserves might last . " we 're working on an alternative supply if that should become necessary , " she said . eu demands explanation the european union on monday demanded an " urgent and detailed " explanation for the interruption of oil supplies . " i would like to underline that there is no immediate risk of the interruption of the oil supply in the short term , " said ferran tarradellas , the eu executive arm 's spokesman on energy issues . he added that the commission planned to hold a meeting in coming days of the oil supply group , a team of european experts , to consider any measures that may be required . tarradellas said that germany had about 130 days of oil reserves and poland had 70 days worth . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy experts say eu gas supplies safe this winter european union energy experts have said that the eu 's natural gas supplies were assured for this winter , following a deal this week between belarus and russia that averted a gas price war .

authorities have resorted to the courts to get him to move on . it 's kind of like the guest who would n't leave , but this one wears a white collar . a polish catholic clergyman on loan to germany has been suspended from his priestly duties because he refuses to move out of a presbytery and go home , a spokesman for the german archdiocese of trier said monday . the priest had been ordered home to the diocese of lublin in poland after spending six years helping to make up for a shortage of priests in germany .
a german priest took over church services last year , but the pole , 42 , simply stayed on in his residence . in october last year , church authorities began court action to evict him from the catholic church 's house in the small town of schönecken .
the case is to be heard in february .
spokesman stephan kronenburg said it was the first time trier archdiocese had ever withdrawn a priest 's license for refusing to clear out . poland is one of the only european nations with a surplus of catholic priests and regularly lends them to its western neighbors .
in germany , ever fewer people are opting to becoming priests , forcing the country to import them . father karl kneissl , dean of the region , said last year he believed the polish priest did not want to return to the lower salary he would receive in his diocese of lublin , south of warsaw . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bureaucratic bungle ends cleric 's mayoral hopes a catholic priest recently made headlines when he announced he was running for mayor of a german state capital .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 08.01.2007 more jews opt to serve in german military großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 200 jews serve in the bundeswehr even though jews have been mostly exempted from serving in the german military for historical reasons , an increasing number are opting to do so . there are no rabbis in the german military and kosher food is never served .
but that does n't matter to recent young recruits such as norbert kagarlitzkij who said he is pretty relaxed about being jewish - and about serving in the german army . " it is just part of the deal of being a young german , " he said .
" germans have to go to the army for a while or do alternative community service .
so should we . " more than 60 years after the holocaust , it still comes as a surprise to many to hear that german jews serve in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr .
after the war , the central council of jews in germany and the defense ministry made a deal that exempted jews up to the third generation of holocaust victims , from serving in the military .
but these days , there are an estimated 200 jews serving in the 250,000-strong german military .
and many say that number is growing . a matter of duty before the nazis , many jews had served in the german army - in world war i , for example .
the bundeswehr was founded in 1955 .
for decades afterward , most jewish germans would not have dreamed of serving in the military . michael fürst was one of the first to do so even though two of his grandparents were killed by the nazis .
he said he felt it was his duty and should be seen as something normal . " in 1966 , in jewish circles , the bundeswehr was not viewed as a new army but as the heir and successor of the army that took part in killing the jews , " he said .
" i did n't have to join the bundeswehr .
i could have requested an exemption which was always granted to people whose families had been persecuted by the nazi regime . " the so-called normality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many equated the early bundeswehr with the nazis more than 200,000 jews now live in germany .
most of them are recent immigrants from the former soviet union .
many of these immigrants , in particular , seem to have fewer qualms about serving in the german army as do the third and fourth generation of german jews . " there is a lot of talk about so-called normality , " said stephan kramer , secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" that we are talking about this subject is a sign of it .
in fact , many young men and women in the jewish community , especially among immigrant families , seriously consider careers in the armed forces .
obviously , the rules and regulations have to change with the times . " putting one 's foot in it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army is on peacekeeping missions around the world most jews that join the german army say they have n't had a hard time fitting in , either . " they are curious about what it 's like to be a jew , " kagarlizkij said of his non-jewish counterparts .
" most of the people i have met in the bundeswehr had never had anything to do with jews . " rabbi walter homolka , an army reserve officer who advises the armed forces , said that the germany military is almost too afraid of offending jews . " one source of tension is that the bundeswehr is too worried about doing something wrong , " homolka said .
" our task , as jews , is to point out to the army where it should be careful .
but the level of concern needs to be lowered ... the constant fear of putting one 's foot in it . " a democratic army students at berlin 's liberal rabbinical seminary , founded in 1999 , have to do a brief internship with a military .
most go to the us army , but some now choose the bundeswehr and say they are pleased with their choice . " it is a democratic army , an army that is very concerned about its image , about what it does , and what it is , " said konstantin pal , who spent a month with the german navy . he added that few institutions provide such a good opportunity for anyone seeking integration into german society . " in the bundeswehr , the most important thing is camaraderie - not whether you go to church every sunday or to the synagogue on friday evening , " he said .
" what counts is doing your job well . " last november , an association of jewish soldiers was founded .
its aim is to honor the jews who fell in the world war i fighting for germany - and to provide a forum for present-day german jewish soldiers . " it is something new , " said kramer of the central council of jews .
" we welcome the establishment of such an organization in principle - but of course it should not mean that a jewish group within the bundeswehr expects any special privileges .

" both suspects are accused of grievous bodily harm while on duty , " the prosecutors said in a statement , adding that the investigations were continuing . kurnaz alleges abuse in afghanistan , guantanamo kurnaz , born in germany in 1982 , was in the process of becoming a german citizen when he was arrested in pakistan in late 2001 on suspicion of supporting afghanistan 's former taliban rulers .
he was handed over to us authorities , who took him to afghanistan and then to guantanamo bay in cuba where he was held for four years until his release in august 2006 . us investigators claimed that kurnaz , who hails from the northern german city of bremen , was an " enemy combatant " with links to al-qaeda . kurnaz was released in august 2006 because of a lack of proof that he belonged to a terrorist organization . since his return to germany , kurnaz has alleged that he was abused by german soldiers during his detainment in afghanistan .
he has also said he suffered abuse in guantanamo bay including psychological torture and undernourishment . in november , kurnaz described his ordeal at the hands of german soldiers during a meeting with members of the european parliament .

" child pornography on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to search the internet , officers do n't need a warrant additional police specialists would be joining the state 's cyber team to match an increase in internet-related sex crimes , according to a baden-württemberg police spokesperson . some 800 cases involving child pornography passed through the state 's district attorney 's office in stuttgart in 2006 .
that number represents an increase from 690 cases in 2005 and 620 cases in 2004 . the suspects come from all parts of society , achim traichel , director of the five-person internet investigation group , said in an interview with the stuttgarter zeitung .
bankers , doctors , factory workers , and even fellow police officers have all been investigated , he added . the team 's cyber research led to a high-ranking member of stuttgart 's police force , whose computer was found to contain some 1,000 examples of child pornography . though the material was discovered in march 2006 , the police department kept the case under wraps until the press became aware of it in mid-december .
the accused officer faces up to five years in prison , according to the online edition of the stuttgarter nachrichten . police hacking still undecided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyber team has already caught perpetrators from 82 countries few cases of child pornography , however , are easy to prosecute , district attorney spokeswoman bettina vetter told the stuttgarter zeitung .
only one third of all child pornography cases are carried through to a court sentence while many cases are often abandoned for lack of evidence , she said . it can be difficult to prove " that the suspects actually viewed the pictures and did n't just erase them as they claim , " said vetter . though police have the technical ability to hack into private computers while the user is connected to the internet and view all files on the hard-drive , lawmakers are still deciding legality of this procedure . in the meantime , police will be putting pressure on pedophiles by showing up at their favorite web sites . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bits and bytes to fight child pornography european forensic scientists have developed a state-of-the-art computer program to help track down child victims of sexual exploitation on the internet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 08.01.2007 second time around for discount pharmacy chain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : docmorris ' generic drugs can save consumers up to 30 percent docmorris , the dutch discount pharmacy chain , has found a loophole to get around germany 's powerful lobby of pharmacists .
the internet retailer wants to sell its brand through 500 german affiliates . in germany , where drug prices are higher than the rest of europe , certified pharmacists have a virtual monopoly on the sale of over-the-counter and prescription drugs .
so when docmorris , europe 's first mail order pharmacy opened its first affiliate in the western city of saarbrücken last july and sold non-prescription medication at discount prices , competitors forced the state courts to shut it down in september . now , nearly four months later , the dutch internet retailer and pharmacy chain wants to get around the german pharmacy act , which does not permit corporate entities to sell drugs and limits ownership to three branches that must be in close proximity to each other , by paying pharmacy owners licensing fees to sell its products . opening 500 franchises through a legal loophole bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prescription and non-prescription drugs can only be sold in pharmacies on monday , in a second attempt to establish a franchise in the small saarland town of st. wendel , docmorris ' chief executive ralf däinghaus said he is planning to open 500 affiliates throughout germany over the next three years , with the next one scheduled to come in the northern city of bremen . he said pharmacies that choose to join his chain would be able to offer over-the-counter medication for up to 30 percent less than other established brands .
although the dutch chain has paid out 25 million euros -lrb- $ 32.5 million -rrb- in rebates to customers , its pharmaceuticals are still less expensive than those of its competitors . the price of prescription drugs , however , are fixed and will not be subject to the discounts , although däinghaus told the german press that he will push to deregulate that sector as well . pharmacy lobby not impressed " mr. däinghaus is trying out a new business model , but that does not frighten us , " said heinz-günter wolf , president of the german pharmacists association . traditional pharmacists , who have staged protests against reforms that they say threaten their existence , argue that they undergo vigorous professional training that enables them to dispense health advice to patients , whereas discounters who have no medical background pose a health hazard to the public . although paying out licensing fees reduce company profits , däinghaus told the german daily süddeutssche zeitung that he is banking on high volume sales to make up for the wafer-thin margins , adding that pharmacists are " running at us " to join . eu anti-trust law takes precedence over national law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pharmacists are trained to dispense health advice docmorris was incorporated in the netherlands , but the company 's main market is germany , where over 700,000 customers have been able to order both over-the-counter and prescription medication via the internet , telephone and mail order .
more than half of its customers are over the age of 50 and tend to live in metropolitan areas . the service is integrated in the german healthcare system and aimed at patients who have long-term or chronic illnesses , such as rheumatism , diabetes heart disorders and asthma . in his anti-trust battle with the pharmaceutical lobby , däinghaus could eventually have the final arbiter , the european court of justice , on his side .
saarland 's health minister josef hecken , who permitted the first docmorris franchise to open in saarbrücken has said that eu law entitling any european citizen to set up business anywhere in the union " takes precedence over national law .

one aspect is the way a product sounds .
it may be subtle , but it can spell commercial success . when steffen weise , director of research and development at germany 's biggest cookie maker bahlsen , sees one of his firm 's products on a plate , he 's not just thinking about the sweet , buttery taste or the slight hint of orange put into one of the baker 's latest creations .
he 's thinking about mastication . " imagine you see a cookie on a plate and it looks very crunchy , " he said , frowning slightly .
" but when you bite into it you find something very soft and unpleasant . " that , he said , is not what bahlsen or most baked-goods buyers want their cookie experience to be . the hanover-based company , founded in 1891 , has been well known for its leibnitz butter cookies for decades and marketed the product 's powerful crunch in advertisements back in the 1960s .
but more recently , it decided that it wanted to add another dimension to its research and development efforts for new products .
while taste and texture had been the primary considerations , bahlsen , in an attempt to get ahead of competitors , added the auditory element .
it was one of the first food companies to take this new sensory step . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test subjects listen to crunch after cookie crunch bahlsen began testing focus groups on their reactions to the sounds of different cookie recipes .
the company developed elaborate recording systems , microphones that were placed inside testers ' ears to record as accurately as possible the sound the chewer hears while chomping down on a cookie . complicated computer programs were developed that presented individuals with a specific crunch and then asked them to rate it according to emotions it triggered or what kind of image it brought to mind .
then the cookie recipe in development could be tweaked – more butter added to soften the crunch , more sugar to make it harder – until the right crunch at the right duration for the right crowd was found . age makes a difference bahlsen found that younger people wanted a stronger crunch , something crisp , loud and exciting .
for them , that represented youth , risk taking and dynamism . for the older crowd , however , a softer , more delicate auditory experience was usually preferred .
they tended to want their sweets to evoke luxury and richness , so the butter content was increased to provide a sonically calmer event . " older people in general are not very interested in additional noisy or stressful situations , " weise said .
" they want to relax ; they want to enjoy their food .
and they do n't need any action while eating . " subtle messaging for bahlsen and other companies working with sound , it revolves around what they call " implicit coding . "
that is , they want a message to get into the consumer 's head without him or her realizing it .
that message should be positive and basically say , " buy me , and not the other one " when faced with 20 varieties of cookies or 30 brands of beer on the store shelves . " if you have the specific sound you know when you open this bottle you will already be happy before tasting the product itself , " said brigitte schulte-fortkamp , who teaches psychoacoustics at berlin 's technical university .
" it 's not really a conscious process .
you are influenced without knowing it . " while sound design in the food industry is relatively new , other sectors have been using sound engineers in their development teams for some time now .
it runs the gamut from feminine hygiene spray -lrb- which should sound soft and soothing when spraying -rrb- to mosquito repellent -lrb- which should have a little more power behind it , to keep those little monsters at bay -rrb- to electric razors . these days , sound designers are often seen as good cooks , adjusting their sonic recipes so that consumers using a product experience positive emotions , are n't too surprised and feel their needs and desires are being met . cars and corporations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a porsche should n't sound like a vw the most intensively sound designed product is likely the automobile .

but more recently , it decided that it wanted to add another dimension to its research and development efforts for new products .
while taste and texture had been the primary considerations , bahlsen , in an attempt to get ahead of competitors , added the auditory element .
it was one of the first food companies to take this new sensory step . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test subjects listen to crunch after cookie crunch bahlsen began testing focus groups on their reactions to the sounds of different cookie recipes .
the company developed elaborate recording systems , microphones that were placed inside testers ' ears to record as accurately as possible the sound the chewer hears while chomping down on a cookie . complicated computer programs were developed that presented individuals with a specific crunch and then asked them to rate it according to emotions it triggered or what kind of image it brought to mind .
then the cookie recipe in development could be tweaked – more butter added to soften the crunch , more sugar to make it harder – until the right crunch at the right duration for the right crowd was found . age makes a difference bahlsen found that younger people wanted a stronger crunch , something crisp , loud and exciting .
for them , that represented youth , risk taking and dynamism . for the older crowd , however , a softer , more delicate auditory experience was usually preferred .
they tended to want their sweets to evoke luxury and richness , so the butter content was increased to provide a sonically calmer event . " older people in general are not very interested in additional noisy or stressful situations , " weise said .
" they want to relax ; they want to enjoy their food .
and they do n't need any action while eating . " subtle messaging for bahlsen and other companies working with sound , it revolves around what they call " implicit coding . "
that is , they want a message to get into the consumer 's head without him or her realizing it .
that message should be positive and basically say , " buy me , and not the other one " when faced with 20 varieties of cookies or 30 brands of beer on the store shelves . " if you have the specific sound you know when you open this bottle you will already be happy before tasting the product itself , " said brigitte schulte-fortkamp , who teaches psychoacoustics at berlin 's technical university .
" it 's not really a conscious process .
you are influenced without knowing it . " while sound design in the food industry is relatively new , other sectors have been using sound engineers in their development teams for some time now .
it runs the gamut from feminine hygiene spray -lrb- which should sound soft and soothing when spraying -rrb- to mosquito repellent -lrb- which should have a little more power behind it , to keep those little monsters at bay -rrb- to electric razors . these days , sound designers are often seen as good cooks , adjusting their sonic recipes so that consumers using a product experience positive emotions , are n't too surprised and feel their needs and desires are being met . cars and corporations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a porsche should n't sound like a vw the most intensively sound designed product is likely the automobile .
the slam of a car door should sound like a safe closing , and any rattling be kept at a minimum .
a volvo driver will likely want the car 's engine to purr quietly and dependably .
the porsche buyer wants a different sound , one that communicates raw , naked power . corporations are also hiring sound designers to provide jingles and corporate music which tell the public who they are , or would at least like to be perceived as being . an insurance company like allianz wants music that communicates reliability and trust .
the audi car brand needs something that indicates motion and speed , but not recklessness . " we want to interpret the brand in the acoustic way so that people who hear it say : ' oh , that is for me : premium , or that is for me : trust ' , " said carl-frank westermann , who heads up the sound department at the berlin company metadesign and has created jingles for both companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vacuum cleaners will likely stay loud while everything can be sound designed to a certain extent , some sonic engineering has – perhaps counter-intuitively - fallen on its face .
in the past , engineers have created quieter vacuum cleaners that were auditory miles away from the high-decibel whines of most of the today 's makes . but , companies found the quieter vacuums did not sell as well .
in many people 's minds , all that headache-inducing noise equaled superior suction power .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 08.01.2007 second time around for discount pharmacy chain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : docmorris ' generic drugs can save consumers up to 30 percent docmorris , the dutch discount pharmacy chain , has found a loophole to get around germany 's powerful lobby of pharmacists .
the internet retailer wants to sell its brand through 500 german affiliates . in germany , where drug prices are higher than the rest of europe , certified pharmacists have a virtual monopoly on the sale of over-the-counter and prescription drugs .
so when docmorris , europe 's first mail order pharmacy opened its first affiliate in the western city of saarbrücken last july and sold non-prescription medication at discount prices , competitors forced the state courts to shut it down in september . now , nearly four months later , the dutch internet retailer and pharmacy chain wants to get around the german pharmacy act , which does not permit corporate entities to sell drugs and limits ownership to three branches that must be in close proximity to each other , by paying pharmacy owners licensing fees to sell its products . opening 500 franchises through a legal loophole bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prescription and non-prescription drugs can only be sold in pharmacies on monday , in a second attempt to establish a franchise in the small saarland town of st. wendel , docmorris ' chief executive ralf däinghaus said he is planning to open 500 affiliates throughout germany over the next three years , with the next one scheduled to come in the northern city of bremen . he said pharmacies that choose to join his chain would be able to offer over-the-counter medication for up to 30 percent less than other established brands .
although the dutch chain has paid out 25 million euros -lrb- $ 32.5 million -rrb- in rebates to customers , its pharmaceuticals are still less expensive than those of its competitors . the price of prescription drugs , however , are fixed and will not be subject to the discounts , although däinghaus told the german press that he will push to deregulate that sector as well . pharmacy lobby not impressed " mr. däinghaus is trying out a new business model , but that does not frighten us , " said heinz-günter wolf , president of the german pharmacists association . traditional pharmacists , who have staged protests against reforms that they say threaten their existence , argue that they undergo vigorous professional training that enables them to dispense health advice to patients , whereas discounters who have no medical background pose a health hazard to the public . although paying out licensing fees reduce company profits , däinghaus told the german daily süddeutssche zeitung that he is banking on high volume sales to make up for the wafer-thin margins , adding that pharmacists are " running at us " to join . eu anti-trust law takes precedence over national law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pharmacists are trained to dispense health advice docmorris was incorporated in the netherlands , but the company 's main market is germany , where over 700,000 customers have been able to order both over-the-counter and prescription medication via the internet , telephone and mail order .
more than half of its customers are over the age of 50 and tend to live in metropolitan areas . the service is integrated in the german healthcare system and aimed at patients who have long-term or chronic illnesses , such as rheumatism , diabetes heart disorders and asthma . in his anti-trust battle with the pharmaceutical lobby , däinghaus could eventually have the final arbiter , the european court of justice , on his side .
saarland 's health minister josef hecken , who permitted the first docmorris franchise to open in saarbrücken has said that eu law entitling any european citizen to set up business anywhere in the union " takes precedence over national law .

the internet retailer wants to sell its brand through 500 german affiliates . in germany , where drug prices are higher than the rest of europe , certified pharmacists have a virtual monopoly on the sale of over-the-counter and prescription drugs .
so when docmorris , europe 's first mail order pharmacy opened its first affiliate in the western city of saarbrücken last july and sold non-prescription medication at discount prices , competitors forced the state courts to shut it down in september . now , nearly four months later , the dutch internet retailer and pharmacy chain wants to get around the german pharmacy act , which does not permit corporate entities to sell drugs and limits ownership to three branches that must be in close proximity to each other , by paying pharmacy owners licensing fees to sell its products . opening 500 franchises through a legal loophole bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prescription and non-prescription drugs can only be sold in pharmacies on monday , in a second attempt to establish a franchise in the small saarland town of st. wendel , docmorris ' chief executive ralf däinghaus said he is planning to open 500 affiliates throughout germany over the next three years , with the next one scheduled to come in the northern city of bremen . he said pharmacies that choose to join his chain would be able to offer over-the-counter medication for up to 30 percent less than other established brands .
although the dutch chain has paid out 25 million euros -lrb- $ 32.5 million -rrb- in rebates to customers , its pharmaceuticals are still less expensive than those of its competitors . the price of prescription drugs , however , are fixed and will not be subject to the discounts , although däinghaus told the german press that he will push to deregulate that sector as well . pharmacy lobby not impressed " mr. däinghaus is trying out a new business model , but that does not frighten us , " said heinz-günter wolf , president of the german pharmacists association . traditional pharmacists , who have staged protests against reforms that they say threaten their existence , argue that they undergo vigorous professional training that enables them to dispense health advice to patients , whereas discounters who have no medical background pose a health hazard to the public . although paying out licensing fees reduce company profits , däinghaus told the german daily süddeutssche zeitung that he is banking on high volume sales to make up for the wafer-thin margins , adding that pharmacists are " running at us " to join . eu anti-trust law takes precedence over national law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pharmacists are trained to dispense health advice docmorris was incorporated in the netherlands , but the company 's main market is germany , where over 700,000 customers have been able to order both over-the-counter and prescription medication via the internet , telephone and mail order .
more than half of its customers are over the age of 50 and tend to live in metropolitan areas . the service is integrated in the german healthcare system and aimed at patients who have long-term or chronic illnesses , such as rheumatism , diabetes heart disorders and asthma . in his anti-trust battle with the pharmaceutical lobby , däinghaus could eventually have the final arbiter , the european court of justice , on his side .

csu leader and bavarian premier edmund stoiber has been one of the chief opponents of the reform , fearing that wealthy german states such as his own would carry the majority of the financial burden of the planned changes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu leader and bavarian state premier edmund stoiber stoiber , however , signaled his readiness to compromise and said he was confident the draft law would take effect on april 1 as planned .

the spd also put forward an idea to guarantee all-day childcare , paid for by the government , to all children between the agea of one and five . spd to sharpen party profile the policies decided over the weekend were a clear attempt to appeal to the center-left party 's traditional base .
with many supporters complaining that the party has abandoned social principles and that its policies have become indistinct from those of the cdu , senior spd members wanted to sharpen the party 's profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chairman kurt beck spd party chairman kurt beck told the meeting that the party would focus more on ensuring that social welfare was not neglected . " people that are prepared to work have to receive special recognition , but the weak must not be allowed to drop by the wayside , " he said . the social democrats have recently been losing ground in the ratings with support dropping by 1 percent to 30 percent in one of the most recent opinion polls conducted by german public broadcaster ard .
meanwhile the cdu achieved a six-month high of 36 percent in the same survey . liberals to show social side germany 's grand coalition government came under attack at saturday 's meeting of the opposition free democrats in the southwestern german city of stuttgart .
fdp party leader guido westerwelle attacked what he sees as the sluggish pace of economic reform in germany , describing it as " slow motion " politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free democratic party head guido westerwelle westerwelle also painted a more socially oriented picture of the free-market party at the gathering . " our policies of economic reason are far more social than any red flag , whether it 's from the spd , the greens , the ex-communists or even what we 've heard lately from the cdu , " he said . westerwelle also criticized firms for their lack of social responsibility . " it is not acceptable that when company results are made public that the salaries of board members are increased by 30 percent and at the same time thousands of redundancies are announced , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jeg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel says germany must push ahead with reforms in a new year 's speech to be broadcast on german television on sunday , chancellor angela merkel said her government must push forward with further economic reforms in 2007 despite the pain they have inflicted .

but that does n't matter to recent young recruits such as norbert kagarlitzkij who said he is pretty relaxed about being jewish - and about serving in the german army . " it is just part of the deal of being a young german , " he said .
" germans have to go to the army for a while or do alternative community service .
so should we . " more than 60 years after the holocaust , it still comes as a surprise to many to hear that german jews serve in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr .
after the war , the central council of jews in germany and the defense ministry made a deal that exempted jews up to the third generation of holocaust victims , from serving in the military .
but these days , there are an estimated 200 jews serving in the 250,000-strong german military .
and many say that number is growing . a matter of duty before the nazis , many jews had served in the german army - in world war i , for example .
the bundeswehr was founded in 1955 .
for decades afterward , most jewish germans would not have dreamed of serving in the military . michael fürst was one of the first to do so even though two of his grandparents were killed by the nazis .
he said he felt it was his duty and should be seen as something normal . " in 1966 , in jewish circles , the bundeswehr was not viewed as a new army but as the heir and successor of the army that took part in killing the jews , " he said .
" i did n't have to join the bundeswehr .
i could have requested an exemption which was always granted to people whose families had been persecuted by the nazi regime . " the so-called normality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many equated the early bundeswehr with the nazis more than 200,000 jews now live in germany .
most of them are recent immigrants from the former soviet union .
many of these immigrants , in particular , seem to have fewer qualms about serving in the german army as do the third and fourth generation of german jews . " there is a lot of talk about so-called normality , " said stephan kramer , secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" that we are talking about this subject is a sign of it .
in fact , many young men and women in the jewish community , especially among immigrant families , seriously consider careers in the armed forces .
obviously , the rules and regulations have to change with the times . " putting one 's foot in it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army is on peacekeeping missions around the world most jews that join the german army say they have n't had a hard time fitting in , either . " they are curious about what it 's like to be a jew , " kagarlizkij said of his non-jewish counterparts .
" most of the people i have met in the bundeswehr had never had anything to do with jews . " rabbi walter homolka , an army reserve officer who advises the armed forces , said that the germany military is almost too afraid of offending jews . " one source of tension is that the bundeswehr is too worried about doing something wrong , " homolka said .
" our task , as jews , is to point out to the army where it should be careful .
but the level of concern needs to be lowered ... the constant fear of putting one 's foot in it . " a democratic army students at berlin 's liberal rabbinical seminary , founded in 1999 , have to do a brief internship with a military .
most go to the us army , but some now choose the bundeswehr and say they are pleased with their choice . " it is a democratic army , an army that is very concerned about its image , about what it does , and what it is , " said konstantin pal , who spent a month with the german navy . he added that few institutions provide such a good opportunity for anyone seeking integration into german society . " in the bundeswehr , the most important thing is camaraderie - not whether you go to church every sunday or to the synagogue on friday evening , " he said .
" what counts is doing your job well . " last november , an association of jewish soldiers was founded .
its aim is to honor the jews who fell in the world war i fighting for germany - and to provide a forum for present-day german jewish soldiers . " it is something new , " said kramer of the central council of jews .
" we welcome the establishment of such an organization in principle - but of course it should not mean that a jewish group within the bundeswehr expects any special privileges .

one aspect is the way a product sounds .
it may be subtle , but it can spell commercial success . when steffen weise , director of research and development at germany 's biggest cookie maker bahlsen , sees one of his firm 's products on a plate , he 's not just thinking about the sweet , buttery taste or the slight hint of orange put into one of the baker 's latest creations .
he 's thinking about mastication . " imagine you see a cookie on a plate and it looks very crunchy , " he said , frowning slightly .
" but when you bite into it you find something very soft and unpleasant . " that , he said , is not what bahlsen or most baked-goods buyers want their cookie experience to be . the hanover-based company , founded in 1891 , has been well known for its leibnitz butter cookies for decades and marketed the product 's powerful crunch in advertisements back in the 1960s .
but more recently , it decided that it wanted to add another dimension to its research and development efforts for new products .
while taste and texture had been the primary considerations , bahlsen , in an attempt to get ahead of competitors , added the auditory element .
it was one of the first food companies to take this new sensory step . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test subjects listen to crunch after cookie crunch bahlsen began testing focus groups on their reactions to the sounds of different cookie recipes .
the company developed elaborate recording systems , microphones that were placed inside testers ' ears to record as accurately as possible the sound the chewer hears while chomping down on a cookie . complicated computer programs were developed that presented individuals with a specific crunch and then asked them to rate it according to emotions it triggered or what kind of image it brought to mind .
then the cookie recipe in development could be tweaked – more butter added to soften the crunch , more sugar to make it harder – until the right crunch at the right duration for the right crowd was found . age makes a difference bahlsen found that younger people wanted a stronger crunch , something crisp , loud and exciting .
for them , that represented youth , risk taking and dynamism . for the older crowd , however , a softer , more delicate auditory experience was usually preferred .
they tended to want their sweets to evoke luxury and richness , so the butter content was increased to provide a sonically calmer event . " older people in general are not very interested in additional noisy or stressful situations , " weise said .
" they want to relax ; they want to enjoy their food .
and they do n't need any action while eating . " subtle messaging for bahlsen and other companies working with sound , it revolves around what they call " implicit coding . "
that is , they want a message to get into the consumer 's head without him or her realizing it .
that message should be positive and basically say , " buy me , and not the other one " when faced with 20 varieties of cookies or 30 brands of beer on the store shelves . " if you have the specific sound you know when you open this bottle you will already be happy before tasting the product itself , " said brigitte schulte-fortkamp , who teaches psychoacoustics at berlin 's technical university .
" it 's not really a conscious process .
you are influenced without knowing it . " while sound design in the food industry is relatively new , other sectors have been using sound engineers in their development teams for some time now .
it runs the gamut from feminine hygiene spray -lrb- which should sound soft and soothing when spraying -rrb- to mosquito repellent -lrb- which should have a little more power behind it , to keep those little monsters at bay -rrb- to electric razors . these days , sound designers are often seen as good cooks , adjusting their sonic recipes so that consumers using a product experience positive emotions , are n't too surprised and feel their needs and desires are being met . cars and corporations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a porsche should n't sound like a vw the most intensively sound designed product is likely the automobile .
the slam of a car door should sound like a safe closing , and any rattling be kept at a minimum .
a volvo driver will likely want the car 's engine to purr quietly and dependably .
the porsche buyer wants a different sound , one that communicates raw , naked power . corporations are also hiring sound designers to provide jingles and corporate music which tell the public who they are , or would at least like to be perceived as being . an insurance company like allianz wants music that communicates reliability and trust .
the audi car brand needs something that indicates motion and speed , but not recklessness . " we want to interpret the brand in the acoustic way so that people who hear it say : ' oh , that is for me : premium , or that is for me : trust ' , " said carl-frank westermann , who heads up the sound department at the berlin company metadesign and has created jingles for both companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vacuum cleaners will likely stay loud while everything can be sound designed to a certain extent , some sonic engineering has – perhaps counter-intuitively - fallen on its face .
in the past , engineers have created quieter vacuum cleaners that were auditory miles away from the high-decibel whines of most of the today 's makes . but , companies found the quieter vacuums did not sell as well .
in many people 's minds , all that headache-inducing noise equaled superior suction power .

one aspect is the way a product sounds .
it may be subtle , but it can spell commercial success . when steffen weise , director of research and development at germany 's biggest cookie maker bahlsen , sees one of his firm 's products on a plate , he 's not just thinking about the sweet , buttery taste or the slight hint of orange put into one of the baker 's latest creations .
he 's thinking about mastication . " imagine you see a cookie on a plate and it looks very crunchy , " he said , frowning slightly .
" but when you bite into it you find something very soft and unpleasant . " that , he said , is not what bahlsen or most baked-goods buyers want their cookie experience to be . the hanover-based company , founded in 1891 , has been well known for its leibnitz butter cookies for decades and marketed the product 's powerful crunch in advertisements back in the 1960s .
but more recently , it decided that it wanted to add another dimension to its research and development efforts for new products .
while taste and texture had been the primary considerations , bahlsen , in an attempt to get ahead of competitors , added the auditory element .
it was one of the first food companies to take this new sensory step . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test subjects listen to crunch after cookie crunch bahlsen began testing focus groups on their reactions to the sounds of different cookie recipes .
the company developed elaborate recording systems , microphones that were placed inside testers ' ears to record as accurately as possible the sound the chewer hears while chomping down on a cookie . complicated computer programs were developed that presented individuals with a specific crunch and then asked them to rate it according to emotions it triggered or what kind of image it brought to mind .
then the cookie recipe in development could be tweaked – more butter added to soften the crunch , more sugar to make it harder – until the right crunch at the right duration for the right crowd was found . age makes a difference bahlsen found that younger people wanted a stronger crunch , something crisp , loud and exciting .
for them , that represented youth , risk taking and dynamism . for the older crowd , however , a softer , more delicate auditory experience was usually preferred .
they tended to want their sweets to evoke luxury and richness , so the butter content was increased to provide a sonically calmer event . " older people in general are not very interested in additional noisy or stressful situations , " weise said .
" they want to relax ; they want to enjoy their food .
and they do n't need any action while eating . " subtle messaging for bahlsen and other companies working with sound , it revolves around what they call " implicit coding . "
that is , they want a message to get into the consumer 's head without him or her realizing it .
that message should be positive and basically say , " buy me , and not the other one " when faced with 20 varieties of cookies or 30 brands of beer on the store shelves . " if you have the specific sound you know when you open this bottle you will already be happy before tasting the product itself , " said brigitte schulte-fortkamp , who teaches psychoacoustics at berlin 's technical university .
" it 's not really a conscious process .
you are influenced without knowing it . " while sound design in the food industry is relatively new , other sectors have been using sound engineers in their development teams for some time now .
it runs the gamut from feminine hygiene spray -lrb- which should sound soft and soothing when spraying -rrb- to mosquito repellent -lrb- which should have a little more power behind it , to keep those little monsters at bay -rrb- to electric razors . these days , sound designers are often seen as good cooks , adjusting their sonic recipes so that consumers using a product experience positive emotions , are n't too surprised and feel their needs and desires are being met . cars and corporations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a porsche should n't sound like a vw the most intensively sound designed product is likely the automobile .
the slam of a car door should sound like a safe closing , and any rattling be kept at a minimum .
a volvo driver will likely want the car 's engine to purr quietly and dependably .
the porsche buyer wants a different sound , one that communicates raw , naked power . corporations are also hiring sound designers to provide jingles and corporate music which tell the public who they are , or would at least like to be perceived as being . an insurance company like allianz wants music that communicates reliability and trust .
the audi car brand needs something that indicates motion and speed , but not recklessness . " we want to interpret the brand in the acoustic way so that people who hear it say : ' oh , that is for me : premium , or that is for me : trust ' , " said carl-frank westermann , who heads up the sound department at the berlin company metadesign and has created jingles for both companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vacuum cleaners will likely stay loud while everything can be sound designed to a certain extent , some sonic engineering has – perhaps counter-intuitively - fallen on its face .
in the past , engineers have created quieter vacuum cleaners that were auditory miles away from the high-decibel whines of most of the today 's makes . but , companies found the quieter vacuums did not sell as well .
in many people 's minds , all that headache-inducing noise equaled superior suction power .
the vacuums soon got their screams back . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de purr , squawk , chirp - animals speak out at berlin archive ever wonder what a mole has to say ?

11 hijackers to 15 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sentence brings to an end a marathon legal process spanning five years a court in hamburg on monday sentenced mounir el motassadeq , a moroccan friend of the sept .
11 , 2001 hijackers who is convicted for being an accessory to mass murder , to 15 years in prison . a hamburg court on monday handed mounir el motassadeq the maximum 15-year sentence for his role in aiding the hijackers who killed nearly 3,000 people in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 . prosecutor walter hemberger said monday that motassadeq , who was friendly with three of the suicide attackers when they were students in the northern german city of hamburg , deserved the toughest sentence possible under german law because he had committed " an immense wrong . " hemberger 's comments came after motassadeq 's lawyers filed a series of motions to halt the sentencing hearing .
they argued that the hamburg bench was " unconstitutional " and demanded a suspension of the sentencing . however , the judges rejected the challenges and pushed ahead with the hearing , saying they wanted to finish the case monday .
the sentencing court , comprising three hamburg state superior court judges , had convened on friday . marathon legal process the sentencing brings to a close a marathon legal process which has seen motassadeq in and out of german courts for five years .
the bearded 32-year-old moroccan was arrested a few months after the sept 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington that killed nearly 3,000 people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german leaders commemorate sept .
11 victims on the fifth anniversary of the attacks in 2003 , he became the first person ever to be convicted for a role in the attacks .
he was then sentenced to 15 years in prison for being an accessory to mass murder . but the german federal court in karlsruhe , in southwestern germany , overturned that verdict on the grounds that us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al qaeda suspects held in us custody .
it ordered a retrial in hamburg . in 2005 , motassadeq was given a seven-year prison sentence for the lesser crime of belonging to a terrorist organisation but was cleared of abetting mass murder .
the judges found there was no evidence to show that motassadeq had been directly involved in planning the sept .
11 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon . but he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of the hamburg-based terror cell which included the presumed ringleader mohammed atta - while the future hijackers were pursuing flight training in the united states - and to have helped cover up their tracks . motassadeq says he 's innocent that verdict was scrapped in november last year , when the karlsruhe court found that motassadeq had " facilitated and supported the attacks " and sent him for sentencing .
prosecutors successfully argued that under a " division of labor " within the group , motassadeq ran the financial affairs of other cell members and covered up their absences from germany before the attacks . motassadeq 's lawyers however maintain he was a low-tier member of the group and that he knew nothing about the plot to fly planes into targets in new york and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq with his lawyer in 2004 last friday , motassadeq vehemently protested his innocence , telling the court : " i swear before god that i did not know that they were in america .
i swear before god that i did not know what they were planning . " german authorities have indicated that they will deport motassadeq to morocco once he has served his sentence . motassadeq 's case and the perceived failure of german courts to successfully prosecute him have strained berlin 's ties with washington in recent years . motassadeq is only the second man to be convicted of a role in the sept .

that number represents an increase from 690 cases in 2005 and 620 cases in 2004 . the suspects come from all parts of society , achim traichel , director of the five-person internet investigation group , said in an interview with the stuttgarter zeitung .
bankers , doctors , factory workers , and even fellow police officers have all been investigated , he added . the team 's cyber research led to a high-ranking member of stuttgart 's police force , whose computer was found to contain some 1,000 examples of child pornography . though the material was discovered in march 2006 , the police department kept the case under wraps until the press became aware of it in mid-december .
the accused officer faces up to five years in prison , according to the online edition of the stuttgarter nachrichten . police hacking still undecided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyber team has already caught perpetrators from 82 countries few cases of child pornography , however , are easy to prosecute , district attorney spokeswoman bettina vetter told the stuttgarter zeitung .
only one third of all child pornography cases are carried through to a court sentence while many cases are often abandoned for lack of evidence , she said . it can be difficult to prove " that the suspects actually viewed the pictures and did n't just erase them as they claim , " said vetter . though police have the technical ability to hack into private computers while the user is connected to the internet and view all files on the hard-drive , lawmakers are still deciding legality of this procedure . in the meantime , police will be putting pressure on pedophiles by showing up at their favorite web sites . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bits and bytes to fight child pornography european forensic scientists have developed a state-of-the-art computer program to help track down child victims of sexual exploitation on the internet .

" we are pursuing our own path .

now , with higher fuel prices hitting us drivers ' wallets and traffic gridlock commonplace , daimlerchrysler expects sales of the vehicle to take off . company officials point to the smart 's relative success in canada , where the brand was expected to sell 1,500 units in its first year but ended up moving more than 4,000 . while total us auto sales are expected to drop to 16.2 million in 2007 , german automakers are still aiming to break the one-million mark this year , said vda 's gottschalk . dpa / afp / dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers expect record 2006 us sales german carmakers are projecting record sales of 900,000 vehicles for 2006 - a year that marked steady setbacks for us producers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 08.01.2007 more jews opt to serve in german military großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 200 jews serve in the bundeswehr even though jews have been mostly exempted from serving in the german military for historical reasons , an increasing number are opting to do so . there are no rabbis in the german military and kosher food is never served .
but that does n't matter to recent young recruits such as norbert kagarlitzkij who said he is pretty relaxed about being jewish - and about serving in the german army . " it is just part of the deal of being a young german , " he said .
" germans have to go to the army for a while or do alternative community service .
so should we . " more than 60 years after the holocaust , it still comes as a surprise to many to hear that german jews serve in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr .
after the war , the central council of jews in germany and the defense ministry made a deal that exempted jews up to the third generation of holocaust victims , from serving in the military .
but these days , there are an estimated 200 jews serving in the 250,000-strong german military .
and many say that number is growing . a matter of duty before the nazis , many jews had served in the german army - in world war i , for example .
the bundeswehr was founded in 1955 .
for decades afterward , most jewish germans would not have dreamed of serving in the military . michael fürst was one of the first to do so even though two of his grandparents were killed by the nazis .
he said he felt it was his duty and should be seen as something normal . " in 1966 , in jewish circles , the bundeswehr was not viewed as a new army but as the heir and successor of the army that took part in killing the jews , " he said .
" i did n't have to join the bundeswehr .
i could have requested an exemption which was always granted to people whose families had been persecuted by the nazi regime . " the so-called normality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many equated the early bundeswehr with the nazis more than 200,000 jews now live in germany .
most of them are recent immigrants from the former soviet union .
many of these immigrants , in particular , seem to have fewer qualms about serving in the german army as do the third and fourth generation of german jews . " there is a lot of talk about so-called normality , " said stephan kramer , secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" that we are talking about this subject is a sign of it .
in fact , many young men and women in the jewish community , especially among immigrant families , seriously consider careers in the armed forces .
obviously , the rules and regulations have to change with the times . " putting one 's foot in it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army is on peacekeeping missions around the world most jews that join the german army say they have n't had a hard time fitting in , either . " they are curious about what it 's like to be a jew , " kagarlizkij said of his non-jewish counterparts .
" most of the people i have met in the bundeswehr had never had anything to do with jews . " rabbi walter homolka , an army reserve officer who advises the armed forces , said that the germany military is almost too afraid of offending jews . " one source of tension is that the bundeswehr is too worried about doing something wrong , " homolka said .
" our task , as jews , is to point out to the army where it should be careful .
but the level of concern needs to be lowered ... the constant fear of putting one 's foot in it . " a democratic army students at berlin 's liberal rabbinical seminary , founded in 1999 , have to do a brief internship with a military .
most go to the us army , but some now choose the bundeswehr and say they are pleased with their choice . " it is a democratic army , an army that is very concerned about its image , about what it does , and what it is , " said konstantin pal , who spent a month with the german navy . he added that few institutions provide such a good opportunity for anyone seeking integration into german society . " in the bundeswehr , the most important thing is camaraderie - not whether you go to church every sunday or to the synagogue on friday evening , " he said .
" what counts is doing your job well . " last november , an association of jewish soldiers was founded .
its aim is to honor the jews who fell in the world war i fighting for germany - and to provide a forum for present-day german jewish soldiers . " it is something new , " said kramer of the central council of jews .
" we welcome the establishment of such an organization in principle - but of course it should not mean that a jewish group within the bundeswehr expects any special privileges .

' the goal can only be to make life as difficult as possible for the japanese , " gottschalk said at a news conference for the motor show which will be open to the public until january 21 .
" we are pursuing our own path . " german automakers are gambling that high oil prices , a growing environmental awareness in the us and new government rules promoting low-sulphur diesel fuel will aid their marketing push . flagging what is likely to be a major part of the campaign , gottschalk said a compact car using turbo diesel technology proved more fuel-efficient than a hybrid in a recent test drive in germany . diesel cars are highly popular in europe , since diesel is taxed significantly less than gasoline .
but in the us , diesel is dogged with a reputation as a dirtier , lower-performing fuel . demand for smaller vehicles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smart car is so tiny that the two-seater can be parked sideways smaller fuel efficient cars , notably the mercedes division 's " smart for two " have been drawing curious crowds at the show . the tiny car has become a familiar sight on europe 's congested roads since it was launched in 1998 , although the project has yet to make a profit . but in the united states , where gas-guzzling trucks and tank-sized sport utility vehicles -lrb- suvs -rrb- are popular , the notion that the two-seater could be a hit was dismissed until just recently . " that 's not the attitude people are showing today .
the smart is simply cool , " said daimlerchrysler chairman dieter zetsche , who insisted that north american drivers were ready for the vehicle . more than 770,000 europeans chose the first generation of the smart vehicles , which are ideal for driving on european cities ' smaller streets . fuel prices in us hurting gas-guzzlers " i think the simple equation that the larger the car the better does n't apply that much to the us market any more either , " added zetsche .
now , with higher fuel prices hitting us drivers ' wallets and traffic gridlock commonplace , daimlerchrysler expects sales of the vehicle to take off . company officials point to the smart 's relative success in canada , where the brand was expected to sell 1,500 units in its first year but ended up moving more than 4,000 . while total us auto sales are expected to drop to 16.2 million in 2007 , german automakers are still aiming to break the one-million mark this year , said vda 's gottschalk . dpa / afp / dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers expect record 2006 us sales german carmakers are projecting record sales of 900,000 vehicles for 2006 - a year that marked steady setbacks for us producers .
but with economic growth slacking off in the us , the outlook for 2007 is n't as rosy .

authorities have resorted to the courts to get him to move on . it 's kind of like the guest who would n't leave , but this one wears a white collar . a polish catholic clergyman on loan to germany has been suspended from his priestly duties because he refuses to move out of a presbytery and go home , a spokesman for the german archdiocese of trier said monday . the priest had been ordered home to the diocese of lublin in poland after spending six years helping to make up for a shortage of priests in germany .
a german priest took over church services last year , but the pole , 42 , simply stayed on in his residence . in october last year , church authorities began court action to evict him from the catholic church 's house in the small town of schönecken .
the case is to be heard in february .
spokesman stephan kronenburg said it was the first time trier archdiocese had ever withdrawn a priest 's license for refusing to clear out . poland is one of the only european nations with a surplus of catholic priests and regularly lends them to its western neighbors .
in germany , ever fewer people are opting to becoming priests , forcing the country to import them . father karl kneissl , dean of the region , said last year he believed the polish priest did not want to return to the lower salary he would receive in his diocese of lublin , south of warsaw . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bureaucratic bungle ends cleric 's mayoral hopes a catholic priest recently made headlines when he announced he was running for mayor of a german state capital .

it ordered a retrial in hamburg . in 2005 , motassadeq was given a seven-year prison sentence for the lesser crime of belonging to a terrorist organisation but was cleared of abetting mass murder .
the judges found there was no evidence to show that motassadeq had been directly involved in planning the sept .
11 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon . but he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of the hamburg-based terror cell which included the presumed ringleader mohammed atta - while the future hijackers were pursuing flight training in the united states - and to have helped cover up their tracks . motassadeq says he 's innocent that verdict was scrapped in november last year , when the karlsruhe court found that motassadeq had " facilitated and supported the attacks " and sent him for sentencing .
prosecutors successfully argued that under a " division of labor " within the group , motassadeq ran the financial affairs of other cell members and covered up their absences from germany before the attacks . motassadeq 's lawyers however maintain he was a low-tier member of the group and that he knew nothing about the plot to fly planes into targets in new york and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq with his lawyer in 2004 last friday , motassadeq vehemently protested his innocence , telling the court : " i swear before god that i did not know that they were in america .
i swear before god that i did not know what they were planning . " german authorities have indicated that they will deport motassadeq to morocco once he has served his sentence . motassadeq 's case and the perceived failure of german courts to successfully prosecute him have strained berlin 's ties with washington in recent years . motassadeq is only the second man to be convicted of a role in the sept .

only 14 of those pictured were actually ksk stationed in kandahar . prosecutors said they were investigating the soldier on charges of inflicting bodily harm as well as a fellow ksk member who was on duty with him . " both suspects are accused of grievous bodily harm while on duty , " the prosecutors said in a statement , adding that the investigations were continuing . kurnaz alleges abuse in afghanistan , guantanamo kurnaz , born in germany in 1982 , was in the process of becoming a german citizen when he was arrested in pakistan in late 2001 on suspicion of supporting afghanistan 's former taliban rulers .
he was handed over to us authorities , who took him to afghanistan and then to guantanamo bay in cuba where he was held for four years until his release in august 2006 . us investigators claimed that kurnaz , who hails from the northern german city of bremen , was an " enemy combatant " with links to al-qaeda . kurnaz was released in august 2006 because of a lack of proof that he belonged to a terrorist organization . since his return to germany , kurnaz has alleged that he was abused by german soldiers during his detainment in afghanistan .
he has also said he suffered abuse in guantanamo bay including psychological torture and undernourishment . in november , kurnaz described his ordeal at the hands of german soldiers during a meeting with members of the european parliament . " they asked me if i knew who they were and then they said , ' we are the ksk , " ' he told european mps , adding that the men had german flags on their uniforms and spoke german with him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an earlier photo of murat kurnaz dating back to before his ordeal in afghanistan " i thought they would have some questions and that they could help me , but they told me i had chosen the wrong side , " kurnaz said . kurnaz 's lawyer has said the us authorities never issued an arrest warrant for kurnaz and no legal proceedings were ever started against him . embarrassing case for germany the case is an embarrassment for germany , which also faces allegations that the previous government secretly aided a us program to kidnap and fly terrorists to third countries for interrogation . the german defense ministry has repeatedly denied kurnaz 's allegations that he was abused by german soldiers in kandahar . the kurnaz case is also being investigated by a parliamentary committee , which is currently studying whether german security agencies breached any german rules while assisting post-2001 , us anti-terrorism operations . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany split over plane deployment to afghanistan germany 's government is split over whether the decision to send spy planes to afghanistan , which could see german troops deployed in the volatile south , needs parliamentary approval .

the internet retailer wants to sell its brand through 500 german affiliates . in germany , where drug prices are higher than the rest of europe , certified pharmacists have a virtual monopoly on the sale of over-the-counter and prescription drugs .
so when docmorris , europe 's first mail order pharmacy opened its first affiliate in the western city of saarbrücken last july and sold non-prescription medication at discount prices , competitors forced the state courts to shut it down in september . now , nearly four months later , the dutch internet retailer and pharmacy chain wants to get around the german pharmacy act , which does not permit corporate entities to sell drugs and limits ownership to three branches that must be in close proximity to each other , by paying pharmacy owners licensing fees to sell its products . opening 500 franchises through a legal loophole bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prescription and non-prescription drugs can only be sold in pharmacies on monday , in a second attempt to establish a franchise in the small saarland town of st. wendel , docmorris ' chief executive ralf däinghaus said he is planning to open 500 affiliates throughout germany over the next three years , with the next one scheduled to come in the northern city of bremen . he said pharmacies that choose to join his chain would be able to offer over-the-counter medication for up to 30 percent less than other established brands .
although the dutch chain has paid out 25 million euros -lrb- $ 32.5 million -rrb- in rebates to customers , its pharmaceuticals are still less expensive than those of its competitors . the price of prescription drugs , however , are fixed and will not be subject to the discounts , although däinghaus told the german press that he will push to deregulate that sector as well . pharmacy lobby not impressed " mr. däinghaus is trying out a new business model , but that does not frighten us , " said heinz-günter wolf , president of the german pharmacists association . traditional pharmacists , who have staged protests against reforms that they say threaten their existence , argue that they undergo vigorous professional training that enables them to dispense health advice to patients , whereas discounters who have no medical background pose a health hazard to the public . although paying out licensing fees reduce company profits , däinghaus told the german daily süddeutssche zeitung that he is banking on high volume sales to make up for the wafer-thin margins , adding that pharmacists are " running at us " to join . eu anti-trust law takes precedence over national law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pharmacists are trained to dispense health advice docmorris was incorporated in the netherlands , but the company 's main market is germany , where over 700,000 customers have been able to order both over-the-counter and prescription medication via the internet , telephone and mail order .

but that does n't matter to recent young recruits such as norbert kagarlitzkij who said he is pretty relaxed about being jewish - and about serving in the german army . " it is just part of the deal of being a young german , " he said .
" germans have to go to the army for a while or do alternative community service .
so should we . " more than 60 years after the holocaust , it still comes as a surprise to many to hear that german jews serve in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr .
after the war , the central council of jews in germany and the defense ministry made a deal that exempted jews up to the third generation of holocaust victims , from serving in the military .
but these days , there are an estimated 200 jews serving in the 250,000-strong german military .
and many say that number is growing . a matter of duty before the nazis , many jews had served in the german army - in world war i , for example .
the bundeswehr was founded in 1955 .
for decades afterward , most jewish germans would not have dreamed of serving in the military . michael fürst was one of the first to do so even though two of his grandparents were killed by the nazis .
he said he felt it was his duty and should be seen as something normal . " in 1966 , in jewish circles , the bundeswehr was not viewed as a new army but as the heir and successor of the army that took part in killing the jews , " he said .
" i did n't have to join the bundeswehr .
i could have requested an exemption which was always granted to people whose families had been persecuted by the nazi regime . " the so-called normality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many equated the early bundeswehr with the nazis more than 200,000 jews now live in germany .
most of them are recent immigrants from the former soviet union .
many of these immigrants , in particular , seem to have fewer qualms about serving in the german army as do the third and fourth generation of german jews . " there is a lot of talk about so-called normality , " said stephan kramer , secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" that we are talking about this subject is a sign of it .
in fact , many young men and women in the jewish community , especially among immigrant families , seriously consider careers in the armed forces .
obviously , the rules and regulations have to change with the times . " putting one 's foot in it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army is on peacekeeping missions around the world most jews that join the german army say they have n't had a hard time fitting in , either . " they are curious about what it 's like to be a jew , " kagarlizkij said of his non-jewish counterparts .
" most of the people i have met in the bundeswehr had never had anything to do with jews . " rabbi walter homolka , an army reserve officer who advises the armed forces , said that the germany military is almost too afraid of offending jews . " one source of tension is that the bundeswehr is too worried about doing something wrong , " homolka said .
" our task , as jews , is to point out to the army where it should be careful .
but the level of concern needs to be lowered ... the constant fear of putting one 's foot in it . " a democratic army students at berlin 's liberal rabbinical seminary , founded in 1999 , have to do a brief internship with a military .
most go to the us army , but some now choose the bundeswehr and say they are pleased with their choice . " it is a democratic army , an army that is very concerned about its image , about what it does , and what it is , " said konstantin pal , who spent a month with the german navy . he added that few institutions provide such a good opportunity for anyone seeking integration into german society . " in the bundeswehr , the most important thing is camaraderie - not whether you go to church every sunday or to the synagogue on friday evening , " he said .
" what counts is doing your job well . " last november , an association of jewish soldiers was founded .
its aim is to honor the jews who fell in the world war i fighting for germany - and to provide a forum for present-day german jewish soldiers . " it is something new , " said kramer of the central council of jews .
" we welcome the establishment of such an organization in principle - but of course it should not mean that a jewish group within the bundeswehr expects any special privileges .

but that does n't matter to recent young recruits such as norbert kagarlitzkij who said he is pretty relaxed about being jewish - and about serving in the german army . " it is just part of the deal of being a young german , " he said .
" germans have to go to the army for a while or do alternative community service .
so should we . " more than 60 years after the holocaust , it still comes as a surprise to many to hear that german jews serve in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr .
after the war , the central council of jews in germany and the defense ministry made a deal that exempted jews up to the third generation of holocaust victims , from serving in the military .
but these days , there are an estimated 200 jews serving in the 250,000-strong german military .
and many say that number is growing . a matter of duty before the nazis , many jews had served in the german army - in world war i , for example .
the bundeswehr was founded in 1955 .
for decades afterward , most jewish germans would not have dreamed of serving in the military . michael fürst was one of the first to do so even though two of his grandparents were killed by the nazis .
he said he felt it was his duty and should be seen as something normal . " in 1966 , in jewish circles , the bundeswehr was not viewed as a new army but as the heir and successor of the army that took part in killing the jews , " he said .
" i did n't have to join the bundeswehr .
i could have requested an exemption which was always granted to people whose families had been persecuted by the nazi regime . " the so-called normality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many equated the early bundeswehr with the nazis more than 200,000 jews now live in germany .
most of them are recent immigrants from the former soviet union .
many of these immigrants , in particular , seem to have fewer qualms about serving in the german army as do the third and fourth generation of german jews . " there is a lot of talk about so-called normality , " said stephan kramer , secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" that we are talking about this subject is a sign of it .
in fact , many young men and women in the jewish community , especially among immigrant families , seriously consider careers in the armed forces .
obviously , the rules and regulations have to change with the times . " putting one 's foot in it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army is on peacekeeping missions around the world most jews that join the german army say they have n't had a hard time fitting in , either . " they are curious about what it 's like to be a jew , " kagarlizkij said of his non-jewish counterparts .
" most of the people i have met in the bundeswehr had never had anything to do with jews . " rabbi walter homolka , an army reserve officer who advises the armed forces , said that the germany military is almost too afraid of offending jews . " one source of tension is that the bundeswehr is too worried about doing something wrong , " homolka said .
" our task , as jews , is to point out to the army where it should be careful .
but the level of concern needs to be lowered ... the constant fear of putting one 's foot in it . " a democratic army students at berlin 's liberal rabbinical seminary , founded in 1999 , have to do a brief internship with a military .
most go to the us army , but some now choose the bundeswehr and say they are pleased with their choice . " it is a democratic army , an army that is very concerned about its image , about what it does , and what it is , " said konstantin pal , who spent a month with the german navy . he added that few institutions provide such a good opportunity for anyone seeking integration into german society . " in the bundeswehr , the most important thing is camaraderie - not whether you go to church every sunday or to the synagogue on friday evening , " he said .
" what counts is doing your job well . " last november , an association of jewish soldiers was founded .
its aim is to honor the jews who fell in the world war i fighting for germany - and to provide a forum for present-day german jewish soldiers . " it is something new , " said kramer of the central council of jews .
" we welcome the establishment of such an organization in principle - but of course it should not mean that a jewish group within the bundeswehr expects any special privileges .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 08.01.2007 second time around for discount pharmacy chain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : docmorris ' generic drugs can save consumers up to 30 percent docmorris , the dutch discount pharmacy chain , has found a loophole to get around germany 's powerful lobby of pharmacists .
the internet retailer wants to sell its brand through 500 german affiliates . in germany , where drug prices are higher than the rest of europe , certified pharmacists have a virtual monopoly on the sale of over-the-counter and prescription drugs .
so when docmorris , europe 's first mail order pharmacy opened its first affiliate in the western city of saarbrücken last july and sold non-prescription medication at discount prices , competitors forced the state courts to shut it down in september . now , nearly four months later , the dutch internet retailer and pharmacy chain wants to get around the german pharmacy act , which does not permit corporate entities to sell drugs and limits ownership to three branches that must be in close proximity to each other , by paying pharmacy owners licensing fees to sell its products . opening 500 franchises through a legal loophole bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prescription and non-prescription drugs can only be sold in pharmacies on monday , in a second attempt to establish a franchise in the small saarland town of st. wendel , docmorris ' chief executive ralf däinghaus said he is planning to open 500 affiliates throughout germany over the next three years , with the next one scheduled to come in the northern city of bremen . he said pharmacies that choose to join his chain would be able to offer over-the-counter medication for up to 30 percent less than other established brands .
although the dutch chain has paid out 25 million euros -lrb- $ 32.5 million -rrb- in rebates to customers , its pharmaceuticals are still less expensive than those of its competitors . the price of prescription drugs , however , are fixed and will not be subject to the discounts , although däinghaus told the german press that he will push to deregulate that sector as well . pharmacy lobby not impressed " mr. däinghaus is trying out a new business model , but that does not frighten us , " said heinz-günter wolf , president of the german pharmacists association . traditional pharmacists , who have staged protests against reforms that they say threaten their existence , argue that they undergo vigorous professional training that enables them to dispense health advice to patients , whereas discounters who have no medical background pose a health hazard to the public . although paying out licensing fees reduce company profits , däinghaus told the german daily süddeutssche zeitung that he is banking on high volume sales to make up for the wafer-thin margins , adding that pharmacists are " running at us " to join . eu anti-trust law takes precedence over national law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pharmacists are trained to dispense health advice docmorris was incorporated in the netherlands , but the company 's main market is germany , where over 700,000 customers have been able to order both over-the-counter and prescription medication via the internet , telephone and mail order .
more than half of its customers are over the age of 50 and tend to live in metropolitan areas . the service is integrated in the german healthcare system and aimed at patients who have long-term or chronic illnesses , such as rheumatism , diabetes heart disorders and asthma . in his anti-trust battle with the pharmaceutical lobby , däinghaus could eventually have the final arbiter , the european court of justice , on his side .
saarland 's health minister josef hecken , who permitted the first docmorris franchise to open in saarbrücken has said that eu law entitling any european citizen to set up business anywhere in the union " takes precedence over national law .

however , germany has underlined that its oil supplies are safe for now . the german economics ministry on monday insisted that the country 's oil supplies were not threatened by an interruption of flows through the druzhba oil pipeline , which supplies russian oil to germany and poland via belarus .
" i view the closure of the important druzhba pipeline with concern , " economy minister michael glos said . " the current situation is not dramatic for germany , " he said . " there are sufficient reserves of crude oil at the refineries to ensure supplies even if there is a long gap in deliveries . "
glos added , saying he expected deliveries via the pipeline to be fully resumed as quickly as possible . russia stops oil exports to belarus state television in belarus , a former soviet republic , reported on monday that the transit of russian crude oil across belarus to western europe had been halted .

" we therefore reduced transit supplies , equal to the amount being taken .
we then reached the point where we had to stop supplies completely . " belarus and russia , which have traditionally enjoyed close ties , have been locked in a bitter gas pricing row .
at the beginning of the year , belarus slapped a transit tax on russian crude oil which passes through the country in response to a russian decision to impose export duties on crude oil that belarus buys from russia . the row over transit fees came just days after belarus had narrowly averted a threatened cut-off in russian natural gas supplies by agreeing to a demand by russian monopoly gazprom that minsk pay double last year 's price for imported gas . germany says consumers wo n't be affected europe is heavily reliant on russia for its oil and gas and extremely vulnerable to russian supply cuts . about 50 million tons of crude oil pass through the druzhba pipeline each year .
of that , 18 million tons are supplied to poland and 22 million tons to the german refineries of schwedt and mider spergau . german economics minister glos said the development " shows once again that a balanced energy mix is imperative " for secure energy supply " and that one-sided dependencies must not be allowed to develop .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unusually mild winter means germans wo n't be needing too much oil for heating supplies to consumers were not in jeopardy , mwv insisted .
" there is a crisis system in place to offset any interruption in supply , " it added . a spokeswoman for total , which operates the leuna refinery , said that supplies had stopped overnight .
" but supplies to customers have been safeguarded and the refineries are functioning , " she insisted . the spokeswoman also said the reasons for the stoppage were not yet clear , but insisted that the refineries had sufficient reserves , even if she declined to say how long those reserves might last .

11 hijackers to 15 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sentence brings to an end a marathon legal process spanning five years a court in hamburg on monday sentenced mounir el motassadeq , a moroccan friend of the sept .
11 , 2001 hijackers who is convicted for being an accessory to mass murder , to 15 years in prison . a hamburg court on monday handed mounir el motassadeq the maximum 15-year sentence for his role in aiding the hijackers who killed nearly 3,000 people in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 . prosecutor walter hemberger said monday that motassadeq , who was friendly with three of the suicide attackers when they were students in the northern german city of hamburg , deserved the toughest sentence possible under german law because he had committed " an immense wrong . " hemberger 's comments came after motassadeq 's lawyers filed a series of motions to halt the sentencing hearing .
they argued that the hamburg bench was " unconstitutional " and demanded a suspension of the sentencing . however , the judges rejected the challenges and pushed ahead with the hearing , saying they wanted to finish the case monday .
the sentencing court , comprising three hamburg state superior court judges , had convened on friday . marathon legal process the sentencing brings to a close a marathon legal process which has seen motassadeq in and out of german courts for five years .
the bearded 32-year-old moroccan was arrested a few months after the sept 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington that killed nearly 3,000 people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german leaders commemorate sept .
11 victims on the fifth anniversary of the attacks in 2003 , he became the first person ever to be convicted for a role in the attacks .
he was then sentenced to 15 years in prison for being an accessory to mass murder . but the german federal court in karlsruhe , in southwestern germany , overturned that verdict on the grounds that us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al qaeda suspects held in us custody .
it ordered a retrial in hamburg . in 2005 , motassadeq was given a seven-year prison sentence for the lesser crime of belonging to a terrorist organisation but was cleared of abetting mass murder .
the judges found there was no evidence to show that motassadeq had been directly involved in planning the sept .
11 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon . but he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of the hamburg-based terror cell which included the presumed ringleader mohammed atta - while the future hijackers were pursuing flight training in the united states - and to have helped cover up their tracks . motassadeq says he 's innocent that verdict was scrapped in november last year , when the karlsruhe court found that motassadeq had " facilitated and supported the attacks " and sent him for sentencing .
prosecutors successfully argued that under a " division of labor " within the group , motassadeq ran the financial affairs of other cell members and covered up their absences from germany before the attacks . motassadeq 's lawyers however maintain he was a low-tier member of the group and that he knew nothing about the plot to fly planes into targets in new york and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq with his lawyer in 2004 last friday , motassadeq vehemently protested his innocence , telling the court : " i swear before god that i did not know that they were in america .
i swear before god that i did not know what they were planning . " german authorities have indicated that they will deport motassadeq to morocco once he has served his sentence . motassadeq 's case and the perceived failure of german courts to successfully prosecute him have strained berlin 's ties with washington in recent years . motassadeq is only the second man to be convicted of a role in the sept .

11 hijackers to 15 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sentence brings to an end a marathon legal process spanning five years a court in hamburg on monday sentenced mounir el motassadeq , a moroccan friend of the sept .
11 , 2001 hijackers who is convicted for being an accessory to mass murder , to 15 years in prison . a hamburg court on monday handed mounir el motassadeq the maximum 15-year sentence for his role in aiding the hijackers who killed nearly 3,000 people in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 . prosecutor walter hemberger said monday that motassadeq , who was friendly with three of the suicide attackers when they were students in the northern german city of hamburg , deserved the toughest sentence possible under german law because he had committed " an immense wrong . " hemberger 's comments came after motassadeq 's lawyers filed a series of motions to halt the sentencing hearing .
they argued that the hamburg bench was " unconstitutional " and demanded a suspension of the sentencing . however , the judges rejected the challenges and pushed ahead with the hearing , saying they wanted to finish the case monday .
the sentencing court , comprising three hamburg state superior court judges , had convened on friday . marathon legal process the sentencing brings to a close a marathon legal process which has seen motassadeq in and out of german courts for five years .
the bearded 32-year-old moroccan was arrested a few months after the sept 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington that killed nearly 3,000 people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german leaders commemorate sept .
11 victims on the fifth anniversary of the attacks in 2003 , he became the first person ever to be convicted for a role in the attacks .
he was then sentenced to 15 years in prison for being an accessory to mass murder . but the german federal court in karlsruhe , in southwestern germany , overturned that verdict on the grounds that us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al qaeda suspects held in us custody .
it ordered a retrial in hamburg . in 2005 , motassadeq was given a seven-year prison sentence for the lesser crime of belonging to a terrorist organisation but was cleared of abetting mass murder .
the judges found there was no evidence to show that motassadeq had been directly involved in planning the sept .
11 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon . but he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of the hamburg-based terror cell which included the presumed ringleader mohammed atta - while the future hijackers were pursuing flight training in the united states - and to have helped cover up their tracks . motassadeq says he 's innocent that verdict was scrapped in november last year , when the karlsruhe court found that motassadeq had " facilitated and supported the attacks " and sent him for sentencing .
prosecutors successfully argued that under a " division of labor " within the group , motassadeq ran the financial affairs of other cell members and covered up their absences from germany before the attacks . motassadeq 's lawyers however maintain he was a low-tier member of the group and that he knew nothing about the plot to fly planes into targets in new york and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq with his lawyer in 2004 last friday , motassadeq vehemently protested his innocence , telling the court : " i swear before god that i did not know that they were in america .
i swear before god that i did not know what they were planning . " german authorities have indicated that they will deport motassadeq to morocco once he has served his sentence . motassadeq 's case and the perceived failure of german courts to successfully prosecute him have strained berlin 's ties with washington in recent years . motassadeq is only the second man to be convicted of a role in the sept .

but that does n't matter to recent young recruits such as norbert kagarlitzkij who said he is pretty relaxed about being jewish - and about serving in the german army . " it is just part of the deal of being a young german , " he said .
" germans have to go to the army for a while or do alternative community service .
so should we . " more than 60 years after the holocaust , it still comes as a surprise to many to hear that german jews serve in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr .
after the war , the central council of jews in germany and the defense ministry made a deal that exempted jews up to the third generation of holocaust victims , from serving in the military .
but these days , there are an estimated 200 jews serving in the 250,000-strong german military .
and many say that number is growing . a matter of duty before the nazis , many jews had served in the german army - in world war i , for example .
the bundeswehr was founded in 1955 .
for decades afterward , most jewish germans would not have dreamed of serving in the military . michael fürst was one of the first to do so even though two of his grandparents were killed by the nazis .
he said he felt it was his duty and should be seen as something normal . " in 1966 , in jewish circles , the bundeswehr was not viewed as a new army but as the heir and successor of the army that took part in killing the jews , " he said .
" i did n't have to join the bundeswehr .
i could have requested an exemption which was always granted to people whose families had been persecuted by the nazi regime . " the so-called normality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many equated the early bundeswehr with the nazis more than 200,000 jews now live in germany .
most of them are recent immigrants from the former soviet union .
many of these immigrants , in particular , seem to have fewer qualms about serving in the german army as do the third and fourth generation of german jews . " there is a lot of talk about so-called normality , " said stephan kramer , secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" that we are talking about this subject is a sign of it .
in fact , many young men and women in the jewish community , especially among immigrant families , seriously consider careers in the armed forces .
obviously , the rules and regulations have to change with the times . " putting one 's foot in it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army is on peacekeeping missions around the world most jews that join the german army say they have n't had a hard time fitting in , either . " they are curious about what it 's like to be a jew , " kagarlizkij said of his non-jewish counterparts .
" most of the people i have met in the bundeswehr had never had anything to do with jews . " rabbi walter homolka , an army reserve officer who advises the armed forces , said that the germany military is almost too afraid of offending jews . " one source of tension is that the bundeswehr is too worried about doing something wrong , " homolka said .
" our task , as jews , is to point out to the army where it should be careful .
but the level of concern needs to be lowered ... the constant fear of putting one 's foot in it . " a democratic army students at berlin 's liberal rabbinical seminary , founded in 1999 , have to do a brief internship with a military .
most go to the us army , but some now choose the bundeswehr and say they are pleased with their choice . " it is a democratic army , an army that is very concerned about its image , about what it does , and what it is , " said konstantin pal , who spent a month with the german navy . he added that few institutions provide such a good opportunity for anyone seeking integration into german society . " in the bundeswehr , the most important thing is camaraderie - not whether you go to church every sunday or to the synagogue on friday evening , " he said .
" what counts is doing your job well . " last november , an association of jewish soldiers was founded .
its aim is to honor the jews who fell in the world war i fighting for germany - and to provide a forum for present-day german jewish soldiers . " it is something new , " said kramer of the central council of jews .
" we welcome the establishment of such an organization in principle - but of course it should not mean that a jewish group within the bundeswehr expects any special privileges .

csu leader and bavarian premier edmund stoiber has been one of the chief opponents of the reform , fearing that wealthy german states such as his own would carry the majority of the financial burden of the planned changes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu leader and bavarian state premier edmund stoiber stoiber , however , signaled his readiness to compromise and said he was confident the draft law would take effect on april 1 as planned . " i am optimistic that the healthcare reform will go into force as agreed , " he told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . old plans ring in new year the beginning of january is a traditional time for germany 's political parties to map out their policies for the year ahead with the spd and the free-market liberal free democrats holding important meetings over the weekend . labor markets reforms were the main policy focus of the two-day spd leadership gathering in the northern german city of bremen . among the reform proposals agreed were the introduction of a minimum wage and a scheme to reduce the amount of social contributions for low earners as a way of getting long-term unemployed back to work .
the spd also put forward an idea to guarantee all-day childcare , paid for by the government , to all children between the agea of one and five . spd to sharpen party profile the policies decided over the weekend were a clear attempt to appeal to the center-left party 's traditional base .
with many supporters complaining that the party has abandoned social principles and that its policies have become indistinct from those of the cdu , senior spd members wanted to sharpen the party 's profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chairman kurt beck spd party chairman kurt beck told the meeting that the party would focus more on ensuring that social welfare was not neglected . " people that are prepared to work have to receive special recognition , but the weak must not be allowed to drop by the wayside , " he said . the social democrats have recently been losing ground in the ratings with support dropping by 1 percent to 30 percent in one of the most recent opinion polls conducted by german public broadcaster ard .
meanwhile the cdu achieved a six-month high of 36 percent in the same survey . liberals to show social side germany 's grand coalition government came under attack at saturday 's meeting of the opposition free democrats in the southwestern german city of stuttgart .
fdp party leader guido westerwelle attacked what he sees as the sluggish pace of economic reform in germany , describing it as " slow motion " politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free democratic party head guido westerwelle westerwelle also painted a more socially oriented picture of the free-market party at the gathering . " our policies of economic reason are far more social than any red flag , whether it 's from the spd , the greens , the ex-communists or even what we 've heard lately from the cdu , " he said . westerwelle also criticized firms for their lack of social responsibility . " it is not acceptable that when company results are made public that the salaries of board members are increased by 30 percent and at the same time thousands of redundancies are announced , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jeg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel says germany must push ahead with reforms in a new year 's speech to be broadcast on german television on sunday , chancellor angela merkel said her government must push forward with further economic reforms in 2007 despite the pain they have inflicted .

" child pornography on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to search the internet , officers do n't need a warrant additional police specialists would be joining the state 's cyber team to match an increase in internet-related sex crimes , according to a baden-württemberg police spokesperson . some 800 cases involving child pornography passed through the state 's district attorney 's office in stuttgart in 2006 .
that number represents an increase from 690 cases in 2005 and 620 cases in 2004 . the suspects come from all parts of society , achim traichel , director of the five-person internet investigation group , said in an interview with the stuttgarter zeitung .
bankers , doctors , factory workers , and even fellow police officers have all been investigated , he added . the team 's cyber research led to a high-ranking member of stuttgart 's police force , whose computer was found to contain some 1,000 examples of child pornography . though the material was discovered in march 2006 , the police department kept the case under wraps until the press became aware of it in mid-december .
the accused officer faces up to five years in prison , according to the online edition of the stuttgarter nachrichten . police hacking still undecided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyber team has already caught perpetrators from 82 countries few cases of child pornography , however , are easy to prosecute , district attorney spokeswoman bettina vetter told the stuttgarter zeitung .
only one third of all child pornography cases are carried through to a court sentence while many cases are often abandoned for lack of evidence , she said . it can be difficult to prove " that the suspects actually viewed the pictures and did n't just erase them as they claim , " said vetter . though police have the technical ability to hack into private computers while the user is connected to the internet and view all files on the hard-drive , lawmakers are still deciding legality of this procedure . in the meantime , police will be putting pressure on pedophiles by showing up at their favorite web sites . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bits and bytes to fight child pornography european forensic scientists have developed a state-of-the-art computer program to help track down child victims of sexual exploitation on the internet .

one aspect is the way a product sounds .
it may be subtle , but it can spell commercial success . when steffen weise , director of research and development at germany 's biggest cookie maker bahlsen , sees one of his firm 's products on a plate , he 's not just thinking about the sweet , buttery taste or the slight hint of orange put into one of the baker 's latest creations .
he 's thinking about mastication . " imagine you see a cookie on a plate and it looks very crunchy , " he said , frowning slightly .
" but when you bite into it you find something very soft and unpleasant . " that , he said , is not what bahlsen or most baked-goods buyers want their cookie experience to be . the hanover-based company , founded in 1891 , has been well known for its leibnitz butter cookies for decades and marketed the product 's powerful crunch in advertisements back in the 1960s .
but more recently , it decided that it wanted to add another dimension to its research and development efforts for new products .
while taste and texture had been the primary considerations , bahlsen , in an attempt to get ahead of competitors , added the auditory element .
it was one of the first food companies to take this new sensory step . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test subjects listen to crunch after cookie crunch bahlsen began testing focus groups on their reactions to the sounds of different cookie recipes .
the company developed elaborate recording systems , microphones that were placed inside testers ' ears to record as accurately as possible the sound the chewer hears while chomping down on a cookie . complicated computer programs were developed that presented individuals with a specific crunch and then asked them to rate it according to emotions it triggered or what kind of image it brought to mind .
then the cookie recipe in development could be tweaked – more butter added to soften the crunch , more sugar to make it harder – until the right crunch at the right duration for the right crowd was found . age makes a difference bahlsen found that younger people wanted a stronger crunch , something crisp , loud and exciting .
for them , that represented youth , risk taking and dynamism . for the older crowd , however , a softer , more delicate auditory experience was usually preferred .
they tended to want their sweets to evoke luxury and richness , so the butter content was increased to provide a sonically calmer event . " older people in general are not very interested in additional noisy or stressful situations , " weise said .
" they want to relax ; they want to enjoy their food .
and they do n't need any action while eating . " subtle messaging for bahlsen and other companies working with sound , it revolves around what they call " implicit coding . "
that is , they want a message to get into the consumer 's head without him or her realizing it .
that message should be positive and basically say , " buy me , and not the other one " when faced with 20 varieties of cookies or 30 brands of beer on the store shelves . " if you have the specific sound you know when you open this bottle you will already be happy before tasting the product itself , " said brigitte schulte-fortkamp , who teaches psychoacoustics at berlin 's technical university .
" it 's not really a conscious process .
you are influenced without knowing it . " while sound design in the food industry is relatively new , other sectors have been using sound engineers in their development teams for some time now .
it runs the gamut from feminine hygiene spray -lrb- which should sound soft and soothing when spraying -rrb- to mosquito repellent -lrb- which should have a little more power behind it , to keep those little monsters at bay -rrb- to electric razors . these days , sound designers are often seen as good cooks , adjusting their sonic recipes so that consumers using a product experience positive emotions , are n't too surprised and feel their needs and desires are being met . cars and corporations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a porsche should n't sound like a vw the most intensively sound designed product is likely the automobile .
the slam of a car door should sound like a safe closing , and any rattling be kept at a minimum .

the audi car brand needs something that indicates motion and speed , but not recklessness . " we want to interpret the brand in the acoustic way so that people who hear it say : ' oh , that is for me : premium , or that is for me : trust ' , " said carl-frank westermann , who heads up the sound department at the berlin company metadesign and has created jingles for both companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vacuum cleaners will likely stay loud while everything can be sound designed to a certain extent , some sonic engineering has – perhaps counter-intuitively - fallen on its face .

he 's thinking about mastication . " imagine you see a cookie on a plate and it looks very crunchy , " he said , frowning slightly .
" but when you bite into it you find something very soft and unpleasant . " that , he said , is not what bahlsen or most baked-goods buyers want their cookie experience to be . the hanover-based company , founded in 1891 , has been well known for its leibnitz butter cookies for decades and marketed the product 's powerful crunch in advertisements back in the 1960s .
but more recently , it decided that it wanted to add another dimension to its research and development efforts for new products .

the company developed elaborate recording systems , microphones that were placed inside testers ' ears to record as accurately as possible the sound the chewer hears while chomping down on a cookie . complicated computer programs were developed that presented individuals with a specific crunch and then asked them to rate it according to emotions it triggered or what kind of image it brought to mind .
then the cookie recipe in development could be tweaked – more butter added to soften the crunch , more sugar to make it harder – until the right crunch at the right duration for the right crowd was found . age makes a difference bahlsen found that younger people wanted a stronger crunch , something crisp , loud and exciting .
for them , that represented youth , risk taking and dynamism . for the older crowd , however , a softer , more delicate auditory experience was usually preferred .
they tended to want their sweets to evoke luxury and richness , so the butter content was increased to provide a sonically calmer event . " older people in general are not very interested in additional noisy or stressful situations , " weise said .
" they want to relax ; they want to enjoy their food .
and they do n't need any action while eating . " subtle messaging for bahlsen and other companies working with sound , it revolves around what they call " implicit coding . "
that is , they want a message to get into the consumer 's head without him or her realizing it .

" child pornography on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to search the internet , officers do n't need a warrant additional police specialists would be joining the state 's cyber team to match an increase in internet-related sex crimes , according to a baden-württemberg police spokesperson . some 800 cases involving child pornography passed through the state 's district attorney 's office in stuttgart in 2006 .
that number represents an increase from 690 cases in 2005 and 620 cases in 2004 . the suspects come from all parts of society , achim traichel , director of the five-person internet investigation group , said in an interview with the stuttgarter zeitung .
bankers , doctors , factory workers , and even fellow police officers have all been investigated , he added . the team 's cyber research led to a high-ranking member of stuttgart 's police force , whose computer was found to contain some 1,000 examples of child pornography . though the material was discovered in march 2006 , the police department kept the case under wraps until the press became aware of it in mid-december .
the accused officer faces up to five years in prison , according to the online edition of the stuttgarter nachrichten . police hacking still undecided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cyber team has already caught perpetrators from 82 countries few cases of child pornography , however , are easy to prosecute , district attorney spokeswoman bettina vetter told the stuttgarter zeitung .
only one third of all child pornography cases are carried through to a court sentence while many cases are often abandoned for lack of evidence , she said . it can be difficult to prove " that the suspects actually viewed the pictures and did n't just erase them as they claim , " said vetter . though police have the technical ability to hack into private computers while the user is connected to the internet and view all files on the hard-drive , lawmakers are still deciding legality of this procedure . in the meantime , police will be putting pressure on pedophiles by showing up at their favorite web sites . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bits and bytes to fight child pornography european forensic scientists have developed a state-of-the-art computer program to help track down child victims of sexual exploitation on the internet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 08.01.2007 second time around for discount pharmacy chain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : docmorris ' generic drugs can save consumers up to 30 percent docmorris , the dutch discount pharmacy chain , has found a loophole to get around germany 's powerful lobby of pharmacists .
the internet retailer wants to sell its brand through 500 german affiliates . in germany , where drug prices are higher than the rest of europe , certified pharmacists have a virtual monopoly on the sale of over-the-counter and prescription drugs .
so when docmorris , europe 's first mail order pharmacy opened its first affiliate in the western city of saarbrücken last july and sold non-prescription medication at discount prices , competitors forced the state courts to shut it down in september . now , nearly four months later , the dutch internet retailer and pharmacy chain wants to get around the german pharmacy act , which does not permit corporate entities to sell drugs and limits ownership to three branches that must be in close proximity to each other , by paying pharmacy owners licensing fees to sell its products . opening 500 franchises through a legal loophole bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prescription and non-prescription drugs can only be sold in pharmacies on monday , in a second attempt to establish a franchise in the small saarland town of st. wendel , docmorris ' chief executive ralf däinghaus said he is planning to open 500 affiliates throughout germany over the next three years , with the next one scheduled to come in the northern city of bremen . he said pharmacies that choose to join his chain would be able to offer over-the-counter medication for up to 30 percent less than other established brands .
although the dutch chain has paid out 25 million euros -lrb- $ 32.5 million -rrb- in rebates to customers , its pharmaceuticals are still less expensive than those of its competitors . the price of prescription drugs , however , are fixed and will not be subject to the discounts , although däinghaus told the german press that he will push to deregulate that sector as well . pharmacy lobby not impressed " mr. däinghaus is trying out a new business model , but that does not frighten us , " said heinz-günter wolf , president of the german pharmacists association . traditional pharmacists , who have staged protests against reforms that they say threaten their existence , argue that they undergo vigorous professional training that enables them to dispense health advice to patients , whereas discounters who have no medical background pose a health hazard to the public . although paying out licensing fees reduce company profits , däinghaus told the german daily süddeutssche zeitung that he is banking on high volume sales to make up for the wafer-thin margins , adding that pharmacists are " running at us " to join . eu anti-trust law takes precedence over national law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pharmacists are trained to dispense health advice docmorris was incorporated in the netherlands , but the company 's main market is germany , where over 700,000 customers have been able to order both over-the-counter and prescription medication via the internet , telephone and mail order .
more than half of its customers are over the age of 50 and tend to live in metropolitan areas . the service is integrated in the german healthcare system and aimed at patients who have long-term or chronic illnesses , such as rheumatism , diabetes heart disorders and asthma . in his anti-trust battle with the pharmaceutical lobby , däinghaus could eventually have the final arbiter , the european court of justice , on his side .
saarland 's health minister josef hecken , who permitted the first docmorris franchise to open in saarbrücken has said that eu law entitling any european citizen to set up business anywhere in the union " takes precedence over national law . " dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pill power : pharmacies battle over who sells meds buying prescription and over-the-counter drugs is no easy task in germany .
only pharmacies run by certified pharmacy owners may sell medicinal drugs , but the meds monopoly has been getting a run for its money of late .
-lrb- 29.11.2006 -rrb- court allows controversial discount pharmacy in germany a german court on wednesday ruled that a dutch internet pharmacy can operate a branch in germany .

only 14 of those pictured were actually ksk stationed in kandahar . prosecutors said they were investigating the soldier on charges of inflicting bodily harm as well as a fellow ksk member who was on duty with him . " both suspects are accused of grievous bodily harm while on duty , " the prosecutors said in a statement , adding that the investigations were continuing . kurnaz alleges abuse in afghanistan , guantanamo kurnaz , born in germany in 1982 , was in the process of becoming a german citizen when he was arrested in pakistan in late 2001 on suspicion of supporting afghanistan 's former taliban rulers .
he was handed over to us authorities , who took him to afghanistan and then to guantanamo bay in cuba where he was held for four years until his release in august 2006 . us investigators claimed that kurnaz , who hails from the northern german city of bremen , was an " enemy combatant " with links to al-qaeda . kurnaz was released in august 2006 because of a lack of proof that he belonged to a terrorist organization . since his return to germany , kurnaz has alleged that he was abused by german soldiers during his detainment in afghanistan .
he has also said he suffered abuse in guantanamo bay including psychological torture and undernourishment . in november , kurnaz described his ordeal at the hands of german soldiers during a meeting with members of the european parliament . " they asked me if i knew who they were and then they said , ' we are the ksk , " ' he told european mps , adding that the men had german flags on their uniforms and spoke german with him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an earlier photo of murat kurnaz dating back to before his ordeal in afghanistan " i thought they would have some questions and that they could help me , but they told me i had chosen the wrong side , " kurnaz said . kurnaz 's lawyer has said the us authorities never issued an arrest warrant for kurnaz and no legal proceedings were ever started against him . embarrassing case for germany the case is an embarrassment for germany , which also faces allegations that the previous government secretly aided a us program to kidnap and fly terrorists to third countries for interrogation . the german defense ministry has repeatedly denied kurnaz 's allegations that he was abused by german soldiers in kandahar . the kurnaz case is also being investigated by a parliamentary committee , which is currently studying whether german security agencies breached any german rules while assisting post-2001 , us anti-terrorism operations . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany split over plane deployment to afghanistan germany 's government is split over whether the decision to send spy planes to afghanistan , which could see german troops deployed in the volatile south , needs parliamentary approval .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 08.01.2007 germany hit as russia halts oil exports to belarus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bitter russia-belarus row has meant less oil is being pumped to some german refineries russia has halted oil exports passing through belarus , threatening wider disruptions in europe .
however , germany has underlined that its oil supplies are safe for now . the german economics ministry on monday insisted that the country 's oil supplies were not threatened by an interruption of flows through the druzhba oil pipeline , which supplies russian oil to germany and poland via belarus .
" i view the closure of the important druzhba pipeline with concern , " economy minister michael glos said . " the current situation is not dramatic for germany , " he said . " there are sufficient reserves of crude oil at the refineries to ensure supplies even if there is a long gap in deliveries . "
glos added , saying he expected deliveries via the pipeline to be fully resumed as quickly as possible . russia stops oil exports to belarus state television in belarus , a former soviet republic , reported on monday that the transit of russian crude oil across belarus to western europe had been halted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at a gas compressor station near nesvizh , southwest of the belarussian capital minsk russia 's pipeline monopoly transneft said on monday it was forced to act because minsk had been illegally siphoning off oil from the druzhba pipeline system . " the belarusian side began taking transit oil as payment in kind for a new duty it had illegally imposed , " transneft vice-president sergei grigoryev told the reuters news agency .
" we therefore reduced transit supplies , equal to the amount being taken .
we then reached the point where we had to stop supplies completely . " belarus and russia , which have traditionally enjoyed close ties , have been locked in a bitter gas pricing row .
at the beginning of the year , belarus slapped a transit tax on russian crude oil which passes through the country in response to a russian decision to impose export duties on crude oil that belarus buys from russia . the row over transit fees came just days after belarus had narrowly averted a threatened cut-off in russian natural gas supplies by agreeing to a demand by russian monopoly gazprom that minsk pay double last year 's price for imported gas . germany says consumers wo n't be affected europe is heavily reliant on russia for its oil and gas and extremely vulnerable to russian supply cuts . about 50 million tons of crude oil pass through the druzhba pipeline each year .
of that , 18 million tons are supplied to poland and 22 million tons to the german refineries of schwedt and mider spergau . german economics minister glos said the development " shows once again that a balanced energy mix is imperative " for secure energy supply " and that one-sided dependencies must not be allowed to develop . " both germany and poland have confirmed that oil supplies to some of their refineries have been disrupted due to the russian interruption of oil exports to belarus . the mwv oil supply federation in hamburg said that " there have been limited pump interruptions on the druzhba pipeline in recent days . " the pipeline supplies the pck schwedt refinery and the mider total refinery near leuna in eastern germany . " the running of the refineries is currently not affected , " mwv said .
" nevertheless , as a precautionary move , alternative routes of supply for crude oil are being drawn up , for example , via the port of rostock . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unusually mild winter means germans wo n't be needing too much oil for heating supplies to consumers were not in jeopardy , mwv insisted .
" there is a crisis system in place to offset any interruption in supply , " it added . a spokeswoman for total , which operates the leuna refinery , said that supplies had stopped overnight .
" but supplies to customers have been safeguarded and the refineries are functioning , " she insisted . the spokeswoman also said the reasons for the stoppage were not yet clear , but insisted that the refineries had sufficient reserves , even if she declined to say how long those reserves might last . " we 're working on an alternative supply if that should become necessary , " she said . eu demands explanation the european union on monday demanded an " urgent and detailed " explanation for the interruption of oil supplies . " i would like to underline that there is no immediate risk of the interruption of the oil supply in the short term , " said ferran tarradellas , the eu executive arm 's spokesman on energy issues . he added that the commission planned to hold a meeting in coming days of the oil supply group , a team of european experts , to consider any measures that may be required . tarradellas said that germany had about 130 days of oil reserves and poland had 70 days worth . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy experts say eu gas supplies safe this winter european union energy experts have said that the eu 's natural gas supplies were assured for this winter , following a deal this week between belarus and russia that averted a gas price war .

however , germany has underlined that its oil supplies are safe for now . the german economics ministry on monday insisted that the country 's oil supplies were not threatened by an interruption of flows through the druzhba oil pipeline , which supplies russian oil to germany and poland via belarus .
" i view the closure of the important druzhba pipeline with concern , " economy minister michael glos said . " the current situation is not dramatic for germany , " he said . " there are sufficient reserves of crude oil at the refineries to ensure supplies even if there is a long gap in deliveries . "
glos added , saying he expected deliveries via the pipeline to be fully resumed as quickly as possible . russia stops oil exports to belarus state television in belarus , a former soviet republic , reported on monday that the transit of russian crude oil across belarus to western europe had been halted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at a gas compressor station near nesvizh , southwest of the belarussian capital minsk russia 's pipeline monopoly transneft said on monday it was forced to act because minsk had been illegally siphoning off oil from the druzhba pipeline system . " the belarusian side began taking transit oil as payment in kind for a new duty it had illegally imposed , " transneft vice-president sergei grigoryev told the reuters news agency .
" we therefore reduced transit supplies , equal to the amount being taken .
we then reached the point where we had to stop supplies completely . " belarus and russia , which have traditionally enjoyed close ties , have been locked in a bitter gas pricing row .
at the beginning of the year , belarus slapped a transit tax on russian crude oil which passes through the country in response to a russian decision to impose export duties on crude oil that belarus buys from russia . the row over transit fees came just days after belarus had narrowly averted a threatened cut-off in russian natural gas supplies by agreeing to a demand by russian monopoly gazprom that minsk pay double last year 's price for imported gas . germany says consumers wo n't be affected europe is heavily reliant on russia for its oil and gas and extremely vulnerable to russian supply cuts . about 50 million tons of crude oil pass through the druzhba pipeline each year .
of that , 18 million tons are supplied to poland and 22 million tons to the german refineries of schwedt and mider spergau . german economics minister glos said the development " shows once again that a balanced energy mix is imperative " for secure energy supply " and that one-sided dependencies must not be allowed to develop . " both germany and poland have confirmed that oil supplies to some of their refineries have been disrupted due to the russian interruption of oil exports to belarus . the mwv oil supply federation in hamburg said that " there have been limited pump interruptions on the druzhba pipeline in recent days . " the pipeline supplies the pck schwedt refinery and the mider total refinery near leuna in eastern germany . " the running of the refineries is currently not affected , " mwv said .
" nevertheless , as a precautionary move , alternative routes of supply for crude oil are being drawn up , for example , via the port of rostock . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unusually mild winter means germans wo n't be needing too much oil for heating supplies to consumers were not in jeopardy , mwv insisted .
" there is a crisis system in place to offset any interruption in supply , " it added . a spokeswoman for total , which operates the leuna refinery , said that supplies had stopped overnight .
" but supplies to customers have been safeguarded and the refineries are functioning , " she insisted . the spokeswoman also said the reasons for the stoppage were not yet clear , but insisted that the refineries had sufficient reserves , even if she declined to say how long those reserves might last . " we 're working on an alternative supply if that should become necessary , " she said . eu demands explanation the european union on monday demanded an " urgent and detailed " explanation for the interruption of oil supplies . " i would like to underline that there is no immediate risk of the interruption of the oil supply in the short term , " said ferran tarradellas , the eu executive arm 's spokesman on energy issues . he added that the commission planned to hold a meeting in coming days of the oil supply group , a team of european experts , to consider any measures that may be required . tarradellas said that germany had about 130 days of oil reserves and poland had 70 days worth . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy experts say eu gas supplies safe this winter european union energy experts have said that the eu 's natural gas supplies were assured for this winter , following a deal this week between belarus and russia that averted a gas price war .

the justice minister has put forward the measures as part of her plans for germany 's six-month presidency of the european union . common standards zypries told the bild newspaper on monday that officials are worried about increasing levels of cross-border activities engaged in by right-wing radicals in europe . " that is why we are immediately going to introduce a new initiative during the european union presidency to lay down uniform standards when it comes to fighting right-wing extremism , " she said . the plans had been blocked by italy up to now .
but zypries said that the new government in rome had signalled its support . " that would open up the way for to go ahead with them , " she said . sharing police information another plan announced by zypries that aimed at tackling right-wing extremism would boost cooperation among police forces across europe . this would make it possible , for example , for police to find out whether a suspect had a criminal record in his or her home country after filing an e-mail request .

' the goal can only be to make life as difficult as possible for the japanese , " gottschalk said at a news conference for the motor show which will be open to the public until january 21 .
" we are pursuing our own path . " german automakers are gambling that high oil prices , a growing environmental awareness in the us and new government rules promoting low-sulphur diesel fuel will aid their marketing push . flagging what is likely to be a major part of the campaign , gottschalk said a compact car using turbo diesel technology proved more fuel-efficient than a hybrid in a recent test drive in germany . diesel cars are highly popular in europe , since diesel is taxed significantly less than gasoline .
but in the us , diesel is dogged with a reputation as a dirtier , lower-performing fuel . demand for smaller vehicles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smart car is so tiny that the two-seater can be parked sideways smaller fuel efficient cars , notably the mercedes division 's " smart for two " have been drawing curious crowds at the show . the tiny car has become a familiar sight on europe 's congested roads since it was launched in 1998 , although the project has yet to make a profit . but in the united states , where gas-guzzling trucks and tank-sized sport utility vehicles -lrb- suvs -rrb- are popular , the notion that the two-seater could be a hit was dismissed until just recently . " that 's not the attitude people are showing today .
the smart is simply cool , " said daimlerchrysler chairman dieter zetsche , who insisted that north american drivers were ready for the vehicle . more than 770,000 europeans chose the first generation of the smart vehicles , which are ideal for driving on european cities ' smaller streets . fuel prices in us hurting gas-guzzlers " i think the simple equation that the larger the car the better does n't apply that much to the us market any more either , " added zetsche .
now , with higher fuel prices hitting us drivers ' wallets and traffic gridlock commonplace , daimlerchrysler expects sales of the vehicle to take off . company officials point to the smart 's relative success in canada , where the brand was expected to sell 1,500 units in its first year but ended up moving more than 4,000 . while total us auto sales are expected to drop to 16.2 million in 2007 , german automakers are still aiming to break the one-million mark this year , said vda 's gottschalk . dpa / afp / dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers expect record 2006 us sales german carmakers are projecting record sales of 900,000 vehicles for 2006 - a year that marked steady setbacks for us producers .

' the goal can only be to make life as difficult as possible for the japanese , " gottschalk said at a news conference for the motor show which will be open to the public until january 21 .
" we are pursuing our own path . " german automakers are gambling that high oil prices , a growing environmental awareness in the us and new government rules promoting low-sulphur diesel fuel will aid their marketing push . flagging what is likely to be a major part of the campaign , gottschalk said a compact car using turbo diesel technology proved more fuel-efficient than a hybrid in a recent test drive in germany . diesel cars are highly popular in europe , since diesel is taxed significantly less than gasoline .
but in the us , diesel is dogged with a reputation as a dirtier , lower-performing fuel . demand for smaller vehicles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smart car is so tiny that the two-seater can be parked sideways smaller fuel efficient cars , notably the mercedes division 's " smart for two " have been drawing curious crowds at the show . the tiny car has become a familiar sight on europe 's congested roads since it was launched in 1998 , although the project has yet to make a profit . but in the united states , where gas-guzzling trucks and tank-sized sport utility vehicles -lrb- suvs -rrb- are popular , the notion that the two-seater could be a hit was dismissed until just recently . " that 's not the attitude people are showing today .
the smart is simply cool , " said daimlerchrysler chairman dieter zetsche , who insisted that north american drivers were ready for the vehicle . more than 770,000 europeans chose the first generation of the smart vehicles , which are ideal for driving on european cities ' smaller streets . fuel prices in us hurting gas-guzzlers " i think the simple equation that the larger the car the better does n't apply that much to the us market any more either , " added zetsche .
now , with higher fuel prices hitting us drivers ' wallets and traffic gridlock commonplace , daimlerchrysler expects sales of the vehicle to take off . company officials point to the smart 's relative success in canada , where the brand was expected to sell 1,500 units in its first year but ended up moving more than 4,000 . while total us auto sales are expected to drop to 16.2 million in 2007 , german automakers are still aiming to break the one-million mark this year , said vda 's gottschalk . dpa / afp / dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers expect record 2006 us sales german carmakers are projecting record sales of 900,000 vehicles for 2006 - a year that marked steady setbacks for us producers .

11 , 2001 hijackers who is convicted for being an accessory to mass murder , to 15 years in prison . a hamburg court on monday handed mounir el motassadeq the maximum 15-year sentence for his role in aiding the hijackers who killed nearly 3,000 people in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 . prosecutor walter hemberger said monday that motassadeq , who was friendly with three of the suicide attackers when they were students in the northern german city of hamburg , deserved the toughest sentence possible under german law because he had committed " an immense wrong . " hemberger 's comments came after motassadeq 's lawyers filed a series of motions to halt the sentencing hearing .
they argued that the hamburg bench was " unconstitutional " and demanded a suspension of the sentencing . however , the judges rejected the challenges and pushed ahead with the hearing , saying they wanted to finish the case monday .
the sentencing court , comprising three hamburg state superior court judges , had convened on friday . marathon legal process the sentencing brings to a close a marathon legal process which has seen motassadeq in and out of german courts for five years .

he was then sentenced to 15 years in prison for being an accessory to mass murder . but the german federal court in karlsruhe , in southwestern germany , overturned that verdict on the grounds that us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al qaeda suspects held in us custody .
it ordered a retrial in hamburg . in 2005 , motassadeq was given a seven-year prison sentence for the lesser crime of belonging to a terrorist organisation but was cleared of abetting mass murder .
the judges found there was no evidence to show that motassadeq had been directly involved in planning the sept .
11 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon . but he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of the hamburg-based terror cell which included the presumed ringleader mohammed atta - while the future hijackers were pursuing flight training in the united states - and to have helped cover up their tracks . motassadeq says he 's innocent that verdict was scrapped in november last year , when the karlsruhe court found that motassadeq had " facilitated and supported the attacks " and sent him for sentencing .
prosecutors successfully argued that under a " division of labor " within the group , motassadeq ran the financial affairs of other cell members and covered up their absences from germany before the attacks . motassadeq 's lawyers however maintain he was a low-tier member of the group and that he knew nothing about the plot to fly planes into targets in new york and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq with his lawyer in 2004 last friday , motassadeq vehemently protested his innocence , telling the court : " i swear before god that i did not know that they were in america .

" german authorities have indicated that they will deport motassadeq to morocco once he has served his sentence . motassadeq 's case and the perceived failure of german courts to successfully prosecute him have strained berlin 's ties with washington in recent years . motassadeq is only the second man to be convicted of a role in the sept .

however , germany has underlined that its oil supplies are safe for now . the german economics ministry on monday insisted that the country 's oil supplies were not threatened by an interruption of flows through the druzhba oil pipeline , which supplies russian oil to germany and poland via belarus .
" i view the closure of the important druzhba pipeline with concern , " economy minister michael glos said . " the current situation is not dramatic for germany , " he said . " there are sufficient reserves of crude oil at the refineries to ensure supplies even if there is a long gap in deliveries . "
glos added , saying he expected deliveries via the pipeline to be fully resumed as quickly as possible . russia stops oil exports to belarus state television in belarus , a former soviet republic , reported on monday that the transit of russian crude oil across belarus to western europe had been halted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at a gas compressor station near nesvizh , southwest of the belarussian capital minsk russia 's pipeline monopoly transneft said on monday it was forced to act because minsk had been illegally siphoning off oil from the druzhba pipeline system . " the belarusian side began taking transit oil as payment in kind for a new duty it had illegally imposed , " transneft vice-president sergei grigoryev told the reuters news agency .
" we therefore reduced transit supplies , equal to the amount being taken .
we then reached the point where we had to stop supplies completely . " belarus and russia , which have traditionally enjoyed close ties , have been locked in a bitter gas pricing row .
at the beginning of the year , belarus slapped a transit tax on russian crude oil which passes through the country in response to a russian decision to impose export duties on crude oil that belarus buys from russia . the row over transit fees came just days after belarus had narrowly averted a threatened cut-off in russian natural gas supplies by agreeing to a demand by russian monopoly gazprom that minsk pay double last year 's price for imported gas . germany says consumers wo n't be affected europe is heavily reliant on russia for its oil and gas and extremely vulnerable to russian supply cuts . about 50 million tons of crude oil pass through the druzhba pipeline each year .
of that , 18 million tons are supplied to poland and 22 million tons to the german refineries of schwedt and mider spergau . german economics minister glos said the development " shows once again that a balanced energy mix is imperative " for secure energy supply " and that one-sided dependencies must not be allowed to develop . " both germany and poland have confirmed that oil supplies to some of their refineries have been disrupted due to the russian interruption of oil exports to belarus . the mwv oil supply federation in hamburg said that " there have been limited pump interruptions on the druzhba pipeline in recent days . " the pipeline supplies the pck schwedt refinery and the mider total refinery near leuna in eastern germany . " the running of the refineries is currently not affected , " mwv said .
" nevertheless , as a precautionary move , alternative routes of supply for crude oil are being drawn up , for example , via the port of rostock . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unusually mild winter means germans wo n't be needing too much oil for heating supplies to consumers were not in jeopardy , mwv insisted .
" there is a crisis system in place to offset any interruption in supply , " it added . a spokeswoman for total , which operates the leuna refinery , said that supplies had stopped overnight .
" but supplies to customers have been safeguarded and the refineries are functioning , " she insisted . the spokeswoman also said the reasons for the stoppage were not yet clear , but insisted that the refineries had sufficient reserves , even if she declined to say how long those reserves might last . " we 're working on an alternative supply if that should become necessary , " she said . eu demands explanation the european union on monday demanded an " urgent and detailed " explanation for the interruption of oil supplies . " i would like to underline that there is no immediate risk of the interruption of the oil supply in the short term , " said ferran tarradellas , the eu executive arm 's spokesman on energy issues . he added that the commission planned to hold a meeting in coming days of the oil supply group , a team of european experts , to consider any measures that may be required . tarradellas said that germany had about 130 days of oil reserves and poland had 70 days worth . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy experts say eu gas supplies safe this winter european union energy experts have said that the eu 's natural gas supplies were assured for this winter , following a deal this week between belarus and russia that averted a gas price war .

one aspect is the way a product sounds .
it may be subtle , but it can spell commercial success . when steffen weise , director of research and development at germany 's biggest cookie maker bahlsen , sees one of his firm 's products on a plate , he 's not just thinking about the sweet , buttery taste or the slight hint of orange put into one of the baker 's latest creations .
he 's thinking about mastication . " imagine you see a cookie on a plate and it looks very crunchy , " he said , frowning slightly .
" but when you bite into it you find something very soft and unpleasant . " that , he said , is not what bahlsen or most baked-goods buyers want their cookie experience to be . the hanover-based company , founded in 1891 , has been well known for its leibnitz butter cookies for decades and marketed the product 's powerful crunch in advertisements back in the 1960s .
but more recently , it decided that it wanted to add another dimension to its research and development efforts for new products .
while taste and texture had been the primary considerations , bahlsen , in an attempt to get ahead of competitors , added the auditory element .
it was one of the first food companies to take this new sensory step . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test subjects listen to crunch after cookie crunch bahlsen began testing focus groups on their reactions to the sounds of different cookie recipes .
the company developed elaborate recording systems , microphones that were placed inside testers ' ears to record as accurately as possible the sound the chewer hears while chomping down on a cookie . complicated computer programs were developed that presented individuals with a specific crunch and then asked them to rate it according to emotions it triggered or what kind of image it brought to mind .
then the cookie recipe in development could be tweaked – more butter added to soften the crunch , more sugar to make it harder – until the right crunch at the right duration for the right crowd was found . age makes a difference bahlsen found that younger people wanted a stronger crunch , something crisp , loud and exciting .
for them , that represented youth , risk taking and dynamism . for the older crowd , however , a softer , more delicate auditory experience was usually preferred .
they tended to want their sweets to evoke luxury and richness , so the butter content was increased to provide a sonically calmer event . " older people in general are not very interested in additional noisy or stressful situations , " weise said .
" they want to relax ; they want to enjoy their food .
and they do n't need any action while eating . " subtle messaging for bahlsen and other companies working with sound , it revolves around what they call " implicit coding . "
that is , they want a message to get into the consumer 's head without him or her realizing it .
that message should be positive and basically say , " buy me , and not the other one " when faced with 20 varieties of cookies or 30 brands of beer on the store shelves . " if you have the specific sound you know when you open this bottle you will already be happy before tasting the product itself , " said brigitte schulte-fortkamp , who teaches psychoacoustics at berlin 's technical university .
" it 's not really a conscious process .
you are influenced without knowing it . " while sound design in the food industry is relatively new , other sectors have been using sound engineers in their development teams for some time now .
it runs the gamut from feminine hygiene spray -lrb- which should sound soft and soothing when spraying -rrb- to mosquito repellent -lrb- which should have a little more power behind it , to keep those little monsters at bay -rrb- to electric razors . these days , sound designers are often seen as good cooks , adjusting their sonic recipes so that consumers using a product experience positive emotions , are n't too surprised and feel their needs and desires are being met . cars and corporations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a porsche should n't sound like a vw the most intensively sound designed product is likely the automobile .
the slam of a car door should sound like a safe closing , and any rattling be kept at a minimum .
a volvo driver will likely want the car 's engine to purr quietly and dependably .
the porsche buyer wants a different sound , one that communicates raw , naked power . corporations are also hiring sound designers to provide jingles and corporate music which tell the public who they are , or would at least like to be perceived as being . an insurance company like allianz wants music that communicates reliability and trust .
the audi car brand needs something that indicates motion and speed , but not recklessness . " we want to interpret the brand in the acoustic way so that people who hear it say : ' oh , that is for me : premium , or that is for me : trust ' , " said carl-frank westermann , who heads up the sound department at the berlin company metadesign and has created jingles for both companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vacuum cleaners will likely stay loud while everything can be sound designed to a certain extent , some sonic engineering has – perhaps counter-intuitively - fallen on its face .
in the past , engineers have created quieter vacuum cleaners that were auditory miles away from the high-decibel whines of most of the today 's makes . but , companies found the quieter vacuums did not sell as well .

he 's thinking about mastication . " imagine you see a cookie on a plate and it looks very crunchy , " he said , frowning slightly .
" but when you bite into it you find something very soft and unpleasant . " that , he said , is not what bahlsen or most baked-goods buyers want their cookie experience to be . the hanover-based company , founded in 1891 , has been well known for its leibnitz butter cookies for decades and marketed the product 's powerful crunch in advertisements back in the 1960s .

11 hijackers to 15 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sentence brings to an end a marathon legal process spanning five years a court in hamburg on monday sentenced mounir el motassadeq , a moroccan friend of the sept .
11 , 2001 hijackers who is convicted for being an accessory to mass murder , to 15 years in prison . a hamburg court on monday handed mounir el motassadeq the maximum 15-year sentence for his role in aiding the hijackers who killed nearly 3,000 people in the united states on sept .
11 , 2001 . prosecutor walter hemberger said monday that motassadeq , who was friendly with three of the suicide attackers when they were students in the northern german city of hamburg , deserved the toughest sentence possible under german law because he had committed " an immense wrong . " hemberger 's comments came after motassadeq 's lawyers filed a series of motions to halt the sentencing hearing .
they argued that the hamburg bench was " unconstitutional " and demanded a suspension of the sentencing . however , the judges rejected the challenges and pushed ahead with the hearing , saying they wanted to finish the case monday .
the sentencing court , comprising three hamburg state superior court judges , had convened on friday . marathon legal process the sentencing brings to a close a marathon legal process which has seen motassadeq in and out of german courts for five years .
the bearded 32-year-old moroccan was arrested a few months after the sept 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in new york and washington that killed nearly 3,000 people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german leaders commemorate sept .
11 victims on the fifth anniversary of the attacks in 2003 , he became the first person ever to be convicted for a role in the attacks .
he was then sentenced to 15 years in prison for being an accessory to mass murder . but the german federal court in karlsruhe , in southwestern germany , overturned that verdict on the grounds that us authorities had refused to allow the court to question top al qaeda suspects held in us custody .
it ordered a retrial in hamburg . in 2005 , motassadeq was given a seven-year prison sentence for the lesser crime of belonging to a terrorist organisation but was cleared of abetting mass murder .
the judges found there was no evidence to show that motassadeq had been directly involved in planning the sept .
11 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon . but he was found to have handled bank transfers for members of the hamburg-based terror cell which included the presumed ringleader mohammed atta - while the future hijackers were pursuing flight training in the united states - and to have helped cover up their tracks . motassadeq says he 's innocent that verdict was scrapped in november last year , when the karlsruhe court found that motassadeq had " facilitated and supported the attacks " and sent him for sentencing .
prosecutors successfully argued that under a " division of labor " within the group , motassadeq ran the financial affairs of other cell members and covered up their absences from germany before the attacks . motassadeq 's lawyers however maintain he was a low-tier member of the group and that he knew nothing about the plot to fly planes into targets in new york and washington . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq with his lawyer in 2004 last friday , motassadeq vehemently protested his innocence , telling the court : " i swear before god that i did not know that they were in america .
i swear before god that i did not know what they were planning . " german authorities have indicated that they will deport motassadeq to morocco once he has served his sentence . motassadeq 's case and the perceived failure of german courts to successfully prosecute him have strained berlin 's ties with washington in recent years . motassadeq is only the second man to be convicted of a role in the sept .
11 attacks .
zacarias moussaoui , a french citizen of moroccan descent who received a life sentence from a us court in may 2006 , is the only other person convicted of links to the attacks . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sept .

however , germany has underlined that its oil supplies are safe for now . the german economics ministry on monday insisted that the country 's oil supplies were not threatened by an interruption of flows through the druzhba oil pipeline , which supplies russian oil to germany and poland via belarus .
" i view the closure of the important druzhba pipeline with concern , " economy minister michael glos said . " the current situation is not dramatic for germany , " he said . " there are sufficient reserves of crude oil at the refineries to ensure supplies even if there is a long gap in deliveries . "
glos added , saying he expected deliveries via the pipeline to be fully resumed as quickly as possible . russia stops oil exports to belarus state television in belarus , a former soviet republic , reported on monday that the transit of russian crude oil across belarus to western europe had been halted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at a gas compressor station near nesvizh , southwest of the belarussian capital minsk russia 's pipeline monopoly transneft said on monday it was forced to act because minsk had been illegally siphoning off oil from the druzhba pipeline system . " the belarusian side began taking transit oil as payment in kind for a new duty it had illegally imposed , " transneft vice-president sergei grigoryev told the reuters news agency .
" we therefore reduced transit supplies , equal to the amount being taken .
we then reached the point where we had to stop supplies completely . " belarus and russia , which have traditionally enjoyed close ties , have been locked in a bitter gas pricing row .
at the beginning of the year , belarus slapped a transit tax on russian crude oil which passes through the country in response to a russian decision to impose export duties on crude oil that belarus buys from russia . the row over transit fees came just days after belarus had narrowly averted a threatened cut-off in russian natural gas supplies by agreeing to a demand by russian monopoly gazprom that minsk pay double last year 's price for imported gas . germany says consumers wo n't be affected europe is heavily reliant on russia for its oil and gas and extremely vulnerable to russian supply cuts . about 50 million tons of crude oil pass through the druzhba pipeline each year .
of that , 18 million tons are supplied to poland and 22 million tons to the german refineries of schwedt and mider spergau . german economics minister glos said the development " shows once again that a balanced energy mix is imperative " for secure energy supply " and that one-sided dependencies must not be allowed to develop . " both germany and poland have confirmed that oil supplies to some of their refineries have been disrupted due to the russian interruption of oil exports to belarus . the mwv oil supply federation in hamburg said that " there have been limited pump interruptions on the druzhba pipeline in recent days . " the pipeline supplies the pck schwedt refinery and the mider total refinery near leuna in eastern germany . " the running of the refineries is currently not affected , " mwv said .
" nevertheless , as a precautionary move , alternative routes of supply for crude oil are being drawn up , for example , via the port of rostock . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unusually mild winter means germans wo n't be needing too much oil for heating supplies to consumers were not in jeopardy , mwv insisted .
" there is a crisis system in place to offset any interruption in supply , " it added . a spokeswoman for total , which operates the leuna refinery , said that supplies had stopped overnight .
" but supplies to customers have been safeguarded and the refineries are functioning , " she insisted . the spokeswoman also said the reasons for the stoppage were not yet clear , but insisted that the refineries had sufficient reserves , even if she declined to say how long those reserves might last . " we 're working on an alternative supply if that should become necessary , " she said . eu demands explanation the european union on monday demanded an " urgent and detailed " explanation for the interruption of oil supplies . " i would like to underline that there is no immediate risk of the interruption of the oil supply in the short term , " said ferran tarradellas , the eu executive arm 's spokesman on energy issues . he added that the commission planned to hold a meeting in coming days of the oil supply group , a team of european experts , to consider any measures that may be required . tarradellas said that germany had about 130 days of oil reserves and poland had 70 days worth . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de energy experts say eu gas supplies safe this winter european union energy experts have said that the eu 's natural gas supplies were assured for this winter , following a deal this week between belarus and russia that averted a gas price war .

the internet retailer wants to sell its brand through 500 german affiliates . in germany , where drug prices are higher than the rest of europe , certified pharmacists have a virtual monopoly on the sale of over-the-counter and prescription drugs .
so when docmorris , europe 's first mail order pharmacy opened its first affiliate in the western city of saarbrücken last july and sold non-prescription medication at discount prices , competitors forced the state courts to shut it down in september . now , nearly four months later , the dutch internet retailer and pharmacy chain wants to get around the german pharmacy act , which does not permit corporate entities to sell drugs and limits ownership to three branches that must be in close proximity to each other , by paying pharmacy owners licensing fees to sell its products . opening 500 franchises through a legal loophole bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prescription and non-prescription drugs can only be sold in pharmacies on monday , in a second attempt to establish a franchise in the small saarland town of st. wendel , docmorris ' chief executive ralf däinghaus said he is planning to open 500 affiliates throughout germany over the next three years , with the next one scheduled to come in the northern city of bremen . he said pharmacies that choose to join his chain would be able to offer over-the-counter medication for up to 30 percent less than other established brands .
although the dutch chain has paid out 25 million euros -lrb- $ 32.5 million -rrb- in rebates to customers , its pharmaceuticals are still less expensive than those of its competitors . the price of prescription drugs , however , are fixed and will not be subject to the discounts , although däinghaus told the german press that he will push to deregulate that sector as well . pharmacy lobby not impressed " mr. däinghaus is trying out a new business model , but that does not frighten us , " said heinz-günter wolf , president of the german pharmacists association . traditional pharmacists , who have staged protests against reforms that they say threaten their existence , argue that they undergo vigorous professional training that enables them to dispense health advice to patients , whereas discounters who have no medical background pose a health hazard to the public . although paying out licensing fees reduce company profits , däinghaus told the german daily süddeutssche zeitung that he is banking on high volume sales to make up for the wafer-thin margins , adding that pharmacists are " running at us " to join . eu anti-trust law takes precedence over national law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pharmacists are trained to dispense health advice docmorris was incorporated in the netherlands , but the company 's main market is germany , where over 700,000 customers have been able to order both over-the-counter and prescription medication via the internet , telephone and mail order .
more than half of its customers are over the age of 50 and tend to live in metropolitan areas . the service is integrated in the german healthcare system and aimed at patients who have long-term or chronic illnesses , such as rheumatism , diabetes heart disorders and asthma . in his anti-trust battle with the pharmaceutical lobby , däinghaus could eventually have the final arbiter , the european court of justice , on his side .

csu leader and bavarian premier edmund stoiber has been one of the chief opponents of the reform , fearing that wealthy german states such as his own would carry the majority of the financial burden of the planned changes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu leader and bavarian state premier edmund stoiber stoiber , however , signaled his readiness to compromise and said he was confident the draft law would take effect on april 1 as planned . " i am optimistic that the healthcare reform will go into force as agreed , " he told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . old plans ring in new year the beginning of january is a traditional time for germany 's political parties to map out their policies for the year ahead with the spd and the free-market liberal free democrats holding important meetings over the weekend . labor markets reforms were the main policy focus of the two-day spd leadership gathering in the northern german city of bremen . among the reform proposals agreed were the introduction of a minimum wage and a scheme to reduce the amount of social contributions for low earners as a way of getting long-term unemployed back to work .
the spd also put forward an idea to guarantee all-day childcare , paid for by the government , to all children between the agea of one and five . spd to sharpen party profile the policies decided over the weekend were a clear attempt to appeal to the center-left party 's traditional base .
with many supporters complaining that the party has abandoned social principles and that its policies have become indistinct from those of the cdu , senior spd members wanted to sharpen the party 's profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chairman kurt beck spd party chairman kurt beck told the meeting that the party would focus more on ensuring that social welfare was not neglected . " people that are prepared to work have to receive special recognition , but the weak must not be allowed to drop by the wayside , " he said . the social democrats have recently been losing ground in the ratings with support dropping by 1 percent to 30 percent in one of the most recent opinion polls conducted by german public broadcaster ard .
meanwhile the cdu achieved a six-month high of 36 percent in the same survey . liberals to show social side germany 's grand coalition government came under attack at saturday 's meeting of the opposition free democrats in the southwestern german city of stuttgart .
fdp party leader guido westerwelle attacked what he sees as the sluggish pace of economic reform in germany , describing it as " slow motion " politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : free democratic party head guido westerwelle westerwelle also painted a more socially oriented picture of the free-market party at the gathering .

only 14 of those pictured were actually ksk stationed in kandahar . prosecutors said they were investigating the soldier on charges of inflicting bodily harm as well as a fellow ksk member who was on duty with him . " both suspects are accused of grievous bodily harm while on duty , " the prosecutors said in a statement , adding that the investigations were continuing . kurnaz alleges abuse in afghanistan , guantanamo kurnaz , born in germany in 1982 , was in the process of becoming a german citizen when he was arrested in pakistan in late 2001 on suspicion of supporting afghanistan 's former taliban rulers .
he was handed over to us authorities , who took him to afghanistan and then to guantanamo bay in cuba where he was held for four years until his release in august 2006 . us investigators claimed that kurnaz , who hails from the northern german city of bremen , was an " enemy combatant " with links to al-qaeda . kurnaz was released in august 2006 because of a lack of proof that he belonged to a terrorist organization . since his return to germany , kurnaz has alleged that he was abused by german soldiers during his detainment in afghanistan .
he has also said he suffered abuse in guantanamo bay including psychological torture and undernourishment . in november , kurnaz described his ordeal at the hands of german soldiers during a meeting with members of the european parliament . " they asked me if i knew who they were and then they said , ' we are the ksk , " ' he told european mps , adding that the men had german flags on their uniforms and spoke german with him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an earlier photo of murat kurnaz dating back to before his ordeal in afghanistan " i thought they would have some questions and that they could help me , but they told me i had chosen the wrong side , " kurnaz said . kurnaz 's lawyer has said the us authorities never issued an arrest warrant for kurnaz and no legal proceedings were ever started against him . embarrassing case for germany the case is an embarrassment for germany , which also faces allegations that the previous government secretly aided a us program to kidnap and fly terrorists to third countries for interrogation . the german defense ministry has repeatedly denied kurnaz 's allegations that he was abused by german soldiers in kandahar . the kurnaz case is also being investigated by a parliamentary committee , which is currently studying whether german security agencies breached any german rules while assisting post-2001 , us anti-terrorism operations . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany split over plane deployment to afghanistan germany 's government is split over whether the decision to send spy planes to afghanistan , which could see german troops deployed in the volatile south , needs parliamentary approval .

but that does n't matter to recent young recruits such as norbert kagarlitzkij who said he is pretty relaxed about being jewish - and about serving in the german army . " it is just part of the deal of being a young german , " he said .
" germans have to go to the army for a while or do alternative community service .
so should we . " more than 60 years after the holocaust , it still comes as a surprise to many to hear that german jews serve in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr .
after the war , the central council of jews in germany and the defense ministry made a deal that exempted jews up to the third generation of holocaust victims , from serving in the military .
but these days , there are an estimated 200 jews serving in the 250,000-strong german military .
and many say that number is growing . a matter of duty before the nazis , many jews had served in the german army - in world war i , for example .
the bundeswehr was founded in 1955 .
for decades afterward , most jewish germans would not have dreamed of serving in the military . michael fürst was one of the first to do so even though two of his grandparents were killed by the nazis .
he said he felt it was his duty and should be seen as something normal . " in 1966 , in jewish circles , the bundeswehr was not viewed as a new army but as the heir and successor of the army that took part in killing the jews , " he said .
" i did n't have to join the bundeswehr .
i could have requested an exemption which was always granted to people whose families had been persecuted by the nazi regime . " the so-called normality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many equated the early bundeswehr with the nazis more than 200,000 jews now live in germany .
most of them are recent immigrants from the former soviet union .
many of these immigrants , in particular , seem to have fewer qualms about serving in the german army as do the third and fourth generation of german jews . " there is a lot of talk about so-called normality , " said stephan kramer , secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" that we are talking about this subject is a sign of it .
in fact , many young men and women in the jewish community , especially among immigrant families , seriously consider careers in the armed forces .
obviously , the rules and regulations have to change with the times . " putting one 's foot in it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army is on peacekeeping missions around the world most jews that join the german army say they have n't had a hard time fitting in , either . " they are curious about what it 's like to be a jew , " kagarlizkij said of his non-jewish counterparts .
" most of the people i have met in the bundeswehr had never had anything to do with jews . " rabbi walter homolka , an army reserve officer who advises the armed forces , said that the germany military is almost too afraid of offending jews . " one source of tension is that the bundeswehr is too worried about doing something wrong , " homolka said .
" our task , as jews , is to point out to the army where it should be careful .
but the level of concern needs to be lowered ... the constant fear of putting one 's foot in it . " a democratic army students at berlin 's liberal rabbinical seminary , founded in 1999 , have to do a brief internship with a military .
most go to the us army , but some now choose the bundeswehr and say they are pleased with their choice . " it is a democratic army , an army that is very concerned about its image , about what it does , and what it is , " said konstantin pal , who spent a month with the german navy . he added that few institutions provide such a good opportunity for anyone seeking integration into german society .

they argued that the hamburg bench was " unconstitutional " and demanded a suspension of the sentencing . however , the judges rejected the challenges and pushed ahead with the hearing , saying they wanted to finish the case monday .
the sentencing court , comprising three hamburg state superior court judges , had convened on friday . marathon legal process the sentencing brings to a close a marathon legal process which has seen motassadeq in and out of german courts for five years .

however , germany has underlined that its oil supplies are safe for now . the german economics ministry on monday insisted that the country 's oil supplies were not threatened by an interruption of flows through the druzhba oil pipeline , which supplies russian oil to germany and poland via belarus .
" i view the closure of the important druzhba pipeline with concern , " economy minister michael glos said . " the current situation is not dramatic for germany , " he said . " there are sufficient reserves of crude oil at the refineries to ensure supplies even if there is a long gap in deliveries . "
glos added , saying he expected deliveries via the pipeline to be fully resumed as quickly as possible . russia stops oil exports to belarus state television in belarus , a former soviet republic , reported on monday that the transit of russian crude oil across belarus to western europe had been halted .

at the beginning of the year , belarus slapped a transit tax on russian crude oil which passes through the country in response to a russian decision to impose export duties on crude oil that belarus buys from russia . the row over transit fees came just days after belarus had narrowly averted a threatened cut-off in russian natural gas supplies by agreeing to a demand by russian monopoly gazprom that minsk pay double last year 's price for imported gas . germany says consumers wo n't be affected europe is heavily reliant on russia for its oil and gas and extremely vulnerable to russian supply cuts . about 50 million tons of crude oil pass through the druzhba pipeline each year .
of that , 18 million tons are supplied to poland and 22 million tons to the german refineries of schwedt and mider spergau . german economics minister glos said the development " shows once again that a balanced energy mix is imperative " for secure energy supply " and that one-sided dependencies must not be allowed to develop . " both germany and poland have confirmed that oil supplies to some of their refineries have been disrupted due to the russian interruption of oil exports to belarus . the mwv oil supply federation in hamburg said that " there have been limited pump interruptions on the druzhba pipeline in recent days . " the pipeline supplies the pck schwedt refinery and the mider total refinery near leuna in eastern germany . " the running of the refineries is currently not affected , " mwv said .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unusually mild winter means germans wo n't be needing too much oil for heating supplies to consumers were not in jeopardy , mwv insisted .
" there is a crisis system in place to offset any interruption in supply , " it added . a spokeswoman for total , which operates the leuna refinery , said that supplies had stopped overnight .
" but supplies to customers have been safeguarded and the refineries are functioning , " she insisted . the spokeswoman also said the reasons for the stoppage were not yet clear , but insisted that the refineries had sufficient reserves , even if she declined to say how long those reserves might last .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 08.01.2007 second time around for discount pharmacy chain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : docmorris ' generic drugs can save consumers up to 30 percent docmorris , the dutch discount pharmacy chain , has found a loophole to get around germany 's powerful lobby of pharmacists .
the internet retailer wants to sell its brand through 500 german affiliates . in germany , where drug prices are higher than the rest of europe , certified pharmacists have a virtual monopoly on the sale of over-the-counter and prescription drugs .
so when docmorris , europe 's first mail order pharmacy opened its first affiliate in the western city of saarbrücken last july and sold non-prescription medication at discount prices , competitors forced the state courts to shut it down in september . now , nearly four months later , the dutch internet retailer and pharmacy chain wants to get around the german pharmacy act , which does not permit corporate entities to sell drugs and limits ownership to three branches that must be in close proximity to each other , by paying pharmacy owners licensing fees to sell its products . opening 500 franchises through a legal loophole bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prescription and non-prescription drugs can only be sold in pharmacies on monday , in a second attempt to establish a franchise in the small saarland town of st. wendel , docmorris ' chief executive ralf däinghaus said he is planning to open 500 affiliates throughout germany over the next three years , with the next one scheduled to come in the northern city of bremen . he said pharmacies that choose to join his chain would be able to offer over-the-counter medication for up to 30 percent less than other established brands .
although the dutch chain has paid out 25 million euros -lrb- $ 32.5 million -rrb- in rebates to customers , its pharmaceuticals are still less expensive than those of its competitors . the price of prescription drugs , however , are fixed and will not be subject to the discounts , although däinghaus told the german press that he will push to deregulate that sector as well . pharmacy lobby not impressed " mr. däinghaus is trying out a new business model , but that does not frighten us , " said heinz-günter wolf , president of the german pharmacists association . traditional pharmacists , who have staged protests against reforms that they say threaten their existence , argue that they undergo vigorous professional training that enables them to dispense health advice to patients , whereas discounters who have no medical background pose a health hazard to the public . although paying out licensing fees reduce company profits , däinghaus told the german daily süddeutssche zeitung that he is banking on high volume sales to make up for the wafer-thin margins , adding that pharmacists are " running at us " to join . eu anti-trust law takes precedence over national law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pharmacists are trained to dispense health advice docmorris was incorporated in the netherlands , but the company 's main market is germany , where over 700,000 customers have been able to order both over-the-counter and prescription medication via the internet , telephone and mail order .
more than half of its customers are over the age of 50 and tend to live in metropolitan areas . the service is integrated in the german healthcare system and aimed at patients who have long-term or chronic illnesses , such as rheumatism , diabetes heart disorders and asthma . in his anti-trust battle with the pharmaceutical lobby , däinghaus could eventually have the final arbiter , the european court of justice , on his side .
saarland 's health minister josef hecken , who permitted the first docmorris franchise to open in saarbrücken has said that eu law entitling any european citizen to set up business anywhere in the union " takes precedence over national law .

one aspect is the way a product sounds .
it may be subtle , but it can spell commercial success . when steffen weise , director of research and development at germany 's biggest cookie maker bahlsen , sees one of his firm 's products on a plate , he 's not just thinking about the sweet , buttery taste or the slight hint of orange put into one of the baker 's latest creations .
he 's thinking about mastication . " imagine you see a cookie on a plate and it looks very crunchy , " he said , frowning slightly .
" but when you bite into it you find something very soft and unpleasant . " that , he said , is not what bahlsen or most baked-goods buyers want their cookie experience to be . the hanover-based company , founded in 1891 , has been well known for its leibnitz butter cookies for decades and marketed the product 's powerful crunch in advertisements back in the 1960s .
but more recently , it decided that it wanted to add another dimension to its research and development efforts for new products .
while taste and texture had been the primary considerations , bahlsen , in an attempt to get ahead of competitors , added the auditory element .
it was one of the first food companies to take this new sensory step . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test subjects listen to crunch after cookie crunch bahlsen began testing focus groups on their reactions to the sounds of different cookie recipes .
the company developed elaborate recording systems , microphones that were placed inside testers ' ears to record as accurately as possible the sound the chewer hears while chomping down on a cookie . complicated computer programs were developed that presented individuals with a specific crunch and then asked them to rate it according to emotions it triggered or what kind of image it brought to mind .
then the cookie recipe in development could be tweaked – more butter added to soften the crunch , more sugar to make it harder – until the right crunch at the right duration for the right crowd was found . age makes a difference bahlsen found that younger people wanted a stronger crunch , something crisp , loud and exciting .
for them , that represented youth , risk taking and dynamism . for the older crowd , however , a softer , more delicate auditory experience was usually preferred .
they tended to want their sweets to evoke luxury and richness , so the butter content was increased to provide a sonically calmer event . " older people in general are not very interested in additional noisy or stressful situations , " weise said .
" they want to relax ; they want to enjoy their food .
and they do n't need any action while eating . " subtle messaging for bahlsen and other companies working with sound , it revolves around what they call " implicit coding . "
that is , they want a message to get into the consumer 's head without him or her realizing it .
that message should be positive and basically say , " buy me , and not the other one " when faced with 20 varieties of cookies or 30 brands of beer on the store shelves . " if you have the specific sound you know when you open this bottle you will already be happy before tasting the product itself , " said brigitte schulte-fortkamp , who teaches psychoacoustics at berlin 's technical university .
" it 's not really a conscious process .
you are influenced without knowing it . " while sound design in the food industry is relatively new , other sectors have been using sound engineers in their development teams for some time now .
it runs the gamut from feminine hygiene spray -lrb- which should sound soft and soothing when spraying -rrb- to mosquito repellent -lrb- which should have a little more power behind it , to keep those little monsters at bay -rrb- to electric razors . these days , sound designers are often seen as good cooks , adjusting their sonic recipes so that consumers using a product experience positive emotions , are n't too surprised and feel their needs and desires are being met . cars and corporations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a porsche should n't sound like a vw the most intensively sound designed product is likely the automobile .
the slam of a car door should sound like a safe closing , and any rattling be kept at a minimum .
a volvo driver will likely want the car 's engine to purr quietly and dependably .
the porsche buyer wants a different sound , one that communicates raw , naked power . corporations are also hiring sound designers to provide jingles and corporate music which tell the public who they are , or would at least like to be perceived as being . an insurance company like allianz wants music that communicates reliability and trust .
the audi car brand needs something that indicates motion and speed , but not recklessness . " we want to interpret the brand in the acoustic way so that people who hear it say : ' oh , that is for me : premium , or that is for me : trust ' , " said carl-frank westermann , who heads up the sound department at the berlin company metadesign and has created jingles for both companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vacuum cleaners will likely stay loud while everything can be sound designed to a certain extent , some sonic engineering has – perhaps counter-intuitively - fallen on its face .
in the past , engineers have created quieter vacuum cleaners that were auditory miles away from the high-decibel whines of most of the today 's makes . but , companies found the quieter vacuums did not sell as well .
in many people 's minds , all that headache-inducing noise equaled superior suction power .
the vacuums soon got their screams back . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de purr , squawk , chirp - animals speak out at berlin archive ever wonder what a mole has to say ?

the internet retailer wants to sell its brand through 500 german affiliates . in germany , where drug prices are higher than the rest of europe , certified pharmacists have a virtual monopoly on the sale of over-the-counter and prescription drugs .
so when docmorris , europe 's first mail order pharmacy opened its first affiliate in the western city of saarbrücken last july and sold non-prescription medication at discount prices , competitors forced the state courts to shut it down in september . now , nearly four months later , the dutch internet retailer and pharmacy chain wants to get around the german pharmacy act , which does not permit corporate entities to sell drugs and limits ownership to three branches that must be in close proximity to each other , by paying pharmacy owners licensing fees to sell its products . opening 500 franchises through a legal loophole bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prescription and non-prescription drugs can only be sold in pharmacies on monday , in a second attempt to establish a franchise in the small saarland town of st. wendel , docmorris ' chief executive ralf däinghaus said he is planning to open 500 affiliates throughout germany over the next three years , with the next one scheduled to come in the northern city of bremen . he said pharmacies that choose to join his chain would be able to offer over-the-counter medication for up to 30 percent less than other established brands .
although the dutch chain has paid out 25 million euros -lrb- $ 32.5 million -rrb- in rebates to customers , its pharmaceuticals are still less expensive than those of its competitors . the price of prescription drugs , however , are fixed and will not be subject to the discounts , although däinghaus told the german press that he will push to deregulate that sector as well . pharmacy lobby not impressed " mr. däinghaus is trying out a new business model , but that does not frighten us , " said heinz-günter wolf , president of the german pharmacists association . traditional pharmacists , who have staged protests against reforms that they say threaten their existence , argue that they undergo vigorous professional training that enables them to dispense health advice to patients , whereas discounters who have no medical background pose a health hazard to the public . although paying out licensing fees reduce company profits , däinghaus told the german daily süddeutssche zeitung that he is banking on high volume sales to make up for the wafer-thin margins , adding that pharmacists are " running at us " to join . eu anti-trust law takes precedence over national law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pharmacists are trained to dispense health advice docmorris was incorporated in the netherlands , but the company 's main market is germany , where over 700,000 customers have been able to order both over-the-counter and prescription medication via the internet , telephone and mail order .

but that does n't matter to recent young recruits such as norbert kagarlitzkij who said he is pretty relaxed about being jewish - and about serving in the german army . " it is just part of the deal of being a young german , " he said .
" germans have to go to the army for a while or do alternative community service .
so should we . " more than 60 years after the holocaust , it still comes as a surprise to many to hear that german jews serve in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr .
after the war , the central council of jews in germany and the defense ministry made a deal that exempted jews up to the third generation of holocaust victims , from serving in the military .
but these days , there are an estimated 200 jews serving in the 250,000-strong german military .
and many say that number is growing . a matter of duty before the nazis , many jews had served in the german army - in world war i , for example .
the bundeswehr was founded in 1955 .
for decades afterward , most jewish germans would not have dreamed of serving in the military . michael fürst was one of the first to do so even though two of his grandparents were killed by the nazis .
he said he felt it was his duty and should be seen as something normal . " in 1966 , in jewish circles , the bundeswehr was not viewed as a new army but as the heir and successor of the army that took part in killing the jews , " he said .
" i did n't have to join the bundeswehr .
i could have requested an exemption which was always granted to people whose families had been persecuted by the nazi regime . " the so-called normality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many equated the early bundeswehr with the nazis more than 200,000 jews now live in germany .
most of them are recent immigrants from the former soviet union .
many of these immigrants , in particular , seem to have fewer qualms about serving in the german army as do the third and fourth generation of german jews . " there is a lot of talk about so-called normality , " said stephan kramer , secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" that we are talking about this subject is a sign of it .
in fact , many young men and women in the jewish community , especially among immigrant families , seriously consider careers in the armed forces .

but that does n't matter to recent young recruits such as norbert kagarlitzkij who said he is pretty relaxed about being jewish - and about serving in the german army . " it is just part of the deal of being a young german , " he said .
" germans have to go to the army for a while or do alternative community service .
so should we . " more than 60 years after the holocaust , it still comes as a surprise to many to hear that german jews serve in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr .
after the war , the central council of jews in germany and the defense ministry made a deal that exempted jews up to the third generation of holocaust victims , from serving in the military .
but these days , there are an estimated 200 jews serving in the 250,000-strong german military .
and many say that number is growing . a matter of duty before the nazis , many jews had served in the german army - in world war i , for example .
the bundeswehr was founded in 1955 .
for decades afterward , most jewish germans would not have dreamed of serving in the military . michael fürst was one of the first to do so even though two of his grandparents were killed by the nazis .
he said he felt it was his duty and should be seen as something normal . " in 1966 , in jewish circles , the bundeswehr was not viewed as a new army but as the heir and successor of the army that took part in killing the jews , " he said .
" i did n't have to join the bundeswehr .
i could have requested an exemption which was always granted to people whose families had been persecuted by the nazi regime . " the so-called normality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many equated the early bundeswehr with the nazis more than 200,000 jews now live in germany .
most of them are recent immigrants from the former soviet union .
many of these immigrants , in particular , seem to have fewer qualms about serving in the german army as do the third and fourth generation of german jews . " there is a lot of talk about so-called normality , " said stephan kramer , secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" that we are talking about this subject is a sign of it .
in fact , many young men and women in the jewish community , especially among immigrant families , seriously consider careers in the armed forces .
obviously , the rules and regulations have to change with the times . " putting one 's foot in it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army is on peacekeeping missions around the world most jews that join the german army say they have n't had a hard time fitting in , either . " they are curious about what it 's like to be a jew , " kagarlizkij said of his non-jewish counterparts .
" most of the people i have met in the bundeswehr had never had anything to do with jews . " rabbi walter homolka , an army reserve officer who advises the armed forces , said that the germany military is almost too afraid of offending jews . " one source of tension is that the bundeswehr is too worried about doing something wrong , " homolka said .
" our task , as jews , is to point out to the army where it should be careful .
but the level of concern needs to be lowered ... the constant fear of putting one 's foot in it . " a democratic army students at berlin 's liberal rabbinical seminary , founded in 1999 , have to do a brief internship with a military .
most go to the us army , but some now choose the bundeswehr and say they are pleased with their choice . " it is a democratic army , an army that is very concerned about its image , about what it does , and what it is , " said konstantin pal , who spent a month with the german navy . he added that few institutions provide such a good opportunity for anyone seeking integration into german society . " in the bundeswehr , the most important thing is camaraderie - not whether you go to church every sunday or to the synagogue on friday evening , " he said .
" what counts is doing your job well . " last november , an association of jewish soldiers was founded .
its aim is to honor the jews who fell in the world war i fighting for germany - and to provide a forum for present-day german jewish soldiers . " it is something new , " said kramer of the central council of jews .
" we welcome the establishment of such an organization in principle - but of course it should not mean that a jewish group within the bundeswehr expects any special privileges .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 08.01.2007 second time around for discount pharmacy chain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : docmorris ' generic drugs can save consumers up to 30 percent docmorris , the dutch discount pharmacy chain , has found a loophole to get around germany 's powerful lobby of pharmacists .
the internet retailer wants to sell its brand through 500 german affiliates . in germany , where drug prices are higher than the rest of europe , certified pharmacists have a virtual monopoly on the sale of over-the-counter and prescription drugs .
so when docmorris , europe 's first mail order pharmacy opened its first affiliate in the western city of saarbrücken last july and sold non-prescription medication at discount prices , competitors forced the state courts to shut it down in september . now , nearly four months later , the dutch internet retailer and pharmacy chain wants to get around the german pharmacy act , which does not permit corporate entities to sell drugs and limits ownership to three branches that must be in close proximity to each other , by paying pharmacy owners licensing fees to sell its products . opening 500 franchises through a legal loophole bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prescription and non-prescription drugs can only be sold in pharmacies on monday , in a second attempt to establish a franchise in the small saarland town of st. wendel , docmorris ' chief executive ralf däinghaus said he is planning to open 500 affiliates throughout germany over the next three years , with the next one scheduled to come in the northern city of bremen . he said pharmacies that choose to join his chain would be able to offer over-the-counter medication for up to 30 percent less than other established brands .
although the dutch chain has paid out 25 million euros -lrb- $ 32.5 million -rrb- in rebates to customers , its pharmaceuticals are still less expensive than those of its competitors . the price of prescription drugs , however , are fixed and will not be subject to the discounts , although däinghaus told the german press that he will push to deregulate that sector as well . pharmacy lobby not impressed " mr. däinghaus is trying out a new business model , but that does not frighten us , " said heinz-günter wolf , president of the german pharmacists association . traditional pharmacists , who have staged protests against reforms that they say threaten their existence , argue that they undergo vigorous professional training that enables them to dispense health advice to patients , whereas discounters who have no medical background pose a health hazard to the public . although paying out licensing fees reduce company profits , däinghaus told the german daily süddeutssche zeitung that he is banking on high volume sales to make up for the wafer-thin margins , adding that pharmacists are " running at us " to join . eu anti-trust law takes precedence over national law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pharmacists are trained to dispense health advice docmorris was incorporated in the netherlands , but the company 's main market is germany , where over 700,000 customers have been able to order both over-the-counter and prescription medication via the internet , telephone and mail order .
more than half of its customers are over the age of 50 and tend to live in metropolitan areas . the service is integrated in the german healthcare system and aimed at patients who have long-term or chronic illnesses , such as rheumatism , diabetes heart disorders and asthma . in his anti-trust battle with the pharmaceutical lobby , däinghaus could eventually have the final arbiter , the european court of justice , on his side .
saarland 's health minister josef hecken , who permitted the first docmorris franchise to open in saarbrücken has said that eu law entitling any european citizen to set up business anywhere in the union " takes precedence over national law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de design -pipe- 08.01.2007 snap , crackle , pop or crunch : sound sells großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting that crunch just right as the marketplace becomes more crowded , companies are looking at new ways to make their wares attractive to consumers .
one aspect is the way a product sounds .
it may be subtle , but it can spell commercial success . when steffen weise , director of research and development at germany 's biggest cookie maker bahlsen , sees one of his firm 's products on a plate , he 's not just thinking about the sweet , buttery taste or the slight hint of orange put into one of the baker 's latest creations .
he 's thinking about mastication . " imagine you see a cookie on a plate and it looks very crunchy , " he said , frowning slightly .
" but when you bite into it you find something very soft and unpleasant . " that , he said , is not what bahlsen or most baked-goods buyers want their cookie experience to be . the hanover-based company , founded in 1891 , has been well known for its leibnitz butter cookies for decades and marketed the product 's powerful crunch in advertisements back in the 1960s .
but more recently , it decided that it wanted to add another dimension to its research and development efforts for new products .
while taste and texture had been the primary considerations , bahlsen , in an attempt to get ahead of competitors , added the auditory element .
it was one of the first food companies to take this new sensory step . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test subjects listen to crunch after cookie crunch bahlsen began testing focus groups on their reactions to the sounds of different cookie recipes .
the company developed elaborate recording systems , microphones that were placed inside testers ' ears to record as accurately as possible the sound the chewer hears while chomping down on a cookie . complicated computer programs were developed that presented individuals with a specific crunch and then asked them to rate it according to emotions it triggered or what kind of image it brought to mind .
then the cookie recipe in development could be tweaked – more butter added to soften the crunch , more sugar to make it harder – until the right crunch at the right duration for the right crowd was found . age makes a difference bahlsen found that younger people wanted a stronger crunch , something crisp , loud and exciting .
for them , that represented youth , risk taking and dynamism . for the older crowd , however , a softer , more delicate auditory experience was usually preferred .
they tended to want their sweets to evoke luxury and richness , so the butter content was increased to provide a sonically calmer event . " older people in general are not very interested in additional noisy or stressful situations , " weise said .
" they want to relax ; they want to enjoy their food .
and they do n't need any action while eating . " subtle messaging for bahlsen and other companies working with sound , it revolves around what they call " implicit coding . "
that is , they want a message to get into the consumer 's head without him or her realizing it .
that message should be positive and basically say , " buy me , and not the other one " when faced with 20 varieties of cookies or 30 brands of beer on the store shelves . " if you have the specific sound you know when you open this bottle you will already be happy before tasting the product itself , " said brigitte schulte-fortkamp , who teaches psychoacoustics at berlin 's technical university .
" it 's not really a conscious process .
you are influenced without knowing it . " while sound design in the food industry is relatively new , other sectors have been using sound engineers in their development teams for some time now .
it runs the gamut from feminine hygiene spray -lrb- which should sound soft and soothing when spraying -rrb- to mosquito repellent -lrb- which should have a little more power behind it , to keep those little monsters at bay -rrb- to electric razors . these days , sound designers are often seen as good cooks , adjusting their sonic recipes so that consumers using a product experience positive emotions , are n't too surprised and feel their needs and desires are being met . cars and corporations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a porsche should n't sound like a vw the most intensively sound designed product is likely the automobile .
the slam of a car door should sound like a safe closing , and any rattling be kept at a minimum .
a volvo driver will likely want the car 's engine to purr quietly and dependably .
the porsche buyer wants a different sound , one that communicates raw , naked power . corporations are also hiring sound designers to provide jingles and corporate music which tell the public who they are , or would at least like to be perceived as being . an insurance company like allianz wants music that communicates reliability and trust .
the audi car brand needs something that indicates motion and speed , but not recklessness . " we want to interpret the brand in the acoustic way so that people who hear it say : ' oh , that is for me : premium , or that is for me : trust ' , " said carl-frank westermann , who heads up the sound department at the berlin company metadesign and has created jingles for both companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vacuum cleaners will likely stay loud while everything can be sound designed to a certain extent , some sonic engineering has – perhaps counter-intuitively - fallen on its face .
in the past , engineers have created quieter vacuum cleaners that were auditory miles away from the high-decibel whines of most of the today 's makes . but , companies found the quieter vacuums did not sell as well .
in many people 's minds , all that headache-inducing noise equaled superior suction power .
the vacuums soon got their screams back . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de purr , squawk , chirp - animals speak out at berlin archive ever wonder what a mole has to say ?

only 14 of those pictured were actually ksk stationed in kandahar . prosecutors said they were investigating the soldier on charges of inflicting bodily harm as well as a fellow ksk member who was on duty with him . " both suspects are accused of grievous bodily harm while on duty , " the prosecutors said in a statement , adding that the investigations were continuing . kurnaz alleges abuse in afghanistan , guantanamo kurnaz , born in germany in 1982 , was in the process of becoming a german citizen when he was arrested in pakistan in late 2001 on suspicion of supporting afghanistan 's former taliban rulers .
he was handed over to us authorities , who took him to afghanistan and then to guantanamo bay in cuba where he was held for four years until his release in august 2006 . us investigators claimed that kurnaz , who hails from the northern german city of bremen , was an " enemy combatant " with links to al-qaeda . kurnaz was released in august 2006 because of a lack of proof that he belonged to a terrorist organization . since his return to germany , kurnaz has alleged that he was abused by german soldiers during his detainment in afghanistan .
he has also said he suffered abuse in guantanamo bay including psychological torture and undernourishment . in november , kurnaz described his ordeal at the hands of german soldiers during a meeting with members of the european parliament . " they asked me if i knew who they were and then they said , ' we are the ksk , " ' he told european mps , adding that the men had german flags on their uniforms and spoke german with him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an earlier photo of murat kurnaz dating back to before his ordeal in afghanistan " i thought they would have some questions and that they could help me , but they told me i had chosen the wrong side , " kurnaz said . kurnaz 's lawyer has said the us authorities never issued an arrest warrant for kurnaz and no legal proceedings were ever started against him . embarrassing case for germany the case is an embarrassment for germany , which also faces allegations that the previous government secretly aided a us program to kidnap and fly terrorists to third countries for interrogation . the german defense ministry has repeatedly denied kurnaz 's allegations that he was abused by german soldiers in kandahar . the kurnaz case is also being investigated by a parliamentary committee , which is currently studying whether german security agencies breached any german rules while assisting post-2001 , us anti-terrorism operations . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany split over plane deployment to afghanistan germany 's government is split over whether the decision to send spy planes to afghanistan , which could see german troops deployed in the volatile south , needs parliamentary approval .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de design -pipe- 08.01.2007 snap , crackle , pop or crunch : sound sells großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting that crunch just right as the marketplace becomes more crowded , companies are looking at new ways to make their wares attractive to consumers .
one aspect is the way a product sounds .
it may be subtle , but it can spell commercial success . when steffen weise , director of research and development at germany 's biggest cookie maker bahlsen , sees one of his firm 's products on a plate , he 's not just thinking about the sweet , buttery taste or the slight hint of orange put into one of the baker 's latest creations .
he 's thinking about mastication . " imagine you see a cookie on a plate and it looks very crunchy , " he said , frowning slightly .
" but when you bite into it you find something very soft and unpleasant . " that , he said , is not what bahlsen or most baked-goods buyers want their cookie experience to be . the hanover-based company , founded in 1891 , has been well known for its leibnitz butter cookies for decades and marketed the product 's powerful crunch in advertisements back in the 1960s .
but more recently , it decided that it wanted to add another dimension to its research and development efforts for new products .
while taste and texture had been the primary considerations , bahlsen , in an attempt to get ahead of competitors , added the auditory element .
it was one of the first food companies to take this new sensory step . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test subjects listen to crunch after cookie crunch bahlsen began testing focus groups on their reactions to the sounds of different cookie recipes .
the company developed elaborate recording systems , microphones that were placed inside testers ' ears to record as accurately as possible the sound the chewer hears while chomping down on a cookie . complicated computer programs were developed that presented individuals with a specific crunch and then asked them to rate it according to emotions it triggered or what kind of image it brought to mind .
then the cookie recipe in development could be tweaked – more butter added to soften the crunch , more sugar to make it harder – until the right crunch at the right duration for the right crowd was found . age makes a difference bahlsen found that younger people wanted a stronger crunch , something crisp , loud and exciting .
for them , that represented youth , risk taking and dynamism . for the older crowd , however , a softer , more delicate auditory experience was usually preferred .
they tended to want their sweets to evoke luxury and richness , so the butter content was increased to provide a sonically calmer event . " older people in general are not very interested in additional noisy or stressful situations , " weise said .
" they want to relax ; they want to enjoy their food .
and they do n't need any action while eating . " subtle messaging for bahlsen and other companies working with sound , it revolves around what they call " implicit coding . "
that is , they want a message to get into the consumer 's head without him or her realizing it .
that message should be positive and basically say , " buy me , and not the other one " when faced with 20 varieties of cookies or 30 brands of beer on the store shelves . " if you have the specific sound you know when you open this bottle you will already be happy before tasting the product itself , " said brigitte schulte-fortkamp , who teaches psychoacoustics at berlin 's technical university .
" it 's not really a conscious process .
you are influenced without knowing it . " while sound design in the food industry is relatively new , other sectors have been using sound engineers in their development teams for some time now .
it runs the gamut from feminine hygiene spray -lrb- which should sound soft and soothing when spraying -rrb- to mosquito repellent -lrb- which should have a little more power behind it , to keep those little monsters at bay -rrb- to electric razors . these days , sound designers are often seen as good cooks , adjusting their sonic recipes so that consumers using a product experience positive emotions , are n't too surprised and feel their needs and desires are being met . cars and corporations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a porsche should n't sound like a vw the most intensively sound designed product is likely the automobile .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de design -pipe- 08.01.2007 snap , crackle , pop or crunch : sound sells großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting that crunch just right as the marketplace becomes more crowded , companies are looking at new ways to make their wares attractive to consumers .
one aspect is the way a product sounds .
it may be subtle , but it can spell commercial success . when steffen weise , director of research and development at germany 's biggest cookie maker bahlsen , sees one of his firm 's products on a plate , he 's not just thinking about the sweet , buttery taste or the slight hint of orange put into one of the baker 's latest creations .
he 's thinking about mastication . " imagine you see a cookie on a plate and it looks very crunchy , " he said , frowning slightly .
" but when you bite into it you find something very soft and unpleasant . " that , he said , is not what bahlsen or most baked-goods buyers want their cookie experience to be . the hanover-based company , founded in 1891 , has been well known for its leibnitz butter cookies for decades and marketed the product 's powerful crunch in advertisements back in the 1960s .
but more recently , it decided that it wanted to add another dimension to its research and development efforts for new products .
while taste and texture had been the primary considerations , bahlsen , in an attempt to get ahead of competitors , added the auditory element .
it was one of the first food companies to take this new sensory step . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test subjects listen to crunch after cookie crunch bahlsen began testing focus groups on their reactions to the sounds of different cookie recipes .
the company developed elaborate recording systems , microphones that were placed inside testers ' ears to record as accurately as possible the sound the chewer hears while chomping down on a cookie . complicated computer programs were developed that presented individuals with a specific crunch and then asked them to rate it according to emotions it triggered or what kind of image it brought to mind .
then the cookie recipe in development could be tweaked – more butter added to soften the crunch , more sugar to make it harder – until the right crunch at the right duration for the right crowd was found . age makes a difference bahlsen found that younger people wanted a stronger crunch , something crisp , loud and exciting .
for them , that represented youth , risk taking and dynamism . for the older crowd , however , a softer , more delicate auditory experience was usually preferred .
they tended to want their sweets to evoke luxury and richness , so the butter content was increased to provide a sonically calmer event . " older people in general are not very interested in additional noisy or stressful situations , " weise said .
" they want to relax ; they want to enjoy their food .
and they do n't need any action while eating . " subtle messaging for bahlsen and other companies working with sound , it revolves around what they call " implicit coding . "
that is , they want a message to get into the consumer 's head without him or her realizing it .
that message should be positive and basically say , " buy me , and not the other one " when faced with 20 varieties of cookies or 30 brands of beer on the store shelves . " if you have the specific sound you know when you open this bottle you will already be happy before tasting the product itself , " said brigitte schulte-fortkamp , who teaches psychoacoustics at berlin 's technical university .
" it 's not really a conscious process .
you are influenced without knowing it . " while sound design in the food industry is relatively new , other sectors have been using sound engineers in their development teams for some time now .
it runs the gamut from feminine hygiene spray -lrb- which should sound soft and soothing when spraying -rrb- to mosquito repellent -lrb- which should have a little more power behind it , to keep those little monsters at bay -rrb- to electric razors . these days , sound designers are often seen as good cooks , adjusting their sonic recipes so that consumers using a product experience positive emotions , are n't too surprised and feel their needs and desires are being met . cars and corporations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a porsche should n't sound like a vw the most intensively sound designed product is likely the automobile .
the slam of a car door should sound like a safe closing , and any rattling be kept at a minimum .
a volvo driver will likely want the car 's engine to purr quietly and dependably .
the porsche buyer wants a different sound , one that communicates raw , naked power . corporations are also hiring sound designers to provide jingles and corporate music which tell the public who they are , or would at least like to be perceived as being . an insurance company like allianz wants music that communicates reliability and trust .
the audi car brand needs something that indicates motion and speed , but not recklessness . " we want to interpret the brand in the acoustic way so that people who hear it say : ' oh , that is for me : premium , or that is for me : trust ' , " said carl-frank westermann , who heads up the sound department at the berlin company metadesign and has created jingles for both companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vacuum cleaners will likely stay loud while everything can be sound designed to a certain extent , some sonic engineering has – perhaps counter-intuitively - fallen on its face .

the internet retailer wants to sell its brand through 500 german affiliates . in germany , where drug prices are higher than the rest of europe , certified pharmacists have a virtual monopoly on the sale of over-the-counter and prescription drugs .
so when docmorris , europe 's first mail order pharmacy opened its first affiliate in the western city of saarbrücken last july and sold non-prescription medication at discount prices , competitors forced the state courts to shut it down in september . now , nearly four months later , the dutch internet retailer and pharmacy chain wants to get around the german pharmacy act , which does not permit corporate entities to sell drugs and limits ownership to three branches that must be in close proximity to each other , by paying pharmacy owners licensing fees to sell its products . opening 500 franchises through a legal loophole bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prescription and non-prescription drugs can only be sold in pharmacies on monday , in a second attempt to establish a franchise in the small saarland town of st. wendel , docmorris ' chief executive ralf däinghaus said he is planning to open 500 affiliates throughout germany over the next three years , with the next one scheduled to come in the northern city of bremen . he said pharmacies that choose to join his chain would be able to offer over-the-counter medication for up to 30 percent less than other established brands .
although the dutch chain has paid out 25 million euros -lrb- $ 32.5 million -rrb- in rebates to customers , its pharmaceuticals are still less expensive than those of its competitors . the price of prescription drugs , however , are fixed and will not be subject to the discounts , although däinghaus told the german press that he will push to deregulate that sector as well . pharmacy lobby not impressed " mr. däinghaus is trying out a new business model , but that does not frighten us , " said heinz-günter wolf , president of the german pharmacists association . traditional pharmacists , who have staged protests against reforms that they say threaten their existence , argue that they undergo vigorous professional training that enables them to dispense health advice to patients , whereas discounters who have no medical background pose a health hazard to the public . although paying out licensing fees reduce company profits , däinghaus told the german daily süddeutssche zeitung that he is banking on high volume sales to make up for the wafer-thin margins , adding that pharmacists are " running at us " to join . eu anti-trust law takes precedence over national law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pharmacists are trained to dispense health advice docmorris was incorporated in the netherlands , but the company 's main market is germany , where over 700,000 customers have been able to order both over-the-counter and prescription medication via the internet , telephone and mail order .
more than half of its customers are over the age of 50 and tend to live in metropolitan areas . the service is integrated in the german healthcare system and aimed at patients who have long-term or chronic illnesses , such as rheumatism , diabetes heart disorders and asthma . in his anti-trust battle with the pharmaceutical lobby , däinghaus could eventually have the final arbiter , the european court of justice , on his side .

one aspect is the way a product sounds .
it may be subtle , but it can spell commercial success . when steffen weise , director of research and development at germany 's biggest cookie maker bahlsen , sees one of his firm 's products on a plate , he 's not just thinking about the sweet , buttery taste or the slight hint of orange put into one of the baker 's latest creations .
he 's thinking about mastication . " imagine you see a cookie on a plate and it looks very crunchy , " he said , frowning slightly .
" but when you bite into it you find something very soft and unpleasant . " that , he said , is not what bahlsen or most baked-goods buyers want their cookie experience to be . the hanover-based company , founded in 1891 , has been well known for its leibnitz butter cookies for decades and marketed the product 's powerful crunch in advertisements back in the 1960s .
but more recently , it decided that it wanted to add another dimension to its research and development efforts for new products .
while taste and texture had been the primary considerations , bahlsen , in an attempt to get ahead of competitors , added the auditory element .
it was one of the first food companies to take this new sensory step . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : test subjects listen to crunch after cookie crunch bahlsen began testing focus groups on their reactions to the sounds of different cookie recipes .
the company developed elaborate recording systems , microphones that were placed inside testers ' ears to record as accurately as possible the sound the chewer hears while chomping down on a cookie . complicated computer programs were developed that presented individuals with a specific crunch and then asked them to rate it according to emotions it triggered or what kind of image it brought to mind .
then the cookie recipe in development could be tweaked – more butter added to soften the crunch , more sugar to make it harder – until the right crunch at the right duration for the right crowd was found . age makes a difference bahlsen found that younger people wanted a stronger crunch , something crisp , loud and exciting .
for them , that represented youth , risk taking and dynamism . for the older crowd , however , a softer , more delicate auditory experience was usually preferred .
they tended to want their sweets to evoke luxury and richness , so the butter content was increased to provide a sonically calmer event . " older people in general are not very interested in additional noisy or stressful situations , " weise said .
" they want to relax ; they want to enjoy their food .
and they do n't need any action while eating . " subtle messaging for bahlsen and other companies working with sound , it revolves around what they call " implicit coding . "
that is , they want a message to get into the consumer 's head without him or her realizing it .
that message should be positive and basically say , " buy me , and not the other one " when faced with 20 varieties of cookies or 30 brands of beer on the store shelves . " if you have the specific sound you know when you open this bottle you will already be happy before tasting the product itself , " said brigitte schulte-fortkamp , who teaches psychoacoustics at berlin 's technical university .
" it 's not really a conscious process .
you are influenced without knowing it . " while sound design in the food industry is relatively new , other sectors have been using sound engineers in their development teams for some time now .
it runs the gamut from feminine hygiene spray -lrb- which should sound soft and soothing when spraying -rrb- to mosquito repellent -lrb- which should have a little more power behind it , to keep those little monsters at bay -rrb- to electric razors . these days , sound designers are often seen as good cooks , adjusting their sonic recipes so that consumers using a product experience positive emotions , are n't too surprised and feel their needs and desires are being met . cars and corporations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a porsche should n't sound like a vw the most intensively sound designed product is likely the automobile .
the slam of a car door should sound like a safe closing , and any rattling be kept at a minimum .
a volvo driver will likely want the car 's engine to purr quietly and dependably .
the porsche buyer wants a different sound , one that communicates raw , naked power . corporations are also hiring sound designers to provide jingles and corporate music which tell the public who they are , or would at least like to be perceived as being . an insurance company like allianz wants music that communicates reliability and trust .
the audi car brand needs something that indicates motion and speed , but not recklessness . " we want to interpret the brand in the acoustic way so that people who hear it say : ' oh , that is for me : premium , or that is for me : trust ' , " said carl-frank westermann , who heads up the sound department at the berlin company metadesign and has created jingles for both companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vacuum cleaners will likely stay loud while everything can be sound designed to a certain extent , some sonic engineering has – perhaps counter-intuitively - fallen on its face .
in the past , engineers have created quieter vacuum cleaners that were auditory miles away from the high-decibel whines of most of the today 's makes . but , companies found the quieter vacuums did not sell as well .

however , germany has underlined that its oil supplies are safe for now . the german economics ministry on monday insisted that the country 's oil supplies were not threatened by an interruption of flows through the druzhba oil pipeline , which supplies russian oil to germany and poland via belarus .
" i view the closure of the important druzhba pipeline with concern , " economy minister michael glos said . " the current situation is not dramatic for germany , " he said . " there are sufficient reserves of crude oil at the refineries to ensure supplies even if there is a long gap in deliveries . "
glos added , saying he expected deliveries via the pipeline to be fully resumed as quickly as possible . russia stops oil exports to belarus state television in belarus , a former soviet republic , reported on monday that the transit of russian crude oil across belarus to western europe had been halted .

we then reached the point where we had to stop supplies completely . " belarus and russia , which have traditionally enjoyed close ties , have been locked in a bitter gas pricing row .
at the beginning of the year , belarus slapped a transit tax on russian crude oil which passes through the country in response to a russian decision to impose export duties on crude oil that belarus buys from russia . the row over transit fees came just days after belarus had narrowly averted a threatened cut-off in russian natural gas supplies by agreeing to a demand by russian monopoly gazprom that minsk pay double last year 's price for imported gas . germany says consumers wo n't be affected europe is heavily reliant on russia for its oil and gas and extremely vulnerable to russian supply cuts . about 50 million tons of crude oil pass through the druzhba pipeline each year .
of that , 18 million tons are supplied to poland and 22 million tons to the german refineries of schwedt and mider spergau . german economics minister glos said the development " shows once again that a balanced energy mix is imperative " for secure energy supply " and that one-sided dependencies must not be allowed to develop .

" the pipeline supplies the pck schwedt refinery and the mider total refinery near leuna in eastern germany . " the running of the refineries is currently not affected , " mwv said .

" but supplies to customers have been safeguarded and the refineries are functioning , " she insisted . the spokeswoman also said the reasons for the stoppage were not yet clear , but insisted that the refineries had sufficient reserves , even if she declined to say how long those reserves might last .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 08.01.2007 germany hit as russia halts oil exports to belarus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bitter russia-belarus row has meant less oil is being pumped to some german refineries russia has halted oil exports passing through belarus , threatening wider disruptions in europe .
however , germany has underlined that its oil supplies are safe for now . the german economics ministry on monday insisted that the country 's oil supplies were not threatened by an interruption of flows through the druzhba oil pipeline , which supplies russian oil to germany and poland via belarus .
" i view the closure of the important druzhba pipeline with concern , " economy minister michael glos said . " the current situation is not dramatic for germany , " he said . " there are sufficient reserves of crude oil at the refineries to ensure supplies even if there is a long gap in deliveries . "
glos added , saying he expected deliveries via the pipeline to be fully resumed as quickly as possible . russia stops oil exports to belarus state television in belarus , a former soviet republic , reported on monday that the transit of russian crude oil across belarus to western europe had been halted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at a gas compressor station near nesvizh , southwest of the belarussian capital minsk russia 's pipeline monopoly transneft said on monday it was forced to act because minsk had been illegally siphoning off oil from the druzhba pipeline system . " the belarusian side began taking transit oil as payment in kind for a new duty it had illegally imposed , " transneft vice-president sergei grigoryev told the reuters news agency .
" we therefore reduced transit supplies , equal to the amount being taken .
we then reached the point where we had to stop supplies completely . " belarus and russia , which have traditionally enjoyed close ties , have been locked in a bitter gas pricing row .
at the beginning of the year , belarus slapped a transit tax on russian crude oil which passes through the country in response to a russian decision to impose export duties on crude oil that belarus buys from russia . the row over transit fees came just days after belarus had narrowly averted a threatened cut-off in russian natural gas supplies by agreeing to a demand by russian monopoly gazprom that minsk pay double last year 's price for imported gas . germany says consumers wo n't be affected europe is heavily reliant on russia for its oil and gas and extremely vulnerable to russian supply cuts . about 50 million tons of crude oil pass through the druzhba pipeline each year .
of that , 18 million tons are supplied to poland and 22 million tons to the german refineries of schwedt and mider spergau . german economics minister glos said the development " shows once again that a balanced energy mix is imperative " for secure energy supply " and that one-sided dependencies must not be allowed to develop . " both germany and poland have confirmed that oil supplies to some of their refineries have been disrupted due to the russian interruption of oil exports to belarus . the mwv oil supply federation in hamburg said that " there have been limited pump interruptions on the druzhba pipeline in recent days .

only 14 of those pictured were actually ksk stationed in kandahar . prosecutors said they were investigating the soldier on charges of inflicting bodily harm as well as a fellow ksk member who was on duty with him . " both suspects are accused of grievous bodily harm while on duty , " the prosecutors said in a statement , adding that the investigations were continuing . kurnaz alleges abuse in afghanistan , guantanamo kurnaz , born in germany in 1982 , was in the process of becoming a german citizen when he was arrested in pakistan in late 2001 on suspicion of supporting afghanistan 's former taliban rulers .
he was handed over to us authorities , who took him to afghanistan and then to guantanamo bay in cuba where he was held for four years until his release in august 2006 . us investigators claimed that kurnaz , who hails from the northern german city of bremen , was an " enemy combatant " with links to al-qaeda . kurnaz was released in august 2006 because of a lack of proof that he belonged to a terrorist organization . since his return to germany , kurnaz has alleged that he was abused by german soldiers during his detainment in afghanistan .
he has also said he suffered abuse in guantanamo bay including psychological torture and undernourishment . in november , kurnaz described his ordeal at the hands of german soldiers during a meeting with members of the european parliament .

csu leader and bavarian premier edmund stoiber has been one of the chief opponents of the reform , fearing that wealthy german states such as his own would carry the majority of the financial burden of the planned changes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu leader and bavarian state premier edmund stoiber stoiber , however , signaled his readiness to compromise and said he was confident the draft law would take effect on april 1 as planned . " i am optimistic that the healthcare reform will go into force as agreed , " he told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . old plans ring in new year the beginning of january is a traditional time for germany 's political parties to map out their policies for the year ahead with the spd and the free-market liberal free democrats holding important meetings over the weekend . labor markets reforms were the main policy focus of the two-day spd leadership gathering in the northern german city of bremen . among the reform proposals agreed were the introduction of a minimum wage and a scheme to reduce the amount of social contributions for low earners as a way of getting long-term unemployed back to work .
the spd also put forward an idea to guarantee all-day childcare , paid for by the government , to all children between the agea of one and five . spd to sharpen party profile the policies decided over the weekend were a clear attempt to appeal to the center-left party 's traditional base .
with many supporters complaining that the party has abandoned social principles and that its policies have become indistinct from those of the cdu , senior spd members wanted to sharpen the party 's profile . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd chairman kurt beck spd party chairman kurt beck told the meeting that the party would focus more on ensuring that social welfare was not neglected . " people that are prepared to work have to receive special recognition , but the weak must not be allowed to drop by the wayside , " he said . the social democrats have recently been losing ground in the ratings with support dropping by 1 percent to 30 percent in one of the most recent opinion polls conducted by german public broadcaster ard .
meanwhile the cdu achieved a six-month high of 36 percent in the same survey . liberals to show social side germany 's grand coalition government came under attack at saturday 's meeting of the opposition free democrats in the southwestern german city of stuttgart .

that number represents an increase from 690 cases in 2005 and 620 cases in 2004 . the suspects come from all parts of society , achim traichel , director of the five-person internet investigation group , said in an interview with the stuttgarter zeitung .
bankers , doctors , factory workers , and even fellow police officers have all been investigated , he added . the team 's cyber research led to a high-ranking member of stuttgart 's police force , whose computer was found to contain some 1,000 examples of child pornography . though the material was discovered in march 2006 , the police department kept the case under wraps until the press became aware of it in mid-december .

but that does n't matter to recent young recruits such as norbert kagarlitzkij who said he is pretty relaxed about being jewish - and about serving in the german army . " it is just part of the deal of being a young german , " he said .
" germans have to go to the army for a while or do alternative community service .
so should we . " more than 60 years after the holocaust , it still comes as a surprise to many to hear that german jews serve in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr .
after the war , the central council of jews in germany and the defense ministry made a deal that exempted jews up to the third generation of holocaust victims , from serving in the military .
but these days , there are an estimated 200 jews serving in the 250,000-strong german military .
and many say that number is growing . a matter of duty before the nazis , many jews had served in the german army - in world war i , for example .
the bundeswehr was founded in 1955 .
for decades afterward , most jewish germans would not have dreamed of serving in the military . michael fürst was one of the first to do so even though two of his grandparents were killed by the nazis .
he said he felt it was his duty and should be seen as something normal . " in 1966 , in jewish circles , the bundeswehr was not viewed as a new army but as the heir and successor of the army that took part in killing the jews , " he said .
" i did n't have to join the bundeswehr .
i could have requested an exemption which was always granted to people whose families had been persecuted by the nazi regime . " the so-called normality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many equated the early bundeswehr with the nazis more than 200,000 jews now live in germany .
most of them are recent immigrants from the former soviet union .
many of these immigrants , in particular , seem to have fewer qualms about serving in the german army as do the third and fourth generation of german jews . " there is a lot of talk about so-called normality , " said stephan kramer , secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" that we are talking about this subject is a sign of it .
in fact , many young men and women in the jewish community , especially among immigrant families , seriously consider careers in the armed forces .

but that does n't matter to recent young recruits such as norbert kagarlitzkij who said he is pretty relaxed about being jewish - and about serving in the german army . " it is just part of the deal of being a young german , " he said .
" germans have to go to the army for a while or do alternative community service .
so should we . " more than 60 years after the holocaust , it still comes as a surprise to many to hear that german jews serve in the german armed forces , the bundeswehr .
after the war , the central council of jews in germany and the defense ministry made a deal that exempted jews up to the third generation of holocaust victims , from serving in the military .
but these days , there are an estimated 200 jews serving in the 250,000-strong german military .
and many say that number is growing . a matter of duty before the nazis , many jews had served in the german army - in world war i , for example .
the bundeswehr was founded in 1955 .
for decades afterward , most jewish germans would not have dreamed of serving in the military . michael fürst was one of the first to do so even though two of his grandparents were killed by the nazis .
he said he felt it was his duty and should be seen as something normal . " in 1966 , in jewish circles , the bundeswehr was not viewed as a new army but as the heir and successor of the army that took part in killing the jews , " he said .
" i did n't have to join the bundeswehr .
i could have requested an exemption which was always granted to people whose families had been persecuted by the nazi regime . " the so-called normality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many equated the early bundeswehr with the nazis more than 200,000 jews now live in germany .
most of them are recent immigrants from the former soviet union .
many of these immigrants , in particular , seem to have fewer qualms about serving in the german army as do the third and fourth generation of german jews . " there is a lot of talk about so-called normality , " said stephan kramer , secretary-general of the central council of jews in germany .
" that we are talking about this subject is a sign of it .
in fact , many young men and women in the jewish community , especially among immigrant families , seriously consider careers in the armed forces .
obviously , the rules and regulations have to change with the times . " putting one 's foot in it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german army is on peacekeeping missions around the world most jews that join the german army say they have n't had a hard time fitting in , either . " they are curious about what it 's like to be a jew , " kagarlizkij said of his non-jewish counterparts .
" most of the people i have met in the bundeswehr had never had anything to do with jews . " rabbi walter homolka , an army reserve officer who advises the armed forces , said that the germany military is almost too afraid of offending jews . " one source of tension is that the bundeswehr is too worried about doing something wrong , " homolka said .
" our task , as jews , is to point out to the army where it should be careful .
but the level of concern needs to be lowered ... the constant fear of putting one 's foot in it . " a democratic army students at berlin 's liberal rabbinical seminary , founded in 1999 , have to do a brief internship with a military .

lead researcher dr dorothy supp explained : " cultured skin substitutes are improving the lives of many burn patients , but they also have limitations - including an increased susceptibility to infection .
" because cultured skin grafts are n't connected to the circulatory system at the time of grafting , they are n't immediately exposed to circulating antibiotic drugs or antibodies from the body 's immune system to fight off infection . "

"
mr gates was speaking on the eve of the world 's largest hi-tech conference , the consumer electronics show .
he told delegates that " connected experiences " were now the most important part of new technologies .
" young people spend more time with their windows pc than watching tv , " he said .
people want to do things with their content across multiple platforms bill gates in a speech with few concrete announcements , mr gates outlined how his firm 's latest operating system vista would be the tool to connect people .
" people want to do things with their content across multiple platforms , " he said .
he said the hardware and content had been put in place " and the key thing missing is the connections " .
as part of the keynote presentation , mr gates invited other microsoft executives on to the stage to explain how products connected people .
justin hutchinson , group product manager , demonstrated a range of new features in vista , many of which seemed designed to counter arguments from some observers that apple was the home of creative computing .
iptv pledge new features unveiled included a document back-up tool called shadow copy , a new dvd photo gallery tool and a piece of software which corrects mistakes in digital photographs .
robbie bach , president of entertainment devices at microsoft , revealed that the company had sold more than 10.4m xbox 360s by the end of 2006 .
tomorrow 's world blog bill 's speech talked of connected experiences , but it lacked a bit of zing darren waters , bbc news website tech editor read darren 's piece in full mr bach told delegates that microsoft 's work in developing iptv -lrb- internet protocol tv -rrb- , which allows programmes to be delivered live or on demand over an internet connection , would soon come to xbox 360 games consoles .
by the end of 2007 partner companies will be offering iptv services to xbox 360 owners , he said .
mr gates also unveiled a new product in conjunction with hp which lets people store all their data on a central device and access from any number of windows-connected products , including the zune portable music player , the xbox 360 , pcs and phones .
the windows home server is a storage system which can hold more than one terabyte of data .
last keynote speech photos , music and videos can be saved to the system and accessed from many other devices in the home and even remotely via the internet .
hp is launching the first product designed around windows home server software , called the hp media smart server .
a range of new pcs from third-party companies using vista were unveiled at the show , including a white , round media centre pc from sony designed for watching of movies and music playback in the living room and a touch screen pc from hp .

born in cardiff 's old docklands , shirley veronica bassey was the seventh child of henry and eliza bassey .
she is the only singer to have recorded more than one james bond theme song - including goldfinger , diamonds are forever and moonraker .
dame shirley is officially " on holiday " for her 70th but a spokesperson said she has a new single out in february .
this song , the living tree , has been performed by dame shirley on itv 's another audience with and throughout her recent uk tour .
dame shirley bassey was born in the area of cardiff known as tiger bay - a multi-ethnic , working class community .
her father henry was a seaman of nigerian ancestry and mother eliza from northern england .
she was spotted singing in local clubs as a teenager , leading to a career in showbusiness which has spanned more than 50 years .
back home in a patriotic dress for a concert of welsh voices in 1999 recording the james bond theme goldfinger in 1964 hurtled an already successful performer further into the public eye and led to two more movie theme blockbusters in the 1970s diamonds are forever and moonraker .
a period largely out of the public eye followed in the 1980s but in the late 1990s she stormed back with history repeating , a collaboration with bath 's propellerheads .
although she now lives in monte carlo , dame shirley has maintained her links with wales and - despite , once famously saying she did not want to be appearing on stage with a walking stick - still regularly performs .
she topped the bill at the opening of the welsh assembly in 1999 , and dueted the anthem world in union with bryn terfel for the rugby world cup in 2000 , the year she was made a dame at buckingham palace .
in august 2006 she also appeared at terfel 's annual faenol festival in north wales and more recently in a bond-style christmas commercial for a high street retailer .

born in cardiff 's old docklands , shirley veronica bassey was the seventh child of henry and eliza bassey .
she is the only singer to have recorded more than one james bond theme song - including goldfinger , diamonds are forever and moonraker .
dame shirley is officially " on holiday " for her 70th but a spokesperson said she has a new single out in february .
this song , the living tree , has been performed by dame shirley on itv 's another audience with and throughout her recent uk tour .
dame shirley bassey was born in the area of cardiff known as tiger bay - a multi-ethnic , working class community .
her father henry was a seaman of nigerian ancestry and mother eliza from northern england .
she was spotted singing in local clubs as a teenager , leading to a career in showbusiness which has spanned more than 50 years .
back home in a patriotic dress for a concert of welsh voices in 1999 recording the james bond theme goldfinger in 1964 hurtled an already successful performer further into the public eye and led to two more movie theme blockbusters in the 1970s diamonds are forever and moonraker .
a period largely out of the public eye followed in the 1980s but in the late 1990s she stormed back with history repeating , a collaboration with bath 's propellerheads .
although she now lives in monte carlo , dame shirley has maintained her links with wales and - despite , once famously saying she did not want to be appearing on stage with a walking stick - still regularly performs .
she topped the bill at the opening of the welsh assembly in 1999 , and dueted the anthem world in union with bryn terfel for the rugby world cup in 2000 , the year she was made a dame at buckingham palace .
in august 2006 she also appeared at terfel 's annual faenol festival in north wales and more recently in a bond-style christmas commercial for a high street retailer .

if you have been " plutoed " you have been demoted or devalued , just as happened to the former planet pluto when its status was downgraded .
a " climate canary " is something whose poor health indicates a looming environmental catastrophe .

" it was good that the society focused on a genuine scientific concern , though i believe the nomination came in from outer space , " said committee chairman professor wayne glowka .
racial slur the general assembly of the international astronomical union decided last year that pluto did not meet its new definition of a planet and would be categorised as a dwarf planet instead .
other words in the running were : flog - an advertisement disguised as a blog or web log prohibited liquids - " fluids that can not be transported by passengers on airplanes " macaca - " an american citizen treated as an alien " macaca is considered by some to be a racial slur .
former senator george allen had a comfortable lead in the polls ahead of last november 's congressional elections when he referred to the son of indian immigrants as a macaca .
mr allen lost to democrat jim webb .
members of the 117-year-old ads include academics , writers , editors and linguists .

the group have reached number nine with their single , chasing cars , which first charted at number six last july .
previously , downloads only counted towards the chart if the song was available to buy on other formats .
the revamp did not alter the top spots in the single and album charts , which leona lewis and take that took again .
big shake-up lewis , who won the itv show the x factor , has now been at number one for three weeks with her single a moment like this .
the highest new entry comes from eric prydz , whose remix of the pink floyd classic another brick in the wall enters the chart at number two .
there are also new hits for u2 and jojo - whose single , too little too late , would not have been eligible for the chart until next week under the previous rules .

the new rules have been hailed as the biggest shake-up in the chart since its inception in 1952 , and could mean old favourites might make their way back .
until now downloads only counted towards chart positions if they were purchased within a week of the physical single being released and two weeks of it being deleted .
but this week 's top 40 sees several deleted songs re-entering the chart , including crazy by gnarls barkley which was the biggest selling single of 2006 , and is now at number 30 .
broader representation nelly furtado 's maneater also re-appears at number 38 after originally making number one in june last year .
outside the top 40 , four songs from the high school musical soundtrack have entered the chart - including two that were previously considered album tracks .
michael andrews and gary jules ' single mad world , the christmas number one in 2003 , is another re-entry at number 58 .
the song , which featured in the cult movie donnie darko and can currently be heard in the advert for xbox 360 game gears of war , made its last chart appearance april 2004 .

it is rumoured emi is considering releasing the beatles ' back catalogue as downloads for the first time .

" the sale of flat-panel tvs will outpace that of projection tvs and traditional flat picture tube tvs in terms of both value and volume this year , " the group said in a statement .
however , the company did warn that the global market would also face stiffer competition , and further falls in margins as companies cut prices to boost sales .
profit vow samsung digital media president choi gee-sung made the promise during a press conference at the consumer electronics show in las vegas .
he also said the division was eyeing profits of 1 trillion won -lrb- $ 1bn ; £ 517m -rrb- for 2007 .
the comment came despite samsung posting a drop in third quarter operating profits in october .
profits for the three months to 30 september hit 1.85 trillion won -lrb- $ 1.8bn ; £ 1bn -rrb- , down from 2.13 trillion won in the same period of 2005 .

he worked with bowie again on his recent albums heathen and reality .
in an interview to mark bowie 's 60th birthday , visconti tells the bbc news website why he thinks bowie has endured and reflects on a partnership that began 40 years ago . "
i met david when he was 20 , in my office in oxford street .
he seemed very nervous but communicated very articulately - about everything under the sun !
we were supposed to talk about working together , but we ended up talking about buddhism , obscure recordings and foreign films .
we ended our first interview by going to the cinema to see a knife in the water by roman polanski . "
it was so important that the words matched the impact of the radical music we had already recorded " tony visconti he is great fun to work with .
his charming sense of humour and confidence pervades the recording studio and everyone is affected by it .
he has great ideas and surrounds himself with very talented musicians who embellish those ideas .
he is very respectful towards his co-workers , encourages creativity from them and fully credits others for their input .
whilst working on the album heroes he laboured with his lyric writing .
it was hard for him to go home and write lyrics .
lyrical struggles it was so important that the words matched the impact of the radical music we had already recorded .
consequently , he composed his lyrics writing and singing them two lines at a time in front of the microphone .
he 'd tell me to put the tape machine into record and when he finished two lines he 'd say " stop " .
then he 'd scribble two more lines and ask for them to be recorded immediately after the last two lines .
i have never worked with another artist who could do that !
his voice is much deeper and his music is more complicated now .
some of the songs on heathen and reality could only be written by a more mature bowie .
the subject matter in these albums is far more philosophical in nature than the 70s music .
' rule-breaker ' bowie is the most flexible of all rock stars .
he never got stuck in a rut .
i 'm sure some of his fans would still love to see him in his ziggy regalia , but david is still around these days , and still very vital , because he killed off his older " personas " .
he is an innovator who 's proved time and again that the only way to make music a vital part of our culture is to continue to break the rules .
he has given birth to movements in rock where his imitators actually did better than him in record sales , like kiss and alice cooper .
there is nothing down-to-earth about his motivation .
rock music has only been one influence on him .
he 's drawn artistic inspiration from jazz , music theatre , classical music , electronic music , asian arts and philosophies and punk , to name a few !
he 's managed to amalgamate all of his influences and come up with new genres . "
i would love to make at least one more album with him " tony visconti in some way i think you 've got the ultimate david bowie in the album hunky dory .
it is one of my favourites and i did n't even produce it .
since 1967 , when we started working together , we have influenced each other .
whenever we work together we spend as much time talking about many non-musical topics as we do recording music .
he sends me a lot of new music i have n't heard before .
i 'm not working with him now and , as far as i know , he 's not making a new album with anyone else .
