the admissions have cast a shadow over the telekom team 's tour de france victories in the 1990s . pressure is mounting both on team telekom 's successor t-mobile and its former stars bjarne riis and jan ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1996 and 1997 respectively , after statements by two teammates from that period . earlier this week , ex-telekom-rider bert dietz said doctors had given him injections of epo , a banned substance that increases the production of red blood cells , in 1995 .
in an interview on german public television , dietz quoted the doctors as saying : " if we want to be riding at the front of the pack , we 'll probably have to try out this new substance . " dietz 's former teammate christian henn also owned up to taking epo .
" the time was such , " he told the daily kölner stadtanzeiger newspaper , " that otherwise we would n't reasonably have been able to compete .
it was all or nothing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the riders say doctors gave them epo at training in mallorca in 1995 the two ex-riders ' statements support allegations recently made in a book by telekom 's former masseur , jef d 'hont , that doping was rampant at telekom during the team 's glory years . german cycling star jan ullrich , who was fired from t-mobile last year after suspicions of being involved in a separate scheme to use enhanced blood , has refused to comment on any doping allegations . but t-mobile 's former sporting director walter godefroot has denied the allegations , accusing dietz of financial interest in making his confession . team 's future in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results of urine tests have meant big trouble for professional cycling the university hospital of freiburg in southern germany said it is temporarily suspending two doctors implicated in the admission , pending the results of an investigation by an independent committee . the hospital , which is one of germany 's most renowned sports medicine facilities , also said it would end its association with t-mobile . team t-mobile 's sponsor , deutsche telekom , will offer an official reaction to dietz and henn 's statements at a press conference on thursday , amidst speculations that it might discontinue its cycling activities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : questions are being asked about titles won by riis and ullrich " the question is whether we believe cycling can be cleaned up , " stephan althoff , telekom 's head of sponsoring , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" if not , we 'll have to take appropriate action , " he said . admissions of doping from former members of one of cycling 's premier teams is further bad news for the beleaguered sport - 2006 tour de france winner floyd landis is still being investigated for abnormally high levels of testosterone and could well be stripped of his title . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dna test links former german cycling star to doping scandal german prosecutors have confirmed that blood found during a spanish anti-doping investigation came from disgraced german cyclist jan ullrich .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 23.05.2007 milan face two opponents in liverpool and foolish revenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool and ac milan in 2005 ac milan have waited two years to avenge the 2005 champions league final defeat to liverpool .
now , with revenge within their grasp , dw-world.de ’ s nick amies hopes the fires of retribution consume the italians . revenge .
it ’ s a dish best served cold , according to certain sicilian families in the " waste disposal " business .
it also seems to be the whispered word on the lips of the milanese as the champions league final gets ever nearer . two years appears to be long enough for the flames of vengeance to have cooled sufficiently for the fans and players of ac milan .
now , with the chance to avenge the 2005 defeat to liverpool just hours away , the rossoneri are blowing new life on those smoldering embers of retribution while claiming to be doing nothing of the sort .
despite the protestations of the more cerebral members of carlo ancelotti ’ s team of world cup winners and superstars , a burning desire for justice is surely flickering in the minds of those who suffered such ignominious defeat in istanbul ’ s ataturk stadium .
for every kaka who says that the past means nothing , there is a rino gattuso snarling at the end of his master ’ s leash , waiting to chomp the legs of those who wounded his pride and crushed his dream .
even milan ’ s coach can not resist throwing the odd bowl of tepid bitterness into his italian designer microwave .
liverpool , ancelotti suggests , are the least technical of the three premiership teams to reach the champions league semi-finals this year .
he would have much preferred playing manchester united in the final .
but of course he would !
he beat them . motivational tool bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool celebrate the win in 2005 to suggest that the defeat on penalties in the 2005 final , after leading liverpool 3-0 at half-time , will not feature as a motivational tool or pre-match topic in the milan dressing room is preposterous . it was not only a sporting defeat , but a spiritual loss akin to the grief that follows the death of a relative .
the six-time winners had their hands on the cup and a ragged , surprise package team of opponents on the ropes . as far as milan were concerned , they weren ’ t even playing the best side in england , let alone a team equal to themselves in europe .
and yet , they lost .
a latin proverb states that " revenge is a confession of pain . "
you can only imagine the pain milan felt at the end .
to even consider that the night of may 25 , 2005 will not be on the minds of at least some of the milanese is ludicrous .
all of which suits liverpool just fine .
while the impression one gets of milan is one of a team pacing the floor in barely contained anticipation , checking their diamond-encrusted watches and chewing furiously on gum which has long lost its taste , the liverpool camp seems almost trappist in comparison.h how not to behave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool 's gabriel paletta , right , and javier mascherano while plotting the reds ’ downfall by watching dvds of their games and sending scouts to merseyside , carlo ancelotti should have added a compilation of jose mourinho sound bites to his preparatory files .
he would then know that hot air disperses very quickly in the skies over anfield .
the chelsea coach is a textbook example of how not to behave before facing liverpool in a crunch match .
put-downs and barbs just rebound off the armor liverpool coach rafa benitez keeps his charges encased in .
insults thrown in their direction come back infuriatingly unanswered - and warmed-up plates of two-year old revenge just end up in your lap .
benitez is a master tactician and a statistical obsessive to the point of compulsion .
nothing is allowed to interfere with how he wants his team to work and think .
talk of revenge and playground insults over style do not feature in his game plan and he will not allow any of the polemic coming from italy to distract his players .
if the memory of istanbul is invoked in any way , it will be used to remind his players that going a goal – or even three - down does not necessarily mean the game is over .
liverpool came to the 2005 final blinking in the lights of an event none of them as players had ever experienced before .
by the time many of them even realized what was going on , it was half over and they had a mountain to climb . but the fact that they climbed that mountain and stuck a red flag of victory in the summit , in addition to the two seasons of improvement under benitez which followed , means that this liverpool team is a very different proposition to the one which made a mockery of the odds .
new stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool coach rafael benitez benitez has new stars at his disposal after culling the squad of those players that did not fit his style or reach his high standards .
strikers peter crouch , dirk kuyt and craig bellamy all offer many different options in attack ; winger jermaine pennant provides added width , pace and improved delivery from the flanks , midfielder javier mascherano adds bite and cover to allow steven gerrard and xabi alonso the license to create .
the defense that was torn apart in istanbul is now marshalled by a more mature and flawless jamie carragher with his new protégé , the hugely driven and accomplished danny agger , by his side .
each new addition has been brought in to fill a specific role and to play a certain way in the coach ’ s vision of how liverpool should operate ; a specialist cog for every part of the machine .
so if milan take to the field on wednesday night burning with the desire to exact revenge , then the victory for liverpool will be half won .
a cool mind is needed and rafael benitez will have kept each of his players in refrigeration before the game .
against a combustible side wanting blood , liverpool can think and play their way into a position of dominance and then let the game plan and undoubted talent of this 2007 model finish the job .
because , as another well-known quote suggests , revenge proves its own executioner . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ac milan win champions league final manchester lose 3:0 to ac milan ; chelsea lose out on penalties -lrb- 02.05.2007 -rrb- chelsea wins narrowly in champions league semifinal joe cole scored the only goal of the game as chelsea emerged from the first leg of their champions league semi-final with a 1-0 advantage over liverpool to take to anfield .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 23.05.2007 milan face two opponents in liverpool and foolish revenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool and ac milan in 2005 ac milan have waited two years to avenge the 2005 champions league final defeat to liverpool .
now , with revenge within their grasp , dw-world.de ’ s nick amies hopes the fires of retribution consume the italians . revenge .
it ’ s a dish best served cold , according to certain sicilian families in the " waste disposal " business .
it also seems to be the whispered word on the lips of the milanese as the champions league final gets ever nearer . two years appears to be long enough for the flames of vengeance to have cooled sufficiently for the fans and players of ac milan .
now , with the chance to avenge the 2005 defeat to liverpool just hours away , the rossoneri are blowing new life on those smoldering embers of retribution while claiming to be doing nothing of the sort .
despite the protestations of the more cerebral members of carlo ancelotti ’ s team of world cup winners and superstars , a burning desire for justice is surely flickering in the minds of those who suffered such ignominious defeat in istanbul ’ s ataturk stadium .
for every kaka who says that the past means nothing , there is a rino gattuso snarling at the end of his master ’ s leash , waiting to chomp the legs of those who wounded his pride and crushed his dream .
even milan ’ s coach can not resist throwing the odd bowl of tepid bitterness into his italian designer microwave .
liverpool , ancelotti suggests , are the least technical of the three premiership teams to reach the champions league semi-finals this year .
he would have much preferred playing manchester united in the final .
but of course he would !
he beat them . motivational tool bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool celebrate the win in 2005 to suggest that the defeat on penalties in the 2005 final , after leading liverpool 3-0 at half-time , will not feature as a motivational tool or pre-match topic in the milan dressing room is preposterous . it was not only a sporting defeat , but a spiritual loss akin to the grief that follows the death of a relative .
the six-time winners had their hands on the cup and a ragged , surprise package team of opponents on the ropes . as far as milan were concerned , they weren ’ t even playing the best side in england , let alone a team equal to themselves in europe .
and yet , they lost .
a latin proverb states that " revenge is a confession of pain . "
you can only imagine the pain milan felt at the end .
to even consider that the night of may 25 , 2005 will not be on the minds of at least some of the milanese is ludicrous .
all of which suits liverpool just fine .
while the impression one gets of milan is one of a team pacing the floor in barely contained anticipation , checking their diamond-encrusted watches and chewing furiously on gum which has long lost its taste , the liverpool camp seems almost trappist in comparison.h how not to behave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool 's gabriel paletta , right , and javier mascherano while plotting the reds ’ downfall by watching dvds of their games and sending scouts to merseyside , carlo ancelotti should have added a compilation of jose mourinho sound bites to his preparatory files .
he would then know that hot air disperses very quickly in the skies over anfield .
the chelsea coach is a textbook example of how not to behave before facing liverpool in a crunch match .
put-downs and barbs just rebound off the armor liverpool coach rafa benitez keeps his charges encased in .
insults thrown in their direction come back infuriatingly unanswered - and warmed-up plates of two-year old revenge just end up in your lap .
benitez is a master tactician and a statistical obsessive to the point of compulsion .
nothing is allowed to interfere with how he wants his team to work and think .
talk of revenge and playground insults over style do not feature in his game plan and he will not allow any of the polemic coming from italy to distract his players .
if the memory of istanbul is invoked in any way , it will be used to remind his players that going a goal – or even three - down does not necessarily mean the game is over .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 23.05.2007 milan face two opponents in liverpool and foolish revenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool and ac milan in 2005 ac milan have waited two years to avenge the 2005 champions league final defeat to liverpool .
now , with revenge within their grasp , dw-world.de ’ s nick amies hopes the fires of retribution consume the italians . revenge .
it ’ s a dish best served cold , according to certain sicilian families in the " waste disposal " business .
it also seems to be the whispered word on the lips of the milanese as the champions league final gets ever nearer . two years appears to be long enough for the flames of vengeance to have cooled sufficiently for the fans and players of ac milan .
now , with the chance to avenge the 2005 defeat to liverpool just hours away , the rossoneri are blowing new life on those smoldering embers of retribution while claiming to be doing nothing of the sort .
despite the protestations of the more cerebral members of carlo ancelotti ’ s team of world cup winners and superstars , a burning desire for justice is surely flickering in the minds of those who suffered such ignominious defeat in istanbul ’ s ataturk stadium .
for every kaka who says that the past means nothing , there is a rino gattuso snarling at the end of his master ’ s leash , waiting to chomp the legs of those who wounded his pride and crushed his dream .
even milan ’ s coach can not resist throwing the odd bowl of tepid bitterness into his italian designer microwave .
liverpool , ancelotti suggests , are the least technical of the three premiership teams to reach the champions league semi-finals this year .
he would have much preferred playing manchester united in the final .
but of course he would !
he beat them . motivational tool bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool celebrate the win in 2005 to suggest that the defeat on penalties in the 2005 final , after leading liverpool 3-0 at half-time , will not feature as a motivational tool or pre-match topic in the milan dressing room is preposterous . it was not only a sporting defeat , but a spiritual loss akin to the grief that follows the death of a relative .
the six-time winners had their hands on the cup and a ragged , surprise package team of opponents on the ropes . as far as milan were concerned , they weren ’ t even playing the best side in england , let alone a team equal to themselves in europe .
and yet , they lost .
a latin proverb states that " revenge is a confession of pain . "
you can only imagine the pain milan felt at the end .
to even consider that the night of may 25 , 2005 will not be on the minds of at least some of the milanese is ludicrous .
all of which suits liverpool just fine .
while the impression one gets of milan is one of a team pacing the floor in barely contained anticipation , checking their diamond-encrusted watches and chewing furiously on gum which has long lost its taste , the liverpool camp seems almost trappist in comparison.h how not to behave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool 's gabriel paletta , right , and javier mascherano while plotting the reds ’ downfall by watching dvds of their games and sending scouts to merseyside , carlo ancelotti should have added a compilation of jose mourinho sound bites to his preparatory files .
he would then know that hot air disperses very quickly in the skies over anfield .
the chelsea coach is a textbook example of how not to behave before facing liverpool in a crunch match .
put-downs and barbs just rebound off the armor liverpool coach rafa benitez keeps his charges encased in .
insults thrown in their direction come back infuriatingly unanswered - and warmed-up plates of two-year old revenge just end up in your lap .
benitez is a master tactician and a statistical obsessive to the point of compulsion .
nothing is allowed to interfere with how he wants his team to work and think .
talk of revenge and playground insults over style do not feature in his game plan and he will not allow any of the polemic coming from italy to distract his players .
if the memory of istanbul is invoked in any way , it will be used to remind his players that going a goal – or even three - down does not necessarily mean the game is over .
liverpool came to the 2005 final blinking in the lights of an event none of them as players had ever experienced before .
by the time many of them even realized what was going on , it was half over and they had a mountain to climb . but the fact that they climbed that mountain and stuck a red flag of victory in the summit , in addition to the two seasons of improvement under benitez which followed , means that this liverpool team is a very different proposition to the one which made a mockery of the odds .
new stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool coach rafael benitez benitez has new stars at his disposal after culling the squad of those players that did not fit his style or reach his high standards .
strikers peter crouch , dirk kuyt and craig bellamy all offer many different options in attack ; winger jermaine pennant provides added width , pace and improved delivery from the flanks , midfielder javier mascherano adds bite and cover to allow steven gerrard and xabi alonso the license to create .
the defense that was torn apart in istanbul is now marshalled by a more mature and flawless jamie carragher with his new protégé , the hugely driven and accomplished danny agger , by his side .
each new addition has been brought in to fill a specific role and to play a certain way in the coach ’ s vision of how liverpool should operate ; a specialist cog for every part of the machine .
so if milan take to the field on wednesday night burning with the desire to exact revenge , then the victory for liverpool will be half won .
a cool mind is needed and rafael benitez will have kept each of his players in refrigeration before the game .
against a combustible side wanting blood , liverpool can think and play their way into a position of dominance and then let the game plan and undoubted talent of this 2007 model finish the job .
because , as another well-known quote suggests , revenge proves its own executioner . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ac milan win champions league final manchester lose 3:0 to ac milan ; chelsea lose out on penalties -lrb- 02.05.2007 -rrb- chelsea wins narrowly in champions league semifinal joe cole scored the only goal of the game as chelsea emerged from the first leg of their champions league semi-final with a 1-0 advantage over liverpool to take to anfield .

three of the pictures are by performance artist vladislav mamychev-monroe .
in the photoworks , he portrays himself as a hysterical adolf hitler , a plastic-bearded osama bin laden and a cat-loving pope benedict .
another work by aidan salakhova portrays a burkha-clad muslim clasping a miniature minaret with distinctly phallic connotations .
two of the other pictures by the blue noses group and by konstantin latyshev make satirical reference to the russian president .
the blue noses pose as vladimir putin , russian cultural idol alexander pushkin and christ .
latyshev 's work is a poster that merges the features of the president and pushkin .
ersatz images bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by vladislav mamyshev-monroe , from the series » starz « : osama bin laden , adolf hitler , pope , 2005 the dresden museum has responded to the events by displaying small-scaled reproductions on paper of the works in the spaces where the originals were meant to hang .
johannes schmidt , curator of the exhibition called " learning from moscow , " said he had been informed by the company involved in the transportation of the pictures that customs officers had refused to issue export licences for the art works .
the transport company had been informed that they were not being released for fear of causing international protest .
" i am not really surprised .
this exhibition is directly concerned with art that concerns itself with contemporary global themes and with political realities in today 's russia , " schmidt said .
" the climate in russia is getting tougher as the elections approach and relations have also become frostier with germany recently . "
harmless jokes he said the pictures , while clearly a little irreverent in character , were " harmless jokes . "
other works by the artists involved have gone on show in dresden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a putin / pushkin mutation by konstantin latyshev the curator does not believe the export stop was an order that came from above , but came from people at lower levels being overenthusiastic in their desire to please political higher-ups .
" i am not someone who pleads for total freedom for art because that would mean allowing far-right images and child pornography .
but apart from that artists should have as much freedom as possible , " he said .
" the artists have taken a long time to gain international attention .
collectors are just becoming interested in them .
this is putting a brake on this .
that has a certain tragic quality , " he added .
recently , a british gallery owner was prevented from taking another picture by the blue noses out of the country .
it showed the trio of artists donning masks depicting photos of putin , bush and bin laden .
when he legally challenged the move , the work was released .
schmidt said that the museum had decided not to officially protest against the action because budgetary constraints meant that they would not be able to pay for a second transport . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de peter sodann peter sodann is an actor is best known in germany for playing commissioner bruno ehrlicher in the german drama " crime scene " .

russian president vladimir putin begins a two day visit to vienna , austria .
but what was supposed to be a state visit based on trade and energy issues may be hijacked by human rights topics . russian president vladimir putin said wednesday that new eu members need to " get over past phobias " that are poisoning relations between russia and the union .
" we do not have particular problems with the eu .
we have had certain difficulties with our nearby neighbors , " putin told a press conference during an official visit to vienna .
" the soviet union is in part to blame but our european partners must get over past phobias , " he added .
" with the eu enlargement these problems now belong to the european union .
this does not contribute to rapid evolution of relations " with moscow , putin insisted .
a russian embargo on polish meat imports is at the heart of a deepening political crisis between moscow and brussels that has blocked talks on a new eu-russia accord since late last year .
relations have also been strained by a dispute over energy exports to lithuania and a bitter controversy over the removal of a soviet war monument in estonia .
putin 's trip closely follows a tense summit last week in which relations between the eu and russia dipped to a new low over issues such as human rights , and a trade dispute with poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin planned to talk business with his austrian hosts calls from activists amnesty international , the international helsinki federation and reporters without borders are staging protests .
rubina möhring , the president of reporters without borders in austria , called for politicians to link human rights and media freedoms to business deals .
" i would like them to say to mr. putin to act in the way that human rights and press freedom are respected in russia , and that this behavior could influence the discussion about the economic treaties as well , " möhring said .
the austrian president said he plans to raise issues of democracy and human rights with putin , but said this will be done behind closed doors and bilateral relations and business deals will dominate the visit .
pipeline control at issue like much of europe , austria is a big consumer of russian energy .
it is also a partner in the proposed nabucco pipeline , which will bring gas from the caspian sea to central europe - bypassing russia .
the trip gives moscow the chance to put its case as a reliable supplier and to do deals on energy cooperation .
edward christie , a vienna-based energy specialist and economist , said there is competition for control of the pipelines .

russian president vladimir putin begins a two day visit to vienna , austria .
but what was supposed to be a state visit based on trade and energy issues may be hijacked by human rights topics . russian president vladimir putin said wednesday that new eu members need to " get over past phobias " that are poisoning relations between russia and the union .
" we do not have particular problems with the eu .
we have had certain difficulties with our nearby neighbors , " putin told a press conference during an official visit to vienna .
" the soviet union is in part to blame but our european partners must get over past phobias , " he added .
" with the eu enlargement these problems now belong to the european union .
this does not contribute to rapid evolution of relations " with moscow , putin insisted .
a russian embargo on polish meat imports is at the heart of a deepening political crisis between moscow and brussels that has blocked talks on a new eu-russia accord since late last year .
relations have also been strained by a dispute over energy exports to lithuania and a bitter controversy over the removal of a soviet war monument in estonia .
putin 's trip closely follows a tense summit last week in which relations between the eu and russia dipped to a new low over issues such as human rights , and a trade dispute with poland .

in an interview on german public television , dietz quoted the doctors as saying : " if we want to be riding at the front of the pack , we 'll probably have to try out this new substance . " dietz 's former teammate christian henn also owned up to taking epo .

three of the pictures are by performance artist vladislav mamychev-monroe .
in the photoworks , he portrays himself as a hysterical adolf hitler , a plastic-bearded osama bin laden and a cat-loving pope benedict .
another work by aidan salakhova portrays a burkha-clad muslim clasping a miniature minaret with distinctly phallic connotations .
two of the other pictures by the blue noses group and by konstantin latyshev make satirical reference to the russian president .
the blue noses pose as vladimir putin , russian cultural idol alexander pushkin and christ .
latyshev 's work is a poster that merges the features of the president and pushkin .
ersatz images bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by vladislav mamyshev-monroe , from the series » starz « : osama bin laden , adolf hitler , pope , 2005 the dresden museum has responded to the events by displaying small-scaled reproductions on paper of the works in the spaces where the originals were meant to hang .
johannes schmidt , curator of the exhibition called " learning from moscow , " said he had been informed by the company involved in the transportation of the pictures that customs officers had refused to issue export licences for the art works .
the transport company had been informed that they were not being released for fear of causing international protest .
" i am not really surprised .
this exhibition is directly concerned with art that concerns itself with contemporary global themes and with political realities in today 's russia , " schmidt said .
" the climate in russia is getting tougher as the elections approach and relations have also become frostier with germany recently . "
harmless jokes he said the pictures , while clearly a little irreverent in character , were " harmless jokes . "
other works by the artists involved have gone on show in dresden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a putin / pushkin mutation by konstantin latyshev the curator does not believe the export stop was an order that came from above , but came from people at lower levels being overenthusiastic in their desire to please political higher-ups .
" i am not someone who pleads for total freedom for art because that would mean allowing far-right images and child pornography .
but apart from that artists should have as much freedom as possible , " he said .
" the artists have taken a long time to gain international attention .
collectors are just becoming interested in them .
this is putting a brake on this .
that has a certain tragic quality , " he added .
recently , a british gallery owner was prevented from taking another picture by the blue noses out of the country .
it showed the trio of artists donning masks depicting photos of putin , bush and bin laden .
when he legally challenged the move , the work was released .
schmidt said that the museum had decided not to officially protest against the action because budgetary constraints meant that they would not be able to pay for a second transport . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de peter sodann peter sodann is an actor is best known in germany for playing commissioner bruno ehrlicher in the german drama " crime scene " .

three of the pictures are by performance artist vladislav mamychev-monroe .
in the photoworks , he portrays himself as a hysterical adolf hitler , a plastic-bearded osama bin laden and a cat-loving pope benedict .
another work by aidan salakhova portrays a burkha-clad muslim clasping a miniature minaret with distinctly phallic connotations .
two of the other pictures by the blue noses group and by konstantin latyshev make satirical reference to the russian president .
the blue noses pose as vladimir putin , russian cultural idol alexander pushkin and christ .
latyshev 's work is a poster that merges the features of the president and pushkin .
ersatz images bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by vladislav mamyshev-monroe , from the series » starz « : osama bin laden , adolf hitler , pope , 2005 the dresden museum has responded to the events by displaying small-scaled reproductions on paper of the works in the spaces where the originals were meant to hang .
johannes schmidt , curator of the exhibition called " learning from moscow , " said he had been informed by the company involved in the transportation of the pictures that customs officers had refused to issue export licences for the art works .
the transport company had been informed that they were not being released for fear of causing international protest .
" i am not really surprised .
this exhibition is directly concerned with art that concerns itself with contemporary global themes and with political realities in today 's russia , " schmidt said .
" the climate in russia is getting tougher as the elections approach and relations have also become frostier with germany recently . "
harmless jokes he said the pictures , while clearly a little irreverent in character , were " harmless jokes . "
other works by the artists involved have gone on show in dresden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a putin / pushkin mutation by konstantin latyshev the curator does not believe the export stop was an order that came from above , but came from people at lower levels being overenthusiastic in their desire to please political higher-ups .
" i am not someone who pleads for total freedom for art because that would mean allowing far-right images and child pornography .
but apart from that artists should have as much freedom as possible , " he said .
" the artists have taken a long time to gain international attention .
collectors are just becoming interested in them .
this is putting a brake on this .
that has a certain tragic quality , " he added .
recently , a british gallery owner was prevented from taking another picture by the blue noses out of the country .
it showed the trio of artists donning masks depicting photos of putin , bush and bin laden .
when he legally challenged the move , the work was released .
schmidt said that the museum had decided not to officially protest against the action because budgetary constraints meant that they would not be able to pay for a second transport . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de peter sodann peter sodann is an actor is best known in germany for playing commissioner bruno ehrlicher in the german drama " crime scene " .

german police have collected body scent samples of left-wing activists in the lead up to the g8 summit .
some politicians accuse the government of resorting to the dubious methods of the east german secret police . " it 's unsavory that our intelligence officials are using methods that were also used by the stasi , " the deputy parliamentary leader of the opposition greens , hans-christian ströbele , told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper . the feared secret police of former communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- notoriously tried to capture and store the body scents of political dissidents so that sniffer dogs could trace them . wolfgang thierse , the deputy speaker of the bundestag lower house of parliament , accused the authorities of going overboard and warned them to refrain from a " hysteria that could lead to a police state similar to the gdr . " activists raided federal prosecutors confirmed on tuesday that police took scent samples earlier in the month when they raided sites in northern germany linked to suspected anti-globalization activists .
but they denied that they wanted to use the samples to sniff out g8 protestors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police say taking a scent sample is no different to taking a fingerprint a spokesman said samples were taken from five or six suspects in order to compare these with physical evidence found at the scene of past arson attacks . according to police , taking scent samples is as legal as taking fingerprints , and talks of the stasi were exaggerated . " ' stasi methods ' clearly refers to … techniques such as denunciation , blackmail and torture , but not to what is a valid legal police practice , " said konrad freiberg , the chairman of the federal police union , in a statement on wednesday . police should be able to use all methods " to preferably avert violence acts before they happen , " he said . strange idea however , wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the christian democratic parliamentary faction , said he found the whole practice of smell tracking " rather strange . " " you have a protester , the dog has a sniff and then he wags three times with his tail or barks - what 's supposed to happen then ? "
bosbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 protesters wo n't be able to come within 200m of the security fence at heiligendamm left-wing groups have warned the police that the recent raids angered their supporters and would only heighten their resolve to demonstrate at the g8 summit being held in the northern coastal town of heiligendamm from june 6 - 8 . protesters are also upset over a ban on protests at the g8 venue and the nearby airport , and are taking legal action to attempt to overturn it . it is believed that left-wing groups could be behind the torching on tuesday of the car belonging to the editor of bild , germany 's biggest-selling newspaper , and those of two businessmen last week . german authorities are expecting up to 100,000 activists to target the g8 summit being hosted by german chancellor angela merkel .
the leaders of the united states , russia , britain , france , italy , canada , and japan are to attend . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de interview " the stasi had a giant smell register of dissidents " german police have been accused of using stasi methods after admitting to using " scent profiling " of g8 activists .
in an interview , the head of the stasi museum in leipzig explains why the issue is so emotive .
-lrb- 24.05.2007 -rrb- german rights organizations accuse police of illegal activities according to a new report published by a group of nine german human rights organizations to mark constitutional day , german police and officials are increasingly using unconstitutional methods in their investigations .
-lrb- 23.05.2007 -rrb- activist speaks out " a new day is dawning for globalization critics " around 100,000 demonstrators are expected at the g8 summit in june .
dw-world.de spoke with sven giegold , one of the founders of attac , a group which describes itself as a skeptical of globalization , about the protests german police declare no-go zone for g8 protestors in a move criticized by left-wing groups , german authorities have said protestors will not be allowed near a baltic sea resort where g8 leaders will hold their june summit .

german police have collected body scent samples of left-wing activists in the lead up to the g8 summit .
some politicians accuse the government of resorting to the dubious methods of the east german secret police . " it 's unsavory that our intelligence officials are using methods that were also used by the stasi , " the deputy parliamentary leader of the opposition greens , hans-christian ströbele , told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper . the feared secret police of former communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- notoriously tried to capture and store the body scents of political dissidents so that sniffer dogs could trace them . wolfgang thierse , the deputy speaker of the bundestag lower house of parliament , accused the authorities of going overboard and warned them to refrain from a " hysteria that could lead to a police state similar to the gdr . " activists raided federal prosecutors confirmed on tuesday that police took scent samples earlier in the month when they raided sites in northern germany linked to suspected anti-globalization activists .
but they denied that they wanted to use the samples to sniff out g8 protestors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police say taking a scent sample is no different to taking a fingerprint a spokesman said samples were taken from five or six suspects in order to compare these with physical evidence found at the scene of past arson attacks . according to police , taking scent samples is as legal as taking fingerprints , and talks of the stasi were exaggerated . " ' stasi methods ' clearly refers to … techniques such as denunciation , blackmail and torture , but not to what is a valid legal police practice , " said konrad freiberg , the chairman of the federal police union , in a statement on wednesday . police should be able to use all methods " to preferably avert violence acts before they happen , " he said . strange idea however , wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the christian democratic parliamentary faction , said he found the whole practice of smell tracking " rather strange . " " you have a protester , the dog has a sniff and then he wags three times with his tail or barks - what 's supposed to happen then ? "
bosbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 protesters wo n't be able to come within 200m of the security fence at heiligendamm left-wing groups have warned the police that the recent raids angered their supporters and would only heighten their resolve to demonstrate at the g8 summit being held in the northern coastal town of heiligendamm from june 6 - 8 . protesters are also upset over a ban on protests at the g8 venue and the nearby airport , and are taking legal action to attempt to overturn it . it is believed that left-wing groups could be behind the torching on tuesday of the car belonging to the editor of bild , germany 's biggest-selling newspaper , and those of two businessmen last week . german authorities are expecting up to 100,000 activists to target the g8 summit being hosted by german chancellor angela merkel .

" the annual report , which is made up of 42 articles , is primarily concerned with the issues of excessive state surveillance , illegal searches and the degrading treament of immigrants .
it was presented for the occasion of germany 's constitutional day , celebrated on may 23 . kühling said the country 's highest court had repeatedly declared numerous police searches and phone taps unconstitutional but such cases continued to occur . bildunterschrift : the constitutional court is germany 's highest court without making reference to the recent raids on activists in the lead up to the g8 summit in june in the northern german town of heiligendamm , kühling called for increased compensation for victims of illegal police activities as a way of curbing their unconstitutional operations . caught in demonstration the former judge gave the example of a lawyer who was returning home from shopping when she was caught up in a mass arrest by police at a demonstration .
despite showing police her shopping and receipt , the woman was handcuffed and locked in a police van for more than five hours before being released in a nearby suburb . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reports criticizes police for picking up innocent bystanders in raids her detention was later declared illegal by a court .
however , criminal proceedings against the police were suspended .
after a long fight , the woman eventually received compensation of 500 euros -lrb- $ 675 -rrb- . kühling pointed out that stars received considerably more in damages for the publication of unauthorized photos . the report 's authors criticized several german states for amending their laws to give police special powers to conduct phone tapping and searches .
the authors said this allowed officials to circumvent the strict constitutional requirements for such activities . " war on terror " the report also criticized the " security hysteria " resulting from the " war against terror . "
speaking at the karlsruhe press conference , political scientist peter grottian said he was spied on by officers simply because of his participation in the berlin social forum , an organization made up largely of left-wing groups . referring to the recent g8 raids , grottian said the state made the assumption of " guilt by association " and that was then used to justify " disproportional state surveillance . " the so-called " alternative constitutional report " was presented week after interior minister wolgang schäuble released the government 's constitutional report warning that germany faced an increasing threat from terrorists . g8 threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dogs are being trained to sniff out protesters in a twist to the surveillance tale , the federal prosecutors ' office has confirmed a report that authorities are using scent tracking to keep tabs on g-8 protesters .
the daily hamburger morgenpost reported on tuesday that police had taken scent samples from activists so that police dogs can pick out the perpetrators if there is violence . the use of scent samples was widely practiced by the east german secret police , the stasi , who used the technique to track dissidents . petra pau , a lawmaker with the opposition left party , a group that includes ex-communists , blasted the practice as " another step away from a democratic state of law toward a preventive security state .

but germany wants to bring the two sides together at next week 's g8 foreign ministers ' meeting . there can be no long-term resolution of the conflict in afghanistan without pakistan 's cooperation , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in islamabad on wednesday . " without a regional approach , we will not succeed in bringing lasting peace to the region , " steinmeier said after talks with pakistan 's foreign minister khurshid kasuri .
steinmeier had previously met with afghanistan 's president hamid karzai in kabul on tuesday . steinmeier 's visit came amid international efforts to calm tensions between the two neighboring countries .
as well as addressing bilateral relations , his visit to the region was part of a german initiative within the g8 to help mend bridges between the governments .
both are key allies in the war against terrorism . germany 's efforts recognized in the region kasuri and his afghan counterpart rangeen dadfar-spanta are due to attend a g8 foreign ministers ' meeting in the german city of potsdam next week .
steinmeier said this was hoped to significantly improve dialogue between the sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier also met with pakistan 's prime minister shaukat aziz the countries are experiencing their worst relations since the taliban were ousted from power in afghanistan in 2001 . capping months of diplomatic disputes and insults , troops this month clashed at the border .
both sides accuse each other of failing to curb militant incursions into afghanistan from pakistan 's tribal areas .
steinmeier said border security was a focus of his talks during his visit to the region . kasuri said he was " looking forward " to attending the potsdam meeting .
the government in kabul also acknowledged the importance of the upcoming contacts in germany . " this meeting is extremely important for afghanistan and pakistan , " dadfar-spanta said tuesday evening after talks with steinmeier .
" without cooperation with pakistan , we will have no long-term peace and stability . " afghanistan 's solutions must be internal at the same time , the german minister also said final solutions to afghanistan 's problems must come from within . " internal reconciliation is not something you can command people to organize and carry out , it has to come internally , it must be a genuine afghan process , " steinmeier said . but he gave an assurance that the international community would maintain its efforts to ensure security and help the country back onto its feet . " reconstruction has to go on ; this is something we owe to the afghan people , " he said .
" they deserve it . " a scheduled meeting with president pervez musharraf was cancelled owing to pressing internal affairs , pakistani officials said .

prodi threatened that rome would not sign any unconvincing compromise accords .
" europe can not achieve ambitious results without ambitious reforms , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday .
" in the last two years euroskeptic views have been listened to almost exclusively , " said prodi .
" it is time to listen to those who ratified the 2004 treaty . "
warning to euroskeptics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' no ' from french and dutch voters in 2005 derailed the planned constitution the italian prime minister 's remarks were not specifically addressed to any state , but france , britain , the netherlands , poland and the czech republic have all expressed reservations about the constitution and want its scope to be curtailed .
french and dutch voters rejected a proposed eu constitution two years ago , plunging the eu into constitutional crisis .
most of the 18 countries that did ratify the original constitution have called for its main planks , such as the institution of a european affairs foreign minister , to be retained , and they want a non-rotating eu presidency and the extension of the qualified majority voting system .
on tuesday , meanwhile , denmark welcomed germany 's attempts to ensure that " concrete decisions " are made at the eu summit on june 21-22 . preserve core elements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says the treaty 's core elements should be retained danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen expressed support for the idea of a shorter treaty that would preserve the " core elements " of the original constitution .
" one solution could be a shorter treaty amending the existing treaties , " rasmussen said .
he said he was hoping for a rapid solution , which could see a new text approved by the end of the year .
like prodi , rasmussen opposed calling into question the voting system agreed in 2004 , which he called more transparent and balanced .
he was speaking after talks with the german chancellor in berlin on tuesday .
newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy has proposed a " mini-treaty " that omits controversial elements of the original draft , instead of a fully fledged constitution .
the french leader visited brussels on wednesday .
mini-treaty proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's idea of a mini-treaty is causing waves british prime minister tony blair has said he supports sarkozy 's plan for a simplified version .
the german press has reported that merkel responded coldly to the idea of a mini-treaty when she met with sarkozy in berlin last week just hours after he took office .
but merkel on tuesday said she was " very satisfied " with their meeting .
the german chancellor has said she wants to preserve as much as possible of the original text .
germany holds the eu presidency until the end of june , and merkel is trying to get member nations to commit to a " road map " that will lead them to ratify a new treaty before the european parliament elections in 2009 . dw-staff -lrb- jg -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany quizzes eu members on constitution germany , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has sent the 27 eu member states a questionnaire on what to do about the bloc 's stalled constitutional treaty to kick-start an intensive series of talks .

but it 's just starting for promoted rostock and duisburg .
the difference between success and failure for these small clubs was consistency . thanks to their poor goal difference , mainz had hardly a chance of staying up when they went into their final match against bayern munich - which they promptly lost 5-2 .
the game was mainz 's whole season in miniature .
they dug themselves an early hole , fought back and came up short . mainz , usually offensively minded , failed to react quickly enough to the departure of key forwards before the start of the season .
unable to score goals , they were dead last in december - with only 11 points . bringing in striker mohamed zidan , who scored 13 times for the club , restored mainz to playing respectably .
but the deficit they carried with them from 2006 was too great and this popular underdog 's first run in the bundesliga came to an end after three seasons . another tale of two seasons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen , in yellow , could n't elevate their game mainz 's rhineland neighbors aachen punched above their weight for the first half - thanks to young players like striker jan schlaudraff and defender sascha dum . but problems lurked .
dum was out on loan from leverkusen , and during the winter , aachen sold the rights to schlaudraff to bayern next season .
and players who have no future at a club usually are n't the ones you want in a dogfight . accused of not giving it their all , schlaudraff and dum were kicked off the squad in the middle of the relegation battle .
aachen slumped and headed down after only one season in the first division . mönchengladbach had already been relegated a few weeks previously . experience crucial for promoted clubs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock celebrated a deserved return to the bundesliga karlsruhe had already wrapped up the second-division title , but there was plenty of excitement on the last day of play , as rostock and duisburg got clutch wins to edge out freiburg for promotion . rostock , led by veteran midfielder stefan beinlich , needed every bit of their ten years experience in the first division to hang on to a top-three spot . despite a mediocre attack , the team conceded only 30 goals and will now become the second eastern german club , together with cottbus , in the top flight .
but they 'll need to get more potent to survive . pair of lethal zebras bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these blue-and-white zebras get another crack at the top flight duisburg bounced back to the bundesliga after only one season in the second division thanks to two seasoned strikers : mohamadou idrissou and youssef mokhtari . drawing on previous experience for first-division sides hanover and cottbus , idrissou and mokhtari combined for twenty goals in the division 's second-best offense .
this was key as the zebras only beat out freiburg for third place because of their better goal difference but duisburg 's last trip to the top flight only lasted one year , and it 's questionable whether they can bolster the squad enough to be competitive . and if all the newly promoted clubs want to stay up , they need to remember that the season is 34 games long - and that for small teams slumps are often fatal . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rough ride to the bundesliga title for champions stuttgart although vfb stuttgart were crowned bundesliga champions on saturday , it was not a smooth ride for armin veh 's men whose early-season form showed little title-winning potential .

but it 's just starting for promoted rostock and duisburg .
the difference between success and failure for these small clubs was consistency . thanks to their poor goal difference , mainz had hardly a chance of staying up when they went into their final match against bayern munich - which they promptly lost 5-2 .
the game was mainz 's whole season in miniature .
they dug themselves an early hole , fought back and came up short . mainz , usually offensively minded , failed to react quickly enough to the departure of key forwards before the start of the season .
unable to score goals , they were dead last in december - with only 11 points . bringing in striker mohamed zidan , who scored 13 times for the club , restored mainz to playing respectably .
but the deficit they carried with them from 2006 was too great and this popular underdog 's first run in the bundesliga came to an end after three seasons . another tale of two seasons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen , in yellow , could n't elevate their game mainz 's rhineland neighbors aachen punched above their weight for the first half - thanks to young players like striker jan schlaudraff and defender sascha dum . but problems lurked .
dum was out on loan from leverkusen , and during the winter , aachen sold the rights to schlaudraff to bayern next season .
and players who have no future at a club usually are n't the ones you want in a dogfight . accused of not giving it their all , schlaudraff and dum were kicked off the squad in the middle of the relegation battle .
aachen slumped and headed down after only one season in the first division . mönchengladbach had already been relegated a few weeks previously . experience crucial for promoted clubs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock celebrated a deserved return to the bundesliga karlsruhe had already wrapped up the second-division title , but there was plenty of excitement on the last day of play , as rostock and duisburg got clutch wins to edge out freiburg for promotion . rostock , led by veteran midfielder stefan beinlich , needed every bit of their ten years experience in the first division to hang on to a top-three spot . despite a mediocre attack , the team conceded only 30 goals and will now become the second eastern german club , together with cottbus , in the top flight .
but they 'll need to get more potent to survive . pair of lethal zebras bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these blue-and-white zebras get another crack at the top flight duisburg bounced back to the bundesliga after only one season in the second division thanks to two seasoned strikers : mohamadou idrissou and youssef mokhtari . drawing on previous experience for first-division sides hanover and cottbus , idrissou and mokhtari combined for twenty goals in the division 's second-best offense .
this was key as the zebras only beat out freiburg for third place because of their better goal difference but duisburg 's last trip to the top flight only lasted one year , and it 's questionable whether they can bolster the squad enough to be competitive . and if all the newly promoted clubs want to stay up , they need to remember that the season is 34 games long - and that for small teams slumps are often fatal . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rough ride to the bundesliga title for champions stuttgart although vfb stuttgart were crowned bundesliga champions on saturday , it was not a smooth ride for armin veh 's men whose early-season form showed little title-winning potential .

but it 's just starting for promoted rostock and duisburg .
the difference between success and failure for these small clubs was consistency . thanks to their poor goal difference , mainz had hardly a chance of staying up when they went into their final match against bayern munich - which they promptly lost 5-2 .
the game was mainz 's whole season in miniature .
they dug themselves an early hole , fought back and came up short . mainz , usually offensively minded , failed to react quickly enough to the departure of key forwards before the start of the season .
unable to score goals , they were dead last in december - with only 11 points . bringing in striker mohamed zidan , who scored 13 times for the club , restored mainz to playing respectably .
but the deficit they carried with them from 2006 was too great and this popular underdog 's first run in the bundesliga came to an end after three seasons . another tale of two seasons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen , in yellow , could n't elevate their game mainz 's rhineland neighbors aachen punched above their weight for the first half - thanks to young players like striker jan schlaudraff and defender sascha dum . but problems lurked .
dum was out on loan from leverkusen , and during the winter , aachen sold the rights to schlaudraff to bayern next season .
and players who have no future at a club usually are n't the ones you want in a dogfight . accused of not giving it their all , schlaudraff and dum were kicked off the squad in the middle of the relegation battle .
aachen slumped and headed down after only one season in the first division . mönchengladbach had already been relegated a few weeks previously . experience crucial for promoted clubs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock celebrated a deserved return to the bundesliga karlsruhe had already wrapped up the second-division title , but there was plenty of excitement on the last day of play , as rostock and duisburg got clutch wins to edge out freiburg for promotion . rostock , led by veteran midfielder stefan beinlich , needed every bit of their ten years experience in the first division to hang on to a top-three spot . despite a mediocre attack , the team conceded only 30 goals and will now become the second eastern german club , together with cottbus , in the top flight .
but they 'll need to get more potent to survive . pair of lethal zebras bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these blue-and-white zebras get another crack at the top flight duisburg bounced back to the bundesliga after only one season in the second division thanks to two seasoned strikers : mohamadou idrissou and youssef mokhtari . drawing on previous experience for first-division sides hanover and cottbus , idrissou and mokhtari combined for twenty goals in the division 's second-best offense .
this was key as the zebras only beat out freiburg for third place because of their better goal difference but duisburg 's last trip to the top flight only lasted one year , and it 's questionable whether they can bolster the squad enough to be competitive . and if all the newly promoted clubs want to stay up , they need to remember that the season is 34 games long - and that for small teams slumps are often fatal . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rough ride to the bundesliga title for champions stuttgart although vfb stuttgart were crowned bundesliga champions on saturday , it was not a smooth ride for armin veh 's men whose early-season form showed little title-winning potential .

but they denied that they wanted to use the samples to sniff out g8 protestors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police say taking a scent sample is no different to taking a fingerprint a spokesman said samples were taken from five or six suspects in order to compare these with physical evidence found at the scene of past arson attacks . according to police , taking scent samples is as legal as taking fingerprints , and talks of the stasi were exaggerated . " ' stasi methods ' clearly refers to … techniques such as denunciation , blackmail and torture , but not to what is a valid legal police practice , " said konrad freiberg , the chairman of the federal police union , in a statement on wednesday . police should be able to use all methods " to preferably avert violence acts before they happen , " he said . strange idea however , wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the christian democratic parliamentary faction , said he found the whole practice of smell tracking " rather strange . " " you have a protester , the dog has a sniff and then he wags three times with his tail or barks - what 's supposed to happen then ? "
bosbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 protesters wo n't be able to come within 200m of the security fence at heiligendamm left-wing groups have warned the police that the recent raids angered their supporters and would only heighten their resolve to demonstrate at the g8 summit being held in the northern coastal town of heiligendamm from june 6 - 8 . protesters are also upset over a ban on protests at the g8 venue and the nearby airport , and are taking legal action to attempt to overturn it . it is believed that left-wing groups could be behind the torching on tuesday of the car belonging to the editor of bild , germany 's biggest-selling newspaper , and those of two businessmen last week . german authorities are expecting up to 100,000 activists to target the g8 summit being hosted by german chancellor angela merkel .

speaking at the karlsruhe press conference , political scientist peter grottian said he was spied on by officers simply because of his participation in the berlin social forum , an organization made up largely of left-wing groups . referring to the recent g8 raids , grottian said the state made the assumption of " guilt by association " and that was then used to justify " disproportional state surveillance .

now , with revenge within their grasp , dw-world.de ’ s nick amies hopes the fires of retribution consume the italians . revenge .
it ’ s a dish best served cold , according to certain sicilian families in the " waste disposal " business .
it also seems to be the whispered word on the lips of the milanese as the champions league final gets ever nearer . two years appears to be long enough for the flames of vengeance to have cooled sufficiently for the fans and players of ac milan .
now , with the chance to avenge the 2005 defeat to liverpool just hours away , the rossoneri are blowing new life on those smoldering embers of retribution while claiming to be doing nothing of the sort .
despite the protestations of the more cerebral members of carlo ancelotti ’ s team of world cup winners and superstars , a burning desire for justice is surely flickering in the minds of those who suffered such ignominious defeat in istanbul ’ s ataturk stadium .
for every kaka who says that the past means nothing , there is a rino gattuso snarling at the end of his master ’ s leash , waiting to chomp the legs of those who wounded his pride and crushed his dream .
even milan ’ s coach can not resist throwing the odd bowl of tepid bitterness into his italian designer microwave .
liverpool , ancelotti suggests , are the least technical of the three premiership teams to reach the champions league semi-finals this year .

the six-time winners had their hands on the cup and a ragged , surprise package team of opponents on the ropes . as far as milan were concerned , they weren ’ t even playing the best side in england , let alone a team equal to themselves in europe .
and yet , they lost .
a latin proverb states that " revenge is a confession of pain . "
you can only imagine the pain milan felt at the end .
to even consider that the night of may 25 , 2005 will not be on the minds of at least some of the milanese is ludicrous .
all of which suits liverpool just fine .
while the impression one gets of milan is one of a team pacing the floor in barely contained anticipation , checking their diamond-encrusted watches and chewing furiously on gum which has long lost its taste , the liverpool camp seems almost trappist in comparison.h how not to behave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool 's gabriel paletta , right , and javier mascherano while plotting the reds ’ downfall by watching dvds of their games and sending scouts to merseyside , carlo ancelotti should have added a compilation of jose mourinho sound bites to his preparatory files .

the chelsea coach is a textbook example of how not to behave before facing liverpool in a crunch match .
put-downs and barbs just rebound off the armor liverpool coach rafa benitez keeps his charges encased in .

benitez is a master tactician and a statistical obsessive to the point of compulsion .
nothing is allowed to interfere with how he wants his team to work and think .
talk of revenge and playground insults over style do not feature in his game plan and he will not allow any of the polemic coming from italy to distract his players .
if the memory of istanbul is invoked in any way , it will be used to remind his players that going a goal – or even three - down does not necessarily mean the game is over .
liverpool came to the 2005 final blinking in the lights of an event none of them as players had ever experienced before .
by the time many of them even realized what was going on , it was half over and they had a mountain to climb . but the fact that they climbed that mountain and stuck a red flag of victory in the summit , in addition to the two seasons of improvement under benitez which followed , means that this liverpool team is a very different proposition to the one which made a mockery of the odds .

strikers peter crouch , dirk kuyt and craig bellamy all offer many different options in attack ; winger jermaine pennant provides added width , pace and improved delivery from the flanks , midfielder javier mascherano adds bite and cover to allow steven gerrard and xabi alonso the license to create .
the defense that was torn apart in istanbul is now marshalled by a more mature and flawless jamie carragher with his new protégé , the hugely driven and accomplished danny agger , by his side .
each new addition has been brought in to fill a specific role and to play a certain way in the coach ’ s vision of how liverpool should operate ; a specialist cog for every part of the machine .
so if milan take to the field on wednesday night burning with the desire to exact revenge , then the victory for liverpool will be half won .
a cool mind is needed and rafael benitez will have kept each of his players in refrigeration before the game .

but while many outsiders see germany as a country suffering from a severe lack of inhibition , or at least having a different moral outlook than buttoned-up britains or puritanical americans , there really are rules that govern when and where it is appropriate to let it all hang out .
subtle difficulties of cultural communication saunas ?
lakes ?
certain parks ?
go ahead , give yourself some air .
walking through a good-sized city on a tuesday afternoon ?
better cover up .
but those subtle distinctions were lost on an american tourist , apparently improperly schooled when it comes to a german society with a tendency to let it all hang out , at least in some contexts .
earlier this week , when temperatures topped 30 degrees celsius -lrb- 86 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , the sightseer stripped down and stuffed his clothes into a bag , which he carried with him as he strolled the streets of nuremberg , a conservative town in bavaria .
he apparently thought it was the appropriate thing to do .
costly cool-down but city streets in germany lack signs for freie körper kultur -lrb- " free body culture , " or " nudist area " -rrb- , the usual signal that it is ok to walk around in your birthday suit .
they are not , in fact , not clothing-optional zones .
shocked locals contacted the police , who apprehended the surprised tourist .
police said the man was n't drunk and had n't been taking drugs , but " he believed it was commonplace to be nude in public in germany . "
" we have been having unusually hot weather here lately but , all the same , we ca n't have this , " a spokesman for police told news services .
the police made him get dressed and pay a 200 euro -lrb- $ 269 -rrb- deposit pending an investigation into his behavior . dw staff -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police release nude shopper police detained a cologne woman shopping naked early one morning this week but let her go after admonishing her .

few come to see a 44-year-old naked homeless woman washing herself .

russian president vladimir putin begins a two day visit to vienna , austria .
but what was supposed to be a state visit based on trade and energy issues may be hijacked by human rights topics . russian president vladimir putin said wednesday that new eu members need to " get over past phobias " that are poisoning relations between russia and the union .
" we do not have particular problems with the eu .
we have had certain difficulties with our nearby neighbors , " putin told a press conference during an official visit to vienna .
" the soviet union is in part to blame but our european partners must get over past phobias , " he added .
" with the eu enlargement these problems now belong to the european union .
this does not contribute to rapid evolution of relations " with moscow , putin insisted .
a russian embargo on polish meat imports is at the heart of a deepening political crisis between moscow and brussels that has blocked talks on a new eu-russia accord since late last year .
relations have also been strained by a dispute over energy exports to lithuania and a bitter controversy over the removal of a soviet war monument in estonia .
putin 's trip closely follows a tense summit last week in which relations between the eu and russia dipped to a new low over issues such as human rights , and a trade dispute with poland .

rubina möhring , the president of reporters without borders in austria , called for politicians to link human rights and media freedoms to business deals .
" i would like them to say to mr. putin to act in the way that human rights and press freedom are respected in russia , and that this behavior could influence the discussion about the economic treaties as well , " möhring said .
the austrian president said he plans to raise issues of democracy and human rights with putin , but said this will be done behind closed doors and bilateral relations and business deals will dominate the visit .

russian president vladimir putin begins a two day visit to vienna , austria .
but what was supposed to be a state visit based on trade and energy issues may be hijacked by human rights topics . russian president vladimir putin said wednesday that new eu members need to " get over past phobias " that are poisoning relations between russia and the union .
" we do not have particular problems with the eu .
we have had certain difficulties with our nearby neighbors , " putin told a press conference during an official visit to vienna .
" the soviet union is in part to blame but our european partners must get over past phobias , " he added .
" with the eu enlargement these problems now belong to the european union .
this does not contribute to rapid evolution of relations " with moscow , putin insisted .
a russian embargo on polish meat imports is at the heart of a deepening political crisis between moscow and brussels that has blocked talks on a new eu-russia accord since late last year .
relations have also been strained by a dispute over energy exports to lithuania and a bitter controversy over the removal of a soviet war monument in estonia .
putin 's trip closely follows a tense summit last week in which relations between the eu and russia dipped to a new low over issues such as human rights , and a trade dispute with poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin planned to talk business with his austrian hosts calls from activists amnesty international , the international helsinki federation and reporters without borders are staging protests .
rubina möhring , the president of reporters without borders in austria , called for politicians to link human rights and media freedoms to business deals .
" i would like them to say to mr. putin to act in the way that human rights and press freedom are respected in russia , and that this behavior could influence the discussion about the economic treaties as well , " möhring said .
the austrian president said he plans to raise issues of democracy and human rights with putin , but said this will be done behind closed doors and bilateral relations and business deals will dominate the visit .
pipeline control at issue like much of europe , austria is a big consumer of russian energy .
it is also a partner in the proposed nabucco pipeline , which will bring gas from the caspian sea to central europe - bypassing russia .
the trip gives moscow the chance to put its case as a reliable supplier and to do deals on energy cooperation .
edward christie , a vienna-based energy specialist and economist , said there is competition for control of the pipelines .

prodi threatened that rome would not sign any unconvincing compromise accords .
" europe can not achieve ambitious results without ambitious reforms , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday .
" in the last two years euroskeptic views have been listened to almost exclusively , " said prodi .
" it is time to listen to those who ratified the 2004 treaty . "
warning to euroskeptics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' no ' from french and dutch voters in 2005 derailed the planned constitution the italian prime minister 's remarks were not specifically addressed to any state , but france , britain , the netherlands , poland and the czech republic have all expressed reservations about the constitution and want its scope to be curtailed .
french and dutch voters rejected a proposed eu constitution two years ago , plunging the eu into constitutional crisis .
most of the 18 countries that did ratify the original constitution have called for its main planks , such as the institution of a european affairs foreign minister , to be retained , and they want a non-rotating eu presidency and the extension of the qualified majority voting system .
on tuesday , meanwhile , denmark welcomed germany 's attempts to ensure that " concrete decisions " are made at the eu summit on june 21-22 . preserve core elements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says the treaty 's core elements should be retained danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen expressed support for the idea of a shorter treaty that would preserve the " core elements " of the original constitution .
" one solution could be a shorter treaty amending the existing treaties , " rasmussen said .
he said he was hoping for a rapid solution , which could see a new text approved by the end of the year .
like prodi , rasmussen opposed calling into question the voting system agreed in 2004 , which he called more transparent and balanced .
he was speaking after talks with the german chancellor in berlin on tuesday .
newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy has proposed a " mini-treaty " that omits controversial elements of the original draft , instead of a fully fledged constitution .
the french leader visited brussels on wednesday .
mini-treaty proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's idea of a mini-treaty is causing waves british prime minister tony blair has said he supports sarkozy 's plan for a simplified version .
the german press has reported that merkel responded coldly to the idea of a mini-treaty when she met with sarkozy in berlin last week just hours after he took office .
but merkel on tuesday said she was " very satisfied " with their meeting .
the german chancellor has said she wants to preserve as much as possible of the original text .
germany holds the eu presidency until the end of june , and merkel is trying to get member nations to commit to a " road map " that will lead them to ratify a new treaty before the european parliament elections in 2009 . dw-staff -lrb- jg -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany quizzes eu members on constitution germany , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has sent the 27 eu member states a questionnaire on what to do about the bloc 's stalled constitutional treaty to kick-start an intensive series of talks .

french and dutch voters rejected a proposed eu constitution two years ago , plunging the eu into constitutional crisis .
most of the 18 countries that did ratify the original constitution have called for its main planks , such as the institution of a european affairs foreign minister , to be retained , and they want a non-rotating eu presidency and the extension of the qualified majority voting system .

but it 's just starting for promoted rostock and duisburg .
the difference between success and failure for these small clubs was consistency . thanks to their poor goal difference , mainz had hardly a chance of staying up when they went into their final match against bayern munich - which they promptly lost 5-2 .
the game was mainz 's whole season in miniature .

but it 's just starting for promoted rostock and duisburg .
the difference between success and failure for these small clubs was consistency . thanks to their poor goal difference , mainz had hardly a chance of staying up when they went into their final match against bayern munich - which they promptly lost 5-2 .
the game was mainz 's whole season in miniature .
they dug themselves an early hole , fought back and came up short . mainz , usually offensively minded , failed to react quickly enough to the departure of key forwards before the start of the season .
unable to score goals , they were dead last in december - with only 11 points . bringing in striker mohamed zidan , who scored 13 times for the club , restored mainz to playing respectably .
but the deficit they carried with them from 2006 was too great and this popular underdog 's first run in the bundesliga came to an end after three seasons . another tale of two seasons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen , in yellow , could n't elevate their game mainz 's rhineland neighbors aachen punched above their weight for the first half - thanks to young players like striker jan schlaudraff and defender sascha dum . but problems lurked .
dum was out on loan from leverkusen , and during the winter , aachen sold the rights to schlaudraff to bayern next season .
and players who have no future at a club usually are n't the ones you want in a dogfight . accused of not giving it their all , schlaudraff and dum were kicked off the squad in the middle of the relegation battle .
aachen slumped and headed down after only one season in the first division . mönchengladbach had already been relegated a few weeks previously . experience crucial for promoted clubs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock celebrated a deserved return to the bundesliga karlsruhe had already wrapped up the second-division title , but there was plenty of excitement on the last day of play , as rostock and duisburg got clutch wins to edge out freiburg for promotion . rostock , led by veteran midfielder stefan beinlich , needed every bit of their ten years experience in the first division to hang on to a top-three spot . despite a mediocre attack , the team conceded only 30 goals and will now become the second eastern german club , together with cottbus , in the top flight .
but they 'll need to get more potent to survive . pair of lethal zebras bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these blue-and-white zebras get another crack at the top flight duisburg bounced back to the bundesliga after only one season in the second division thanks to two seasoned strikers : mohamadou idrissou and youssef mokhtari . drawing on previous experience for first-division sides hanover and cottbus , idrissou and mokhtari combined for twenty goals in the division 's second-best offense .
this was key as the zebras only beat out freiburg for third place because of their better goal difference but duisburg 's last trip to the top flight only lasted one year , and it 's questionable whether they can bolster the squad enough to be competitive . and if all the newly promoted clubs want to stay up , they need to remember that the season is 34 games long - and that for small teams slumps are often fatal . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rough ride to the bundesliga title for champions stuttgart although vfb stuttgart were crowned bundesliga champions on saturday , it was not a smooth ride for armin veh 's men whose early-season form showed little title-winning potential .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 23.05.2007 milan face two opponents in liverpool and foolish revenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool and ac milan in 2005 ac milan have waited two years to avenge the 2005 champions league final defeat to liverpool .
now , with revenge within their grasp , dw-world.de ’ s nick amies hopes the fires of retribution consume the italians . revenge .
it ’ s a dish best served cold , according to certain sicilian families in the " waste disposal " business .
it also seems to be the whispered word on the lips of the milanese as the champions league final gets ever nearer . two years appears to be long enough for the flames of vengeance to have cooled sufficiently for the fans and players of ac milan .
now , with the chance to avenge the 2005 defeat to liverpool just hours away , the rossoneri are blowing new life on those smoldering embers of retribution while claiming to be doing nothing of the sort .
despite the protestations of the more cerebral members of carlo ancelotti ’ s team of world cup winners and superstars , a burning desire for justice is surely flickering in the minds of those who suffered such ignominious defeat in istanbul ’ s ataturk stadium .
for every kaka who says that the past means nothing , there is a rino gattuso snarling at the end of his master ’ s leash , waiting to chomp the legs of those who wounded his pride and crushed his dream .
even milan ’ s coach can not resist throwing the odd bowl of tepid bitterness into his italian designer microwave .
liverpool , ancelotti suggests , are the least technical of the three premiership teams to reach the champions league semi-finals this year .
he would have much preferred playing manchester united in the final .
but of course he would !
he beat them . motivational tool bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool celebrate the win in 2005 to suggest that the defeat on penalties in the 2005 final , after leading liverpool 3-0 at half-time , will not feature as a motivational tool or pre-match topic in the milan dressing room is preposterous . it was not only a sporting defeat , but a spiritual loss akin to the grief that follows the death of a relative .
the six-time winners had their hands on the cup and a ragged , surprise package team of opponents on the ropes . as far as milan were concerned , they weren ’ t even playing the best side in england , let alone a team equal to themselves in europe .
and yet , they lost .
a latin proverb states that " revenge is a confession of pain . "
you can only imagine the pain milan felt at the end .
to even consider that the night of may 25 , 2005 will not be on the minds of at least some of the milanese is ludicrous .
all of which suits liverpool just fine .
while the impression one gets of milan is one of a team pacing the floor in barely contained anticipation , checking their diamond-encrusted watches and chewing furiously on gum which has long lost its taste , the liverpool camp seems almost trappist in comparison.h how not to behave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool 's gabriel paletta , right , and javier mascherano while plotting the reds ’ downfall by watching dvds of their games and sending scouts to merseyside , carlo ancelotti should have added a compilation of jose mourinho sound bites to his preparatory files .
he would then know that hot air disperses very quickly in the skies over anfield .
the chelsea coach is a textbook example of how not to behave before facing liverpool in a crunch match .
put-downs and barbs just rebound off the armor liverpool coach rafa benitez keeps his charges encased in .
insults thrown in their direction come back infuriatingly unanswered - and warmed-up plates of two-year old revenge just end up in your lap .
benitez is a master tactician and a statistical obsessive to the point of compulsion .
nothing is allowed to interfere with how he wants his team to work and think .
talk of revenge and playground insults over style do not feature in his game plan and he will not allow any of the polemic coming from italy to distract his players .
if the memory of istanbul is invoked in any way , it will be used to remind his players that going a goal – or even three - down does not necessarily mean the game is over .
liverpool came to the 2005 final blinking in the lights of an event none of them as players had ever experienced before .
by the time many of them even realized what was going on , it was half over and they had a mountain to climb . but the fact that they climbed that mountain and stuck a red flag of victory in the summit , in addition to the two seasons of improvement under benitez which followed , means that this liverpool team is a very different proposition to the one which made a mockery of the odds .
new stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool coach rafael benitez benitez has new stars at his disposal after culling the squad of those players that did not fit his style or reach his high standards .
strikers peter crouch , dirk kuyt and craig bellamy all offer many different options in attack ; winger jermaine pennant provides added width , pace and improved delivery from the flanks , midfielder javier mascherano adds bite and cover to allow steven gerrard and xabi alonso the license to create .
the defense that was torn apart in istanbul is now marshalled by a more mature and flawless jamie carragher with his new protégé , the hugely driven and accomplished danny agger , by his side .
each new addition has been brought in to fill a specific role and to play a certain way in the coach ’ s vision of how liverpool should operate ; a specialist cog for every part of the machine .
so if milan take to the field on wednesday night burning with the desire to exact revenge , then the victory for liverpool will be half won .

now , with revenge within their grasp , dw-world.de ’ s nick amies hopes the fires of retribution consume the italians . revenge .
it ’ s a dish best served cold , according to certain sicilian families in the " waste disposal " business .
it also seems to be the whispered word on the lips of the milanese as the champions league final gets ever nearer . two years appears to be long enough for the flames of vengeance to have cooled sufficiently for the fans and players of ac milan .
now , with the chance to avenge the 2005 defeat to liverpool just hours away , the rossoneri are blowing new life on those smoldering embers of retribution while claiming to be doing nothing of the sort .
despite the protestations of the more cerebral members of carlo ancelotti ’ s team of world cup winners and superstars , a burning desire for justice is surely flickering in the minds of those who suffered such ignominious defeat in istanbul ’ s ataturk stadium .
for every kaka who says that the past means nothing , there is a rino gattuso snarling at the end of his master ’ s leash , waiting to chomp the legs of those who wounded his pride and crushed his dream .
even milan ’ s coach can not resist throwing the odd bowl of tepid bitterness into his italian designer microwave .
liverpool , ancelotti suggests , are the least technical of the three premiership teams to reach the champions league semi-finals this year .
he would have much preferred playing manchester united in the final .
but of course he would !
he beat them . motivational tool bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool celebrate the win in 2005 to suggest that the defeat on penalties in the 2005 final , after leading liverpool 3-0 at half-time , will not feature as a motivational tool or pre-match topic in the milan dressing room is preposterous . it was not only a sporting defeat , but a spiritual loss akin to the grief that follows the death of a relative .
the six-time winners had their hands on the cup and a ragged , surprise package team of opponents on the ropes . as far as milan were concerned , they weren ’ t even playing the best side in england , let alone a team equal to themselves in europe .
and yet , they lost .
a latin proverb states that " revenge is a confession of pain . "
you can only imagine the pain milan felt at the end .
to even consider that the night of may 25 , 2005 will not be on the minds of at least some of the milanese is ludicrous .
all of which suits liverpool just fine .
while the impression one gets of milan is one of a team pacing the floor in barely contained anticipation , checking their diamond-encrusted watches and chewing furiously on gum which has long lost its taste , the liverpool camp seems almost trappist in comparison.h how not to behave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool 's gabriel paletta , right , and javier mascherano while plotting the reds ’ downfall by watching dvds of their games and sending scouts to merseyside , carlo ancelotti should have added a compilation of jose mourinho sound bites to his preparatory files .
he would then know that hot air disperses very quickly in the skies over anfield .
the chelsea coach is a textbook example of how not to behave before facing liverpool in a crunch match .
put-downs and barbs just rebound off the armor liverpool coach rafa benitez keeps his charges encased in .
insults thrown in their direction come back infuriatingly unanswered - and warmed-up plates of two-year old revenge just end up in your lap .
benitez is a master tactician and a statistical obsessive to the point of compulsion .
nothing is allowed to interfere with how he wants his team to work and think .
talk of revenge and playground insults over style do not feature in his game plan and he will not allow any of the polemic coming from italy to distract his players .
if the memory of istanbul is invoked in any way , it will be used to remind his players that going a goal – or even three - down does not necessarily mean the game is over .
liverpool came to the 2005 final blinking in the lights of an event none of them as players had ever experienced before .
by the time many of them even realized what was going on , it was half over and they had a mountain to climb . but the fact that they climbed that mountain and stuck a red flag of victory in the summit , in addition to the two seasons of improvement under benitez which followed , means that this liverpool team is a very different proposition to the one which made a mockery of the odds .
new stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool coach rafael benitez benitez has new stars at his disposal after culling the squad of those players that did not fit his style or reach his high standards .
strikers peter crouch , dirk kuyt and craig bellamy all offer many different options in attack ; winger jermaine pennant provides added width , pace and improved delivery from the flanks , midfielder javier mascherano adds bite and cover to allow steven gerrard and xabi alonso the license to create .
the defense that was torn apart in istanbul is now marshalled by a more mature and flawless jamie carragher with his new protégé , the hugely driven and accomplished danny agger , by his side .
each new addition has been brought in to fill a specific role and to play a certain way in the coach ’ s vision of how liverpool should operate ; a specialist cog for every part of the machine .
so if milan take to the field on wednesday night burning with the desire to exact revenge , then the victory for liverpool will be half won .
a cool mind is needed and rafael benitez will have kept each of his players in refrigeration before the game .
against a combustible side wanting blood , liverpool can think and play their way into a position of dominance and then let the game plan and undoubted talent of this 2007 model finish the job .

" activists raided federal prosecutors confirmed on tuesday that police took scent samples earlier in the month when they raided sites in northern germany linked to suspected anti-globalization activists .
but they denied that they wanted to use the samples to sniff out g8 protestors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police say taking a scent sample is no different to taking a fingerprint a spokesman said samples were taken from five or six suspects in order to compare these with physical evidence found at the scene of past arson attacks . according to police , taking scent samples is as legal as taking fingerprints , and talks of the stasi were exaggerated . " ' stasi methods ' clearly refers to … techniques such as denunciation , blackmail and torture , but not to what is a valid legal police practice , " said konrad freiberg , the chairman of the federal police union , in a statement on wednesday . police should be able to use all methods " to preferably avert violence acts before they happen , " he said . strange idea however , wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the christian democratic parliamentary faction , said he found the whole practice of smell tracking " rather strange . " " you have a protester , the dog has a sniff and then he wags three times with his tail or barks - what 's supposed to happen then ? "
bosbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 protesters wo n't be able to come within 200m of the security fence at heiligendamm left-wing groups have warned the police that the recent raids angered their supporters and would only heighten their resolve to demonstrate at the g8 summit being held in the northern coastal town of heiligendamm from june 6 - 8 . protesters are also upset over a ban on protests at the g8 venue and the nearby airport , and are taking legal action to attempt to overturn it . it is believed that left-wing groups could be behind the torching on tuesday of the car belonging to the editor of bild , germany 's biggest-selling newspaper , and those of two businessmen last week . german authorities are expecting up to 100,000 activists to target the g8 summit being hosted by german chancellor angela merkel .

german police have collected body scent samples of left-wing activists in the lead up to the g8 summit .
some politicians accuse the government of resorting to the dubious methods of the east german secret police . " it 's unsavory that our intelligence officials are using methods that were also used by the stasi , " the deputy parliamentary leader of the opposition greens , hans-christian ströbele , told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper . the feared secret police of former communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- notoriously tried to capture and store the body scents of political dissidents so that sniffer dogs could trace them . wolfgang thierse , the deputy speaker of the bundestag lower house of parliament , accused the authorities of going overboard and warned them to refrain from a " hysteria that could lead to a police state similar to the gdr . " activists raided federal prosecutors confirmed on tuesday that police took scent samples earlier in the month when they raided sites in northern germany linked to suspected anti-globalization activists .
but they denied that they wanted to use the samples to sniff out g8 protestors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police say taking a scent sample is no different to taking a fingerprint a spokesman said samples were taken from five or six suspects in order to compare these with physical evidence found at the scene of past arson attacks . according to police , taking scent samples is as legal as taking fingerprints , and talks of the stasi were exaggerated . " ' stasi methods ' clearly refers to … techniques such as denunciation , blackmail and torture , but not to what is a valid legal police practice , " said konrad freiberg , the chairman of the federal police union , in a statement on wednesday . police should be able to use all methods " to preferably avert violence acts before they happen , " he said . strange idea however , wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the christian democratic parliamentary faction , said he found the whole practice of smell tracking " rather strange . " " you have a protester , the dog has a sniff and then he wags three times with his tail or barks - what 's supposed to happen then ? "
bosbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 protesters wo n't be able to come within 200m of the security fence at heiligendamm left-wing groups have warned the police that the recent raids angered their supporters and would only heighten their resolve to demonstrate at the g8 summit being held in the northern coastal town of heiligendamm from june 6 - 8 . protesters are also upset over a ban on protests at the g8 venue and the nearby airport , and are taking legal action to attempt to overturn it . it is believed that left-wing groups could be behind the torching on tuesday of the car belonging to the editor of bild , germany 's biggest-selling newspaper , and those of two businessmen last week . german authorities are expecting up to 100,000 activists to target the g8 summit being hosted by german chancellor angela merkel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 23.05.2007 milan face two opponents in liverpool and foolish revenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool and ac milan in 2005 ac milan have waited two years to avenge the 2005 champions league final defeat to liverpool .
now , with revenge within their grasp , dw-world.de ’ s nick amies hopes the fires of retribution consume the italians . revenge .
it ’ s a dish best served cold , according to certain sicilian families in the " waste disposal " business .
it also seems to be the whispered word on the lips of the milanese as the champions league final gets ever nearer . two years appears to be long enough for the flames of vengeance to have cooled sufficiently for the fans and players of ac milan .
now , with the chance to avenge the 2005 defeat to liverpool just hours away , the rossoneri are blowing new life on those smoldering embers of retribution while claiming to be doing nothing of the sort .
despite the protestations of the more cerebral members of carlo ancelotti ’ s team of world cup winners and superstars , a burning desire for justice is surely flickering in the minds of those who suffered such ignominious defeat in istanbul ’ s ataturk stadium .
for every kaka who says that the past means nothing , there is a rino gattuso snarling at the end of his master ’ s leash , waiting to chomp the legs of those who wounded his pride and crushed his dream .
even milan ’ s coach can not resist throwing the odd bowl of tepid bitterness into his italian designer microwave .
liverpool , ancelotti suggests , are the least technical of the three premiership teams to reach the champions league semi-finals this year .
he would have much preferred playing manchester united in the final .
but of course he would !
he beat them . motivational tool bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool celebrate the win in 2005 to suggest that the defeat on penalties in the 2005 final , after leading liverpool 3-0 at half-time , will not feature as a motivational tool or pre-match topic in the milan dressing room is preposterous . it was not only a sporting defeat , but a spiritual loss akin to the grief that follows the death of a relative .
the six-time winners had their hands on the cup and a ragged , surprise package team of opponents on the ropes . as far as milan were concerned , they weren ’ t even playing the best side in england , let alone a team equal to themselves in europe .
and yet , they lost .
a latin proverb states that " revenge is a confession of pain . "
you can only imagine the pain milan felt at the end .
to even consider that the night of may 25 , 2005 will not be on the minds of at least some of the milanese is ludicrous .
all of which suits liverpool just fine .
while the impression one gets of milan is one of a team pacing the floor in barely contained anticipation , checking their diamond-encrusted watches and chewing furiously on gum which has long lost its taste , the liverpool camp seems almost trappist in comparison.h how not to behave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool 's gabriel paletta , right , and javier mascherano while plotting the reds ’ downfall by watching dvds of their games and sending scouts to merseyside , carlo ancelotti should have added a compilation of jose mourinho sound bites to his preparatory files .
he would then know that hot air disperses very quickly in the skies over anfield .
the chelsea coach is a textbook example of how not to behave before facing liverpool in a crunch match .
put-downs and barbs just rebound off the armor liverpool coach rafa benitez keeps his charges encased in .
insults thrown in their direction come back infuriatingly unanswered - and warmed-up plates of two-year old revenge just end up in your lap .
benitez is a master tactician and a statistical obsessive to the point of compulsion .
nothing is allowed to interfere with how he wants his team to work and think .
talk of revenge and playground insults over style do not feature in his game plan and he will not allow any of the polemic coming from italy to distract his players .
if the memory of istanbul is invoked in any way , it will be used to remind his players that going a goal – or even three - down does not necessarily mean the game is over .
liverpool came to the 2005 final blinking in the lights of an event none of them as players had ever experienced before .
by the time many of them even realized what was going on , it was half over and they had a mountain to climb . but the fact that they climbed that mountain and stuck a red flag of victory in the summit , in addition to the two seasons of improvement under benitez which followed , means that this liverpool team is a very different proposition to the one which made a mockery of the odds .
new stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool coach rafael benitez benitez has new stars at his disposal after culling the squad of those players that did not fit his style or reach his high standards .
strikers peter crouch , dirk kuyt and craig bellamy all offer many different options in attack ; winger jermaine pennant provides added width , pace and improved delivery from the flanks , midfielder javier mascherano adds bite and cover to allow steven gerrard and xabi alonso the license to create .
the defense that was torn apart in istanbul is now marshalled by a more mature and flawless jamie carragher with his new protégé , the hugely driven and accomplished danny agger , by his side .
each new addition has been brought in to fill a specific role and to play a certain way in the coach ’ s vision of how liverpool should operate ; a specialist cog for every part of the machine .
so if milan take to the field on wednesday night burning with the desire to exact revenge , then the victory for liverpool will be half won .
a cool mind is needed and rafael benitez will have kept each of his players in refrigeration before the game .
against a combustible side wanting blood , liverpool can think and play their way into a position of dominance and then let the game plan and undoubted talent of this 2007 model finish the job .
because , as another well-known quote suggests , revenge proves its own executioner . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ac milan win champions league final manchester lose 3:0 to ac milan ; chelsea lose out on penalties -lrb- 02.05.2007 -rrb- chelsea wins narrowly in champions league semifinal joe cole scored the only goal of the game as chelsea emerged from the first leg of their champions league semi-final with a 1-0 advantage over liverpool to take to anfield .

prodi threatened that rome would not sign any unconvincing compromise accords .
" europe can not achieve ambitious results without ambitious reforms , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday .
" in the last two years euroskeptic views have been listened to almost exclusively , " said prodi .
" it is time to listen to those who ratified the 2004 treaty . "

french and dutch voters rejected a proposed eu constitution two years ago , plunging the eu into constitutional crisis .
most of the 18 countries that did ratify the original constitution have called for its main planks , such as the institution of a european affairs foreign minister , to be retained , and they want a non-rotating eu presidency and the extension of the qualified majority voting system .

he said he was hoping for a rapid solution , which could see a new text approved by the end of the year .

he was speaking after talks with the german chancellor in berlin on tuesday .
newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy has proposed a " mini-treaty " that omits controversial elements of the original draft , instead of a fully fledged constitution .

the german press has reported that merkel responded coldly to the idea of a mini-treaty when she met with sarkozy in berlin last week just hours after he took office .
but merkel on tuesday said she was " very satisfied " with their meeting .
the german chancellor has said she wants to preserve as much as possible of the original text .

russian president vladimir putin begins a two day visit to vienna , austria .
but what was supposed to be a state visit based on trade and energy issues may be hijacked by human rights topics . russian president vladimir putin said wednesday that new eu members need to " get over past phobias " that are poisoning relations between russia and the union .
" we do not have particular problems with the eu .
we have had certain difficulties with our nearby neighbors , " putin told a press conference during an official visit to vienna .
" the soviet union is in part to blame but our european partners must get over past phobias , " he added .
" with the eu enlargement these problems now belong to the european union .
this does not contribute to rapid evolution of relations " with moscow , putin insisted .
a russian embargo on polish meat imports is at the heart of a deepening political crisis between moscow and brussels that has blocked talks on a new eu-russia accord since late last year .
relations have also been strained by a dispute over energy exports to lithuania and a bitter controversy over the removal of a soviet war monument in estonia .
putin 's trip closely follows a tense summit last week in which relations between the eu and russia dipped to a new low over issues such as human rights , and a trade dispute with poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin planned to talk business with his austrian hosts calls from activists amnesty international , the international helsinki federation and reporters without borders are staging protests .
rubina möhring , the president of reporters without borders in austria , called for politicians to link human rights and media freedoms to business deals .
" i would like them to say to mr. putin to act in the way that human rights and press freedom are respected in russia , and that this behavior could influence the discussion about the economic treaties as well , " möhring said .
the austrian president said he plans to raise issues of democracy and human rights with putin , but said this will be done behind closed doors and bilateral relations and business deals will dominate the visit .
pipeline control at issue like much of europe , austria is a big consumer of russian energy .
it is also a partner in the proposed nabucco pipeline , which will bring gas from the caspian sea to central europe - bypassing russia .
the trip gives moscow the chance to put its case as a reliable supplier and to do deals on energy cooperation .
edward christie , a vienna-based energy specialist and economist , said there is competition for control of the pipelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian president heinz fischer will dine with putin " a certain number of european countries would much rather channel some of these central asian resources directly to european markets and not have them transit through russia , " christie said .

but while many outsiders see germany as a country suffering from a severe lack of inhibition , or at least having a different moral outlook than buttoned-up britains or puritanical americans , there really are rules that govern when and where it is appropriate to let it all hang out .
subtle difficulties of cultural communication saunas ?
lakes ?
certain parks ?
go ahead , give yourself some air .
walking through a good-sized city on a tuesday afternoon ?
better cover up .
but those subtle distinctions were lost on an american tourist , apparently improperly schooled when it comes to a german society with a tendency to let it all hang out , at least in some contexts .
earlier this week , when temperatures topped 30 degrees celsius -lrb- 86 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , the sightseer stripped down and stuffed his clothes into a bag , which he carried with him as he strolled the streets of nuremberg , a conservative town in bavaria .
he apparently thought it was the appropriate thing to do .
costly cool-down but city streets in germany lack signs for freie körper kultur -lrb- " free body culture , " or " nudist area " -rrb- , the usual signal that it is ok to walk around in your birthday suit .
they are not , in fact , not clothing-optional zones .
shocked locals contacted the police , who apprehended the surprised tourist .
police said the man was n't drunk and had n't been taking drugs , but " he believed it was commonplace to be nude in public in germany . "
" we have been having unusually hot weather here lately but , all the same , we ca n't have this , " a spokesman for police told news services .
the police made him get dressed and pay a 200 euro -lrb- $ 269 -rrb- deposit pending an investigation into his behavior . dw staff -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police release nude shopper police detained a cologne woman shopping naked early one morning this week but let her go after admonishing her .
-lrb- 21.07.2005 -rrb- naked bather gets munich city authorities in a lather tourists come to munich for many reasons : architecture , culture , beer .
few come to see a 44-year-old naked homeless woman washing herself .
but the city just ca n't stop bille taking off her clothes in public .

" the annual report , which is made up of 42 articles , is primarily concerned with the issues of excessive state surveillance , illegal searches and the degrading treament of immigrants .
it was presented for the occasion of germany 's constitutional day , celebrated on may 23 . kühling said the country 's highest court had repeatedly declared numerous police searches and phone taps unconstitutional but such cases continued to occur . bildunterschrift : the constitutional court is germany 's highest court without making reference to the recent raids on activists in the lead up to the g8 summit in june in the northern german town of heiligendamm , kühling called for increased compensation for victims of illegal police activities as a way of curbing their unconstitutional operations . caught in demonstration the former judge gave the example of a lawyer who was returning home from shopping when she was caught up in a mass arrest by police at a demonstration .
despite showing police her shopping and receipt , the woman was handcuffed and locked in a police van for more than five hours before being released in a nearby suburb . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reports criticizes police for picking up innocent bystanders in raids her detention was later declared illegal by a court .
however , criminal proceedings against the police were suspended .
after a long fight , the woman eventually received compensation of 500 euros -lrb- $ 675 -rrb- . kühling pointed out that stars received considerably more in damages for the publication of unauthorized photos . the report 's authors criticized several german states for amending their laws to give police special powers to conduct phone tapping and searches .
the authors said this allowed officials to circumvent the strict constitutional requirements for such activities . " war on terror " the report also criticized the " security hysteria " resulting from the " war against terror . "
speaking at the karlsruhe press conference , political scientist peter grottian said he was spied on by officers simply because of his participation in the berlin social forum , an organization made up largely of left-wing groups . referring to the recent g8 raids , grottian said the state made the assumption of " guilt by association " and that was then used to justify " disproportional state surveillance .

the daily hamburger morgenpost reported on tuesday that police had taken scent samples from activists so that police dogs can pick out the perpetrators if there is violence . the use of scent samples was widely practiced by the east german secret police , the stasi , who used the technique to track dissidents . petra pau , a lawmaker with the opposition left party , a group that includes ex-communists , blasted the practice as " another step away from a democratic state of law toward a preventive security state .

but germany wants to bring the two sides together at next week 's g8 foreign ministers ' meeting . there can be no long-term resolution of the conflict in afghanistan without pakistan 's cooperation , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in islamabad on wednesday . " without a regional approach , we will not succeed in bringing lasting peace to the region , " steinmeier said after talks with pakistan 's foreign minister khurshid kasuri .
steinmeier had previously met with afghanistan 's president hamid karzai in kabul on tuesday . steinmeier 's visit came amid international efforts to calm tensions between the two neighboring countries .
as well as addressing bilateral relations , his visit to the region was part of a german initiative within the g8 to help mend bridges between the governments .
both are key allies in the war against terrorism . germany 's efforts recognized in the region kasuri and his afghan counterpart rangeen dadfar-spanta are due to attend a g8 foreign ministers ' meeting in the german city of potsdam next week .
steinmeier said this was hoped to significantly improve dialogue between the sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier also met with pakistan 's prime minister shaukat aziz the countries are experiencing their worst relations since the taliban were ousted from power in afghanistan in 2001 . capping months of diplomatic disputes and insults , troops this month clashed at the border .
both sides accuse each other of failing to curb militant incursions into afghanistan from pakistan 's tribal areas .
steinmeier said border security was a focus of his talks during his visit to the region . kasuri said he was " looking forward " to attending the potsdam meeting .
the government in kabul also acknowledged the importance of the upcoming contacts in germany . " this meeting is extremely important for afghanistan and pakistan , " dadfar-spanta said tuesday evening after talks with steinmeier .
" without cooperation with pakistan , we will have no long-term peace and stability . " afghanistan 's solutions must be internal at the same time , the german minister also said final solutions to afghanistan 's problems must come from within . " internal reconciliation is not something you can command people to organize and carry out , it has to come internally , it must be a genuine afghan process , " steinmeier said . but he gave an assurance that the international community would maintain its efforts to ensure security and help the country back onto its feet . " reconstruction has to go on ; this is something we owe to the afghan people , " he said .
" they deserve it . " a scheduled meeting with president pervez musharraf was cancelled owing to pressing internal affairs , pakistani officials said .

" the annual report , which is made up of 42 articles , is primarily concerned with the issues of excessive state surveillance , illegal searches and the degrading treament of immigrants .
it was presented for the occasion of germany 's constitutional day , celebrated on may 23 . kühling said the country 's highest court had repeatedly declared numerous police searches and phone taps unconstitutional but such cases continued to occur . bildunterschrift : the constitutional court is germany 's highest court without making reference to the recent raids on activists in the lead up to the g8 summit in june in the northern german town of heiligendamm , kühling called for increased compensation for victims of illegal police activities as a way of curbing their unconstitutional operations . caught in demonstration the former judge gave the example of a lawyer who was returning home from shopping when she was caught up in a mass arrest by police at a demonstration .
despite showing police her shopping and receipt , the woman was handcuffed and locked in a police van for more than five hours before being released in a nearby suburb . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reports criticizes police for picking up innocent bystanders in raids her detention was later declared illegal by a court .
however , criminal proceedings against the police were suspended .
after a long fight , the woman eventually received compensation of 500 euros -lrb- $ 675 -rrb- . kühling pointed out that stars received considerably more in damages for the publication of unauthorized photos . the report 's authors criticized several german states for amending their laws to give police special powers to conduct phone tapping and searches .
the authors said this allowed officials to circumvent the strict constitutional requirements for such activities . " war on terror " the report also criticized the " security hysteria " resulting from the " war against terror . "
speaking at the karlsruhe press conference , political scientist peter grottian said he was spied on by officers simply because of his participation in the berlin social forum , an organization made up largely of left-wing groups . referring to the recent g8 raids , grottian said the state made the assumption of " guilt by association " and that was then used to justify " disproportional state surveillance . " the so-called " alternative constitutional report " was presented week after interior minister wolgang schäuble released the government 's constitutional report warning that germany faced an increasing threat from terrorists . g8 threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dogs are being trained to sniff out protesters in a twist to the surveillance tale , the federal prosecutors ' office has confirmed a report that authorities are using scent tracking to keep tabs on g-8 protesters .
the daily hamburger morgenpost reported on tuesday that police had taken scent samples from activists so that police dogs can pick out the perpetrators if there is violence . the use of scent samples was widely practiced by the east german secret police , the stasi , who used the technique to track dissidents . petra pau , a lawmaker with the opposition left party , a group that includes ex-communists , blasted the practice as " another step away from a democratic state of law toward a preventive security state .

but germany wants to bring the two sides together at next week 's g8 foreign ministers ' meeting . there can be no long-term resolution of the conflict in afghanistan without pakistan 's cooperation , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in islamabad on wednesday . " without a regional approach , we will not succeed in bringing lasting peace to the region , " steinmeier said after talks with pakistan 's foreign minister khurshid kasuri .
steinmeier had previously met with afghanistan 's president hamid karzai in kabul on tuesday . steinmeier 's visit came amid international efforts to calm tensions between the two neighboring countries .
as well as addressing bilateral relations , his visit to the region was part of a german initiative within the g8 to help mend bridges between the governments .
both are key allies in the war against terrorism . germany 's efforts recognized in the region kasuri and his afghan counterpart rangeen dadfar-spanta are due to attend a g8 foreign ministers ' meeting in the german city of potsdam next week .
steinmeier said this was hoped to significantly improve dialogue between the sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier also met with pakistan 's prime minister shaukat aziz the countries are experiencing their worst relations since the taliban were ousted from power in afghanistan in 2001 . capping months of diplomatic disputes and insults , troops this month clashed at the border .
both sides accuse each other of failing to curb militant incursions into afghanistan from pakistan 's tribal areas .
steinmeier said border security was a focus of his talks during his visit to the region . kasuri said he was " looking forward " to attending the potsdam meeting .
the government in kabul also acknowledged the importance of the upcoming contacts in germany . " this meeting is extremely important for afghanistan and pakistan , " dadfar-spanta said tuesday evening after talks with steinmeier .
" without cooperation with pakistan , we will have no long-term peace and stability . " afghanistan 's solutions must be internal at the same time , the german minister also said final solutions to afghanistan 's problems must come from within . " internal reconciliation is not something you can command people to organize and carry out , it has to come internally , it must be a genuine afghan process , " steinmeier said . but he gave an assurance that the international community would maintain its efforts to ensure security and help the country back onto its feet . " reconstruction has to go on ; this is something we owe to the afghan people , " he said .
" they deserve it . " a scheduled meeting with president pervez musharraf was cancelled owing to pressing internal affairs , pakistani officials said .

now , with revenge within their grasp , dw-world.de ’ s nick amies hopes the fires of retribution consume the italians . revenge .
it ’ s a dish best served cold , according to certain sicilian families in the " waste disposal " business .
it also seems to be the whispered word on the lips of the milanese as the champions league final gets ever nearer . two years appears to be long enough for the flames of vengeance to have cooled sufficiently for the fans and players of ac milan .
now , with the chance to avenge the 2005 defeat to liverpool just hours away , the rossoneri are blowing new life on those smoldering embers of retribution while claiming to be doing nothing of the sort .
despite the protestations of the more cerebral members of carlo ancelotti ’ s team of world cup winners and superstars , a burning desire for justice is surely flickering in the minds of those who suffered such ignominious defeat in istanbul ’ s ataturk stadium .
for every kaka who says that the past means nothing , there is a rino gattuso snarling at the end of his master ’ s leash , waiting to chomp the legs of those who wounded his pride and crushed his dream .
even milan ’ s coach can not resist throwing the odd bowl of tepid bitterness into his italian designer microwave .
liverpool , ancelotti suggests , are the least technical of the three premiership teams to reach the champions league semi-finals this year .
he would have much preferred playing manchester united in the final .
but of course he would !
he beat them . motivational tool bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool celebrate the win in 2005 to suggest that the defeat on penalties in the 2005 final , after leading liverpool 3-0 at half-time , will not feature as a motivational tool or pre-match topic in the milan dressing room is preposterous . it was not only a sporting defeat , but a spiritual loss akin to the grief that follows the death of a relative .
the six-time winners had their hands on the cup and a ragged , surprise package team of opponents on the ropes . as far as milan were concerned , they weren ’ t even playing the best side in england , let alone a team equal to themselves in europe .
and yet , they lost .
a latin proverb states that " revenge is a confession of pain . "
you can only imagine the pain milan felt at the end .
to even consider that the night of may 25 , 2005 will not be on the minds of at least some of the milanese is ludicrous .
all of which suits liverpool just fine .
while the impression one gets of milan is one of a team pacing the floor in barely contained anticipation , checking their diamond-encrusted watches and chewing furiously on gum which has long lost its taste , the liverpool camp seems almost trappist in comparison.h how not to behave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool 's gabriel paletta , right , and javier mascherano while plotting the reds ’ downfall by watching dvds of their games and sending scouts to merseyside , carlo ancelotti should have added a compilation of jose mourinho sound bites to his preparatory files .
he would then know that hot air disperses very quickly in the skies over anfield .
the chelsea coach is a textbook example of how not to behave before facing liverpool in a crunch match .
put-downs and barbs just rebound off the armor liverpool coach rafa benitez keeps his charges encased in .
insults thrown in their direction come back infuriatingly unanswered - and warmed-up plates of two-year old revenge just end up in your lap .
benitez is a master tactician and a statistical obsessive to the point of compulsion .
nothing is allowed to interfere with how he wants his team to work and think .
talk of revenge and playground insults over style do not feature in his game plan and he will not allow any of the polemic coming from italy to distract his players .
if the memory of istanbul is invoked in any way , it will be used to remind his players that going a goal – or even three - down does not necessarily mean the game is over .
liverpool came to the 2005 final blinking in the lights of an event none of them as players had ever experienced before .
by the time many of them even realized what was going on , it was half over and they had a mountain to climb . but the fact that they climbed that mountain and stuck a red flag of victory in the summit , in addition to the two seasons of improvement under benitez which followed , means that this liverpool team is a very different proposition to the one which made a mockery of the odds .
new stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool coach rafael benitez benitez has new stars at his disposal after culling the squad of those players that did not fit his style or reach his high standards .
strikers peter crouch , dirk kuyt and craig bellamy all offer many different options in attack ; winger jermaine pennant provides added width , pace and improved delivery from the flanks , midfielder javier mascherano adds bite and cover to allow steven gerrard and xabi alonso the license to create .
the defense that was torn apart in istanbul is now marshalled by a more mature and flawless jamie carragher with his new protégé , the hugely driven and accomplished danny agger , by his side .
each new addition has been brought in to fill a specific role and to play a certain way in the coach ’ s vision of how liverpool should operate ; a specialist cog for every part of the machine .
so if milan take to the field on wednesday night burning with the desire to exact revenge , then the victory for liverpool will be half won .
a cool mind is needed and rafael benitez will have kept each of his players in refrigeration before the game .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 23.05.2007 milan face two opponents in liverpool and foolish revenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool and ac milan in 2005 ac milan have waited two years to avenge the 2005 champions league final defeat to liverpool .
now , with revenge within their grasp , dw-world.de ’ s nick amies hopes the fires of retribution consume the italians . revenge .
it ’ s a dish best served cold , according to certain sicilian families in the " waste disposal " business .
it also seems to be the whispered word on the lips of the milanese as the champions league final gets ever nearer . two years appears to be long enough for the flames of vengeance to have cooled sufficiently for the fans and players of ac milan .
now , with the chance to avenge the 2005 defeat to liverpool just hours away , the rossoneri are blowing new life on those smoldering embers of retribution while claiming to be doing nothing of the sort .
despite the protestations of the more cerebral members of carlo ancelotti ’ s team of world cup winners and superstars , a burning desire for justice is surely flickering in the minds of those who suffered such ignominious defeat in istanbul ’ s ataturk stadium .
for every kaka who says that the past means nothing , there is a rino gattuso snarling at the end of his master ’ s leash , waiting to chomp the legs of those who wounded his pride and crushed his dream .
even milan ’ s coach can not resist throwing the odd bowl of tepid bitterness into his italian designer microwave .
liverpool , ancelotti suggests , are the least technical of the three premiership teams to reach the champions league semi-finals this year .
he would have much preferred playing manchester united in the final .
but of course he would !
he beat them . motivational tool bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool celebrate the win in 2005 to suggest that the defeat on penalties in the 2005 final , after leading liverpool 3-0 at half-time , will not feature as a motivational tool or pre-match topic in the milan dressing room is preposterous . it was not only a sporting defeat , but a spiritual loss akin to the grief that follows the death of a relative .
the six-time winners had their hands on the cup and a ragged , surprise package team of opponents on the ropes . as far as milan were concerned , they weren ’ t even playing the best side in england , let alone a team equal to themselves in europe .
and yet , they lost .
a latin proverb states that " revenge is a confession of pain . "
you can only imagine the pain milan felt at the end .
to even consider that the night of may 25 , 2005 will not be on the minds of at least some of the milanese is ludicrous .
all of which suits liverpool just fine .
while the impression one gets of milan is one of a team pacing the floor in barely contained anticipation , checking their diamond-encrusted watches and chewing furiously on gum which has long lost its taste , the liverpool camp seems almost trappist in comparison.h how not to behave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool 's gabriel paletta , right , and javier mascherano while plotting the reds ’ downfall by watching dvds of their games and sending scouts to merseyside , carlo ancelotti should have added a compilation of jose mourinho sound bites to his preparatory files .
he would then know that hot air disperses very quickly in the skies over anfield .
the chelsea coach is a textbook example of how not to behave before facing liverpool in a crunch match .
put-downs and barbs just rebound off the armor liverpool coach rafa benitez keeps his charges encased in .
insults thrown in their direction come back infuriatingly unanswered - and warmed-up plates of two-year old revenge just end up in your lap .
benitez is a master tactician and a statistical obsessive to the point of compulsion .
nothing is allowed to interfere with how he wants his team to work and think .
talk of revenge and playground insults over style do not feature in his game plan and he will not allow any of the polemic coming from italy to distract his players .
if the memory of istanbul is invoked in any way , it will be used to remind his players that going a goal – or even three - down does not necessarily mean the game is over .
liverpool came to the 2005 final blinking in the lights of an event none of them as players had ever experienced before .
by the time many of them even realized what was going on , it was half over and they had a mountain to climb . but the fact that they climbed that mountain and stuck a red flag of victory in the summit , in addition to the two seasons of improvement under benitez which followed , means that this liverpool team is a very different proposition to the one which made a mockery of the odds .
new stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool coach rafael benitez benitez has new stars at his disposal after culling the squad of those players that did not fit his style or reach his high standards .
strikers peter crouch , dirk kuyt and craig bellamy all offer many different options in attack ; winger jermaine pennant provides added width , pace and improved delivery from the flanks , midfielder javier mascherano adds bite and cover to allow steven gerrard and xabi alonso the license to create .
the defense that was torn apart in istanbul is now marshalled by a more mature and flawless jamie carragher with his new protégé , the hugely driven and accomplished danny agger , by his side .
each new addition has been brought in to fill a specific role and to play a certain way in the coach ’ s vision of how liverpool should operate ; a specialist cog for every part of the machine .
so if milan take to the field on wednesday night burning with the desire to exact revenge , then the victory for liverpool will be half won .
a cool mind is needed and rafael benitez will have kept each of his players in refrigeration before the game .
against a combustible side wanting blood , liverpool can think and play their way into a position of dominance and then let the game plan and undoubted talent of this 2007 model finish the job .
because , as another well-known quote suggests , revenge proves its own executioner . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ac milan win champions league final manchester lose 3:0 to ac milan ; chelsea lose out on penalties -lrb- 02.05.2007 -rrb- chelsea wins narrowly in champions league semifinal joe cole scored the only goal of the game as chelsea emerged from the first leg of their champions league semi-final with a 1-0 advantage over liverpool to take to anfield .

prodi threatened that rome would not sign any unconvincing compromise accords .
" europe can not achieve ambitious results without ambitious reforms , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday .
" in the last two years euroskeptic views have been listened to almost exclusively , " said prodi .
" it is time to listen to those who ratified the 2004 treaty . "
warning to euroskeptics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' no ' from french and dutch voters in 2005 derailed the planned constitution the italian prime minister 's remarks were not specifically addressed to any state , but france , britain , the netherlands , poland and the czech republic have all expressed reservations about the constitution and want its scope to be curtailed .
french and dutch voters rejected a proposed eu constitution two years ago , plunging the eu into constitutional crisis .
most of the 18 countries that did ratify the original constitution have called for its main planks , such as the institution of a european affairs foreign minister , to be retained , and they want a non-rotating eu presidency and the extension of the qualified majority voting system .
on tuesday , meanwhile , denmark welcomed germany 's attempts to ensure that " concrete decisions " are made at the eu summit on june 21-22 . preserve core elements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says the treaty 's core elements should be retained danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen expressed support for the idea of a shorter treaty that would preserve the " core elements " of the original constitution .
" one solution could be a shorter treaty amending the existing treaties , " rasmussen said .
he said he was hoping for a rapid solution , which could see a new text approved by the end of the year .
like prodi , rasmussen opposed calling into question the voting system agreed in 2004 , which he called more transparent and balanced .
he was speaking after talks with the german chancellor in berlin on tuesday .
newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy has proposed a " mini-treaty " that omits controversial elements of the original draft , instead of a fully fledged constitution .
the french leader visited brussels on wednesday .
mini-treaty proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's idea of a mini-treaty is causing waves british prime minister tony blair has said he supports sarkozy 's plan for a simplified version .
the german press has reported that merkel responded coldly to the idea of a mini-treaty when she met with sarkozy in berlin last week just hours after he took office .
but merkel on tuesday said she was " very satisfied " with their meeting .
the german chancellor has said she wants to preserve as much as possible of the original text .
germany holds the eu presidency until the end of june , and merkel is trying to get member nations to commit to a " road map " that will lead them to ratify a new treaty before the european parliament elections in 2009 . dw-staff -lrb- jg -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany quizzes eu members on constitution germany , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has sent the 27 eu member states a questionnaire on what to do about the bloc 's stalled constitutional treaty to kick-start an intensive series of talks .

" ' stasi methods ' clearly refers to … techniques such as denunciation , blackmail and torture , but not to what is a valid legal police practice , " said konrad freiberg , the chairman of the federal police union , in a statement on wednesday . police should be able to use all methods " to preferably avert violence acts before they happen , " he said . strange idea however , wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the christian democratic parliamentary faction , said he found the whole practice of smell tracking " rather strange . " " you have a protester , the dog has a sniff and then he wags three times with his tail or barks - what 's supposed to happen then ? "
bosbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 protesters wo n't be able to come within 200m of the security fence at heiligendamm left-wing groups have warned the police that the recent raids angered their supporters and would only heighten their resolve to demonstrate at the g8 summit being held in the northern coastal town of heiligendamm from june 6 - 8 . protesters are also upset over a ban on protests at the g8 venue and the nearby airport , and are taking legal action to attempt to overturn it . it is believed that left-wing groups could be behind the torching on tuesday of the car belonging to the editor of bild , germany 's biggest-selling newspaper , and those of two businessmen last week . german authorities are expecting up to 100,000 activists to target the g8 summit being hosted by german chancellor angela merkel .

but while many outsiders see germany as a country suffering from a severe lack of inhibition , or at least having a different moral outlook than buttoned-up britains or puritanical americans , there really are rules that govern when and where it is appropriate to let it all hang out .
subtle difficulties of cultural communication saunas ?
lakes ?
certain parks ?
go ahead , give yourself some air .
walking through a good-sized city on a tuesday afternoon ?
better cover up .
but those subtle distinctions were lost on an american tourist , apparently improperly schooled when it comes to a german society with a tendency to let it all hang out , at least in some contexts .
earlier this week , when temperatures topped 30 degrees celsius -lrb- 86 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , the sightseer stripped down and stuffed his clothes into a bag , which he carried with him as he strolled the streets of nuremberg , a conservative town in bavaria .
he apparently thought it was the appropriate thing to do .
costly cool-down but city streets in germany lack signs for freie körper kultur -lrb- " free body culture , " or " nudist area " -rrb- , the usual signal that it is ok to walk around in your birthday suit .
they are not , in fact , not clothing-optional zones .
shocked locals contacted the police , who apprehended the surprised tourist .
police said the man was n't drunk and had n't been taking drugs , but " he believed it was commonplace to be nude in public in germany . "
" we have been having unusually hot weather here lately but , all the same , we ca n't have this , " a spokesman for police told news services .
the police made him get dressed and pay a 200 euro -lrb- $ 269 -rrb- deposit pending an investigation into his behavior . dw staff -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police release nude shopper police detained a cologne woman shopping naked early one morning this week but let her go after admonishing her .

russian president vladimir putin begins a two day visit to vienna , austria .
but what was supposed to be a state visit based on trade and energy issues may be hijacked by human rights topics . russian president vladimir putin said wednesday that new eu members need to " get over past phobias " that are poisoning relations between russia and the union .
" we do not have particular problems with the eu .
we have had certain difficulties with our nearby neighbors , " putin told a press conference during an official visit to vienna .
" the soviet union is in part to blame but our european partners must get over past phobias , " he added .
" with the eu enlargement these problems now belong to the european union .
this does not contribute to rapid evolution of relations " with moscow , putin insisted .
a russian embargo on polish meat imports is at the heart of a deepening political crisis between moscow and brussels that has blocked talks on a new eu-russia accord since late last year .
relations have also been strained by a dispute over energy exports to lithuania and a bitter controversy over the removal of a soviet war monument in estonia .
putin 's trip closely follows a tense summit last week in which relations between the eu and russia dipped to a new low over issues such as human rights , and a trade dispute with poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin planned to talk business with his austrian hosts calls from activists amnesty international , the international helsinki federation and reporters without borders are staging protests .
rubina möhring , the president of reporters without borders in austria , called for politicians to link human rights and media freedoms to business deals .
" i would like them to say to mr. putin to act in the way that human rights and press freedom are respected in russia , and that this behavior could influence the discussion about the economic treaties as well , " möhring said .
the austrian president said he plans to raise issues of democracy and human rights with putin , but said this will be done behind closed doors and bilateral relations and business deals will dominate the visit .
pipeline control at issue like much of europe , austria is a big consumer of russian energy .
it is also a partner in the proposed nabucco pipeline , which will bring gas from the caspian sea to central europe - bypassing russia .
the trip gives moscow the chance to put its case as a reliable supplier and to do deals on energy cooperation .
edward christie , a vienna-based energy specialist and economist , said there is competition for control of the pipelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian president heinz fischer will dine with putin " a certain number of european countries would much rather channel some of these central asian resources directly to european markets and not have them transit through russia , " christie said .

russian president vladimir putin begins a two day visit to vienna , austria .
but what was supposed to be a state visit based on trade and energy issues may be hijacked by human rights topics . russian president vladimir putin said wednesday that new eu members need to " get over past phobias " that are poisoning relations between russia and the union .
" we do not have particular problems with the eu .
we have had certain difficulties with our nearby neighbors , " putin told a press conference during an official visit to vienna .
" the soviet union is in part to blame but our european partners must get over past phobias , " he added .
" with the eu enlargement these problems now belong to the european union .
this does not contribute to rapid evolution of relations " with moscow , putin insisted .
a russian embargo on polish meat imports is at the heart of a deepening political crisis between moscow and brussels that has blocked talks on a new eu-russia accord since late last year .
relations have also been strained by a dispute over energy exports to lithuania and a bitter controversy over the removal of a soviet war monument in estonia .
putin 's trip closely follows a tense summit last week in which relations between the eu and russia dipped to a new low over issues such as human rights , and a trade dispute with poland .

three of the pictures are by performance artist vladislav mamychev-monroe .
in the photoworks , he portrays himself as a hysterical adolf hitler , a plastic-bearded osama bin laden and a cat-loving pope benedict .
another work by aidan salakhova portrays a burkha-clad muslim clasping a miniature minaret with distinctly phallic connotations .
two of the other pictures by the blue noses group and by konstantin latyshev make satirical reference to the russian president .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 23.05.2007 art show in germany falls foul of russian censorship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the candle of our life " by the blue noses - stopped at the border a german exhibition intended to illustrate contemporary art trends in russia has become a victim of current political realities . six works by contemporary russian artists that were due to appear in an exhibition opening on wednesday in dresden 's municipal gallery were not allowed to pass through customs .
three of the pictures are by performance artist vladislav mamychev-monroe .
in the photoworks , he portrays himself as a hysterical adolf hitler , a plastic-bearded osama bin laden and a cat-loving pope benedict .
another work by aidan salakhova portrays a burkha-clad muslim clasping a miniature minaret with distinctly phallic connotations .
two of the other pictures by the blue noses group and by konstantin latyshev make satirical reference to the russian president .
the blue noses pose as vladimir putin , russian cultural idol alexander pushkin and christ .
latyshev 's work is a poster that merges the features of the president and pushkin .
ersatz images bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by vladislav mamyshev-monroe , from the series » starz « : osama bin laden , adolf hitler , pope , 2005 the dresden museum has responded to the events by displaying small-scaled reproductions on paper of the works in the spaces where the originals were meant to hang .
johannes schmidt , curator of the exhibition called " learning from moscow , " said he had been informed by the company involved in the transportation of the pictures that customs officers had refused to issue export licences for the art works .
the transport company had been informed that they were not being released for fear of causing international protest .
" i am not really surprised .
this exhibition is directly concerned with art that concerns itself with contemporary global themes and with political realities in today 's russia , " schmidt said .
" the climate in russia is getting tougher as the elections approach and relations have also become frostier with germany recently . "
harmless jokes he said the pictures , while clearly a little irreverent in character , were " harmless jokes . "
other works by the artists involved have gone on show in dresden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a putin / pushkin mutation by konstantin latyshev the curator does not believe the export stop was an order that came from above , but came from people at lower levels being overenthusiastic in their desire to please political higher-ups .
" i am not someone who pleads for total freedom for art because that would mean allowing far-right images and child pornography .
but apart from that artists should have as much freedom as possible , " he said .
" the artists have taken a long time to gain international attention .
collectors are just becoming interested in them .
this is putting a brake on this .
that has a certain tragic quality , " he added .
recently , a british gallery owner was prevented from taking another picture by the blue noses out of the country .
it showed the trio of artists donning masks depicting photos of putin , bush and bin laden .
when he legally challenged the move , the work was released .
schmidt said that the museum had decided not to officially protest against the action because budgetary constraints meant that they would not be able to pay for a second transport . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de peter sodann peter sodann is an actor is best known in germany for playing commissioner bruno ehrlicher in the german drama " crime scene " .

but it 's just starting for promoted rostock and duisburg .
the difference between success and failure for these small clubs was consistency . thanks to their poor goal difference , mainz had hardly a chance of staying up when they went into their final match against bayern munich - which they promptly lost 5-2 .
the game was mainz 's whole season in miniature .
they dug themselves an early hole , fought back and came up short . mainz , usually offensively minded , failed to react quickly enough to the departure of key forwards before the start of the season .
unable to score goals , they were dead last in december - with only 11 points . bringing in striker mohamed zidan , who scored 13 times for the club , restored mainz to playing respectably .

dum was out on loan from leverkusen , and during the winter , aachen sold the rights to schlaudraff to bayern next season .
and players who have no future at a club usually are n't the ones you want in a dogfight . accused of not giving it their all , schlaudraff and dum were kicked off the squad in the middle of the relegation battle .

this was key as the zebras only beat out freiburg for third place because of their better goal difference but duisburg 's last trip to the top flight only lasted one year , and it 's questionable whether they can bolster the squad enough to be competitive . and if all the newly promoted clubs want to stay up , they need to remember that the season is 34 games long - and that for small teams slumps are often fatal . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rough ride to the bundesliga title for champions stuttgart although vfb stuttgart were crowned bundesliga champions on saturday , it was not a smooth ride for armin veh 's men whose early-season form showed little title-winning potential .

usually sequels never live up to the original .
but with so much at stake , and too much to lose liverpool wanted to prove a point - that they deserved to win two years ago in a dramatic penalty shoot-out .
but ac milan , who at the beginning of the season didn ’ t know if were going to be playing in europe at all after being implicated in a match fixing scandal , were out for revenge against the english side .
two years ago , liverpool 's victory was all about an incredible comeback and will go down as probably the greatest european cup final of all-time .
but wednesday ’ s match didn ’ t live up to those expectations .
liverpool 's main priority was to suffocate the game and stifle ac milan 's midfield and frustrate kaka in particular as he is probably the best midfielder in the world .
filippo inzaghi goal gave ac milan the lead on the stroke of half-time - against the run of play – by deflecting a freekick from andrea pirlo .
the goal in the 45th minute was against the run of play after a confident liverpool enjoyed most of the possession and created more chances with steven gerrard hungry for goal scoring opportunities .
liverpool had the first shot on goal in the 10th minute but jeramine penant ’ s effort was saved by dida .
conceding the goal just before half time damaged liverpool ‘ s spirit .
the spark which they had showed in the first half was gone .
fillipo inzaghi put the issue beyount doubt when a pass from kaka gave him acres of space in front of the liverpool goal .
inzaghi then cooly rounded reina to slide the goal into the liverpool net .
would there be a comeback for liverpool this time around ?
never right off liverpool as milan will surely know .
dutch striker dirk kuyt pulled one back two minutes from time with a header which flashed past goalkeeper dida .
but in the end it was milan 's fans celebrating loudest after seeing their 38-year-old captain paulo maldini lift the trophy . nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic champions league final dw-radio : sports report feedback send us an e-mail .

usually sequels never live up to the original .
but with so much at stake , and too much to lose liverpool wanted to prove a point - that they deserved to win two years ago in a dramatic penalty shoot-out .
but ac milan , who at the beginning of the season didn ’ t know if were going to be playing in europe at all after being implicated in a match fixing scandal , were out for revenge against the english side .
two years ago , liverpool 's victory was all about an incredible comeback and will go down as probably the greatest european cup final of all-time .
but wednesday ’ s match didn ’ t live up to those expectations .
liverpool 's main priority was to suffocate the game and stifle ac milan 's midfield and frustrate kaka in particular as he is probably the best midfielder in the world .
filippo inzaghi goal gave ac milan the lead on the stroke of half-time - against the run of play – by deflecting a freekick from andrea pirlo .
the goal in the 45th minute was against the run of play after a confident liverpool enjoyed most of the possession and created more chances with steven gerrard hungry for goal scoring opportunities .
liverpool had the first shot on goal in the 10th minute but jeramine penant ’ s effort was saved by dida .
conceding the goal just before half time damaged liverpool ‘ s spirit .
the spark which they had showed in the first half was gone .
fillipo inzaghi put the issue beyount doubt when a pass from kaka gave him acres of space in front of the liverpool goal .
inzaghi then cooly rounded reina to slide the goal into the liverpool net .
would there be a comeback for liverpool this time around ?
never right off liverpool as milan will surely know .
dutch striker dirk kuyt pulled one back two minutes from time with a header which flashed past goalkeeper dida .

but it 's just starting for promoted rostock and duisburg .
the difference between success and failure for these small clubs was consistency . thanks to their poor goal difference , mainz had hardly a chance of staying up when they went into their final match against bayern munich - which they promptly lost 5-2 .
the game was mainz 's whole season in miniature .
they dug themselves an early hole , fought back and came up short . mainz , usually offensively minded , failed to react quickly enough to the departure of key forwards before the start of the season .
unable to score goals , they were dead last in december - with only 11 points . bringing in striker mohamed zidan , who scored 13 times for the club , restored mainz to playing respectably .
but the deficit they carried with them from 2006 was too great and this popular underdog 's first run in the bundesliga came to an end after three seasons . another tale of two seasons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen , in yellow , could n't elevate their game mainz 's rhineland neighbors aachen punched above their weight for the first half - thanks to young players like striker jan schlaudraff and defender sascha dum . but problems lurked .
dum was out on loan from leverkusen , and during the winter , aachen sold the rights to schlaudraff to bayern next season .
and players who have no future at a club usually are n't the ones you want in a dogfight . accused of not giving it their all , schlaudraff and dum were kicked off the squad in the middle of the relegation battle .
aachen slumped and headed down after only one season in the first division . mönchengladbach had already been relegated a few weeks previously . experience crucial for promoted clubs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock celebrated a deserved return to the bundesliga karlsruhe had already wrapped up the second-division title , but there was plenty of excitement on the last day of play , as rostock and duisburg got clutch wins to edge out freiburg for promotion . rostock , led by veteran midfielder stefan beinlich , needed every bit of their ten years experience in the first division to hang on to a top-three spot . despite a mediocre attack , the team conceded only 30 goals and will now become the second eastern german club , together with cottbus , in the top flight .
but they 'll need to get more potent to survive . pair of lethal zebras bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these blue-and-white zebras get another crack at the top flight duisburg bounced back to the bundesliga after only one season in the second division thanks to two seasoned strikers : mohamadou idrissou and youssef mokhtari . drawing on previous experience for first-division sides hanover and cottbus , idrissou and mokhtari combined for twenty goals in the division 's second-best offense .
this was key as the zebras only beat out freiburg for third place because of their better goal difference but duisburg 's last trip to the top flight only lasted one year , and it 's questionable whether they can bolster the squad enough to be competitive . and if all the newly promoted clubs want to stay up , they need to remember that the season is 34 games long - and that for small teams slumps are often fatal . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rough ride to the bundesliga title for champions stuttgart although vfb stuttgart were crowned bundesliga champions on saturday , it was not a smooth ride for armin veh 's men whose early-season form showed little title-winning potential .

three of the pictures are by performance artist vladislav mamychev-monroe .
in the photoworks , he portrays himself as a hysterical adolf hitler , a plastic-bearded osama bin laden and a cat-loving pope benedict .
another work by aidan salakhova portrays a burkha-clad muslim clasping a miniature minaret with distinctly phallic connotations .
two of the other pictures by the blue noses group and by konstantin latyshev make satirical reference to the russian president .
the blue noses pose as vladimir putin , russian cultural idol alexander pushkin and christ .
latyshev 's work is a poster that merges the features of the president and pushkin .

johannes schmidt , curator of the exhibition called " learning from moscow , " said he had been informed by the company involved in the transportation of the pictures that customs officers had refused to issue export licences for the art works .
the transport company had been informed that they were not being released for fear of causing international protest .
" i am not really surprised .
this exhibition is directly concerned with art that concerns itself with contemporary global themes and with political realities in today 's russia , " schmidt said .
" the climate in russia is getting tougher as the elections approach and relations have also become frostier with germany recently . "
harmless jokes he said the pictures , while clearly a little irreverent in character , were " harmless jokes . "
other works by the artists involved have gone on show in dresden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a putin / pushkin mutation by konstantin latyshev the curator does not believe the export stop was an order that came from above , but came from people at lower levels being overenthusiastic in their desire to please political higher-ups .
" i am not someone who pleads for total freedom for art because that would mean allowing far-right images and child pornography .
but apart from that artists should have as much freedom as possible , " he said .
" the artists have taken a long time to gain international attention .
collectors are just becoming interested in them .
this is putting a brake on this .
that has a certain tragic quality , " he added .
recently , a british gallery owner was prevented from taking another picture by the blue noses out of the country .
it showed the trio of artists donning masks depicting photos of putin , bush and bin laden .
when he legally challenged the move , the work was released .

prodi threatened that rome would not sign any unconvincing compromise accords .
" europe can not achieve ambitious results without ambitious reforms , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday .
" in the last two years euroskeptic views have been listened to almost exclusively , " said prodi .
" it is time to listen to those who ratified the 2004 treaty . "
warning to euroskeptics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' no ' from french and dutch voters in 2005 derailed the planned constitution the italian prime minister 's remarks were not specifically addressed to any state , but france , britain , the netherlands , poland and the czech republic have all expressed reservations about the constitution and want its scope to be curtailed .
french and dutch voters rejected a proposed eu constitution two years ago , plunging the eu into constitutional crisis .
most of the 18 countries that did ratify the original constitution have called for its main planks , such as the institution of a european affairs foreign minister , to be retained , and they want a non-rotating eu presidency and the extension of the qualified majority voting system .

he said he was hoping for a rapid solution , which could see a new text approved by the end of the year .
like prodi , rasmussen opposed calling into question the voting system agreed in 2004 , which he called more transparent and balanced .
he was speaking after talks with the german chancellor in berlin on tuesday .
newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy has proposed a " mini-treaty " that omits controversial elements of the original draft , instead of a fully fledged constitution .

russian president vladimir putin begins a two day visit to vienna , austria .
but what was supposed to be a state visit based on trade and energy issues may be hijacked by human rights topics . russian president vladimir putin said wednesday that new eu members need to " get over past phobias " that are poisoning relations between russia and the union .
" we do not have particular problems with the eu .
we have had certain difficulties with our nearby neighbors , " putin told a press conference during an official visit to vienna .
" the soviet union is in part to blame but our european partners must get over past phobias , " he added .
" with the eu enlargement these problems now belong to the european union .
this does not contribute to rapid evolution of relations " with moscow , putin insisted .
a russian embargo on polish meat imports is at the heart of a deepening political crisis between moscow and brussels that has blocked talks on a new eu-russia accord since late last year .
relations have also been strained by a dispute over energy exports to lithuania and a bitter controversy over the removal of a soviet war monument in estonia .
putin 's trip closely follows a tense summit last week in which relations between the eu and russia dipped to a new low over issues such as human rights , and a trade dispute with poland .

rubina möhring , the president of reporters without borders in austria , called for politicians to link human rights and media freedoms to business deals .
" i would like them to say to mr. putin to act in the way that human rights and press freedom are respected in russia , and that this behavior could influence the discussion about the economic treaties as well , " möhring said .
the austrian president said he plans to raise issues of democracy and human rights with putin , but said this will be done behind closed doors and bilateral relations and business deals will dominate the visit .
pipeline control at issue like much of europe , austria is a big consumer of russian energy .
it is also a partner in the proposed nabucco pipeline , which will bring gas from the caspian sea to central europe - bypassing russia .
the trip gives moscow the chance to put its case as a reliable supplier and to do deals on energy cooperation .

russian president vladimir putin begins a two day visit to vienna , austria .
but what was supposed to be a state visit based on trade and energy issues may be hijacked by human rights topics . russian president vladimir putin said wednesday that new eu members need to " get over past phobias " that are poisoning relations between russia and the union .
" we do not have particular problems with the eu .
we have had certain difficulties with our nearby neighbors , " putin told a press conference during an official visit to vienna .
" the soviet union is in part to blame but our european partners must get over past phobias , " he added .
" with the eu enlargement these problems now belong to the european union .
this does not contribute to rapid evolution of relations " with moscow , putin insisted .
a russian embargo on polish meat imports is at the heart of a deepening political crisis between moscow and brussels that has blocked talks on a new eu-russia accord since late last year .
relations have also been strained by a dispute over energy exports to lithuania and a bitter controversy over the removal of a soviet war monument in estonia .
putin 's trip closely follows a tense summit last week in which relations between the eu and russia dipped to a new low over issues such as human rights , and a trade dispute with poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin planned to talk business with his austrian hosts calls from activists amnesty international , the international helsinki federation and reporters without borders are staging protests .
rubina möhring , the president of reporters without borders in austria , called for politicians to link human rights and media freedoms to business deals .
" i would like them to say to mr. putin to act in the way that human rights and press freedom are respected in russia , and that this behavior could influence the discussion about the economic treaties as well , " möhring said .
the austrian president said he plans to raise issues of democracy and human rights with putin , but said this will be done behind closed doors and bilateral relations and business deals will dominate the visit .
pipeline control at issue like much of europe , austria is a big consumer of russian energy .
it is also a partner in the proposed nabucco pipeline , which will bring gas from the caspian sea to central europe - bypassing russia .
the trip gives moscow the chance to put its case as a reliable supplier and to do deals on energy cooperation .
edward christie , a vienna-based energy specialist and economist , said there is competition for control of the pipelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian president heinz fischer will dine with putin " a certain number of european countries would much rather channel some of these central asian resources directly to european markets and not have them transit through russia , " christie said .
" for russia , on the other hand , it is obviously extremely beneficial to have those resources transit their territory .

the admissions have cast a shadow over the telekom team 's tour de france victories in the 1990s . pressure is mounting both on team telekom 's successor t-mobile and its former stars bjarne riis and jan ullrich , who won the tour de france in 1996 and 1997 respectively , after statements by two teammates from that period . earlier this week , ex-telekom-rider bert dietz said doctors had given him injections of epo , a banned substance that increases the production of red blood cells , in 1995 .
in an interview on german public television , dietz quoted the doctors as saying : " if we want to be riding at the front of the pack , we 'll probably have to try out this new substance . " dietz 's former teammate christian henn also owned up to taking epo .
" the time was such , " he told the daily kölner stadtanzeiger newspaper , " that otherwise we would n't reasonably have been able to compete .
it was all or nothing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the riders say doctors gave them epo at training in mallorca in 1995 the two ex-riders ' statements support allegations recently made in a book by telekom 's former masseur , jef d 'hont , that doping was rampant at telekom during the team 's glory years . german cycling star jan ullrich , who was fired from t-mobile last year after suspicions of being involved in a separate scheme to use enhanced blood , has refused to comment on any doping allegations . but t-mobile 's former sporting director walter godefroot has denied the allegations , accusing dietz of financial interest in making his confession . team 's future in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the results of urine tests have meant big trouble for professional cycling the university hospital of freiburg in southern germany said it is temporarily suspending two doctors implicated in the admission , pending the results of an investigation by an independent committee . the hospital , which is one of germany 's most renowned sports medicine facilities , also said it would end its association with t-mobile . team t-mobile 's sponsor , deutsche telekom , will offer an official reaction to dietz and henn 's statements at a press conference on thursday , amidst speculations that it might discontinue its cycling activities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : questions are being asked about titles won by riis and ullrich " the question is whether we believe cycling can be cleaned up , " stephan althoff , telekom 's head of sponsoring , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" if not , we 'll have to take appropriate action , " he said . admissions of doping from former members of one of cycling 's premier teams is further bad news for the beleaguered sport - 2006 tour de france winner floyd landis is still being investigated for abnormally high levels of testosterone and could well be stripped of his title . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dna test links former german cycling star to doping scandal german prosecutors have confirmed that blood found during a spanish anti-doping investigation came from disgraced german cyclist jan ullrich .

but while many outsiders see germany as a country suffering from a severe lack of inhibition , or at least having a different moral outlook than buttoned-up britains or puritanical americans , there really are rules that govern when and where it is appropriate to let it all hang out .
subtle difficulties of cultural communication saunas ?
lakes ?
certain parks ?
go ahead , give yourself some air .
walking through a good-sized city on a tuesday afternoon ?
better cover up .
but those subtle distinctions were lost on an american tourist , apparently improperly schooled when it comes to a german society with a tendency to let it all hang out , at least in some contexts .
earlier this week , when temperatures topped 30 degrees celsius -lrb- 86 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , the sightseer stripped down and stuffed his clothes into a bag , which he carried with him as he strolled the streets of nuremberg , a conservative town in bavaria .
he apparently thought it was the appropriate thing to do .
costly cool-down but city streets in germany lack signs for freie körper kultur -lrb- " free body culture , " or " nudist area " -rrb- , the usual signal that it is ok to walk around in your birthday suit .
they are not , in fact , not clothing-optional zones .
shocked locals contacted the police , who apprehended the surprised tourist .
police said the man was n't drunk and had n't been taking drugs , but " he believed it was commonplace to be nude in public in germany . "
" we have been having unusually hot weather here lately but , all the same , we ca n't have this , " a spokesman for police told news services .
the police made him get dressed and pay a 200 euro -lrb- $ 269 -rrb- deposit pending an investigation into his behavior . dw staff -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police release nude shopper police detained a cologne woman shopping naked early one morning this week but let her go after admonishing her .
-lrb- 21.07.2005 -rrb- naked bather gets munich city authorities in a lather tourists come to munich for many reasons : architecture , culture , beer .
few come to see a 44-year-old naked homeless woman washing herself .
but the city just ca n't stop bille taking off her clothes in public .
-lrb- 25.08.2006 -rrb- adidas hit with lawsuit over missy elliot clothing line a us charity has filed a $ 10 million -lrb- 8.3 million euros -rrb- lawsuit against adidas-salomon , alleging the german sporting-goods company improperly used its logo on its clothing line designed by rapper missy elliot .

now , with revenge within their grasp , dw-world.de ’ s nick amies hopes the fires of retribution consume the italians . revenge .
it ’ s a dish best served cold , according to certain sicilian families in the " waste disposal " business .
it also seems to be the whispered word on the lips of the milanese as the champions league final gets ever nearer . two years appears to be long enough for the flames of vengeance to have cooled sufficiently for the fans and players of ac milan .
now , with the chance to avenge the 2005 defeat to liverpool just hours away , the rossoneri are blowing new life on those smoldering embers of retribution while claiming to be doing nothing of the sort .
despite the protestations of the more cerebral members of carlo ancelotti ’ s team of world cup winners and superstars , a burning desire for justice is surely flickering in the minds of those who suffered such ignominious defeat in istanbul ’ s ataturk stadium .
for every kaka who says that the past means nothing , there is a rino gattuso snarling at the end of his master ’ s leash , waiting to chomp the legs of those who wounded his pride and crushed his dream .
even milan ’ s coach can not resist throwing the odd bowl of tepid bitterness into his italian designer microwave .
liverpool , ancelotti suggests , are the least technical of the three premiership teams to reach the champions league semi-finals this year .
he would have much preferred playing manchester united in the final .
but of course he would !
he beat them . motivational tool bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool celebrate the win in 2005 to suggest that the defeat on penalties in the 2005 final , after leading liverpool 3-0 at half-time , will not feature as a motivational tool or pre-match topic in the milan dressing room is preposterous . it was not only a sporting defeat , but a spiritual loss akin to the grief that follows the death of a relative .
the six-time winners had their hands on the cup and a ragged , surprise package team of opponents on the ropes . as far as milan were concerned , they weren ’ t even playing the best side in england , let alone a team equal to themselves in europe .
and yet , they lost .
a latin proverb states that " revenge is a confession of pain . "
you can only imagine the pain milan felt at the end .
to even consider that the night of may 25 , 2005 will not be on the minds of at least some of the milanese is ludicrous .
all of which suits liverpool just fine .
while the impression one gets of milan is one of a team pacing the floor in barely contained anticipation , checking their diamond-encrusted watches and chewing furiously on gum which has long lost its taste , the liverpool camp seems almost trappist in comparison.h how not to behave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool 's gabriel paletta , right , and javier mascherano while plotting the reds ’ downfall by watching dvds of their games and sending scouts to merseyside , carlo ancelotti should have added a compilation of jose mourinho sound bites to his preparatory files .
he would then know that hot air disperses very quickly in the skies over anfield .
the chelsea coach is a textbook example of how not to behave before facing liverpool in a crunch match .
put-downs and barbs just rebound off the armor liverpool coach rafa benitez keeps his charges encased in .
insults thrown in their direction come back infuriatingly unanswered - and warmed-up plates of two-year old revenge just end up in your lap .
benitez is a master tactician and a statistical obsessive to the point of compulsion .
nothing is allowed to interfere with how he wants his team to work and think .
talk of revenge and playground insults over style do not feature in his game plan and he will not allow any of the polemic coming from italy to distract his players .
if the memory of istanbul is invoked in any way , it will be used to remind his players that going a goal – or even three - down does not necessarily mean the game is over .
liverpool came to the 2005 final blinking in the lights of an event none of them as players had ever experienced before .
by the time many of them even realized what was going on , it was half over and they had a mountain to climb . but the fact that they climbed that mountain and stuck a red flag of victory in the summit , in addition to the two seasons of improvement under benitez which followed , means that this liverpool team is a very different proposition to the one which made a mockery of the odds .
new stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool coach rafael benitez benitez has new stars at his disposal after culling the squad of those players that did not fit his style or reach his high standards .
strikers peter crouch , dirk kuyt and craig bellamy all offer many different options in attack ; winger jermaine pennant provides added width , pace and improved delivery from the flanks , midfielder javier mascherano adds bite and cover to allow steven gerrard and xabi alonso the license to create .
the defense that was torn apart in istanbul is now marshalled by a more mature and flawless jamie carragher with his new protégé , the hugely driven and accomplished danny agger , by his side .
each new addition has been brought in to fill a specific role and to play a certain way in the coach ’ s vision of how liverpool should operate ; a specialist cog for every part of the machine .
so if milan take to the field on wednesday night burning with the desire to exact revenge , then the victory for liverpool will be half won .
a cool mind is needed and rafael benitez will have kept each of his players in refrigeration before the game .
against a combustible side wanting blood , liverpool can think and play their way into a position of dominance and then let the game plan and undoubted talent of this 2007 model finish the job .
because , as another well-known quote suggests , revenge proves its own executioner . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ac milan win champions league final manchester lose 3:0 to ac milan ; chelsea lose out on penalties -lrb- 02.05.2007 -rrb- chelsea wins narrowly in champions league semifinal joe cole scored the only goal of the game as chelsea emerged from the first leg of their champions league semi-final with a 1-0 advantage over liverpool to take to anfield .

it also seems to be the whispered word on the lips of the milanese as the champions league final gets ever nearer . two years appears to be long enough for the flames of vengeance to have cooled sufficiently for the fans and players of ac milan .
now , with the chance to avenge the 2005 defeat to liverpool just hours away , the rossoneri are blowing new life on those smoldering embers of retribution while claiming to be doing nothing of the sort .
despite the protestations of the more cerebral members of carlo ancelotti ’ s team of world cup winners and superstars , a burning desire for justice is surely flickering in the minds of those who suffered such ignominious defeat in istanbul ’ s ataturk stadium .
for every kaka who says that the past means nothing , there is a rino gattuso snarling at the end of his master ’ s leash , waiting to chomp the legs of those who wounded his pride and crushed his dream .
even milan ’ s coach can not resist throwing the odd bowl of tepid bitterness into his italian designer microwave .
liverpool , ancelotti suggests , are the least technical of the three premiership teams to reach the champions league semi-finals this year .
he would have much preferred playing manchester united in the final .
but of course he would !
he beat them . motivational tool bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool celebrate the win in 2005 to suggest that the defeat on penalties in the 2005 final , after leading liverpool 3-0 at half-time , will not feature as a motivational tool or pre-match topic in the milan dressing room is preposterous . it was not only a sporting defeat , but a spiritual loss akin to the grief that follows the death of a relative .
the six-time winners had their hands on the cup and a ragged , surprise package team of opponents on the ropes . as far as milan were concerned , they weren ’ t even playing the best side in england , let alone a team equal to themselves in europe .
and yet , they lost .
a latin proverb states that " revenge is a confession of pain . "
you can only imagine the pain milan felt at the end .
to even consider that the night of may 25 , 2005 will not be on the minds of at least some of the milanese is ludicrous .
all of which suits liverpool just fine .
while the impression one gets of milan is one of a team pacing the floor in barely contained anticipation , checking their diamond-encrusted watches and chewing furiously on gum which has long lost its taste , the liverpool camp seems almost trappist in comparison.h how not to behave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool 's gabriel paletta , right , and javier mascherano while plotting the reds ’ downfall by watching dvds of their games and sending scouts to merseyside , carlo ancelotti should have added a compilation of jose mourinho sound bites to his preparatory files .
he would then know that hot air disperses very quickly in the skies over anfield .
the chelsea coach is a textbook example of how not to behave before facing liverpool in a crunch match .
put-downs and barbs just rebound off the armor liverpool coach rafa benitez keeps his charges encased in .
insults thrown in their direction come back infuriatingly unanswered - and warmed-up plates of two-year old revenge just end up in your lap .
benitez is a master tactician and a statistical obsessive to the point of compulsion .
nothing is allowed to interfere with how he wants his team to work and think .
talk of revenge and playground insults over style do not feature in his game plan and he will not allow any of the polemic coming from italy to distract his players .
if the memory of istanbul is invoked in any way , it will be used to remind his players that going a goal – or even three - down does not necessarily mean the game is over .
liverpool came to the 2005 final blinking in the lights of an event none of them as players had ever experienced before .
by the time many of them even realized what was going on , it was half over and they had a mountain to climb . but the fact that they climbed that mountain and stuck a red flag of victory in the summit , in addition to the two seasons of improvement under benitez which followed , means that this liverpool team is a very different proposition to the one which made a mockery of the odds .
new stars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool coach rafael benitez benitez has new stars at his disposal after culling the squad of those players that did not fit his style or reach his high standards .
strikers peter crouch , dirk kuyt and craig bellamy all offer many different options in attack ; winger jermaine pennant provides added width , pace and improved delivery from the flanks , midfielder javier mascherano adds bite and cover to allow steven gerrard and xabi alonso the license to create .
the defense that was torn apart in istanbul is now marshalled by a more mature and flawless jamie carragher with his new protégé , the hugely driven and accomplished danny agger , by his side .
each new addition has been brought in to fill a specific role and to play a certain way in the coach ’ s vision of how liverpool should operate ; a specialist cog for every part of the machine .
so if milan take to the field on wednesday night burning with the desire to exact revenge , then the victory for liverpool will be half won .
a cool mind is needed and rafael benitez will have kept each of his players in refrigeration before the game .
against a combustible side wanting blood , liverpool can think and play their way into a position of dominance and then let the game plan and undoubted talent of this 2007 model finish the job .
because , as another well-known quote suggests , revenge proves its own executioner . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ac milan win champions league final manchester lose 3:0 to ac milan ; chelsea lose out on penalties -lrb- 02.05.2007 -rrb- chelsea wins narrowly in champions league semifinal joe cole scored the only goal of the game as chelsea emerged from the first leg of their champions league semi-final with a 1-0 advantage over liverpool to take to anfield .

but germany wants to bring the two sides together at next week 's g8 foreign ministers ' meeting . there can be no long-term resolution of the conflict in afghanistan without pakistan 's cooperation , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in islamabad on wednesday . " without a regional approach , we will not succeed in bringing lasting peace to the region , " steinmeier said after talks with pakistan 's foreign minister khurshid kasuri .
steinmeier had previously met with afghanistan 's president hamid karzai in kabul on tuesday . steinmeier 's visit came amid international efforts to calm tensions between the two neighboring countries .
as well as addressing bilateral relations , his visit to the region was part of a german initiative within the g8 to help mend bridges between the governments .
both are key allies in the war against terrorism . germany 's efforts recognized in the region kasuri and his afghan counterpart rangeen dadfar-spanta are due to attend a g8 foreign ministers ' meeting in the german city of potsdam next week .

the government in kabul also acknowledged the importance of the upcoming contacts in germany . " this meeting is extremely important for afghanistan and pakistan , " dadfar-spanta said tuesday evening after talks with steinmeier .
" without cooperation with pakistan , we will have no long-term peace and stability . " afghanistan 's solutions must be internal at the same time , the german minister also said final solutions to afghanistan 's problems must come from within . " internal reconciliation is not something you can command people to organize and carry out , it has to come internally , it must be a genuine afghan process , " steinmeier said . but he gave an assurance that the international community would maintain its efforts to ensure security and help the country back onto its feet . " reconstruction has to go on ; this is something we owe to the afghan people , " he said .

now , with revenge within their grasp , dw-world.de ’ s nick amies hopes the fires of retribution consume the italians . revenge .
it ’ s a dish best served cold , according to certain sicilian families in the " waste disposal " business .
it also seems to be the whispered word on the lips of the milanese as the champions league final gets ever nearer . two years appears to be long enough for the flames of vengeance to have cooled sufficiently for the fans and players of ac milan .
now , with the chance to avenge the 2005 defeat to liverpool just hours away , the rossoneri are blowing new life on those smoldering embers of retribution while claiming to be doing nothing of the sort .
despite the protestations of the more cerebral members of carlo ancelotti ’ s team of world cup winners and superstars , a burning desire for justice is surely flickering in the minds of those who suffered such ignominious defeat in istanbul ’ s ataturk stadium .
for every kaka who says that the past means nothing , there is a rino gattuso snarling at the end of his master ’ s leash , waiting to chomp the legs of those who wounded his pride and crushed his dream .

a latin proverb states that " revenge is a confession of pain . "
you can only imagine the pain milan felt at the end .
to even consider that the night of may 25 , 2005 will not be on the minds of at least some of the milanese is ludicrous .
all of which suits liverpool just fine .

the chelsea coach is a textbook example of how not to behave before facing liverpool in a crunch match .
put-downs and barbs just rebound off the armor liverpool coach rafa benitez keeps his charges encased in .
insults thrown in their direction come back infuriatingly unanswered - and warmed-up plates of two-year old revenge just end up in your lap .
benitez is a master tactician and a statistical obsessive to the point of compulsion .
nothing is allowed to interfere with how he wants his team to work and think .
talk of revenge and playground insults over style do not feature in his game plan and he will not allow any of the polemic coming from italy to distract his players .
if the memory of istanbul is invoked in any way , it will be used to remind his players that going a goal – or even three - down does not necessarily mean the game is over .
liverpool came to the 2005 final blinking in the lights of an event none of them as players had ever experienced before .
by the time many of them even realized what was going on , it was half over and they had a mountain to climb . but the fact that they climbed that mountain and stuck a red flag of victory in the summit , in addition to the two seasons of improvement under benitez which followed , means that this liverpool team is a very different proposition to the one which made a mockery of the odds .

strikers peter crouch , dirk kuyt and craig bellamy all offer many different options in attack ; winger jermaine pennant provides added width , pace and improved delivery from the flanks , midfielder javier mascherano adds bite and cover to allow steven gerrard and xabi alonso the license to create .
the defense that was torn apart in istanbul is now marshalled by a more mature and flawless jamie carragher with his new protégé , the hugely driven and accomplished danny agger , by his side .
each new addition has been brought in to fill a specific role and to play a certain way in the coach ’ s vision of how liverpool should operate ; a specialist cog for every part of the machine .
so if milan take to the field on wednesday night burning with the desire to exact revenge , then the victory for liverpool will be half won .
a cool mind is needed and rafael benitez will have kept each of his players in refrigeration before the game .

but it 's just starting for promoted rostock and duisburg .
the difference between success and failure for these small clubs was consistency . thanks to their poor goal difference , mainz had hardly a chance of staying up when they went into their final match against bayern munich - which they promptly lost 5-2 .
the game was mainz 's whole season in miniature .
they dug themselves an early hole , fought back and came up short . mainz , usually offensively minded , failed to react quickly enough to the departure of key forwards before the start of the season .
unable to score goals , they were dead last in december - with only 11 points . bringing in striker mohamed zidan , who scored 13 times for the club , restored mainz to playing respectably .
but the deficit they carried with them from 2006 was too great and this popular underdog 's first run in the bundesliga came to an end after three seasons . another tale of two seasons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen , in yellow , could n't elevate their game mainz 's rhineland neighbors aachen punched above their weight for the first half - thanks to young players like striker jan schlaudraff and defender sascha dum . but problems lurked .
dum was out on loan from leverkusen , and during the winter , aachen sold the rights to schlaudraff to bayern next season .
and players who have no future at a club usually are n't the ones you want in a dogfight . accused of not giving it their all , schlaudraff and dum were kicked off the squad in the middle of the relegation battle .
aachen slumped and headed down after only one season in the first division . mönchengladbach had already been relegated a few weeks previously . experience crucial for promoted clubs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock celebrated a deserved return to the bundesliga karlsruhe had already wrapped up the second-division title , but there was plenty of excitement on the last day of play , as rostock and duisburg got clutch wins to edge out freiburg for promotion . rostock , led by veteran midfielder stefan beinlich , needed every bit of their ten years experience in the first division to hang on to a top-three spot . despite a mediocre attack , the team conceded only 30 goals and will now become the second eastern german club , together with cottbus , in the top flight .
but they 'll need to get more potent to survive . pair of lethal zebras bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these blue-and-white zebras get another crack at the top flight duisburg bounced back to the bundesliga after only one season in the second division thanks to two seasoned strikers : mohamadou idrissou and youssef mokhtari . drawing on previous experience for first-division sides hanover and cottbus , idrissou and mokhtari combined for twenty goals in the division 's second-best offense .
this was key as the zebras only beat out freiburg for third place because of their better goal difference but duisburg 's last trip to the top flight only lasted one year , and it 's questionable whether they can bolster the squad enough to be competitive . and if all the newly promoted clubs want to stay up , they need to remember that the season is 34 games long - and that for small teams slumps are often fatal . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rough ride to the bundesliga title for champions stuttgart although vfb stuttgart were crowned bundesliga champions on saturday , it was not a smooth ride for armin veh 's men whose early-season form showed little title-winning potential .

french and dutch voters rejected a proposed eu constitution two years ago , plunging the eu into constitutional crisis .

prodi threatened that rome would not sign any unconvincing compromise accords .
" europe can not achieve ambitious results without ambitious reforms , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday .
" in the last two years euroskeptic views have been listened to almost exclusively , " said prodi .
" it is time to listen to those who ratified the 2004 treaty . "
warning to euroskeptics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' no ' from french and dutch voters in 2005 derailed the planned constitution the italian prime minister 's remarks were not specifically addressed to any state , but france , britain , the netherlands , poland and the czech republic have all expressed reservations about the constitution and want its scope to be curtailed .
french and dutch voters rejected a proposed eu constitution two years ago , plunging the eu into constitutional crisis .
most of the 18 countries that did ratify the original constitution have called for its main planks , such as the institution of a european affairs foreign minister , to be retained , and they want a non-rotating eu presidency and the extension of the qualified majority voting system .
on tuesday , meanwhile , denmark welcomed germany 's attempts to ensure that " concrete decisions " are made at the eu summit on june 21-22 . preserve core elements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says the treaty 's core elements should be retained danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen expressed support for the idea of a shorter treaty that would preserve the " core elements " of the original constitution .
" one solution could be a shorter treaty amending the existing treaties , " rasmussen said .
he said he was hoping for a rapid solution , which could see a new text approved by the end of the year .
like prodi , rasmussen opposed calling into question the voting system agreed in 2004 , which he called more transparent and balanced .
he was speaking after talks with the german chancellor in berlin on tuesday .
newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy has proposed a " mini-treaty " that omits controversial elements of the original draft , instead of a fully fledged constitution .
the french leader visited brussels on wednesday .
mini-treaty proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's idea of a mini-treaty is causing waves british prime minister tony blair has said he supports sarkozy 's plan for a simplified version .
the german press has reported that merkel responded coldly to the idea of a mini-treaty when she met with sarkozy in berlin last week just hours after he took office .
but merkel on tuesday said she was " very satisfied " with their meeting .
the german chancellor has said she wants to preserve as much as possible of the original text .

russian president vladimir putin begins a two day visit to vienna , austria .
but what was supposed to be a state visit based on trade and energy issues may be hijacked by human rights topics . russian president vladimir putin said wednesday that new eu members need to " get over past phobias " that are poisoning relations between russia and the union .
" we do not have particular problems with the eu .
we have had certain difficulties with our nearby neighbors , " putin told a press conference during an official visit to vienna .
" the soviet union is in part to blame but our european partners must get over past phobias , " he added .
" with the eu enlargement these problems now belong to the european union .
this does not contribute to rapid evolution of relations " with moscow , putin insisted .
a russian embargo on polish meat imports is at the heart of a deepening political crisis between moscow and brussels that has blocked talks on a new eu-russia accord since late last year .
relations have also been strained by a dispute over energy exports to lithuania and a bitter controversy over the removal of a soviet war monument in estonia .
putin 's trip closely follows a tense summit last week in which relations between the eu and russia dipped to a new low over issues such as human rights , and a trade dispute with poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin planned to talk business with his austrian hosts calls from activists amnesty international , the international helsinki federation and reporters without borders are staging protests .
rubina möhring , the president of reporters without borders in austria , called for politicians to link human rights and media freedoms to business deals .
" i would like them to say to mr. putin to act in the way that human rights and press freedom are respected in russia , and that this behavior could influence the discussion about the economic treaties as well , " möhring said .
the austrian president said he plans to raise issues of democracy and human rights with putin , but said this will be done behind closed doors and bilateral relations and business deals will dominate the visit .
pipeline control at issue like much of europe , austria is a big consumer of russian energy .
it is also a partner in the proposed nabucco pipeline , which will bring gas from the caspian sea to central europe - bypassing russia .
the trip gives moscow the chance to put its case as a reliable supplier and to do deals on energy cooperation .
edward christie , a vienna-based energy specialist and economist , said there is competition for control of the pipelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian president heinz fischer will dine with putin " a certain number of european countries would much rather channel some of these central asian resources directly to european markets and not have them transit through russia , " christie said .
" for russia , on the other hand , it is obviously extremely beneficial to have those resources transit their territory .

but while many outsiders see germany as a country suffering from a severe lack of inhibition , or at least having a different moral outlook than buttoned-up britains or puritanical americans , there really are rules that govern when and where it is appropriate to let it all hang out .
subtle difficulties of cultural communication saunas ?
lakes ?
certain parks ?
go ahead , give yourself some air .
walking through a good-sized city on a tuesday afternoon ?
better cover up .
but those subtle distinctions were lost on an american tourist , apparently improperly schooled when it comes to a german society with a tendency to let it all hang out , at least in some contexts .
earlier this week , when temperatures topped 30 degrees celsius -lrb- 86 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , the sightseer stripped down and stuffed his clothes into a bag , which he carried with him as he strolled the streets of nuremberg , a conservative town in bavaria .
he apparently thought it was the appropriate thing to do .
costly cool-down but city streets in germany lack signs for freie körper kultur -lrb- " free body culture , " or " nudist area " -rrb- , the usual signal that it is ok to walk around in your birthday suit .
they are not , in fact , not clothing-optional zones .
shocked locals contacted the police , who apprehended the surprised tourist .
police said the man was n't drunk and had n't been taking drugs , but " he believed it was commonplace to be nude in public in germany . "
" we have been having unusually hot weather here lately but , all the same , we ca n't have this , " a spokesman for police told news services .
the police made him get dressed and pay a 200 euro -lrb- $ 269 -rrb- deposit pending an investigation into his behavior . dw staff -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police release nude shopper police detained a cologne woman shopping naked early one morning this week but let her go after admonishing her .

" without a regional approach , we will not succeed in bringing lasting peace to the region , " steinmeier said after talks with pakistan 's foreign minister khurshid kasuri .
steinmeier had previously met with afghanistan 's president hamid karzai in kabul on tuesday . steinmeier 's visit came amid international efforts to calm tensions between the two neighboring countries .
as well as addressing bilateral relations , his visit to the region was part of a german initiative within the g8 to help mend bridges between the governments .
both are key allies in the war against terrorism . germany 's efforts recognized in the region kasuri and his afghan counterpart rangeen dadfar-spanta are due to attend a g8 foreign ministers ' meeting in the german city of potsdam next week .
steinmeier said this was hoped to significantly improve dialogue between the sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier also met with pakistan 's prime minister shaukat aziz the countries are experiencing their worst relations since the taliban were ousted from power in afghanistan in 2001 . capping months of diplomatic disputes and insults , troops this month clashed at the border .

steinmeier said border security was a focus of his talks during his visit to the region . kasuri said he was " looking forward " to attending the potsdam meeting .
the government in kabul also acknowledged the importance of the upcoming contacts in germany . " this meeting is extremely important for afghanistan and pakistan , " dadfar-spanta said tuesday evening after talks with steinmeier .
" without cooperation with pakistan , we will have no long-term peace and stability . " afghanistan 's solutions must be internal at the same time , the german minister also said final solutions to afghanistan 's problems must come from within . " internal reconciliation is not something you can command people to organize and carry out , it has to come internally , it must be a genuine afghan process , " steinmeier said . but he gave an assurance that the international community would maintain its efforts to ensure security and help the country back onto its feet . " reconstruction has to go on ; this is something we owe to the afghan people , " he said .
" they deserve it . " a scheduled meeting with president pervez musharraf was cancelled owing to pressing internal affairs , pakistani officials said .

prodi threatened that rome would not sign any unconvincing compromise accords .
" europe can not achieve ambitious results without ambitious reforms , " he told the european parliament in strasbourg on tuesday .
" in the last two years euroskeptic views have been listened to almost exclusively , " said prodi .
" it is time to listen to those who ratified the 2004 treaty . "
warning to euroskeptics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ' no ' from french and dutch voters in 2005 derailed the planned constitution the italian prime minister 's remarks were not specifically addressed to any state , but france , britain , the netherlands , poland and the czech republic have all expressed reservations about the constitution and want its scope to be curtailed .
french and dutch voters rejected a proposed eu constitution two years ago , plunging the eu into constitutional crisis .
most of the 18 countries that did ratify the original constitution have called for its main planks , such as the institution of a european affairs foreign minister , to be retained , and they want a non-rotating eu presidency and the extension of the qualified majority voting system .
on tuesday , meanwhile , denmark welcomed germany 's attempts to ensure that " concrete decisions " are made at the eu summit on june 21-22 . preserve core elements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen says the treaty 's core elements should be retained danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen expressed support for the idea of a shorter treaty that would preserve the " core elements " of the original constitution .
" one solution could be a shorter treaty amending the existing treaties , " rasmussen said .
he said he was hoping for a rapid solution , which could see a new text approved by the end of the year .
like prodi , rasmussen opposed calling into question the voting system agreed in 2004 , which he called more transparent and balanced .
he was speaking after talks with the german chancellor in berlin on tuesday .
newly elected french president nicolas sarkozy has proposed a " mini-treaty " that omits controversial elements of the original draft , instead of a fully fledged constitution .
the french leader visited brussels on wednesday .
mini-treaty proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's idea of a mini-treaty is causing waves british prime minister tony blair has said he supports sarkozy 's plan for a simplified version .
the german press has reported that merkel responded coldly to the idea of a mini-treaty when she met with sarkozy in berlin last week just hours after he took office .
but merkel on tuesday said she was " very satisfied " with their meeting .
the german chancellor has said she wants to preserve as much as possible of the original text .
germany holds the eu presidency until the end of june , and merkel is trying to get member nations to commit to a " road map " that will lead them to ratify a new treaty before the european parliament elections in 2009 . dw-staff -lrb- jg -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany quizzes eu members on constitution germany , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has sent the 27 eu member states a questionnaire on what to do about the bloc 's stalled constitutional treaty to kick-start an intensive series of talks .

" it 's unsavory that our intelligence officials are using methods that were also used by the stasi , " the deputy parliamentary leader of the opposition greens , hans-christian ströbele , told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper . the feared secret police of former communist east germany -lrb- gdr -rrb- notoriously tried to capture and store the body scents of political dissidents so that sniffer dogs could trace them . wolfgang thierse , the deputy speaker of the bundestag lower house of parliament , accused the authorities of going overboard and warned them to refrain from a " hysteria that could lead to a police state similar to the gdr . " activists raided federal prosecutors confirmed on tuesday that police took scent samples earlier in the month when they raided sites in northern germany linked to suspected anti-globalization activists .
but they denied that they wanted to use the samples to sniff out g8 protestors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police say taking a scent sample is no different to taking a fingerprint a spokesman said samples were taken from five or six suspects in order to compare these with physical evidence found at the scene of past arson attacks . according to police , taking scent samples is as legal as taking fingerprints , and talks of the stasi were exaggerated . " ' stasi methods ' clearly refers to … techniques such as denunciation , blackmail and torture , but not to what is a valid legal police practice , " said konrad freiberg , the chairman of the federal police union , in a statement on wednesday . police should be able to use all methods " to preferably avert violence acts before they happen , " he said . strange idea however , wolfgang bosbach , the deputy chairman of the christian democratic parliamentary faction , said he found the whole practice of smell tracking " rather strange . " " you have a protester , the dog has a sniff and then he wags three times with his tail or barks - what 's supposed to happen then ? "
bosbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 protesters wo n't be able to come within 200m of the security fence at heiligendamm left-wing groups have warned the police that the recent raids angered their supporters and would only heighten their resolve to demonstrate at the g8 summit being held in the northern coastal town of heiligendamm from june 6 - 8 . protesters are also upset over a ban on protests at the g8 venue and the nearby airport , and are taking legal action to attempt to overturn it . it is believed that left-wing groups could be behind the torching on tuesday of the car belonging to the editor of bild , germany 's biggest-selling newspaper , and those of two businessmen last week . german authorities are expecting up to 100,000 activists to target the g8 summit being hosted by german chancellor angela merkel .

russian president vladimir putin begins a two day visit to vienna , austria .
but what was supposed to be a state visit based on trade and energy issues may be hijacked by human rights topics . russian president vladimir putin said wednesday that new eu members need to " get over past phobias " that are poisoning relations between russia and the union .
" we do not have particular problems with the eu .
we have had certain difficulties with our nearby neighbors , " putin told a press conference during an official visit to vienna .
" the soviet union is in part to blame but our european partners must get over past phobias , " he added .
" with the eu enlargement these problems now belong to the european union .
this does not contribute to rapid evolution of relations " with moscow , putin insisted .
a russian embargo on polish meat imports is at the heart of a deepening political crisis between moscow and brussels that has blocked talks on a new eu-russia accord since late last year .
relations have also been strained by a dispute over energy exports to lithuania and a bitter controversy over the removal of a soviet war monument in estonia .
putin 's trip closely follows a tense summit last week in which relations between the eu and russia dipped to a new low over issues such as human rights , and a trade dispute with poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin planned to talk business with his austrian hosts calls from activists amnesty international , the international helsinki federation and reporters without borders are staging protests .
rubina möhring , the president of reporters without borders in austria , called for politicians to link human rights and media freedoms to business deals .
" i would like them to say to mr. putin to act in the way that human rights and press freedom are respected in russia , and that this behavior could influence the discussion about the economic treaties as well , " möhring said .
the austrian president said he plans to raise issues of democracy and human rights with putin , but said this will be done behind closed doors and bilateral relations and business deals will dominate the visit .
pipeline control at issue like much of europe , austria is a big consumer of russian energy .
it is also a partner in the proposed nabucco pipeline , which will bring gas from the caspian sea to central europe - bypassing russia .
the trip gives moscow the chance to put its case as a reliable supplier and to do deals on energy cooperation .
edward christie , a vienna-based energy specialist and economist , said there is competition for control of the pipelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian president heinz fischer will dine with putin " a certain number of european countries would much rather channel some of these central asian resources directly to european markets and not have them transit through russia , " christie said .

the taliban claimed responsibility . critical injuries the german survivors were flown home monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 23.05.2007 rostock , duisburg go up ; mainz and aachen drop down großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz will battle gladbach in the second division next year the party 's over for mainz and aachen , both relegated to the second division .
but it 's just starting for promoted rostock and duisburg .
the difference between success and failure for these small clubs was consistency . thanks to their poor goal difference , mainz had hardly a chance of staying up when they went into their final match against bayern munich - which they promptly lost 5-2 .
the game was mainz 's whole season in miniature .
they dug themselves an early hole , fought back and came up short . mainz , usually offensively minded , failed to react quickly enough to the departure of key forwards before the start of the season .
unable to score goals , they were dead last in december - with only 11 points . bringing in striker mohamed zidan , who scored 13 times for the club , restored mainz to playing respectably .
but the deficit they carried with them from 2006 was too great and this popular underdog 's first run in the bundesliga came to an end after three seasons . another tale of two seasons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aachen , in yellow , could n't elevate their game mainz 's rhineland neighbors aachen punched above their weight for the first half - thanks to young players like striker jan schlaudraff and defender sascha dum . but problems lurked .
dum was out on loan from leverkusen , and during the winter , aachen sold the rights to schlaudraff to bayern next season .
and players who have no future at a club usually are n't the ones you want in a dogfight . accused of not giving it their all , schlaudraff and dum were kicked off the squad in the middle of the relegation battle .
aachen slumped and headed down after only one season in the first division . mönchengladbach had already been relegated a few weeks previously . experience crucial for promoted clubs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock celebrated a deserved return to the bundesliga karlsruhe had already wrapped up the second-division title , but there was plenty of excitement on the last day of play , as rostock and duisburg got clutch wins to edge out freiburg for promotion . rostock , led by veteran midfielder stefan beinlich , needed every bit of their ten years experience in the first division to hang on to a top-three spot . despite a mediocre attack , the team conceded only 30 goals and will now become the second eastern german club , together with cottbus , in the top flight .
but they 'll need to get more potent to survive . pair of lethal zebras bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these blue-and-white zebras get another crack at the top flight duisburg bounced back to the bundesliga after only one season in the second division thanks to two seasoned strikers : mohamadou idrissou and youssef mokhtari . drawing on previous experience for first-division sides hanover and cottbus , idrissou and mokhtari combined for twenty goals in the division 's second-best offense .
this was key as the zebras only beat out freiburg for third place because of their better goal difference but duisburg 's last trip to the top flight only lasted one year , and it 's questionable whether they can bolster the squad enough to be competitive . and if all the newly promoted clubs want to stay up , they need to remember that the season is 34 games long - and that for small teams slumps are often fatal . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rough ride to the bundesliga title for champions stuttgart although vfb stuttgart were crowned bundesliga champions on saturday , it was not a smooth ride for armin veh 's men whose early-season form showed little title-winning potential .

but germany wants to bring the two sides together at next week 's g8 foreign ministers ' meeting . there can be no long-term resolution of the conflict in afghanistan without pakistan 's cooperation , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in islamabad on wednesday . " without a regional approach , we will not succeed in bringing lasting peace to the region , " steinmeier said after talks with pakistan 's foreign minister khurshid kasuri .
steinmeier had previously met with afghanistan 's president hamid karzai in kabul on tuesday . steinmeier 's visit came amid international efforts to calm tensions between the two neighboring countries .
as well as addressing bilateral relations , his visit to the region was part of a german initiative within the g8 to help mend bridges between the governments .
both are key allies in the war against terrorism . germany 's efforts recognized in the region kasuri and his afghan counterpart rangeen dadfar-spanta are due to attend a g8 foreign ministers ' meeting in the german city of potsdam next week .
steinmeier said this was hoped to significantly improve dialogue between the sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier also met with pakistan 's prime minister shaukat aziz the countries are experiencing their worst relations since the taliban were ousted from power in afghanistan in 2001 . capping months of diplomatic disputes and insults , troops this month clashed at the border .
both sides accuse each other of failing to curb militant incursions into afghanistan from pakistan 's tribal areas .
steinmeier said border security was a focus of his talks during his visit to the region . kasuri said he was " looking forward " to attending the potsdam meeting .
the government in kabul also acknowledged the importance of the upcoming contacts in germany . " this meeting is extremely important for afghanistan and pakistan , " dadfar-spanta said tuesday evening after talks with steinmeier .
" without cooperation with pakistan , we will have no long-term peace and stability . " afghanistan 's solutions must be internal at the same time , the german minister also said final solutions to afghanistan 's problems must come from within . " internal reconciliation is not something you can command people to organize and carry out , it has to come internally , it must be a genuine afghan process , " steinmeier said . but he gave an assurance that the international community would maintain its efforts to ensure security and help the country back onto its feet . " reconstruction has to go on ; this is something we owe to the afghan people , " he said .
" they deserve it . " a scheduled meeting with president pervez musharraf was cancelled owing to pressing internal affairs , pakistani officials said .

russian president vladimir putin begins a two day visit to vienna , austria .
but what was supposed to be a state visit based on trade and energy issues may be hijacked by human rights topics . russian president vladimir putin said wednesday that new eu members need to " get over past phobias " that are poisoning relations between russia and the union .
" we do not have particular problems with the eu .
we have had certain difficulties with our nearby neighbors , " putin told a press conference during an official visit to vienna .
" the soviet union is in part to blame but our european partners must get over past phobias , " he added .
" with the eu enlargement these problems now belong to the european union .
this does not contribute to rapid evolution of relations " with moscow , putin insisted .
a russian embargo on polish meat imports is at the heart of a deepening political crisis between moscow and brussels that has blocked talks on a new eu-russia accord since late last year .
relations have also been strained by a dispute over energy exports to lithuania and a bitter controversy over the removal of a soviet war monument in estonia .
putin 's trip closely follows a tense summit last week in which relations between the eu and russia dipped to a new low over issues such as human rights , and a trade dispute with poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin planned to talk business with his austrian hosts calls from activists amnesty international , the international helsinki federation and reporters without borders are staging protests .
rubina möhring , the president of reporters without borders in austria , called for politicians to link human rights and media freedoms to business deals .
" i would like them to say to mr. putin to act in the way that human rights and press freedom are respected in russia , and that this behavior could influence the discussion about the economic treaties as well , " möhring said .
the austrian president said he plans to raise issues of democracy and human rights with putin , but said this will be done behind closed doors and bilateral relations and business deals will dominate the visit .
pipeline control at issue like much of europe , austria is a big consumer of russian energy .
it is also a partner in the proposed nabucco pipeline , which will bring gas from the caspian sea to central europe - bypassing russia .
the trip gives moscow the chance to put its case as a reliable supplier and to do deals on energy cooperation .
edward christie , a vienna-based energy specialist and economist , said there is competition for control of the pipelines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian president heinz fischer will dine with putin " a certain number of european countries would much rather channel some of these central asian resources directly to european markets and not have them transit through russia , " christie said .

three of the pictures are by performance artist vladislav mamychev-monroe .
in the photoworks , he portrays himself as a hysterical adolf hitler , a plastic-bearded osama bin laden and a cat-loving pope benedict .
another work by aidan salakhova portrays a burkha-clad muslim clasping a miniature minaret with distinctly phallic connotations .
two of the other pictures by the blue noses group and by konstantin latyshev make satirical reference to the russian president .
the blue noses pose as vladimir putin , russian cultural idol alexander pushkin and christ .
latyshev 's work is a poster that merges the features of the president and pushkin .
ersatz images bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by vladislav mamyshev-monroe , from the series » starz « : osama bin laden , adolf hitler , pope , 2005 the dresden museum has responded to the events by displaying small-scaled reproductions on paper of the works in the spaces where the originals were meant to hang .
johannes schmidt , curator of the exhibition called " learning from moscow , " said he had been informed by the company involved in the transportation of the pictures that customs officers had refused to issue export licences for the art works .
the transport company had been informed that they were not being released for fear of causing international protest .
" i am not really surprised .
this exhibition is directly concerned with art that concerns itself with contemporary global themes and with political realities in today 's russia , " schmidt said .
" the climate in russia is getting tougher as the elections approach and relations have also become frostier with germany recently . "
harmless jokes he said the pictures , while clearly a little irreverent in character , were " harmless jokes . "
other works by the artists involved have gone on show in dresden .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a putin / pushkin mutation by konstantin latyshev the curator does not believe the export stop was an order that came from above , but came from people at lower levels being overenthusiastic in their desire to please political higher-ups .
" i am not someone who pleads for total freedom for art because that would mean allowing far-right images and child pornography .
but apart from that artists should have as much freedom as possible , " he said .
" the artists have taken a long time to gain international attention .
collectors are just becoming interested in them .
this is putting a brake on this .
that has a certain tragic quality , " he added .
recently , a british gallery owner was prevented from taking another picture by the blue noses out of the country .
it showed the trio of artists donning masks depicting photos of putin , bush and bin laden .
when he legally challenged the move , the work was released .
schmidt said that the museum had decided not to officially protest against the action because budgetary constraints meant that they would not be able to pay for a second transport . julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : peter sodann peter sodann is an actor is best known in germany for playing commissioner bruno ehrlicher in the german drama " crime scene " .

some wardens in the area will start to wear head-mounted miniature cameras from later this month .
ncp , which supplies traffic wardens in the city , will use the film to resolve disputes over tickets and to prosecute motorists who assault or abuse staff .
the technology will also help wardens in their new role of issuing fixed penalties for anti-social behaviour .
new legislation enables the attendants to hand out tickets for activities including littering , flyposting , graffiti and allowing dogs to foul the pavement .
ncp says the cameras - already used by police and community support officers - are needed as evidence to prove beyond doubt that the penalties its wardens hand out are justified .
wardens across the country have for several years captured parking violations on digital still cameras .

ms wilson urged the government and the executive to provide more support for parents to get back to work " by introducing the new deal for families and the full job centre plus programme " .
" they could provide further support for families with a disabled child or parent through reviewing current levels of respite care and review the levels of supported training and employment of disabled young people , " she said .

' cutting cloth ' australia has suffered its worst drought in more than a century and awb said it would be reviewing the structure of its domestic trading operation . "
we will continue to cut our cloth " gordon davis , awb chief executive drought takes toll on farmers " we will continue to cut our cloth to accommodate swings in seasonal conditions , " said chief executive gordon davis .
" our objective is to maintain a lower cost base and grow the company . "
mr davis said the winter crop could be strong if current rains continued although no firm predictions could be made .
the government revealed on tuesday that it would remove awb 's current monopoly status next year and allow competition into international sales of wheat , one of the country 's most valuable exports .

supporters say the scheme could supply 5 % of the uk 's electricity , but environmentalists fear its impact .
the bbc news website gathered views from both sides of the argument .
arguing against the barrage martin spray , chief executive of the wildfowl and wetlands trust " i can quite understand the view that perhaps this needs to be taken back into consideration .
" but i 'm quite concerned about the severn barrage , there is no doubt it would make quite a considerable impact to a natural , internationally important ecosystem .
" the whole of the severn estuary is home to some 65,000 various species of water birds and wading birds .
it 's a site of scientific interest . "
dr mark avery , conservation director , royal society for the protection of birds " the severn barrage was a bad idea in 2003 and is an even worse proposal now , not least because there are better , less damaging alternatives .
" clean energy technology is developing apace and there will soon be less intrusive ways of harnessing the tides with little environmental cost .
tidal stream systems are being tested in the bristol channel , scotland and northern ireland and could generate far more energy and cause little environmental harm .
" the rspb strongly supports the development of renewables but today 's white paper lacks the drive to develop the best green energy projects quickly enough . "
gordon james , campaigner with friends of the earth cymru " we are opposed to the large severn barrage because it would have a major negative environmental impact .
" any proposal to build a barrage could face strong legal challenges on environmental grounds .
" it would take a long time to build , there would be high costs and it would generate a lot of carbon dioxide as it was being built .
" there are better alternatives available such as a tidal lagoons . "
councillor anthony ernest , representing lavernock and sully " the only objectors i have heard in the media so far are those who either favour renewable energy , or are concerned about a few rabbits and seagulls , who live around the coastline .
" not one of those interviewed has dared talk about human misery , loss of property and the wiping out of huge areas of rural countryside , which currently protect the total integration of towns and the city itself , around cardiff . "
arguing for the barrage stephen williams , bristol west mp , sponsored an early day motion calling on the government to look again at the barrage proposal " i grew up in south wales and i remember the barrage being discussed .
the idea has been around for a long time .
" it has got great potential for creating clean energy .
it is now extremely pressing and i think we should leave no stone unturned .
" the price of doing nothing about changing our energy mix , how we generate our energy and not reducing our carbon footprint means several years down the track the habitat of the severn could be affected anyway .
we 've got to do something .
" the last time this was looked at in detail was 1989 .
we want a serious study into its potential and to say whether this could be best realised by a barrage or lagoon . "
paul flynn , mp for newport west , also signed the early day motion " tidal power is british , will carry on virtually forever , is a free source of energy and is carbon neutral .
" it has been vastly undersold , little understood and would provide us with huge quantities of electricity and is a far better prospect than nuclear power .
" it is environmentally benign and something we can take complete control of .
" the cheapest power produced in the world is in la rance -lrb- a tidal barrage -rrb- in brittany and it has been operating more than 30 years . "
jonny boston of the south west rural development agency " it 's probably more likely than it 's been for perhaps 20 years - with the threat of climate change on us , we need to look at new ways of tackling that and generating our energy .
" this is now being looked at but if it did go ahead , it would still be nearly 2020 probably before any power was generated - and what we 're doing at the rda is pioneering some projects in the region to try to bring other renewable technologies to fruition which can also help tackle climate change .

" clean energy technology is developing apace and there will soon be less intrusive ways of harnessing the tides with little environmental cost .
tidal stream systems are being tested in the bristol channel , scotland and northern ireland and could generate far more energy and cause little environmental harm .
" the rspb strongly supports the development of renewables but today 's white paper lacks the drive to develop the best green energy projects quickly enough . "
gordon james , campaigner with friends of the earth cymru " we are opposed to the large severn barrage because it would have a major negative environmental impact .
" any proposal to build a barrage could face strong legal challenges on environmental grounds .
" it would take a long time to build , there would be high costs and it would generate a lot of carbon dioxide as it was being built .
" there are better alternatives available such as a tidal lagoons . "
councillor anthony ernest , representing lavernock and sully " the only objectors i have heard in the media so far are those who either favour renewable energy , or are concerned about a few rabbits and seagulls , who live around the coastline .
" not one of those interviewed has dared talk about human misery , loss of property and the wiping out of huge areas of rural countryside , which currently protect the total integration of towns and the city itself , around cardiff . "
arguing for the barrage stephen williams , bristol west mp , sponsored an early day motion calling on the government to look again at the barrage proposal " i grew up in south wales and i remember the barrage being discussed .
the idea has been around for a long time .
" it has got great potential for creating clean energy .
it is now extremely pressing and i think we should leave no stone unturned .
" the price of doing nothing about changing our energy mix , how we generate our energy and not reducing our carbon footprint means several years down the track the habitat of the severn could be affected anyway .
we 've got to do something .
" the last time this was looked at in detail was 1989 .
we want a serious study into its potential and to say whether this could be best realised by a barrage or lagoon . "
paul flynn , mp for newport west , also signed the early day motion " tidal power is british , will carry on virtually forever , is a free source of energy and is carbon neutral .
" it has been vastly undersold , little understood and would provide us with huge quantities of electricity and is a far better prospect than nuclear power .
" it is environmentally benign and something we can take complete control of .
" the cheapest power produced in the world is in la rance -lrb- a tidal barrage -rrb- in brittany and it has been operating more than 30 years . "
jonny boston of the south west rural development agency " it 's probably more likely than it 's been for perhaps 20 years - with the threat of climate change on us , we need to look at new ways of tackling that and generating our energy .
" this is now being looked at but if it did go ahead , it would still be nearly 2020 probably before any power was generated - and what we 're doing at the rda is pioneering some projects in the region to try to bring other renewable technologies to fruition which can also help tackle climate change .

one worker for the charity said children in wales occasionally go without food or heating .
its research found numbers had fallen from 33 % to 28 % in the last five years , but was 2 % lower than the uk average .
the uk government has pledged to eradicate child poverty by 2020 , and last year the assembly government also set out targets to tackle it .
on wednesday barnardo , s said the uk government was not on target to meet its pledge , and called on both governments to " redouble " their efforts .
child poverty is generally assessed by whether the family 's income is less than 60 % of the uk 's average .
sally jenkins , a project manager from barnardo 's said children living in poverty may sometimes go without food .
" there will be times where something happens and there is no-one else to call on and on occasion some of those children and those young people will go hungry , " she said .
despite the fall in the number of children living in poverty , the charity says wales has seen an increase in the proportion of working households living below the poverty line .
it has called for more affordable childcare to help the country 's poorest families , as many parents are faced with low wages and high childcare costs .
barnardo 's cymru director raymond ciborowski , said : " most parents we work with want to work and there should be a focus on work as the best route out of poverty .
" but for many with low skills or qualifications getting a job means moving from workless poverty to working poverty . "
" i do n't think anyone wants to be in this situation , everyone wants the best for their kids " hannah erickson one of the parents supported by the charity is 16-year-old hannah erickson from cardiff , who has an 11-month-old baby called dylan .
after paying all her bills , she is left with around £ 10 a week to cover clothes for herself and her baby , bus fares and other essentials .
during the winter , hannah said she did not have enough money to heat her flat .
" because it was so cold i had to put £ 20 a week in the gas , and it ran out , so i went without gas for three days , " she said .
" it made me feel very , very bad because i could n't provide the gas for him -lrb- dylan -rrb- when he needed it , " she said .
hannah would like to train to become a hair and beauty therapist at college , but says the cost of childcare is one of the things stopping her .
" i do n't think anyone wants to be in this situation , everyone wants the best for their kids , " she said .
" i 'm doing the best i can for him , but not what i would like to do for him , take him places , buy him what he needs , what i would like him to have . "

" there will be times where something happens and there is no-one else to call on and on occasion some of those children and those young people will go hungry , " she said .
despite the fall in the number of children living in poverty , the charity says wales has seen an increase in the proportion of working households living below the poverty line .
it has called for more affordable childcare to help the country 's poorest families , as many parents are faced with low wages and high childcare costs .
barnardo 's cymru director raymond ciborowski , said : " most parents we work with want to work and there should be a focus on work as the best route out of poverty .
" but for many with low skills or qualifications getting a job means moving from workless poverty to working poverty . "
i do n't think anyone wants to be in this situation , everyone wants the best for their kids hannah erickson one of the parents supported by the charity is 16-year-old hannah erickson from cardiff , who has an 11-month-old baby called dylan .
after paying all her bills , she is left with around £ 10 a week to cover clothes for herself and her baby , bus fares and other essentials .
during the winter , hannah said she did not have enough money to heat her flat .
" because it was so cold i had to put £ 20 a week in the gas , and it ran out , so i went without gas for three days , " she said .
" it made me feel very , very bad because i could n't provide the gas for him -lrb- dylan -rrb- when he needed it , " she said .
hannah would like to train to become a hair and beauty therapist at college , but says the cost of childcare is one of the things stopping her .
" i do n't think anyone wants to be in this situation , everyone wants the best for their kids , " she said .
" i 'm doing the best i can for him , but not what i would like to do for him , take him places , buy him what he needs , what i would like him to have . "

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- 30 pieces of trivia about star wars home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment arts & culture also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : wednesday , 23 may 2007 , 07:36 gmt 08:36 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version 30 pieces of trivia about star wars the original star wars film was released on 25 may 1977 .
much to the surprise of many involved in the project , including the studio which backed it , it became a runaway success .
to celebrate the movie 's 30th anniversary here are 30 facts and figures related to the film which influenced a new generation of film-makers .
the making of star wars 1 .
the first trailer for the film hit cinemas six months before it was to open - with tag lines such as " the story of a boy , a girl and a universe " and " a billion years in the making " - as executives hoped to drum up some interest in a film they had little faith in .
george lucas struggled to make people understand his vision 2 .
made on a budget of $ 11m -lrb- £ 5.5m -rrb- it made $ 215m -lrb- £ 108m -rrb- in the us during its original release , and $ 337m -lrb- £ 170m -rrb- overseas .
the final film in the franchise - revenge of the sith - cost about $ 113m -lrb- £ 57m -rrb- to make .
3 .
it was originally called the star wars , but " the " was dropped fairly early on in the creative process .
4 .
the full title star wars : episode iv : a new hope first appeared when the film was re-released in 1981 .
5 .
director george lucas originally had a contract with fox for $ 150,000 -lrb- £ 75,941 -rrb- for writing and directing star wars .
but he cannily insisted on total control and 40 % of merchandising - something the studio agreed to because they had no idea of what a phenomenon star wars would become .
6 .
the famous - and often imitated - opening crawl for star wars was co-written by brian de palma , the director of scarface .
it begins " it is a period of civil war .
rebel spaceships , striking from a hidden base , have won their first victory against the evil galactic empire . " 7 .
sir alec guinness made a ton of money from the film having recognised its potential success and negotiating a deal for two per cent of box office takings .
he also refused to do any promotional work for the film .
8 .
anthony daniels as c-3po and kenny baker , who played r2-d2 , are the only actors credited with being in all six star wars films .
9 .
harrison ford was far from george lucas ' first choice to play han solo as the director had wanted completely new faces for star wars .
ford had already starred in lucas ' american graffiti .
10 .
the original release date was set for christmas 1976 but major delays in filming saw it pushed back .
the fox studio had threatened to close down production when filming over-ran by more than two weeks .
inspiration 11 .
ralph mcquarrie created the paintings which were used to illustrate how the star wars universe could look .
he started out as a technical illustrator for boeing .
the stormtroopers 12 .
the wookiee chewbacca was inspired by george lucas ' beloved dog indiana - an alaskan malamute .
13 .
lucas once said that the shape of the millennium falcon was based on a hamburger .
14 .
george lucas based the character of han solo on his friend francis ford coppola .
15 .
the droids r2-d2 and c-3po are said to be based on the 1958 akira kourosawa film kakushi toride no san akunin -lrb- the hidden fortress -rrb- .
other characters in star wars were also drawn from the film including han solo and ben kenobi .
marketing and merchandising 16 .
cinemas in the us were press-ganged into buying the film after few took up the option , with the threat that they would n't get the other side of midnight - a widely-anticipated adaptation of a sidney sheldon novel .
the other side of midnight , starring susan sarandon , was a box office flop .
17 .
publicity supervisor charles lippincott was aware of the power of the sci-fi fan , going along to conventions to talk about star wars and what audiences could expect .
he was largely credited with bringing in huge opening day audiences .
sir alec guinness became very rich off the back of star wars 18 .
the merchandise for the film was not in place to accommodate the demand for the first christmas rush after the film 's release .
lucas and merchandise company kenner toys hit upon a novel idea with the introduction of early bird certificate boxes .
these were basically empty boxes that promised the receiver they would get the figures once they had been made .
they sold for $ 16 at the time and the actual figures arrived two months later .
limited edition packs were re-released in 2005 .
19 .
more than 250 million small action figures were shipped in the eight years after the first film , going to countries across the world .
in the first year alone 42m were sold .
awards 20 .
composer john williams won an oscar for his score for star wars .
the music was later named by the american film institute as the greatest film score of all time .
21 .
a new hope was the only one of the six films in the franchise to be nominated in the academy awards best picture category .
it lost out to woody allen 's annie hall .
mishaps and miscellaneous 22 .
mark hamill , who played luke skywalker , was involved in a car accident following primary shooting .
his face was damaged making reshoots impossible .
hamill later said he only broke his nose and reports that his face was reconstructed were wide of the mark .
23 .
anthony daniels was injured during his first outing as c-3po when a leg piece fell off his gold-coloured costume and shattered - stabbing him in the foot .
24 .
on the first day of filming in the deserts of tunisia , the country experienced its first major rainstorm in 50 years and a rest day had to be called .
25 .
when filming moved to elstree it was hoped the earlier problems encountered in the desert would be finished .
but a new problem arose in the shape of the strict british working conditions adhered to on set .
lucas says that filming had to close at 5.30pm on the dot , unless he was in the middle of a shot - when he could ask workers to stay for an extra 15 minutes .
darth vader was played by british actor dave prowse 26 .
one of the most famous bloopers from the film is when stormtroopers burst into a room and one of them hits his head on the door frame .
fans of star wars and the blooper have spotted hundreds of " mistakes " throughout the star wars franchise but many can only be spotted by the most eagle-eyed viewer .
27 .
peter mayhew , who played chewbacca , worked as a hospital orderly in london before being cast as the wookiee .
he was said to have got into character by copying the mannerisms of animals he visited at the zoo .
28 .
david prowse , the 6ft 7ins actor who plays darth vader , had problems filming lightsaber scenes as he kept breaking the poles that were used as stand-ins for the weapons .
in the sequels , fight co-ordinator bob anderson stepped into the costume to film the lightsaber scenes .
29 .
george lucas wanted his sets to look worn and scuffed but the studio cleaning service continually cleaned and tidied up after a day 's filming - much to the director 's dismay .
30 .
lucas ' stress levels reached such a height that he thought he was having a heart attack .
he was diagnosed with hypertension and exhaustion and told to rest - something the punishing schedule would not allow .

for the love of god is an 11-minute stop-motion animation competing in the cinefondation section of film students ' shorts .
it is the creation of writer-director joe tucker and writer-producer raphael warner , recent graduates of the uk 's national film and television school .
and it features high-calibre voice talent in sir ian mckellen , steve coogan and julia davis .
" i like to think big and say , ' why do n't we aim for the best ? " ' says warner .
" from the start , i said we wanted mckellen , coogan - our tutors laughed . "
unholy fantasy tucker says : " i am guessing it was a far more unusual offer than they normally get .
" the fact that it was something a bit out of the ordinary , it stood out . "
for the love of god follows graham , a man driven to pursue an unholy sexual fantasy by a life spent working in the christian bookshop of his domineering mother .
the story idea was sparked by tabloid reports of celebrity sex videos , which prompted tucker to imagine the discovery of one involving the almighty .
the film is highly imaginative , meticulously detailed and eccentrically funny .
" we share the same passion for dark comedy centring on strange worlds and strange characters , " says warner about his working relationship with tucker .
' cinematic ' tucker and director of photography liam iandoli spent three months of up to 18-hour days in a darkened room shooting the movie .
" we did n't want to just keep a static camera - it had to be cinematic , " says iandoli .
" it really paid off .
it was worth the extra time we spent on the film . "
he adds : " the way joe has directed this piece , the images say so much .
" from the opening shot you get drawn into this film . "
the festival organisers apparently agreed , and the resultant nomination has given the film-makers ' profiles a considerable boost .
tucker says : " it has been really good for us that we have been able to say we are the only british film in cannes .
" i would hope it has brought us a little bit more attention than we might otherwise have got . "
warner says that while they are hugely excited to be at the festival , there is also pressure to take advantage of a significant career opportunity .
" we have to strike while the coals are white , " he says .
competition hopes a cannes prize win - the result is announced on friday - would be a massive boost for the film and its makers .
tucker adds : " when i first found out we were in the competition , i was completely overwhelmed .
" but like everything , you quickly adjust - being here is absolutely wonderful , but we would like to come away with some kind of prize . "
the trio hope their next project together will be a feature film , and they have animation and live-action scripts at the ready .
" we have got a fantastic relationship as a team , " says warner .
" we work really well on a creative level , the three of us . "
but he adds : " if we were in america , no doubt about it we would be in work on a feature .
" but in the uk it 's a little bit more difficult and it should n't be like that . "

for the love of god is an 11-minute stop-motion animation competing in the cinefondation section of film students ' shorts .
it is the creation of writer-director joe tucker and writer-producer raphael warner , recent graduates of the uk 's national film and television school .
and it features high-calibre voice talent in sir ian mckellen , steve coogan and julia davis .
" i like to think big and say , ' why do n't we aim for the best ? " ' says warner .
" from the start , i said we wanted mckellen , coogan - our tutors laughed . "
unholy fantasy tucker says : " i am guessing it was a far more unusual offer than they normally get .
" the fact that it was something a bit out of the ordinary , it stood out . "
for the love of god follows graham , a man driven to pursue an unholy sexual fantasy by a life spent working in the christian bookshop of his domineering mother .
the only british cannes contenders have attracted uk media interest the story idea was sparked by tabloid reports of celebrity sex videos , which prompted tucker to imagine the discovery of one involving the almighty .
the film is highly imaginative , meticulously detailed and eccentrically funny .
" we share the same passion for dark comedy centring on strange worlds and strange characters , " says warner about his working relationship with tucker .
' cinematic ' tucker and director of photography liam iandoli spent three months of up to 18-hour days in a darkened room shooting the movie .
" we did n't want to just keep a static camera - it had to be cinematic , " says iandoli .
" it really paid off .
it was worth the extra time we spent on the film . "
he adds : " the way joe has directed this piece , the images say so much .
" from the opening shot you get drawn into this film . "
the festival organisers apparently agreed , and the resultant nomination has given the film-makers ' profiles a considerable boost .
tucker has worked on music videos since leaving film school tucker says : " it has been really good for us that we have been able to say we are the only british film in cannes .
" i would hope it has brought us a little bit more attention than we might otherwise have got . "
warner says that while they are hugely excited to be at the festival , there is also pressure to take advantage of a significant career opportunity .
" we have to strike while the coals are white , " he says .
competition hopes a cannes prize win - the result is announced on friday - would be a massive boost for the film and its makers .
tucker adds : " when i first found out we were in the competition , i was completely overwhelmed .
" but like everything , you quickly adjust - being here is absolutely wonderful , but we would like to come away with some kind of prize . "
the trio hope their next project together will be a feature film , and they have animation and live-action scripts at the ready .
" we have got a fantastic relationship as a team , " says warner .
" we work really well on a creative level , the three of us . "
but he adds : " if we were in america , no doubt about it we would be in work on a feature .
" but in the uk it 's a little bit more difficult and it should n't be like that . "

the six-day war in 1967 arguably had its origins in a water dispute - moves to divert the river jordan , israel 's main source of drinking water .
years of skirmishes and sabre rattling culminated in all-out war , with israel quadrupling the territory it controlled and gaining complete control of double the resources of fresh water .
a country needs water to survive and develop .
in israel 's history , it has needed water to make feasible the influx of huge numbers of jewish immigrants .
obstacles to peace history of negotiations jerusalem water refugees borders and settlements therefore , on the margins of one of the most arid environments on earth , the available water system had to support not just the indigenous population , mainly palestinian peasant farmers , but also hundreds of thousands of immigrants .
in addition to their sheer numbers , citizens of the new state were intent on conducting water-intensive commercial agricultural such as growing bananas and citrus fruits .
shared water israel says the 1967 war was forced upon it by the imminent threat of hostile arab countries and there was no intention to occupy more land or resources .
but the war 's outcome left israel occupying an area not far short of the territory claimed by the founders of the zionist movement at the beginning of the 20th century .
in 1919 , the zionist delegation at the paris peace conference said the golan heights , jordan valley , what is now the west bank , as well as lebanon 's river litani were " essential for the necessary economic foundation of the country .
palestine must have ... the control of its rivers and their headwaters " .
photo journal : water use in the 1967 war israel gained exclusive control of the waters of the west bank and the sea of galilee , although not the litani .
those resources - the west bank 's mountain aquifer and the sea of galilee - give israel about 60 % of its fresh water , a billion cubic metres per year .
heated arguments rage about the rights to the mountain aquifer .
israel , and israeli settlements , take about 80 % of the aquifer 's flow , leaving the palestinians with 20 % .
israel says the proportion of water it uses has not changed substantially since the 1950s .
the rain which replenishes the aquifer may fall on the occupied territory , but the water does flow down into pre-1967 israel .
but the palestinians say they are prevented from using their own water resources by a belligerent military power , forcing hundreds of thousands of people to buy water from their occupiers at inflated prices .
moreover , israel allocates its citizens , including those living in settlements in the west bank deemed illegal under international law , with between three and five times more water than the palestinians .
this , palestinians say , is crippling to their agricultural economy .
with water consumption outstripping supply in both israel and the palestinian territories , palestinians say they are always the first community to be rationed as reserves run dry , with the health problems that entails .
fruitless discussions not surprisingly , during the era of arab-israeli peacemaking in the 1990s , water rights became one of the trickiest areas of discussion .
they were set aside to be dealt with in the " final status " israel-palestinian talks , which were never concluded .
replenishable resources sources in million cubic metres per year : sea of galilee - 700 mountain aquifer - 370 coastal aquifer -lrb- gaza -rrb- - 320 other - 410 israeli allocations : 56 % agriculture 38 % household 6 % industry -lrb- source : israeli government -rrb- meanwhile , israeli settlement activity continued in some of most sensitive water areas in the west bank , despite israel 's undertaking not to act in ways that prejudice final status talks .
stalled negotiations on syria 's dispute with israel over the golan heights - occupied by israel in 1967 and annexed in 1980 - also foundered on water-related issues .
syria wants an israeli withdrawal to 5 june 1967 borders , allowing syria access to the jordan and yarmouk rivers .
israel wants to use boundaries dating back to 1923 and the british mandate , which give the areas to israel .
by contrast , the jordan-israel treaty of 1994 produced notable agreement on use of wells in the wadi araba area in the south and sharing the yarmouk in the north .
in the 21st century israel has tried to solve the palestinian problem unilaterally , pulling troops and settlers from gaza and building a barrier around west bank areas with the largest concentration of palestinians .
although israel says this is a temporary security measure , the barrier encroaches deep onto occupied territory - especially areas of high water yield .
better future ?
middle eastern rhetoric often portrays the issue of water as an existential , zero-sum conflict - casting either israel as a malevolent sponge sucking up arab water resources , or the implacably hostile arabs as threatening israel 's very existence by denying life-giving water .
former un secretary general boutros boutros-ghali may not have been right when he said in the 1990s that the next war in the middle east would be about water not politics , but a future war over water is not out of the question .
demand for water already outstrips supply , requirements are rising and current supply is unsustainable .
hydrologists say joint solutions need to be found , because water requirements are interdependent and water resources cross political boundaries .
that necessitates improved conservation and recycling by both sides .
improving the political atmosphere would allow supplies to be piped from neighbouring countries .
also crucial , experts say , are investment in desalination and other technical advances .
such solutions are desperately needed in the medium to long term .
in other words , israel and the palestinians must work together , because they can not survive as combatants .

replenishable resources sources in million cubic metres per year : sea of galilee - 700 mountain aquifer - 370 coastal aquifer -lrb- gaza -rrb- - 320 other - 410 israeli allocations : 56 % agriculture 38 % household 6 % industry -lrb- source : israeli government -rrb- meanwhile , israeli settlement activity continued in some of most sensitive water areas in the west bank , despite israel 's undertaking not to act in ways that prejudice final status talks .
stalled negotiations on syria 's dispute with israel over the golan heights - occupied by israel in 1967 and annexed in 1980 - also foundered on water-related issues .
syria wants an israeli withdrawal to 5 june 1967 borders , allowing syria access to the jordan and yarmouk rivers .
israel wants to use boundaries dating back to 1923 and the british mandate , which give the areas to israel .
by contrast , the jordan-israel treaty of 1994 produced notable agreement on use of wells in the wadi araba area in the south and sharing the yarmouk in the north .
in the 21st century israel has tried to solve the palestinian problem unilaterally , pulling troops and settlers from gaza and building a barrier around west bank areas with the largest concentration of palestinians .
although israel says this is a temporary security measure , the barrier encroaches deep onto occupied territory - especially areas of high water yield .
better future ?
middle eastern rhetoric often portrays the issue of water as an existential , zero-sum conflict - casting either israel as a malevolent sponge sucking up arab water resources , or the implacably hostile arabs as threatening israel 's very existence by denying life-giving water .
former un secretary general boutros boutros-ghali may not have been right when he said in the 1990s that the next war in the middle east would be about water not politics , but a future war over water is not out of the question .
demand for water already outstrips supply , requirements are rising and current supply is unsustainable .
hydrologists say joint solutions need to be found , because water requirements are interdependent and water resources cross political boundaries .
that necessitates improved conservation and recycling by both sides .
improving the political atmosphere would allow supplies to be piped from neighbouring countries .
also crucial , experts say , are investment in desalination and other technical advances .
such solutions are desperately needed in the medium to long term .
in other words , israel and the palestinians must work together , because they can not survive as combatants .

when microsoft unveiled silverlight at the nab show in april 2006 , industry commentators instantly dubbed it a " flash killer " and said it spelled serious competition for adobe 's widely used animating tool .
at first glance , silverlight did seem to deserve the description as it seemed to be a tool chest that let designers and developers produce the same sort of animated and rich websites that flash coders can .
but , as more details of silverlight emerge , it is clear that calling it a " flash killer " is to seriously underestimate microsoft 's ambitions for it .
gear change it is true that microsoft does want to displace adobe 's flash perhaps because that software has proved so useful to so many hugely popular websites .
it can be argued that without flash , websites such as youtube would not have become so successful so fast .
but with silverlight , microsoft is also taking aim at a much larger swathe of technologies , all of which are behind the growth of all those sites lumped together under the web 2.0 banner .
web 2.0 is a slippery portmanteau term that describes both a series of technologies and an attitude .
web 2.0 sites tend to have large committed communities and many of those sites give them a series of tools to make more of the content seen or stored on that site .
classic examples of web 2.0 sites include flickr , myspace and netvibes - all of which are in the business of making it easy for their users to do a lot with the pictures they take , friends they gather or news and blogs they want to read .
building those tools involves a range of technologies with formidable acronyms that , crucially , microsoft does not own or control .
a clue to how microsoft wants to use silverlight to become a big player in the tools for creating rich websites came at the mix 07 conference held at the end of april .
at the conference , ray ozzie , microsoft 's chief software architect and the spiritual heir of bill gates , said : " the web apps of today , and the web apps of tomorrow are by necessity complicated , and fragmented across many technologies . "
in his speech , mr ozzie unveiled a new version of silverlight , release 1.1 , that microsoft hopes will solve some of those fragmentation problems .
with the new release microsoft made it possible for almost every programmer who develops software using the firm 's tools to produce code that can feed into a silverlight application .
developing picture at a stroke that vast army of developers , who microsoft has always assiduously courted , suddenly got the ability to write code that can be used to power rich web 2.0 sites .
as mr ozzie said , this includes those who write code for servers , pcs , web browsers , mobile devices or game consoles .
suddenly , said mr ozzie , developers had a " new choice " for creating those compelling futuristic web applications .
all those developers no longer need to go through the tricky route of converting their original code to a format that flash can understand - silverlight will understand it untranslated .
it goes without saying that a browser running a silverlight application needs a microsoft server to hand over the rich content .
it is here that the redmond giant hopes to make some money and claw back some credibility with web developers .
in a sense , microsoft had to develop a tool that could do this if it wanted to become a serious player in the future of the web .
" it would have been a mistake not to do it , " said matteo berlucchi , boss of uk developer skinkers which has wholeheartedly embraced silverlight .
it is one of the ironies of the microsoft story that just as its dominance on the desktop was assured , focus moved to the internet where it had almost no control .
silverlight is an attempt to win back some control .
but microsoft 's history could mean that silverlight takes time to become established .
the numerous anti-trust cases against microsoft mean that it is unlikely that it will simply be able to bundle it in with other microsoft programs .
instead users will have to download and install it themselves .
in that respect there may be something of a brake on the spread of silverlight even if there is no limit to microsoft 's ambitions for it .

when microsoft unveiled silverlight at the nab show in april 2006 , industry commentators instantly dubbed it a " flash killer " and said it spelled serious competition for adobe 's widely used animating tool .
at first glance , silverlight did seem to deserve the description as it seemed to be a tool chest that let designers and developers produce the same sort of animated and rich websites that flash coders can .
but , as more details of silverlight emerge , it is clear that calling it a " flash killer " is to seriously underestimate microsoft 's ambitions for it .
gear change it is true that microsoft does want to displace adobe 's flash perhaps because that software has proved so useful to so many hugely popular websites .
it can be argued that without flash , websites such as youtube would not have become so successful so fast .
but with silverlight , microsoft is also taking aim at a much larger swathe of technologies , all of which are behind the growth of all those sites lumped together under the web 2.0 banner .
ray ozzie talked up silverlight at the mix 07 show web 2.0 is a slippery portmanteau term that describes both a series of technologies and an attitude .
web 2.0 sites tend to have large committed communities and many of those sites give them a series of tools to make more of the content seen or stored on that site .
classic examples of web 2.0 sites include flickr , myspace and netvibes - all of which are in the business of making it easy for their users to do a lot with the pictures they take , friends they gather or news and blogs they want to read .
building those tools involves a range of technologies with formidable acronyms that , crucially , microsoft does not own or control .
a clue to how microsoft wants to use silverlight to become a big player in the tools for creating rich websites came at the mix 07 conference held at the end of april .
at the conference , ray ozzie , microsoft 's chief software architect and the spiritual heir of bill gates , said : " the web apps of today , and the web apps of tomorrow are by necessity complicated , and fragmented across many technologies . "
in his speech , mr ozzie unveiled a new version of silverlight , release 1.1 , that microsoft hopes will solve some of those fragmentation problems .
with the new release microsoft made it possible for almost every programmer who develops software using the firm 's tools to produce code that can feed into a silverlight application .
developing picture at a stroke that vast army of developers , who microsoft has always assiduously courted , suddenly got the ability to write code that can be used to power rich web 2.0 sites .
as mr ozzie said , this includes those who write code for servers , pcs , web browsers , mobile devices or game consoles .
suddenly , said mr ozzie , developers had a " new choice " for creating those compelling futuristic web applications .
all those developers no longer need to go through the tricky route of converting their original code to a format that flash can understand - silverlight will understand it untranslated .
silverlight lets existing developers crank out web code it goes without saying that a browser running a silverlight application needs a microsoft server to hand over the rich content .
it is here that the redmond giant hopes to make some money and claw back some credibility with web developers .
in a sense , microsoft had to develop a tool that could do this if it wanted to become a serious player in the future of the web .
" it would have been a mistake not to do it , " said matteo berlucchi , boss of uk developer skinkers which has wholeheartedly embraced silverlight .
it is one of the ironies of the microsoft story that just as its dominance on the desktop was assured , focus moved to the internet where it had almost no control .
silverlight is an attempt to win back some control .

when microsoft unveiled silverlight at the nab show in april 2006 , industry commentators instantly dubbed it a " flash killer " and said it spelled serious competition for adobe 's widely used animating tool .
at first glance , silverlight did seem to deserve the description as it seemed to be a tool chest that let designers and developers produce the same sort of animated and rich websites that flash coders can .
but , as more details of silverlight emerge , it is clear that calling it a " flash killer " is to seriously underestimate microsoft 's ambitions for it .
gear change it is true that microsoft does want to displace adobe 's flash perhaps because that software has proved so useful to so many hugely popular websites .
it can be argued that without flash , websites such as youtube would not have become so successful so fast .
but with silverlight , microsoft is also taking aim at a much larger swathe of technologies , all of which are behind the growth of all those sites lumped together under the web 2.0 banner .
ray ozzie talked up silverlight at the mix 07 show web 2.0 is a slippery portmanteau term that describes both a series of technologies and an attitude .
web 2.0 sites tend to have large committed communities and many of those sites give them a series of tools to make more of the content seen or stored on that site .
classic examples of web 2.0 sites include flickr , myspace and netvibes - all of which are in the business of making it easy for their users to do a lot with the pictures they take , friends they gather or news and blogs they want to read .
building those tools involves a range of technologies with formidable acronyms that , crucially , microsoft does not own or control .
a clue to how microsoft wants to use silverlight to become a big player in the tools for creating rich websites came at the mix 07 conference held at the end of april .
at the conference , ray ozzie , microsoft 's chief software architect and the spiritual heir of bill gates , said : " the web apps of today , and the web apps of tomorrow are by necessity complicated , and fragmented across many technologies . "
in his speech , mr ozzie unveiled a new version of silverlight , release 1.1 , that microsoft hopes will solve some of those fragmentation problems .
with the new release microsoft made it possible for almost every programmer who develops software using the firm 's tools to produce code that can feed into a silverlight application .
developing picture at a stroke that vast army of developers , who microsoft has always assiduously courted , suddenly got the ability to write code that can be used to power rich web 2.0 sites .
as mr ozzie said , this includes those who write code for servers , pcs , web browsers , mobile devices or game consoles .
suddenly , said mr ozzie , developers had a " new choice " for creating those compelling futuristic web applications .
all those developers no longer need to go through the tricky route of converting their original code to a format that flash can understand - silverlight will understand it untranslated .
silverlight lets existing developers crank out web code it goes without saying that a browser running a silverlight application needs a microsoft server to hand over the rich content .
it is here that the redmond giant hopes to make some money and claw back some credibility with web developers .
in a sense , microsoft had to develop a tool that could do this if it wanted to become a serious player in the future of the web .
" it would have been a mistake not to do it , " said matteo berlucchi , boss of uk developer skinkers which has wholeheartedly embraced silverlight .
it is one of the ironies of the microsoft story that just as its dominance on the desktop was assured , focus moved to the internet where it had almost no control .
silverlight is an attempt to win back some control .
but microsoft 's history could mean that silverlight takes time to become established .
the numerous anti-trust cases against microsoft mean that it is unlikely that it will simply be able to bundle it in with other microsoft programs .
instead users will have to download and install it themselves .
in that respect there may be something of a brake on the spread of silverlight even if there is no limit to microsoft 's ambitions for it .

the plot was due to revolve around kara tointon 's character dawn swann , who is currently pregnant in the programme .
" it was felt any storyline that included child abduction would be inappropriate and could cause distress to our viewers , " a spokeswoman said .
coronation street also changed a story following madeleine 's disappearance .
the four-year-old from rothley , leicestershire , went missing in the algarve on 3 may .
love triangle eastenders said its story would undergo a " substantial rewrite " before it was broadcast over the summer .
the scenes involve swann , her lover rob minter , played by stuart laing , and his wife dr may wright , played by amanda drew .
in the show , the trio are caught in a love triangle .
minter left his wife last december after she attempted to buy swann 's unborn baby .
coronation street 's story about a kidnapped child is currently on air , but has been significantly scaled back .
' disturbing similarities ' scenes from forthcoming episodes were due to feature the child 's mother , claire peacock , at press conferences clutching her baby 's teddy and handing out photos of her son , freddie .
a coronation street spokeswoman said : " there were some quite disturbing similarities to the situation in portugal and we did n't want to add to the torment of madeleine 's parents . "
a number of uk law enforcement agencies are helping the portuguese authorities in their search for the four-year-old girl .
portuguese police have also confirmed they are investigating claims of a possible sighting of madeleine in morocco .

how else , they argue , do you explain the return to favour of an industry once written-off as dirty , dangerous and prohibitively expensive ?
the picture put forward by some critics is certainly a powerful one .
it suggests the image of hapless ministers being schmoozed into submission by smooth-talking former party grandees now in the pay of nuclear multinationals .
in the background there would be briefings with sympathetic scientists , fact-finding missions to exotic locations , dubious statistics advanced over the brandy and cigars .
but how much truth is there in all of this ?
and how much influence do lobbyists on both sides of the nuclear debate actually have on government policy ?
most industries and large organisations , including the bbc , use lobbyists .
they are often former ministers or senior journalists , who have contacts in government and offer advice on how to influence policy .
i do n't believe tony blair has been influenced by lobbying greenpeace anti-nuclear campaigner the industry has tried to clean up its act since 1998 's cash-for-access scandal , which saw peter mandelson 's spin doctor derek draper fired over his links with lobbyists , but it remains controversial .
lobbyists working for the nuclear industry , which employs 40,000 people in the uk , have always been well-funded , but since the 1986 chernobyl disaster were widely assumed to be fighting a losing battle .
sophisticated campaign but as the debate about britain 's future energy needs has intensified , the industry 's reputation has been rehabilitated , with labour politicians at least .
nuclear lobbyist alan donnelly is a former labour mep " there has been a very sophisticated public relations campaign by the nuclear industry , using climate change , using energy security , saying that nuclear is now cheap and safe , and a few years ago the technology was dead in the water , " says andy rowell of greenpeace-funded nuclear spin website .
there are certainly no shortage of links between the nuclear industry and the new labour establishment .
former energy minister brian wilson is now a non-executive director of amec nuclear , a client of bnfl , the government-owned nuclear reactor operator .
since 2004 , bnfl has used lobbyists weber shandwick to help it push the case for new nuclear plants .
fast-track planning weber shandwick 's uk arm is headed by colin byrne , the labour party 's former chief press officer .
french energy giant edf has also been at the forefront of the campaign to change perceptions of nuclear power .
lord cunningham was tony blair 's ' cabinet enforcer ' the company , which operates 58 nuclear reactors in france and is already a big player in the uk electricity market , has said it is ready to invest in a new generation of plants in the uk , provided it gets the go-ahead from government .
it has successfully lobbied ministers to introduce a fast-track planning process to make it easier to build new plants without lengthy public enquiries .
chancellor gordon brown 's brother , andrew , is edf 's head of media relations in the uk .
yvette cooper , housing and planning minister , and wife of mr brown 's closest political ally ed balls , also has links to the nuclear industry .
her father , ex-trade union official tony cooper , is the former chairman of the nuclear industry association , and is currently a director of the nuclear decommissioning authority .
he has been one of the most vocal champions of the industry 's green credentials .
one of the most well-connected nuclear lobbyists is alan donnelly , former leader of the labour group in the european parliament .
mr donnelly 's company , sovereign strategy , represents us engineering giant fluor , one of the world 's biggest nuclear contractors , which is currently vying for a slice of the uk 's £ 70bn nuclear clean-up market - but like other us firms , such as bechtel , also has an eye on future nuclear build .
kitchen row on its website , sovereign strategy , offers among other services , " pathways to the decision makers in national governments " .
its board members include tory peer lady maitland and pro-nuclear labour peer lord cunningham , tony blair 's former " cabinet enforcer " and the ex chairman of the friends of sellafield campaign .
lord cunningham is also " legislative chair " of the transatlantic nuclear energy forum , an organisation founded and run by mr donnelly , that aims to foster " strong relationships " between nuclear power companies and governments .
tony blair has spoken at events organised by sovereign strategy , including 2005 's north east economic forum in his sedgefield constituency , where he was reportedly introduced by a fluor executive .
it was nonsense , but that 's the way it goes alan donnelly mr donnelly 's links with environment minister david miliband have also come under the spotlight after the sunday times ran a story about the lobbyist paying £ 2,000 towards the refurbishment of mr miliband 's constituency office .
mr donnelly insisted he was acting in his capacity as the chairman of mr miliband 's constituency labour party in south shields .
both men have firmly denied any impropriety .
writing in trade magazine public affairs news , mr donnelly said the money had been declared - and he had given it because he has been a labour party member for 32 years " and the party workers needed the kitchen fixing " .
he wrote : " the crux of the story was this : that david miliband would be so ecstatic with the £ 2,000 spent on his constituency kitchen that , were he fortunate enough to become environment secretary one day , he 'd pull out all the stops to award one of our clients the contract to build a whole raft of nuclear power stations .
" it was nonsense , but that 's the way it goes . "
peers ' payment sovereign strategy has been criticised by the association of professional political consultants -lrb- appc -rrb- - of which it is not a member - for having parliamentarians on its payroll , something the trade body prohibits in its code of conduct .
" we pay them for their work because they deserve to be paid for their time , " mr donnelly wrote of the two peers who sit on his board .
labour has often castigated the old boy network , the public school tie and so on , but they have a similar network .
it depends who you know in the unions or ex-labour ministers jean mcsorely greenpeace lobbyists such as sovereign and weber shandwick rely on their contacts in the corridors of power to impress potential clients and bring in new business .
green lobby but how much influence do they actually wield over government policy ?
and what about the role of the anti-nuclear lobby - groups such as greenpeace and friends of the earth - less well-funded , perhaps , but arguably no less well-connected , and with a canny knack for grabbing headlines ?
there are many links between the government and the green lobby - although several former advisers are now firmly opposed to its policies .
greenpeace executive director stephen tindale , a former special adviser to labour ministers chris smith and michael meacher , has been highly critical of the government 's nuclear policy .
stephen hale , director of the green alliance , who was a special adviser to margaret beckett when she was environment secretary , has also attacked what he called tony blair 's " obsession " with nuclear power .
and the government 's independent sustainable development commission , chaired by ex-friends of the earth chief jonathan porritt , has also been sceptical about nuclear .
' old boy network ' because it is made up of voluntary organisations or charities , the green lobby can claim to have a certain amount of public support , which can help open doors in whitehall .
but it is not enough for green campaigners just to be seen as " nice people " , argues greenpeace 's jean mcsorely - they must also have the stronger arguments .
the pro-nuclear lobby has been clever in using environmental arguments , on climate change , and the security of supply issue , to push its case , she says .
she believes greenpeace has a stronger scientific case , but , she argues , it does not always get a fair chance to make it .
" the access industry gets is just phenomenal compared to green groups , " she tells the bbc news website .
" labour has often castigated the old boy network , the public school tie and so on , but they have a similar network .
it depends who you know in the unions or ex-labour ministers .
" people may accept that as the way things are , but there needs to be more transparency . "
blair advisers having said that , she does not believe mr blair has been made to change his mind by the efforts of the pro-nuclear lobby - he was already a convert .
it was mr blair , she argues , who in 2003 insisted on the door being left open for nuclear in the government 's energy white paper , which proposed a large increase in renewable energy .
tony blair used a cbi dinner to say nuclear was back with a vengeance " i do n't believe tony blair has been influenced by lobbying .
both he and the industry have just been waiting for the right time to make their move " , says ms mcsorely .
where the lobbyists come in , she argues , is in " shoring up " support among other cabinet ministers , mps and the general public , and smoothing away potential opposition .
the role of the trade unions has also been crucial , with the gmb and tgwu being particularly active in pushing the pro-nuclear case .
five trade unions have also banded together to fund a nuclear workers ' lobby group , nuklear21 , to push the case for new nuclear plants .
industry voice mr blair is thought to have made the decision to hold an energy review - paving the way for the return of nuclear - after a meeting in september 2005 at chequers with his advisers and representatives of the nuclear industry .
those close to the debate believe it is these advisers - such as former bbc director general lord birt , industry adviser geoffrey norris and the government 's chief scientific adviser sir david king - who have most influenced the prime minister 's thinking .
insiders argue that mr blair is more than capable of making his own mind up based on the available evidence and the nuclear industry also rejects the suggestion it is given special access to ministers and other decision-makers .
with the industry employing 40,000 people in the uk , nuclear has a right to make its voice heard in government , argues john mcnamara , of the nuclear industry association .
he adds : " it should not come as a surprise that we do as much as we can to represent the interests of our industry , like any other large industrial sector . "

french energy giant edf has also been at the forefront of the campaign to change perceptions of nuclear power .
lord cunningham was tony blair 's ' cabinet enforcer ' the company , which operates 58 nuclear reactors in france and is already a big player in the uk electricity market , has said it is ready to invest in a new generation of plants in the uk , provided it gets the go-ahead from government .
it has successfully lobbied ministers to introduce a fast-track planning process to make it easier to build new plants without lengthy public enquiries .
chancellor gordon brown 's brother , andrew , is edf 's head of media relations in the uk .
yvette cooper , housing and planning minister , and wife of mr brown 's closest political ally ed balls , also has links to the nuclear industry .
her father , ex-trade union official tony cooper , is the former chairman of the nuclear industry association , and is currently a director of the nuclear decommissioning authority .
he has been one of the most vocal champions of the industry 's green credentials .
one of the most well-connected nuclear lobbyists is alan donnelly , former leader of the labour group in the european parliament .
mr donnelly 's company , sovereign strategy , represents us engineering giant fluor , one of the world 's biggest nuclear contractors , which is currently vying for a slice of the uk 's £ 70bn nuclear clean-up market - but like other us firms , such as bechtel , also has an eye on future nuclear build .
kitchen row on its website , sovereign strategy , offers among other services , " pathways to the decision makers in national governments " .
its board members include tory peer lady maitland and pro-nuclear labour peer lord cunningham , tony blair 's former " cabinet enforcer " and the ex chairman of the friends of sellafield campaign .
lord cunningham is also " legislative chair " of the transatlantic nuclear energy forum , an organisation founded and run by mr donnelly , that aims to foster " strong relationships " between nuclear power companies and governments .
tony blair has spoken at events organised by sovereign strategy , including 2005 's north east economic forum in his sedgefield constituency , where he was reportedly introduced by a fluor executive .
it was nonsense , but that 's the way it goes alan donnelly mr donnelly 's links with environment minister david miliband have also come under the spotlight after the sunday times ran a story about the lobbyist paying £ 2,000 towards the refurbishment of mr miliband 's constituency office .
mr donnelly insisted he was acting in his capacity as the chairman of mr miliband 's constituency labour party in south shields .
both men have firmly denied any impropriety .
writing in trade magazine public affairs news , mr donnelly said the money had been declared - and he had given it because he has been a labour party member for 32 years " and the party workers needed the kitchen fixing " .
he wrote : " the crux of the story was this : that david miliband would be so ecstatic with the £ 2,000 spent on his constituency kitchen that , were he fortunate enough to become environment secretary one day , he 'd pull out all the stops to award one of our clients the contract to build a whole raft of nuclear power stations .
" it was nonsense , but that 's the way it goes . "
peers ' payment sovereign strategy has been criticised by the association of professional political consultants -lrb- appc -rrb- - of which it is not a member - for having parliamentarians on its payroll , something the trade body prohibits in its code of conduct .
" we pay them for their work because they deserve to be paid for their time , " mr donnelly wrote of the two peers who sit on his board .
labour has often castigated the old boy network , the public school tie and so on , but they have a similar network .

green lobby but how much influence do they actually wield over government policy ?
and what about the role of the anti-nuclear lobby - groups such as greenpeace and friends of the earth - less well-funded , perhaps , but arguably no less well-connected , and with a canny knack for grabbing headlines ?
there are many links between the government and the green lobby - although several former advisers are now firmly opposed to its policies .
greenpeace executive director stephen tindale , a former special adviser to labour ministers chris smith and michael meacher , has been highly critical of the government 's nuclear policy .
stephen hale , director of the green alliance , who was a special adviser to margaret beckett when she was environment secretary , has also attacked what he called tony blair 's " obsession " with nuclear power .
and the government 's independent sustainable development commission , chaired by ex-friends of the earth chief jonathan porritt , has also been sceptical about nuclear .
' old boy network ' because it is made up of voluntary organisations or charities , the green lobby can claim to have a certain amount of public support , which can help open doors in whitehall .
but it is not enough for green campaigners just to be seen as " nice people " , argues greenpeace 's jean mcsorely - they must also have the stronger arguments .
the pro-nuclear lobby has been clever in using environmental arguments , on climate change , and the security of supply issue , to push its case , she says .
she believes greenpeace has a stronger scientific case , but , she argues , it does not always get a fair chance to make it .
" the access industry gets is just phenomenal compared to green groups , " she tells the bbc news website .
" labour has often castigated the old boy network , the public school tie and so on , but they have a similar network .
it depends who you know in the unions or ex-labour ministers .
" people may accept that as the way things are , but there needs to be more transparency . "
blair advisers having said that , she does not believe mr blair has been made to change his mind by the efforts of the pro-nuclear lobby - he was already a convert .
it was mr blair , she argues , who in 2003 insisted on the door being left open for nuclear in the government 's energy white paper , which proposed a large increase in renewable energy .
tony blair used a cbi dinner to say nuclear was back with a vengeance " i do n't believe tony blair has been influenced by lobbying .
both he and the industry have just been waiting for the right time to make their move " , says ms mcsorely .
where the lobbyists come in , she argues , is in " shoring up " support among other cabinet ministers , mps and the general public , and smoothing away potential opposition .
the role of the trade unions has also been crucial , with the gmb and tgwu being particularly active in pushing the pro-nuclear case .
five trade unions have also banded together to fund a nuclear workers ' lobby group , nuklear21 , to push the case for new nuclear plants .
industry voice mr blair is thought to have made the decision to hold an energy review - paving the way for the return of nuclear - after a meeting in september 2005 at chequers with his advisers and representatives of the nuclear industry .
those close to the debate believe it is these advisers - such as former bbc director general lord birt , industry adviser geoffrey norris and the government 's chief scientific adviser sir david king - who have most influenced the prime minister 's thinking .
insiders argue that mr blair is more than capable of making his own mind up based on the available evidence and the nuclear industry also rejects the suggestion it is given special access to ministers and other decision-makers .
with the industry employing 40,000 people in the uk , nuclear has a right to make its voice heard in government , argues john mcnamara , of the nuclear industry association .
he adds : " it should not come as a surprise that we do as much as we can to represent the interests of our industry , like any other large industrial sector . "

how else , they argue , do you explain the return to favour of an industry once written-off as dirty , dangerous and prohibitively expensive ?
the picture put forward by some critics is certainly a powerful one .
it suggests the image of hapless ministers being schmoozed into submission by smooth-talking former party grandees now in the pay of nuclear multinationals .
in the background there would be briefings with sympathetic scientists , fact-finding missions to exotic locations , dubious statistics advanced over the brandy and cigars .
but how much truth is there in all of this ?
and how much influence do lobbyists on both sides of the nuclear debate actually have on government policy ?
most industries and large organisations , including the bbc , use lobbyists .
they are often former ministers or senior journalists , who have contacts in government and offer advice on how to influence policy .
i do n't believe tony blair has been influenced by lobbying greenpeace anti-nuclear campaigner the industry has tried to clean up its act since 1998 's cash-for-access scandal , which saw peter mandelson 's spin doctor derek draper fired over his links with lobbyists , but it remains controversial .
lobbyists working for the nuclear industry , which employs 40,000 people in the uk , have always been well-funded , but since the 1986 chernobyl disaster were widely assumed to be fighting a losing battle .
sophisticated campaign but as the debate about britain 's future energy needs has intensified , the industry 's reputation has been rehabilitated , with labour politicians at least .
nuclear lobbyist alan donnelly is a former labour mep " there has been a very sophisticated public relations campaign by the nuclear industry , using climate change , using energy security , saying that nuclear is now cheap and safe , and a few years ago the technology was dead in the water , " says andy rowell of greenpeace-funded nuclear spin website .
there are certainly no shortage of links between the nuclear industry and the new labour establishment .

industry voice mr blair is thought to have made the decision to hold an energy review - paving the way for the return of nuclear - after a meeting in september 2005 at chequers with his advisers and representatives of the nuclear industry .

how else , they argue , do you explain the return to favour of an industry once written-off as dirty , dangerous and prohibitively expensive ?
the picture put forward by some critics is certainly a powerful one .
it suggests the image of hapless ministers being schmoozed into submission by smooth-talking former party grandees now in the pay of nuclear multinationals .
in the background there would be briefings with sympathetic scientists , fact-finding missions to exotic locations , dubious statistics advanced over the brandy and cigars .
but how much truth is there in all of this ?
and how much influence do lobbyists on both sides of the nuclear debate actually have on government policy ?
most industries and large organisations , including the bbc , use lobbyists .
they are often former ministers or senior journalists , who have contacts in government and offer advice on how to influence policy .
i do n't believe tony blair has been influenced by lobbying greenpeace anti-nuclear campaigner the industry has tried to clean up its act since 1998 's cash-for-access scandal , which saw peter mandelson 's spin doctor derek draper fired over his links with lobbyists , but it remains controversial .
lobbyists working for the nuclear industry , which employs 40,000 people in the uk , have always been well-funded , but since the 1986 chernobyl disaster were widely assumed to be fighting a losing battle .
sophisticated campaign but as the debate about britain 's future energy needs has intensified , the industry 's reputation has been rehabilitated , with labour politicians at least .
nuclear lobbyist alan donnelly is a former labour mep " there has been a very sophisticated public relations campaign by the nuclear industry , using climate change , using energy security , saying that nuclear is now cheap and safe , and a few years ago the technology was dead in the water , " says andy rowell of greenpeace-funded nuclear spin website .
there are certainly no shortage of links between the nuclear industry and the new labour establishment .
former energy minister brian wilson is now a non-executive director of amec nuclear , a client of bnfl , the government-owned nuclear reactor operator .
since 2004 , bnfl has used lobbyists weber shandwick to help it push the case for new nuclear plants .
fast-track planning weber shandwick 's uk arm is headed by colin byrne , the labour party 's former chief press officer .
french energy giant edf has also been at the forefront of the campaign to change perceptions of nuclear power .
lord cunningham was tony blair 's ' cabinet enforcer ' the company , which operates 58 nuclear reactors in france and is already a big player in the uk electricity market , has said it is ready to invest in a new generation of plants in the uk , provided it gets the go-ahead from government .
it has successfully lobbied ministers to introduce a fast-track planning process to make it easier to build new plants without lengthy public enquiries .
chancellor gordon brown 's brother , andrew , is edf 's head of media relations in the uk .
yvette cooper , housing and planning minister , and wife of mr brown 's closest political ally ed balls , also has links to the nuclear industry .
her father , ex-trade union official tony cooper , is the former chairman of the nuclear industry association , and is currently a director of the nuclear decommissioning authority .
he has been one of the most vocal champions of the industry 's green credentials .
one of the most well-connected nuclear lobbyists is alan donnelly , former leader of the labour group in the european parliament .
mr donnelly 's company , sovereign strategy , represents us engineering giant fluor , one of the world 's biggest nuclear contractors , which is currently vying for a slice of the uk 's £ 70bn nuclear clean-up market - but like other us firms , such as bechtel , also has an eye on future nuclear build .
kitchen row on its website , sovereign strategy , offers among other services , " pathways to the decision makers in national governments " .
its board members include tory peer lady maitland and pro-nuclear labour peer lord cunningham , tony blair 's former " cabinet enforcer " and the ex chairman of the friends of sellafield campaign .
lord cunningham is also " legislative chair " of the transatlantic nuclear energy forum , an organisation founded and run by mr donnelly , that aims to foster " strong relationships " between nuclear power companies and governments .
tony blair has spoken at events organised by sovereign strategy , including 2005 's north east economic forum in his sedgefield constituency , where he was reportedly introduced by a fluor executive .
it was nonsense , but that 's the way it goes alan donnelly mr donnelly 's links with environment minister david miliband have also come under the spotlight after the sunday times ran a story about the lobbyist paying £ 2,000 towards the refurbishment of mr miliband 's constituency office .
mr donnelly insisted he was acting in his capacity as the chairman of mr miliband 's constituency labour party in south shields .
both men have firmly denied any impropriety .
writing in trade magazine public affairs news , mr donnelly said the money had been declared - and he had given it because he has been a labour party member for 32 years " and the party workers needed the kitchen fixing " .
he wrote : " the crux of the story was this : that david miliband would be so ecstatic with the £ 2,000 spent on his constituency kitchen that , were he fortunate enough to become environment secretary one day , he 'd pull out all the stops to award one of our clients the contract to build a whole raft of nuclear power stations .
" it was nonsense , but that 's the way it goes . "
peers ' payment sovereign strategy has been criticised by the association of professional political consultants -lrb- appc -rrb- - of which it is not a member - for having parliamentarians on its payroll , something the trade body prohibits in its code of conduct .
" we pay them for their work because they deserve to be paid for their time , " mr donnelly wrote of the two peers who sit on his board .
labour has often castigated the old boy network , the public school tie and so on , but they have a similar network .
it depends who you know in the unions or ex-labour ministers jean mcsorely greenpeace lobbyists such as sovereign and weber shandwick rely on their contacts in the corridors of power to impress potential clients and bring in new business .
green lobby but how much influence do they actually wield over government policy ?
and what about the role of the anti-nuclear lobby - groups such as greenpeace and friends of the earth - less well-funded , perhaps , but arguably no less well-connected , and with a canny knack for grabbing headlines ?
there are many links between the government and the green lobby - although several former advisers are now firmly opposed to its policies .
greenpeace executive director stephen tindale , a former special adviser to labour ministers chris smith and michael meacher , has been highly critical of the government 's nuclear policy .
stephen hale , director of the green alliance , who was a special adviser to margaret beckett when she was environment secretary , has also attacked what he called tony blair 's " obsession " with nuclear power .
and the government 's independent sustainable development commission , chaired by ex-friends of the earth chief jonathan porritt , has also been sceptical about nuclear .
' old boy network ' because it is made up of voluntary organisations or charities , the green lobby can claim to have a certain amount of public support , which can help open doors in whitehall .
but it is not enough for green campaigners just to be seen as " nice people " , argues greenpeace 's jean mcsorely - they must also have the stronger arguments .
the pro-nuclear lobby has been clever in using environmental arguments , on climate change , and the security of supply issue , to push its case , she says .
she believes greenpeace has a stronger scientific case , but , she argues , it does not always get a fair chance to make it .
" the access industry gets is just phenomenal compared to green groups , " she tells the bbc news website .
" labour has often castigated the old boy network , the public school tie and so on , but they have a similar network .
it depends who you know in the unions or ex-labour ministers .
" people may accept that as the way things are , but there needs to be more transparency . "
blair advisers having said that , she does not believe mr blair has been made to change his mind by the efforts of the pro-nuclear lobby - he was already a convert .
it was mr blair , she argues , who in 2003 insisted on the door being left open for nuclear in the government 's energy white paper , which proposed a large increase in renewable energy .
tony blair used a cbi dinner to say nuclear was back with a vengeance " i do n't believe tony blair has been influenced by lobbying .
both he and the industry have just been waiting for the right time to make their move " , says ms mcsorely .
where the lobbyists come in , she argues , is in " shoring up " support among other cabinet ministers , mps and the general public , and smoothing away potential opposition .
the role of the trade unions has also been crucial , with the gmb and tgwu being particularly active in pushing the pro-nuclear case .
five trade unions have also banded together to fund a nuclear workers ' lobby group , nuklear21 , to push the case for new nuclear plants .
industry voice mr blair is thought to have made the decision to hold an energy review - paving the way for the return of nuclear - after a meeting in september 2005 at chequers with his advisers and representatives of the nuclear industry .
those close to the debate believe it is these advisers - such as former bbc director general lord birt , industry adviser geoffrey norris and the government 's chief scientific adviser sir david king - who have most influenced the prime minister 's thinking .
insiders argue that mr blair is more than capable of making his own mind up based on the available evidence and the nuclear industry also rejects the suggestion it is given special access to ministers and other decision-makers .
with the industry employing 40,000 people in the uk , nuclear has a right to make its voice heard in government , argues john mcnamara , of the nuclear industry association .
he adds : " it should not come as a surprise that we do as much as we can to represent the interests of our industry , like any other large industrial sector . "

former energy minister brian wilson is now a non-executive director of amec nuclear , a client of bnfl , the government-owned nuclear reactor operator .
since 2004 , bnfl has used lobbyists weber shandwick to help it push the case for new nuclear plants .
fast-track planning weber shandwick 's uk arm is headed by colin byrne , the labour party 's former chief press officer .
french energy giant edf has also been at the forefront of the campaign to change perceptions of nuclear power .
lord cunningham was tony blair 's ' cabinet enforcer ' the company , which operates 58 nuclear reactors in france and is already a big player in the uk electricity market , has said it is ready to invest in a new generation of plants in the uk , provided it gets the go-ahead from government .
it has successfully lobbied ministers to introduce a fast-track planning process to make it easier to build new plants without lengthy public enquiries .
chancellor gordon brown 's brother , andrew , is edf 's head of media relations in the uk .
yvette cooper , housing and planning minister , and wife of mr brown 's closest political ally ed balls , also has links to the nuclear industry .
her father , ex-trade union official tony cooper , is the former chairman of the nuclear industry association , and is currently a director of the nuclear decommissioning authority .
he has been one of the most vocal champions of the industry 's green credentials .
one of the most well-connected nuclear lobbyists is alan donnelly , former leader of the labour group in the european parliament .
mr donnelly 's company , sovereign strategy , represents us engineering giant fluor , one of the world 's biggest nuclear contractors , which is currently vying for a slice of the uk 's £ 70bn nuclear clean-up market - but like other us firms , such as bechtel , also has an eye on future nuclear build .
kitchen row on its website , sovereign strategy , offers among other services , " pathways to the decision makers in national governments " .
its board members include tory peer lady maitland and pro-nuclear labour peer lord cunningham , tony blair 's former " cabinet enforcer " and the ex chairman of the friends of sellafield campaign .
lord cunningham is also " legislative chair " of the transatlantic nuclear energy forum , an organisation founded and run by mr donnelly , that aims to foster " strong relationships " between nuclear power companies and governments .
tony blair has spoken at events organised by sovereign strategy , including 2005 's north east economic forum in his sedgefield constituency , where he was reportedly introduced by a fluor executive .
it was nonsense , but that 's the way it goes alan donnelly mr donnelly 's links with environment minister david miliband have also come under the spotlight after the sunday times ran a story about the lobbyist paying £ 2,000 towards the refurbishment of mr miliband 's constituency office .
mr donnelly insisted he was acting in his capacity as the chairman of mr miliband 's constituency labour party in south shields .
both men have firmly denied any impropriety .
writing in trade magazine public affairs news , mr donnelly said the money had been declared - and he had given it because he has been a labour party member for 32 years " and the party workers needed the kitchen fixing " .
he wrote : " the crux of the story was this : that david miliband would be so ecstatic with the £ 2,000 spent on his constituency kitchen that , were he fortunate enough to become environment secretary one day , he 'd pull out all the stops to award one of our clients the contract to build a whole raft of nuclear power stations .
" it was nonsense , but that 's the way it goes . "
peers ' payment sovereign strategy has been criticised by the association of professional political consultants -lrb- appc -rrb- - of which it is not a member - for having parliamentarians on its payroll , something the trade body prohibits in its code of conduct .
" we pay them for their work because they deserve to be paid for their time , " mr donnelly wrote of the two peers who sit on his board .
labour has often castigated the old boy network , the public school tie and so on , but they have a similar network .
it depends who you know in the unions or ex-labour ministers jean mcsorely greenpeace lobbyists such as sovereign and weber shandwick rely on their contacts in the corridors of power to impress potential clients and bring in new business .
green lobby but how much influence do they actually wield over government policy ?
and what about the role of the anti-nuclear lobby - groups such as greenpeace and friends of the earth - less well-funded , perhaps , but arguably no less well-connected , and with a canny knack for grabbing headlines ?
there are many links between the government and the green lobby - although several former advisers are now firmly opposed to its policies .
greenpeace executive director stephen tindale , a former special adviser to labour ministers chris smith and michael meacher , has been highly critical of the government 's nuclear policy .
stephen hale , director of the green alliance , who was a special adviser to margaret beckett when she was environment secretary , has also attacked what he called tony blair 's " obsession " with nuclear power .
and the government 's independent sustainable development commission , chaired by ex-friends of the earth chief jonathan porritt , has also been sceptical about nuclear .
' old boy network ' because it is made up of voluntary organisations or charities , the green lobby can claim to have a certain amount of public support , which can help open doors in whitehall .
but it is not enough for green campaigners just to be seen as " nice people " , argues greenpeace 's jean mcsorely - they must also have the stronger arguments .
the pro-nuclear lobby has been clever in using environmental arguments , on climate change , and the security of supply issue , to push its case , she says .
she believes greenpeace has a stronger scientific case , but , she argues , it does not always get a fair chance to make it .
" the access industry gets is just phenomenal compared to green groups , " she tells the bbc news website .
" labour has often castigated the old boy network , the public school tie and so on , but they have a similar network .
it depends who you know in the unions or ex-labour ministers .
" people may accept that as the way things are , but there needs to be more transparency . "
blair advisers having said that , she does not believe mr blair has been made to change his mind by the efforts of the pro-nuclear lobby - he was already a convert .
it was mr blair , she argues , who in 2003 insisted on the door being left open for nuclear in the government 's energy white paper , which proposed a large increase in renewable energy .
tony blair used a cbi dinner to say nuclear was back with a vengeance " i do n't believe tony blair has been influenced by lobbying .
both he and the industry have just been waiting for the right time to make their move " , says ms mcsorely .
where the lobbyists come in , she argues , is in " shoring up " support among other cabinet ministers , mps and the general public , and smoothing away potential opposition .
the role of the trade unions has also been crucial , with the gmb and tgwu being particularly active in pushing the pro-nuclear case .
five trade unions have also banded together to fund a nuclear workers ' lobby group , nuklear21 , to push the case for new nuclear plants .
industry voice mr blair is thought to have made the decision to hold an energy review - paving the way for the return of nuclear - after a meeting in september 2005 at chequers with his advisers and representatives of the nuclear industry .
those close to the debate believe it is these advisers - such as former bbc director general lord birt , industry adviser geoffrey norris and the government 's chief scientific adviser sir david king - who have most influenced the prime minister 's thinking .
insiders argue that mr blair is more than capable of making his own mind up based on the available evidence and the nuclear industry also rejects the suggestion it is given special access to ministers and other decision-makers .
with the industry employing 40,000 people in the uk , nuclear has a right to make its voice heard in government , argues john mcnamara , of the nuclear industry association .
he adds : " it should not come as a surprise that we do as much as we can to represent the interests of our industry , like any other large industrial sector . "

how else , they argue , do you explain the return to favour of an industry once written-off as dirty , dangerous and prohibitively expensive ?
the picture put forward by some critics is certainly a powerful one .
it suggests the image of hapless ministers being schmoozed into submission by smooth-talking former party grandees now in the pay of nuclear multinationals .
in the background there would be briefings with sympathetic scientists , fact-finding missions to exotic locations , dubious statistics advanced over the brandy and cigars .
but how much truth is there in all of this ?
and how much influence do lobbyists on both sides of the nuclear debate actually have on government policy ?
most industries and large organisations , including the bbc , use lobbyists .
they are often former ministers or senior journalists , who have contacts in government and offer advice on how to influence policy .
i do n't believe tony blair has been influenced by lobbying greenpeace anti-nuclear campaigner the industry has tried to clean up its act since 1998 's cash-for-access scandal , which saw peter mandelson 's spin doctor derek draper fired over his links with lobbyists , but it remains controversial .
lobbyists working for the nuclear industry , which employs 40,000 people in the uk , have always been well-funded , but since the 1986 chernobyl disaster were widely assumed to be fighting a losing battle .
sophisticated campaign but as the debate about britain 's future energy needs has intensified , the industry 's reputation has been rehabilitated , with labour politicians at least .

both he and the industry have just been waiting for the right time to make their move " , says ms mcsorely .
where the lobbyists come in , she argues , is in " shoring up " support among other cabinet ministers , mps and the general public , and smoothing away potential opposition .
the role of the trade unions has also been crucial , with the gmb and tgwu being particularly active in pushing the pro-nuclear case .
five trade unions have also banded together to fund a nuclear workers ' lobby group , nuklear21 , to push the case for new nuclear plants .
industry voice mr blair is thought to have made the decision to hold an energy review - paving the way for the return of nuclear - after a meeting in september 2005 at chequers with his advisers and representatives of the nuclear industry .
those close to the debate believe it is these advisers - such as former bbc director general lord birt , industry adviser geoffrey norris and the government 's chief scientific adviser sir david king - who have most influenced the prime minister 's thinking .
insiders argue that mr blair is more than capable of making his own mind up based on the available evidence and the nuclear industry also rejects the suggestion it is given special access to ministers and other decision-makers .
with the industry employing 40,000 people in the uk , nuclear has a right to make its voice heard in government , argues john mcnamara , of the nuclear industry association .
he adds : " it should not come as a surprise that we do as much as we can to represent the interests of our industry , like any other large industrial sector . "

greenpeace executive director stephen tindale , a former special adviser to labour ministers chris smith and michael meacher , has been highly critical of the government 's nuclear policy .

the pro-nuclear lobby has been clever in using environmental arguments , on climate change , and the security of supply issue , to push its case , she says .
she believes greenpeace has a stronger scientific case , but , she argues , it does not always get a fair chance to make it .

french energy giant edf has also been at the forefront of the campaign to change perceptions of nuclear power .
the company , which operates 58 nuclear reactors in france and is already a big player in the uk electricity market , has said it is ready to invest in a new generation of plants in the uk , provided it gets the go-ahead from government .
it has successfully lobbied ministers to introduce a fast-track planning process to make it easier to build new plants without lengthy public enquiries .
chancellor gordon brown 's brother , andrew , is edf 's head of media relations in the uk .
yvette cooper , housing and planning minister , and wife of mr brown 's closest political ally ed balls , also has links to the nuclear industry .
her father , ex-trade union official tony cooper , is the former chairman of the nuclear industry association , and is currently a director of the nuclear decommissioning authority .
he has been one of the most vocal champions of the industry 's green credentials .
one of the most well-connected nuclear lobbyists is alan donnelly , former leader of the labour group in the european parliament .
mr donnelly 's company , sovereign strategy , represents us engineering giant fluor , one of the world 's biggest nuclear contractors , which is currently vying for a slice of the uk 's £ 70bn nuclear clean-up market - but like other us firms , such as bechtel , also has an eye on future nuclear build .
kitchen row on its website , sovereign strategy , offers among other services , " pathways to the decision makers in national governments " .
its board members include tory peer lady maitland and pro-nuclear labour peer lord cunningham , tony blair 's former " cabinet enforcer " and the ex chairman of the friends of sellafield campaign .
lord cunningham is also " legislative chair " of the transatlantic nuclear energy forum , an organisation founded and run by mr donnelly , that aims to foster " strong relationships " between nuclear power companies and governments .
tony blair has spoken at events organised by sovereign strategy , including 2005 's north east economic forum in his sedgefield constituency , where he was reportedly introduced by a fluor executive . "
it was nonsense , but that 's the way it goes " alan donnelly mr donnelly 's links with environment minister david miliband have also come under the spotlight after the sunday times ran a story about the lobbyist paying £ 2,000 towards the refurbishment of mr miliband 's constituency office .
mr donnelly insisted he was acting in his capacity as the chairman of mr miliband 's constituency labour party in south shields .
both men have firmly denied any impropriety .
writing in trade magazine public affairs news , mr donnelly said the money had been declared - and he had given it because he has been a labour party member for 32 years " and the party workers needed the kitchen fixing " .
he wrote : " the crux of the story was this : that david miliband would be so ecstatic with the £ 2,000 spent on his constituency kitchen that , were he fortunate enough to become environment secretary one day , he 'd pull out all the stops to award one of our clients the contract to build a whole raft of nuclear power stations .
" it was nonsense , but that 's the way it goes . "
peers ' payment sovereign strategy has been criticised by the association of professional political consultants -lrb- appc -rrb- - of which it is not a member - for having parliamentarians on its payroll , something the trade body prohibits in its code of conduct .
" we pay them for their work because they deserve to be paid for their time , " mr donnelly wrote of the two peers who sit on his board . "
labour has often castigated the old boy network , the public school tie and so on , but they have a similar network .
it depends who you know in the unions or ex-labour ministers " jean mcsorely greenpeace lobbyists such as sovereign and weber shandwick rely on their contacts in the corridors of power to impress potential clients and bring in new business .
green lobby but how much influence do they actually wield over government policy ?
and what about the role of the anti-nuclear lobby - groups such as greenpeace and friends of the earth - less well-funded , perhaps , but arguably no less well-connected , and with a canny knack for grabbing headlines ?
there are many links between the government and the green lobby - although several former advisers are now firmly opposed to its policies .
greenpeace executive director stephen tindale , a former special adviser to labour ministers chris smith and michael meacher , has been highly critical of the government 's nuclear policy .
stephen hale , director of the green alliance , who was a special adviser to margaret beckett when she was environment secretary , has also attacked what he called tony blair 's " obsession " with nuclear power .
and the government 's independent sustainable development commission , chaired by ex-friends of the earth chief jonathan porritt , has also been sceptical about nuclear .
' old boy network ' because it is made up of voluntary organisations or charities , the green lobby can claim to have a certain amount of public support , which can help open doors in whitehall .
but it is not enough for green campaigners just to be seen as " nice people " , argues greenpeace 's jean mcsorely - they must also have the stronger arguments .
the pro-nuclear lobby has been clever in using environmental arguments , on climate change , and the security of supply issue , to push its case , she says .
she believes greenpeace has a stronger scientific case , but , she argues , it does not always get a fair chance to make it .
" the access industry gets is just phenomenal compared to green groups , " she tells the bbc news website .
" labour has often castigated the old boy network , the public school tie and so on , but they have a similar network .
it depends who you know in the unions or ex-labour ministers .
" people may accept that as the way things are , but there needs to be more transparency . "
blair advisers having said that , she does not believe mr blair has been made to change his mind by the efforts of the pro-nuclear lobby - he was already a convert .
it was mr blair , she argues , who in 2003 insisted on the door being left open for nuclear in the government 's energy white paper , which proposed a large increase in renewable energy .
" i do n't believe tony blair has been influenced by lobbying .
both he and the industry have just been waiting for the right time to make their move " , says ms mcsorely .
where the lobbyists come in , she argues , is in " shoring up " support among other cabinet ministers , mps and the general public , and smoothing away potential opposition .
the role of the trade unions has also been crucial , with the gmb and tgwu being particularly active in pushing the pro-nuclear case .
five trade unions have also banded together to fund a nuclear workers ' lobby group , nuklear21 , to push the case for new nuclear plants .
industry voice mr blair is thought to have made the decision to hold an energy review - paving the way for the return of nuclear - after a meeting in september 2005 at chequers with his advisers and representatives of the nuclear industry .
those close to the debate believe it is these advisers - such as former bbc director general lord birt , industry adviser geoffrey norris and the government 's chief scientific adviser sir david king - who have most influenced the prime minister 's thinking .
insiders argue that mr blair is more than capable of making his own mind up based on the available evidence and the nuclear industry also rejects the suggestion it is given special access to ministers and other decision-makers .
with the industry employing 40,000 people in the uk , nuclear has a right to make its voice heard in government , argues john mcnamara , of the nuclear industry association .
he adds : " it should not come as a surprise that we do as much as we can to represent the interests of our industry , like any other large industrial sector . "

the government has pledged to build 160,000 new homes by 2016 in the thames gateway , a 40-mile area between east london and parts of kent and essex .
the nao said ministers had yet to produce a coherent fully-costed plan for the multi-billion programme .
a government spokesman said the rate of house building was being accelerated .
' step change ' the nao 's report into the thames gateway programme said house building was not growing as fast as the rest of south-east england .
it said the number of homes delivered had risen from around 4,500 in 1995/96 to 6,000 in 2005/06 .
but it said building would have to more than double to about 12,500 homes a year if the 2016 target is to be met .
while an estimated £ 7bn of taxpayers ' money has been invested already in infrastructure , more money was still needed , it said .
the report also criticised ministers for failing to produce a fully-costed detailed plan for the project .
" the thames gateway is western europe 's most ambitious regeneration programme , " said the report .
" the legacy of the last 200 years has been one of relative decline in the thames estuary and east london . "
it said the government aspired to a " world-class region with unrivalled locations for working and living " .
but the nao warned a " step change " was needed to deliver " the high quality transport , housing , health , education , leisure and employment opportunities the region needs " .
the department for communities and local government said considerable investment has gone into the area .
a spokesman said : " while there are clearly areas where further activity is still needed , such as accelerating the rate of house building , much of this is already under way .
" progress has been made on delivering a cross-government co-ordination on investment and programme management . "

the government has pledged to build 160,000 new homes by 2016 in the thames gateway , a 40-mile area between east london and parts of kent and essex .
the nao said ministers had yet to produce a coherent fully-costed plan for the multi-billion programme .
a government spokesman said the rate of house building was being accelerated .
' step change ' the nao 's report into the thames gateway programme said house building was not growing as fast as the rest of south-east england .
it said the number of homes delivered had risen from around 4,500 in 1995/96 to 6,000 in 2005/06 .
but it said building would have to more than double to about 12,500 homes a year if the 2016 target is to be met .
while an estimated £ 7bn of taxpayers ' money has been invested already in infrastructure , more money was still needed , it said .
the report also criticised ministers for failing to produce a fully-costed detailed plan for the project .
" the thames gateway is western europe 's most ambitious regeneration programme , " said the report .
" the legacy of the last 200 years has been one of relative decline in the thames estuary and east london . "
it said the government aspired to a " world-class region with unrivalled locations for working and living " .
but the nao warned a " step change " was needed to deliver " the high quality transport , housing , health , education , leisure and employment opportunities the region needs " .
the department for communities and local government said considerable investment has gone into the area .
a spokesman said : " while there are clearly areas where further activity is still needed , such as accelerating the rate of house building , much of this is already under way .
" progress has been made on delivering a cross-government co-ordination on investment and programme management . "
