program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 21.10.2007 opposition party wins landslide in polish elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victory for tusk this time around poland 's liberal civic platform scored a landslide victory in parliamentary elections amid record turnout at the polls , ending the reign of the right-wing law and justice party of prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . the civic platform , or po , party was led by europe-friendly opposition leader donald tusk .
in a victory speech on sunday , oct .
21 , tusk thanked voters " who showed all of europe that in times of difficulty poles can take care of their country in an extraordinarily responsible fashion . " " we 'll do everything to make poland a good home for you , " he vowed , ending the emotional address by singing the polish national anthem along with hundreds of po party faithful gathered at a victory rally in warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski said there were lessons to be learned from the campaign in the wake of the crushing defeat for law and justice , or pis , prime minister kaczynski said : " i wish tusk success .
i congratulate him . " he vowed that pis would be a " hard and decisive opposition , " apparently ruling out any coalition with the archrival liberals .
meanwhile , the po is expected to team up with the peasants ' party to form an outright majority . based on early counts of some three-quarters of the votes , poland 's election commission said the business-friendly po took around 41 percent of the vote , which would give it around 205 of 460 parliamentary seats .
that would put it well past the pis , which took 32 percent of the vote , according to early voter surveys . the left-wing lid took 12 percent while the conservative polish peasants ' party -lrb- psl -rrb- scored 9 percent , exceeding the 5-percent threshold required to enter parliament .
no other party reached 5 percent .
overwhelming turnout turnout soared to around 55 percent , the highest result since poland 's first fully democratic parliamentary election in 1991 .
as a result , some election stations ran out of ballots , and others had to extend voting hours to accommodate the unexpectedly large numbers of voters .
the interest stood in stark contrast to the record low 40-percent turnout in poland 's last parliamentary ballot in september 2005 , which handed kaczynski 's pis a narrow 2.9-percent victory over the liberals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles turned out in force to cast their ballots sunday 's snap ballot came two years early due to the failure of kaczynski 's minority government to forge a stable majority coalition in poland .
more stability ?
once confirmed by poland 's state elections commission in official results , the po victory means political power in poland will cease to be concentrated in the hands of the kaczynski twins .
president lech kaczynski 's term in office ends in 2009 .
with a population of 38 million , poland was by far the largest of 10 mostly ex-communist states to have joined the european union in 2004 and has since become a key player in the 27-member bloc . " it was a battle .
we won .
but tomorrow we have to get to work , " tusk told his supporters during his victory speech at his party 's headquarters . president lech kaczynski made no comment on his twin brother 's defeat in parliament , which experts also saw as a vote against the reigning head of state . the election was closely watched by polands eu partners , especially germany , which has seen its relations to poland strained during the kaczynski brothers ' rule . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a victory speech on sunday , oct .
21 , tusk thanked voters " who showed all of europe that in times of difficulty poles can take care of their country in an extraordinarily responsible fashion . " " we 'll do everything to make poland a good home for you , " he vowed , ending the emotional address by singing the polish national anthem along with hundreds of po party faithful gathered at a victory rally in warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski said there were lessons to be learned from the campaign in the wake of the crushing defeat for law and justice , or pis , prime minister kaczynski said : " i wish tusk success .
i congratulate him . " he vowed that pis would be a " hard and decisive opposition , " apparently ruling out any coalition with the archrival liberals .
meanwhile , the po is expected to team up with the peasants ' party to form an outright majority . based on early counts of some three-quarters of the votes , poland 's election commission said the business-friendly po took around 41 percent of the vote , which would give it around 205 of 460 parliamentary seats .
that would put it well past the pis , which took 32 percent of the vote , according to early voter surveys . the left-wing lid took 12 percent while the conservative polish peasants ' party -lrb- psl -rrb- scored 9 percent , exceeding the 5-percent threshold required to enter parliament .
no other party reached 5 percent .
overwhelming turnout turnout soared to around 55 percent , the highest result since poland 's first fully democratic parliamentary election in 1991 .
as a result , some election stations ran out of ballots , and others had to extend voting hours to accommodate the unexpectedly large numbers of voters .
the interest stood in stark contrast to the record low 40-percent turnout in poland 's last parliamentary ballot in september 2005 , which handed kaczynski 's pis a narrow 2.9-percent victory over the liberals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles turned out in force to cast their ballots sunday 's snap ballot came two years early due to the failure of kaczynski 's minority government to forge a stable majority coalition in poland .
more stability ?
once confirmed by poland 's state elections commission in official results , the po victory means political power in poland will cease to be concentrated in the hands of the kaczynski twins .
president lech kaczynski 's term in office ends in 2009 .
with a population of 38 million , poland was by far the largest of 10 mostly ex-communist states to have joined the european union in 2004 and has since become a key player in the 27-member bloc . " it was a battle .
we won .
but tomorrow we have to get to work , " tusk told his supporters during his victory speech at his party 's headquarters . president lech kaczynski made no comment on his twin brother 's defeat in parliament , which experts also saw as a vote against the reigning head of state . the election was closely watched by polands eu partners , especially germany , which has seen its relations to poland strained during the kaczynski brothers ' rule . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fat-free sausage sounds like an oxymoron , but german food researchers and a butcher have come up with a recipe for it .
but the real question is how the beef and pork wieners taste . it looks like sausage .
it smells like sausage .
and it pretty much tastes like sausage . but instead of the usual 25 percent to 40 percent fat content of a regular sausage , butcher josef pointner 's wurst , which was developed with the fraunhofer institute , is only about 2 percent fat .
entirely fat-free would only be possible in a vegetarian sausage . it was pointner 's customers who gave him the idea for the new recipe , which is made with natural ingredients from pork and beef . " more and more customers like ms. huber and ms. meier came into the store and said that their husbands were n't allowed to eat pork or beef anymore , " the butcher said . real meat , more water bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors were n't ready to give the ok to low-fat wurst varieties low-fat varieties of sausage were already available , but even these contained 10 percent to 20 percent fat - which his customers ' doctors probably would n't have approved of .
those types with even less fat are typically made with poultry - a switch neither pointner nor his customers said they were willing to make . to bring the fat content down , pointner started by leaving out the bacon , rind and gristle and added water to the mixture instead of extra grease .
the only drawback to the high water content is that the sausage can dry out more easily than the fatty version when not refrigerated . " the first tries completely flopped , " said pointner .
" they were like chewing gum . " after a few more attempts , the results started tasting a bit less like gum and more like sausage .
the butcher called up the fraunhofer institute , a leading research organization in germany , to share the news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nearly fat-free sausage is no substitute for old-fashioned exercise pointner joined the institute in conducting further research and the team has since developed nearly fat-free recipes for a whole spectrum of german sausage varieties . a major german retailer will begin producing the new sausage in the next few weeks , said fraunhofer 's peter eisner . interest from abroad germany may be home to a disproportionately high number of sausage lovers , but the new product is also making waves abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 21.10.2007 common abortion policy remains out of reach in eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abortion issue divides europeans along religious and cultural lines an eu citizen denied an abortion in her own country can freely travel to a member state where it is legal .
but experts say an eu-wide policy that legalizes abortion throughout the bloc infringes on national sovereignty . eu leaders cinched a deal on the european reform treaty on thursday , oct .
18 , but only after overcoming vocal polish objections on voting rights .
one reason behind such obstinacy was the fear that poland in the future could be outvoted if the european union ever decided to make abortion legal throughout the 27 nation bloc . at present , each eu state has its own national laws , which vary considerably in detail with regard to the upper limit as to when a pregnancy can be terminated and under what circumstances an abortion can be permitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters greet dutch " abortion ship " entering polish waters only three of the eu 's 27 member states outlaw abortion : poland , ireland and malta .
in july , portugal legalized abortion up until the 10th week of pregnancy , bringing the overwhelmingly roman catholic country in line with most countries in the eu . poland was also the lone dissenter in the 46-member council of europe that did not sign a declaration against the death penalty as warsaw wanted the document to include condemnations of abortion and euthanasia . the eu 's open borders and guaranteed freedom of movement , however , permit women living in countries with restrictive policies or outright bans to travel abroad to receive an abortion - if they can afford the trip , according to paul bell , a spokesman for the international planned parenthood federation in london . " individual state bans only make access to abortion difficult for the poor , " bell said .
" if a woman can not afford to travel or take time off work , she 'll risk getting an illegal backstreet abortion at home .

one reason behind such obstinacy was the fear that poland in the future could be outvoted if the european union ever decided to make abortion legal throughout the 27 nation bloc . at present , each eu state has its own national laws , which vary considerably in detail with regard to the upper limit as to when a pregnancy can be terminated and under what circumstances an abortion can be permitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters greet dutch " abortion ship " entering polish waters only three of the eu 's 27 member states outlaw abortion : poland , ireland and malta .
in july , portugal legalized abortion up until the 10th week of pregnancy , bringing the overwhelmingly roman catholic country in line with most countries in the eu . poland was also the lone dissenter in the 46-member council of europe that did not sign a declaration against the death penalty as warsaw wanted the document to include condemnations of abortion and euthanasia . the eu 's open borders and guaranteed freedom of movement , however , permit women living in countries with restrictive policies or outright bans to travel abroad to receive an abortion - if they can afford the trip , according to paul bell , a spokesman for the international planned parenthood federation in london .

tysiac , a 36-year-old , disabled single mother of three who lives on a state pension , sought an abortion because her last pregnancy exacerbated a condition that could make her go blind .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 21.10.2007 voters end bitter election campaign in switzerland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss parliamentary election campaign descended into violent chaos recently polls closed in switzerland on sunday , oct .
21 , ending what may become known as the most acrimonious campaigning in swiss history .
accusations of racism in the far-right swiss people party were the focus of the campaign . votes were being counted after a relatively strong turnout estimated at about 50 percent of the 4.9 million voters . the last opinion poll by swiss television on oct .
10 indicated that the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- was set to win 27.3 percent of the vote , 0.6 percent more than its score in the 2003 election .
the left-of-center social democratic party -lrb- sp / ps -rrb- at 21.7 percent while the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp / pdc / ppd -rrb- and the radicals -lrb- fdp / prd -rrb- were neck and neck with 15.4 and 15.5 percent respectively .
the svp and its leader , justice minister christoph blocher , were intensely criticized for a campaigning stance focusing on immigration and crime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp 's black sheep campaign has lost it few voters despite being denounced by the un special rapporteur on racism for inciting racial hatred in its xenophobic campaigning and for pledging to deport non-national criminals , the svp has struck a chord with voters in a country where one in five people is foreign . attempts to label the party as extremist have also failed to derail the svp campaign .
its now notorious campaign poster of a black sheep being kicked out of a field by three white sheep caused outrage with politicians from the other parties but has done little to reduce its growing popularity . the svp campaign also seems to have benefited from the recent outbreak of violence in switzerland which , as one observer put it , replaced the " chocolates and cuckoos " image with one of smashed cars , crushed campaign stands and unflattering headlines in the foreign press about the threat to swiss democracy .
left-wing violence plays into svp 's hands it is widely assumed that the riots in berne on oct .
6 may have played directly into the svp 's hands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police fought protestors with tear gas and batons switzerland was shocked to see scenes of running battles on the streets of the swiss capital with police armed with tear gas fighting back left-wing radicals who disrupted a svp march .
there were 20 people injured , 18 of them officers as the rally in the federal square descended into baton charges under a hail of paving stones and bottles .
until then , the focus of the opposition parties had been on exposing the svp as an extremist organization , in contrast to its self-appointed position at the heart of family , cultural and national values in switzerland .
since the riots , the people 's party has been using the violence to garner further sympathy .
blocher , a millionaire businessman and the minister of justice in the cabinet , blamed the unrest on " the irresponsibility of a left-wing sowing chaos . "
president blames general intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss president calmy-rey called for dialogue and tolerance the swiss president micheline calmy-rey has refused to blame neither left nor right for the divisions and recriminations which have besmirched the campaign , choosing instead to blame everyone , saying the intolerance of the poster campaigns had now spilled onto the streets .
while the right and left wing parties wage their ideological battles away from the streets and back on the podium , the green party continues to make steady gains which , if the rate of their progress is sustained , could be instrumental in the formation of the government .
the greens - the most popular party not represented in the cabinet - could see the strongest gain in support on sunday .
the latest polls see them heading for 10 percent of the vote , up 2.6 percent on the 2003 election , with some observers also predicting that they could further increase that and force their way into government .
a strong green showing at the election may be enough to reduce the majority of the svp .
for that to happen , however , the svp would have to lose ground and while the people 's party stands to have less votes than it did in the 2003 election , it is unlikely that they will lose enough to stop them becoming the majority party in the swiss parliament . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 indicated that the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- was set to win 27.3 percent of the vote , 0.6 percent more than its score in the 2003 election .
the left-of-center social democratic party -lrb- sp / ps -rrb- at 21.7 percent while the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp / pdc / ppd -rrb- and the radicals -lrb- fdp / prd -rrb- were neck and neck with 15.4 and 15.5 percent respectively .
the svp and its leader , justice minister christoph blocher , were intensely criticized for a campaigning stance focusing on immigration and crime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp 's black sheep campaign has lost it few voters despite being denounced by the un special rapporteur on racism for inciting racial hatred in its xenophobic campaigning and for pledging to deport non-national criminals , the svp has struck a chord with voters in a country where one in five people is foreign . attempts to label the party as extremist have also failed to derail the svp campaign .
its now notorious campaign poster of a black sheep being kicked out of a field by three white sheep caused outrage with politicians from the other parties but has done little to reduce its growing popularity . the svp campaign also seems to have benefited from the recent outbreak of violence in switzerland which , as one observer put it , replaced the " chocolates and cuckoos " image with one of smashed cars , crushed campaign stands and unflattering headlines in the foreign press about the threat to swiss democracy .
left-wing violence plays into svp 's hands it is widely assumed that the riots in berne on oct .
6 may have played directly into the svp 's hands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police fought protestors with tear gas and batons switzerland was shocked to see scenes of running battles on the streets of the swiss capital with police armed with tear gas fighting back left-wing radicals who disrupted a svp march .
there were 20 people injured , 18 of them officers as the rally in the federal square descended into baton charges under a hail of paving stones and bottles .
until then , the focus of the opposition parties had been on exposing the svp as an extremist organization , in contrast to its self-appointed position at the heart of family , cultural and national values in switzerland .
since the riots , the people 's party has been using the violence to garner further sympathy .
blocher , a millionaire businessman and the minister of justice in the cabinet , blamed the unrest on " the irresponsibility of a left-wing sowing chaos . "
president blames general intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss president calmy-rey called for dialogue and tolerance the swiss president micheline calmy-rey has refused to blame neither left nor right for the divisions and recriminations which have besmirched the campaign , choosing instead to blame everyone , saying the intolerance of the poster campaigns had now spilled onto the streets .
while the right and left wing parties wage their ideological battles away from the streets and back on the podium , the green party continues to make steady gains which , if the rate of their progress is sustained , could be instrumental in the formation of the government .
the greens - the most popular party not represented in the cabinet - could see the strongest gain in support on sunday .
the latest polls see them heading for 10 percent of the vote , up 2.6 percent on the 2003 election , with some observers also predicting that they could further increase that and force their way into government .
a strong green showing at the election may be enough to reduce the majority of the svp .
for that to happen , however , the svp would have to lose ground and while the people 's party stands to have less votes than it did in the 2003 election , it is unlikely that they will lose enough to stop them becoming the majority party in the swiss parliament . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is the only big european soccer nation which takes this break .
the english premier league takes no time off and rather has a popular full round of action on boxing day .
there is only a short pause in italy and spain over the festive season .
the issue is on the agenda of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , but plans to scrap the break from 2009 onwards have so far not become reality .
a dfl spokesman said " a few parameters have changed " over the years .
changing parameters reopen discussions erwin staudt , the president of bundesliga champions vfb stuttgart , agreed a change of schedule was worth evaluating .
" this is no sacred cow , you can think about it , " staudt said in a survey by the german dpa news agency .

another is that icy pitches no longer exist because all german professional clubs have a heating system for the playing field .
cancellations these days only occur if the stands or stadium roofs ca n't be cleared from snow .
money is another factor as a bundesliga round on boxing day would generate big television audiences and advertising income .
those who favor the break say that players get a mid-season rest .
most clubs allow the players a fortnight off with their families over christmas and new year 's day , followed by a training camp in sunny and warm regions .

a longer summer break would be mandatory if hibernation is scrapped , but völler is probably not the only one who believes that there will never be a common agreement over the issue .

the winter break originated from poor pitch conditions which in the past led to cancellations of matches .
this season there will be no play between dec .
17 and jan .
31 .
germany is the only big european soccer nation which takes this break .
the english premier league takes no time off and rather has a popular full round of action on boxing day .
there is only a short pause in italy and spain over the festive season .
the issue is on the agenda of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , but plans to scrap the break from 2009 onwards have so far not become reality .
a dfl spokesman said " a few parameters have changed " over the years .
changing parameters reopen discussions erwin staudt , the president of bundesliga champions vfb stuttgart , agreed a change of schedule was worth evaluating .
" this is no sacred cow , you can think about it , " staudt said in a survey by the german dpa news agency .
the only consensus is that the weather no longer warrants the break .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pitches remain ice and snow-free with undersoil heating global warming with less snow is one aspect .
another is that icy pitches no longer exist because all german professional clubs have a heating system for the playing field .
cancellations these days only occur if the stands or stadium roofs ca n't be cleared from snow .
money is another factor as a bundesliga round on boxing day would generate big television audiences and advertising income .
those who favor the break say that players get a mid-season rest .
most clubs allow the players a fortnight off with their families over christmas and new year 's day , followed by a training camp in sunny and warm regions .
a break for rejuvenation is clever , say supporters " other countries say that the germans are clever because the players recuperate and get a breather in this period , " said former germany coach rudi völler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german players are spared games in the worst months sv hamburg coach huub stevens warned that " players will be in action all year if the break no longer exists , " but staudt pointed out that players in england appear to have no problems with this - and they have an even heavier overall match schedule .
a longer summer break would be mandatory if hibernation is scrapped , but völler is probably not the only one who believes that there will never be a common agreement over the issue .

21 , ending what may become known as the most acrimonious campaigning in swiss history .
accusations of racism in the far-right swiss people party were the focus of the campaign . votes were being counted after a relatively strong turnout estimated at about 50 percent of the 4.9 million voters . the last opinion poll by swiss television on oct .
10 indicated that the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- was set to win 27.3 percent of the vote , 0.6 percent more than its score in the 2003 election .
the left-of-center social democratic party -lrb- sp / ps -rrb- at 21.7 percent while the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp / pdc / ppd -rrb- and the radicals -lrb- fdp / prd -rrb- were neck and neck with 15.4 and 15.5 percent respectively .
the svp and its leader , justice minister christoph blocher , were intensely criticized for a campaigning stance focusing on immigration and crime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp 's black sheep campaign has lost it few voters despite being denounced by the un special rapporteur on racism for inciting racial hatred in its xenophobic campaigning and for pledging to deport non-national criminals , the svp has struck a chord with voters in a country where one in five people is foreign . attempts to label the party as extremist have also failed to derail the svp campaign .
its now notorious campaign poster of a black sheep being kicked out of a field by three white sheep caused outrage with politicians from the other parties but has done little to reduce its growing popularity . the svp campaign also seems to have benefited from the recent outbreak of violence in switzerland which , as one observer put it , replaced the " chocolates and cuckoos " image with one of smashed cars , crushed campaign stands and unflattering headlines in the foreign press about the threat to swiss democracy .
left-wing violence plays into svp 's hands it is widely assumed that the riots in berne on oct .
6 may have played directly into the svp 's hands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police fought protestors with tear gas and batons switzerland was shocked to see scenes of running battles on the streets of the swiss capital with police armed with tear gas fighting back left-wing radicals who disrupted a svp march .
there were 20 people injured , 18 of them officers as the rally in the federal square descended into baton charges under a hail of paving stones and bottles .
until then , the focus of the opposition parties had been on exposing the svp as an extremist organization , in contrast to its self-appointed position at the heart of family , cultural and national values in switzerland .
since the riots , the people 's party has been using the violence to garner further sympathy .
blocher , a millionaire businessman and the minister of justice in the cabinet , blamed the unrest on " the irresponsibility of a left-wing sowing chaos . "
president blames general intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss president calmy-rey called for dialogue and tolerance the swiss president micheline calmy-rey has refused to blame neither left nor right for the divisions and recriminations which have besmirched the campaign , choosing instead to blame everyone , saying the intolerance of the poster campaigns had now spilled onto the streets .
while the right and left wing parties wage their ideological battles away from the streets and back on the podium , the green party continues to make steady gains which , if the rate of their progress is sustained , could be instrumental in the formation of the government .
the greens - the most popular party not represented in the cabinet - could see the strongest gain in support on sunday .
the latest polls see them heading for 10 percent of the vote , up 2.6 percent on the 2003 election , with some observers also predicting that they could further increase that and force their way into government .
a strong green showing at the election may be enough to reduce the majority of the svp .
for that to happen , however , the svp would have to lose ground and while the people 's party stands to have less votes than it did in the 2003 election , it is unlikely that they will lose enough to stop them becoming the majority party in the swiss parliament . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a strong green showing at the election may be enough to reduce the majority of the svp .
for that to happen , however , the svp would have to lose ground and while the people 's party stands to have less votes than it did in the 2003 election , it is unlikely that they will lose enough to stop them becoming the majority party in the swiss parliament . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the winter break originated from poor pitch conditions which in the past led to cancellations of matches .
this season there will be no play between dec .
17 and jan .
31 .
germany is the only big european soccer nation which takes this break .
the english premier league takes no time off and rather has a popular full round of action on boxing day .
there is only a short pause in italy and spain over the festive season .
the issue is on the agenda of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , but plans to scrap the break from 2009 onwards have so far not become reality .
a dfl spokesman said " a few parameters have changed " over the years .
changing parameters reopen discussions erwin staudt , the president of bundesliga champions vfb stuttgart , agreed a change of schedule was worth evaluating .
" this is no sacred cow , you can think about it , " staudt said in a survey by the german dpa news agency .
the only consensus is that the weather no longer warrants the break .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pitches remain ice and snow-free with undersoil heating global warming with less snow is one aspect .
another is that icy pitches no longer exist because all german professional clubs have a heating system for the playing field .
cancellations these days only occur if the stands or stadium roofs ca n't be cleared from snow .
money is another factor as a bundesliga round on boxing day would generate big television audiences and advertising income .
those who favor the break say that players get a mid-season rest .
most clubs allow the players a fortnight off with their families over christmas and new year 's day , followed by a training camp in sunny and warm regions .
a break for rejuvenation is clever , say supporters " other countries say that the germans are clever because the players recuperate and get a breather in this period , " said former germany coach rudi völler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german players are spared games in the worst months sv hamburg coach huub stevens warned that " players will be in action all year if the break no longer exists , " but staudt pointed out that players in england appear to have no problems with this - and they have an even heavier overall match schedule .
a longer summer break would be mandatory if hibernation is scrapped , but völler is probably not the only one who believes that there will never be a common agreement over the issue .
" there is no absolute truth , no ideal solution , " said völler . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but experts say an eu-wide policy that legalizes abortion throughout the bloc infringes on national sovereignty . eu leaders cinched a deal on the european reform treaty on thursday , oct .
18 , but only after overcoming vocal polish objections on voting rights .
one reason behind such obstinacy was the fear that poland in the future could be outvoted if the european union ever decided to make abortion legal throughout the 27 nation bloc . at present , each eu state has its own national laws , which vary considerably in detail with regard to the upper limit as to when a pregnancy can be terminated and under what circumstances an abortion can be permitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters greet dutch " abortion ship " entering polish waters only three of the eu 's 27 member states outlaw abortion : poland , ireland and malta .
in july , portugal legalized abortion up until the 10th week of pregnancy , bringing the overwhelmingly roman catholic country in line with most countries in the eu . poland was also the lone dissenter in the 46-member council of europe that did not sign a declaration against the death penalty as warsaw wanted the document to include condemnations of abortion and euthanasia . the eu 's open borders and guaranteed freedom of movement , however , permit women living in countries with restrictive policies or outright bans to travel abroad to receive an abortion - if they can afford the trip , according to paul bell , a spokesman for the international planned parenthood federation in london . " individual state bans only make access to abortion difficult for the poor , " bell said .
" if a woman can not afford to travel or take time off work , she 'll risk getting an illegal backstreet abortion at home . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abortion became legal in portugal this year between 1980 and 2005 , there were 123,258 women who traveled from ireland to england for abortions , according to the safe and legal abortion rights campaign in ireland . the figures on cross-border abortions tend to be greatly understated , since it is optional for irish women to give out their addresses to abortion clinics in the uk and now with cheap flights to spain , there are alternatives to england , bell added . eu-wide policy infringes on national sovereignty while the ipcc has lobbied the european parliament to make abortion a legal right across the european union , some experts say an eu-wide policy would be undemocratic .

germany is the only big european soccer nation which takes this break .
the english premier league takes no time off and rather has a popular full round of action on boxing day .
there is only a short pause in italy and spain over the festive season .
the issue is on the agenda of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , but plans to scrap the break from 2009 onwards have so far not become reality .
a dfl spokesman said " a few parameters have changed " over the years .
changing parameters reopen discussions erwin staudt , the president of bundesliga champions vfb stuttgart , agreed a change of schedule was worth evaluating .
" this is no sacred cow , you can think about it , " staudt said in a survey by the german dpa news agency .
the only consensus is that the weather no longer warrants the break .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pitches remain ice and snow-free with undersoil heating global warming with less snow is one aspect .
another is that icy pitches no longer exist because all german professional clubs have a heating system for the playing field .
cancellations these days only occur if the stands or stadium roofs ca n't be cleared from snow .
money is another factor as a bundesliga round on boxing day would generate big television audiences and advertising income .
those who favor the break say that players get a mid-season rest .
most clubs allow the players a fortnight off with their families over christmas and new year 's day , followed by a training camp in sunny and warm regions .
a break for rejuvenation is clever , say supporters " other countries say that the germans are clever because the players recuperate and get a breather in this period , " said former germany coach rudi völler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german players are spared games in the worst months sv hamburg coach huub stevens warned that " players will be in action all year if the break no longer exists , " but staudt pointed out that players in england appear to have no problems with this - and they have an even heavier overall match schedule .
a longer summer break would be mandatory if hibernation is scrapped , but völler is probably not the only one who believes that there will never be a common agreement over the issue .
" there is no absolute truth , no ideal solution , " said völler . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a victory speech on sunday , oct .
21 , tusk thanked voters " who showed all of europe that in times of difficulty poles can take care of their country in an extraordinarily responsible fashion . " " we 'll do everything to make poland a good home for you , " he vowed , ending the emotional address by singing the polish national anthem along with hundreds of po party faithful gathered at a victory rally in warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski said there were lessons to be learned from the campaign in the wake of the crushing defeat for law and justice , or pis , prime minister kaczynski said : " i wish tusk success .
i congratulate him . " he vowed that pis would be a " hard and decisive opposition , " apparently ruling out any coalition with the archrival liberals .
meanwhile , the po is expected to team up with the peasants ' party to form an outright majority . based on early counts of some three-quarters of the votes , poland 's election commission said the business-friendly po took around 41 percent of the vote , which would give it around 205 of 460 parliamentary seats .
that would put it well past the pis , which took 32 percent of the vote , according to early voter surveys . the left-wing lid took 12 percent while the conservative polish peasants ' party -lrb- psl -rrb- scored 9 percent , exceeding the 5-percent threshold required to enter parliament .
no other party reached 5 percent .
overwhelming turnout turnout soared to around 55 percent , the highest result since poland 's first fully democratic parliamentary election in 1991 .
as a result , some election stations ran out of ballots , and others had to extend voting hours to accommodate the unexpectedly large numbers of voters .
the interest stood in stark contrast to the record low 40-percent turnout in poland 's last parliamentary ballot in september 2005 , which handed kaczynski 's pis a narrow 2.9-percent victory over the liberals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles turned out in force to cast their ballots sunday 's snap ballot came two years early due to the failure of kaczynski 's minority government to forge a stable majority coalition in poland .
more stability ?
once confirmed by poland 's state elections commission in official results , the po victory means political power in poland will cease to be concentrated in the hands of the kaczynski twins .
president lech kaczynski 's term in office ends in 2009 .
with a population of 38 million , poland was by far the largest of 10 mostly ex-communist states to have joined the european union in 2004 and has since become a key player in the 27-member bloc . " it was a battle .
we won .
but tomorrow we have to get to work , " tusk told his supporters during his victory speech at his party 's headquarters . president lech kaczynski made no comment on his twin brother 's defeat in parliament , which experts also saw as a vote against the reigning head of state . the election was closely watched by polands eu partners , especially germany , which has seen its relations to poland strained during the kaczynski brothers ' rule . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 21.10.2007 opposition party wins landslide in polish elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victory for tusk this time around poland 's liberal civic platform scored a landslide victory in parliamentary elections amid record turnout at the polls , ending the reign of the right-wing law and justice party of prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . the civic platform , or po , party was led by europe-friendly opposition leader donald tusk .
in a victory speech on sunday , oct .
21 , tusk thanked voters " who showed all of europe that in times of difficulty poles can take care of their country in an extraordinarily responsible fashion . " " we 'll do everything to make poland a good home for you , " he vowed , ending the emotional address by singing the polish national anthem along with hundreds of po party faithful gathered at a victory rally in warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski said there were lessons to be learned from the campaign in the wake of the crushing defeat for law and justice , or pis , prime minister kaczynski said : " i wish tusk success .
i congratulate him . " he vowed that pis would be a " hard and decisive opposition , " apparently ruling out any coalition with the archrival liberals .
meanwhile , the po is expected to team up with the peasants ' party to form an outright majority . based on early counts of some three-quarters of the votes , poland 's election commission said the business-friendly po took around 41 percent of the vote , which would give it around 205 of 460 parliamentary seats .
that would put it well past the pis , which took 32 percent of the vote , according to early voter surveys . the left-wing lid took 12 percent while the conservative polish peasants ' party -lrb- psl -rrb- scored 9 percent , exceeding the 5-percent threshold required to enter parliament .
no other party reached 5 percent .
overwhelming turnout turnout soared to around 55 percent , the highest result since poland 's first fully democratic parliamentary election in 1991 .
as a result , some election stations ran out of ballots , and others had to extend voting hours to accommodate the unexpectedly large numbers of voters .
the interest stood in stark contrast to the record low 40-percent turnout in poland 's last parliamentary ballot in september 2005 , which handed kaczynski 's pis a narrow 2.9-percent victory over the liberals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles turned out in force to cast their ballots sunday 's snap ballot came two years early due to the failure of kaczynski 's minority government to forge a stable majority coalition in poland .
more stability ?
once confirmed by poland 's state elections commission in official results , the po victory means political power in poland will cease to be concentrated in the hands of the kaczynski twins .
president lech kaczynski 's term in office ends in 2009 .
with a population of 38 million , poland was by far the largest of 10 mostly ex-communist states to have joined the european union in 2004 and has since become a key player in the 27-member bloc . " it was a battle .
we won .
but tomorrow we have to get to work , " tusk told his supporters during his victory speech at his party 's headquarters . president lech kaczynski made no comment on his twin brother 's defeat in parliament , which experts also saw as a vote against the reigning head of state . the election was closely watched by polands eu partners , especially germany , which has seen its relations to poland strained during the kaczynski brothers ' rule . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but experts say an eu-wide policy that legalizes abortion throughout the bloc infringes on national sovereignty . eu leaders cinched a deal on the european reform treaty on thursday , oct .
18 , but only after overcoming vocal polish objections on voting rights .
one reason behind such obstinacy was the fear that poland in the future could be outvoted if the european union ever decided to make abortion legal throughout the 27 nation bloc . at present , each eu state has its own national laws , which vary considerably in detail with regard to the upper limit as to when a pregnancy can be terminated and under what circumstances an abortion can be permitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters greet dutch " abortion ship " entering polish waters only three of the eu 's 27 member states outlaw abortion : poland , ireland and malta .
in july , portugal legalized abortion up until the 10th week of pregnancy , bringing the overwhelmingly roman catholic country in line with most countries in the eu . poland was also the lone dissenter in the 46-member council of europe that did not sign a declaration against the death penalty as warsaw wanted the document to include condemnations of abortion and euthanasia . the eu 's open borders and guaranteed freedom of movement , however , permit women living in countries with restrictive policies or outright bans to travel abroad to receive an abortion - if they can afford the trip , according to paul bell , a spokesman for the international planned parenthood federation in london . " individual state bans only make access to abortion difficult for the poor , " bell said .
" if a woman can not afford to travel or take time off work , she 'll risk getting an illegal backstreet abortion at home . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abortion became legal in portugal this year between 1980 and 2005 , there were 123,258 women who traveled from ireland to england for abortions , according to the safe and legal abortion rights campaign in ireland . the figures on cross-border abortions tend to be greatly understated , since it is optional for irish women to give out their addresses to abortion clinics in the uk and now with cheap flights to spain , there are alternatives to england , bell added . eu-wide policy infringes on national sovereignty while the ipcc has lobbied the european parliament to make abortion a legal right across the european union , some experts say an eu-wide policy would be undemocratic . " the eu could never achieve a consensus when it comes to controversial policies such as abortion .
harmonizing such national laws only serves to antagonize the public towards the eu , " said maciej golubiewski , a policy expert on eu matters at the sobieski institute , a conservative think tank in warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no eu law can influence irelands 's ban on abortion " national sovereignty is the cornerstone of democracy and our political leadership needs to be responsive to what people want , " he said , adding that the existing polish laws on abortion , which are highly restrictive by eu standards , has very broad support among mainstream political parties to both the right and left . hugo brady , an eu justice expert at the london-based centre for european reform , who said he is generally in favor of european integration added that debates about abortion belong to national legislatures . golubiewski pointed out that poland makes exceptions for therapeutic and non-elective abortions .
earlier this year , the european court of human rights awarded 25,000 euros -lrb- us $ 35,691 -rrb- in damages to alicia tysiac , who sued the polish government for being denied an abortion in 2000 .
tysiac , a 36-year-old , disabled single mother of three who lives on a state pension , sought an abortion because her last pregnancy exacerbated a condition that could make her go blind .
since poland permits abortion for medical reasons , the strasbourg court ruled that the country had violated its own laws . ippf had hailed the case as a victory for abortion rights in the eu , but brady said the eu simply does not have the judicial powers to change national practices .

the winter break originated from poor pitch conditions which in the past led to cancellations of matches .
this season there will be no play between dec .
17 and jan .
31 .
germany is the only big european soccer nation which takes this break .
the english premier league takes no time off and rather has a popular full round of action on boxing day .
there is only a short pause in italy and spain over the festive season .
the issue is on the agenda of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , but plans to scrap the break from 2009 onwards have so far not become reality .
a dfl spokesman said " a few parameters have changed " over the years .
changing parameters reopen discussions erwin staudt , the president of bundesliga champions vfb stuttgart , agreed a change of schedule was worth evaluating .
" this is no sacred cow , you can think about it , " staudt said in a survey by the german dpa news agency .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pitches remain ice and snow-free with undersoil heating global warming with less snow is one aspect .
another is that icy pitches no longer exist because all german professional clubs have a heating system for the playing field .
cancellations these days only occur if the stands or stadium roofs ca n't be cleared from snow .
money is another factor as a bundesliga round on boxing day would generate big television audiences and advertising income .
those who favor the break say that players get a mid-season rest .
most clubs allow the players a fortnight off with their families over christmas and new year 's day , followed by a training camp in sunny and warm regions .
a break for rejuvenation is clever , say supporters " other countries say that the germans are clever because the players recuperate and get a breather in this period , " said former germany coach rudi völler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german players are spared games in the worst months sv hamburg coach huub stevens warned that " players will be in action all year if the break no longer exists , " but staudt pointed out that players in england appear to have no problems with this - and they have an even heavier overall match schedule .
a longer summer break would be mandatory if hibernation is scrapped , but völler is probably not the only one who believes that there will never be a common agreement over the issue .

21 , voted in favor of directly electing the country 's president .
the results , however , were overshadowed by kurdish rebel attacks that killed at least 12 turkish soldiers . an ambush by kurdish rebels was responsible for 17 turkish soldiers ' deaths sunday .
at least 32 kurds are reported to have been killed in the clashes .
prime minister tayyip erdogan called a crisis meeting to consider a military strike against rebel bases in iraq . the attack , one of the worst in more than a decade by rebels of the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , came four days after turkey 's parliament approved a motion to allow troops to enter northern iraq to fight guerrillas hiding there . " we are very angry , " erdogan told reporters .
" our parliament has granted us the authority to act and within this framework we will do whatever has to be done . " cross-border military plans exist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the military has plans for operations in iraq , they wo n't be moving in immediately contrary to pkk claims of capturing several turkish soldiers , turkey 's defense minister vecdi gonul said no hostages were being held by kurdish rebels in northern iraq . " there are no hostages , " gonul told the press after meeting in the ukrainian capital with us defense secretary robert gates . gonul also said ankara had plans to cross the border into iraq but would not do so immediately .
the united states , european union , nato and iraq have all called on turkey not to conduct military actions in iraq out of fear they could destabilize the most peaceful part of iraq . considered a terrorist organization by ankara , the pkk on sunday claimed to have captured a group of turkish soldiers in the volatile region on the turkey-iraq border following heavy clashes between the two sides . " we can not expect turkey to remain silent in the face of attacks like these , " murat yetkin , a commentator for the liberal radikal daily told n-tv television .
" this attack , coming on a day when turkey votes in a referendum , is a very clear provocation .
it shows the pkk is not interested in democratic initiatives . " next president elected by popular vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey will elect its next president by popular vote seventy percent of turks who voted in a referendum sunday said " yes " to constitutional reforms that would make it possible to elect the country 's president by popular vote , with two-thirds of the ballots counted , the high electoral board said . the direct election proposal comes from the governing islamic conservative akp party .
several opposition parties had criticized the plans or called on voters to boycott the referendum .
according to turkish media reports , voting was light in some places . the government has been urging a direct election of the president by the people after initially failing to get foreign minister abdullah gül elected president by the parliament . gül has in the interim finally been elected by the parliament and began his seven-year term in august . a proposed change in the constitution would also reduce the presidential term to five years . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , ending what may become known as the most acrimonious campaigning in swiss history .
accusations of racism in the far-right swiss people party were the focus of the campaign . votes were being counted after a relatively strong turnout estimated at about 50 percent of the 4.9 million voters . the last opinion poll by swiss television on oct .
10 indicated that the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- was set to win 27.3 percent of the vote , 0.6 percent more than its score in the 2003 election .
the left-of-center social democratic party -lrb- sp / ps -rrb- at 21.7 percent while the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp / pdc / ppd -rrb- and the radicals -lrb- fdp / prd -rrb- were neck and neck with 15.4 and 15.5 percent respectively .
the svp and its leader , justice minister christoph blocher , were intensely criticized for a campaigning stance focusing on immigration and crime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp 's black sheep campaign has lost it few voters despite being denounced by the un special rapporteur on racism for inciting racial hatred in its xenophobic campaigning and for pledging to deport non-national criminals , the svp has struck a chord with voters in a country where one in five people is foreign . attempts to label the party as extremist have also failed to derail the svp campaign .
its now notorious campaign poster of a black sheep being kicked out of a field by three white sheep caused outrage with politicians from the other parties but has done little to reduce its growing popularity . the svp campaign also seems to have benefited from the recent outbreak of violence in switzerland which , as one observer put it , replaced the " chocolates and cuckoos " image with one of smashed cars , crushed campaign stands and unflattering headlines in the foreign press about the threat to swiss democracy .
left-wing violence plays into svp 's hands it is widely assumed that the riots in berne on oct .
6 may have played directly into the svp 's hands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police fought protestors with tear gas and batons switzerland was shocked to see scenes of running battles on the streets of the swiss capital with police armed with tear gas fighting back left-wing radicals who disrupted a svp march .
there were 20 people injured , 18 of them officers as the rally in the federal square descended into baton charges under a hail of paving stones and bottles .
until then , the focus of the opposition parties had been on exposing the svp as an extremist organization , in contrast to its self-appointed position at the heart of family , cultural and national values in switzerland .
since the riots , the people 's party has been using the violence to garner further sympathy .
blocher , a millionaire businessman and the minister of justice in the cabinet , blamed the unrest on " the irresponsibility of a left-wing sowing chaos . "
president blames general intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss president calmy-rey called for dialogue and tolerance the swiss president micheline calmy-rey has refused to blame neither left nor right for the divisions and recriminations which have besmirched the campaign , choosing instead to blame everyone , saying the intolerance of the poster campaigns had now spilled onto the streets .
while the right and left wing parties wage their ideological battles away from the streets and back on the podium , the green party continues to make steady gains which , if the rate of their progress is sustained , could be instrumental in the formation of the government .
the greens - the most popular party not represented in the cabinet - could see the strongest gain in support on sunday .
the latest polls see them heading for 10 percent of the vote , up 2.6 percent on the 2003 election , with some observers also predicting that they could further increase that and force their way into government .
a strong green showing at the election may be enough to reduce the majority of the svp .
for that to happen , however , the svp would have to lose ground and while the people 's party stands to have less votes than it did in the 2003 election , it is unlikely that they will lose enough to stop them becoming the majority party in the swiss parliament . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 21.10.2007 german butcher develops nearly fat-free sausage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is wurst without fat still wurst ?
fat-free sausage sounds like an oxymoron , but german food researchers and a butcher have come up with a recipe for it .
but the real question is how the beef and pork wieners taste . it looks like sausage .
it smells like sausage .
and it pretty much tastes like sausage . but instead of the usual 25 percent to 40 percent fat content of a regular sausage , butcher josef pointner 's wurst , which was developed with the fraunhofer institute , is only about 2 percent fat .
entirely fat-free would only be possible in a vegetarian sausage . it was pointner 's customers who gave him the idea for the new recipe , which is made with natural ingredients from pork and beef . " more and more customers like ms. huber and ms. meier came into the store and said that their husbands were n't allowed to eat pork or beef anymore , " the butcher said . real meat , more water bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors were n't ready to give the ok to low-fat wurst varieties low-fat varieties of sausage were already available , but even these contained 10 percent to 20 percent fat - which his customers ' doctors probably would n't have approved of .
those types with even less fat are typically made with poultry - a switch neither pointner nor his customers said they were willing to make . to bring the fat content down , pointner started by leaving out the bacon , rind and gristle and added water to the mixture instead of extra grease .
the only drawback to the high water content is that the sausage can dry out more easily than the fatty version when not refrigerated . " the first tries completely flopped , " said pointner .
" they were like chewing gum . " after a few more attempts , the results started tasting a bit less like gum and more like sausage .
the butcher called up the fraunhofer institute , a leading research organization in germany , to share the news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nearly fat-free sausage is no substitute for old-fashioned exercise pointner joined the institute in conducting further research and the team has since developed nearly fat-free recipes for a whole spectrum of german sausage varieties . a major german retailer will begin producing the new sausage in the next few weeks , said fraunhofer 's peter eisner . interest from abroad germany may be home to a disproportionately high number of sausage lovers , but the new product is also making waves abroad . " we 're currently talking with a russian company about starting a factory in moscow , " eisner said .
a partner in beijing wants to offer the wurst in international hotels , and interest has come from the us , latin america and other parts of europe as well . marcus bösch -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the results , however , were overshadowed by kurdish rebel attacks that killed at least 12 turkish soldiers . an ambush by kurdish rebels was responsible for 17 turkish soldiers ' deaths sunday .
at least 32 kurds are reported to have been killed in the clashes .
prime minister tayyip erdogan called a crisis meeting to consider a military strike against rebel bases in iraq . the attack , one of the worst in more than a decade by rebels of the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , came four days after turkey 's parliament approved a motion to allow troops to enter northern iraq to fight guerrillas hiding there .

" there are no hostages , " gonul told the press after meeting in the ukrainian capital with us defense secretary robert gates . gonul also said ankara had plans to cross the border into iraq but would not do so immediately .
the united states , european union , nato and iraq have all called on turkey not to conduct military actions in iraq out of fear they could destabilize the most peaceful part of iraq . considered a terrorist organization by ankara , the pkk on sunday claimed to have captured a group of turkish soldiers in the volatile region on the turkey-iraq border following heavy clashes between the two sides .

the winter break originated from poor pitch conditions which in the past led to cancellations of matches .
this season there will be no play between dec .

germany is the only big european soccer nation which takes this break .
the english premier league takes no time off and rather has a popular full round of action on boxing day .
there is only a short pause in italy and spain over the festive season .
the issue is on the agenda of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , but plans to scrap the break from 2009 onwards have so far not become reality .
a dfl spokesman said " a few parameters have changed " over the years .
changing parameters reopen discussions erwin staudt , the president of bundesliga champions vfb stuttgart , agreed a change of schedule was worth evaluating .
" this is no sacred cow , you can think about it , " staudt said in a survey by the german dpa news agency .

another is that icy pitches no longer exist because all german professional clubs have a heating system for the playing field .
cancellations these days only occur if the stands or stadium roofs ca n't be cleared from snow .
money is another factor as a bundesliga round on boxing day would generate big television audiences and advertising income .
those who favor the break say that players get a mid-season rest .
most clubs allow the players a fortnight off with their families over christmas and new year 's day , followed by a training camp in sunny and warm regions .
a break for rejuvenation is clever , say supporters " other countries say that the germans are clever because the players recuperate and get a breather in this period , " said former germany coach rudi völler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german players are spared games in the worst months sv hamburg coach huub stevens warned that " players will be in action all year if the break no longer exists , " but staudt pointed out that players in england appear to have no problems with this - and they have an even heavier overall match schedule .
a longer summer break would be mandatory if hibernation is scrapped , but völler is probably not the only one who believes that there will never be a common agreement over the issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 21.10.2007 common abortion policy remains out of reach in eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abortion issue divides europeans along religious and cultural lines an eu citizen denied an abortion in her own country can freely travel to a member state where it is legal .
but experts say an eu-wide policy that legalizes abortion throughout the bloc infringes on national sovereignty . eu leaders cinched a deal on the european reform treaty on thursday , oct .
18 , but only after overcoming vocal polish objections on voting rights .
one reason behind such obstinacy was the fear that poland in the future could be outvoted if the european union ever decided to make abortion legal throughout the 27 nation bloc . at present , each eu state has its own national laws , which vary considerably in detail with regard to the upper limit as to when a pregnancy can be terminated and under what circumstances an abortion can be permitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters greet dutch " abortion ship " entering polish waters only three of the eu 's 27 member states outlaw abortion : poland , ireland and malta .
in july , portugal legalized abortion up until the 10th week of pregnancy , bringing the overwhelmingly roman catholic country in line with most countries in the eu . poland was also the lone dissenter in the 46-member council of europe that did not sign a declaration against the death penalty as warsaw wanted the document to include condemnations of abortion and euthanasia . the eu 's open borders and guaranteed freedom of movement , however , permit women living in countries with restrictive policies or outright bans to travel abroad to receive an abortion - if they can afford the trip , according to paul bell , a spokesman for the international planned parenthood federation in london . " individual state bans only make access to abortion difficult for the poor , " bell said .
" if a woman can not afford to travel or take time off work , she 'll risk getting an illegal backstreet abortion at home . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abortion became legal in portugal this year between 1980 and 2005 , there were 123,258 women who traveled from ireland to england for abortions , according to the safe and legal abortion rights campaign in ireland . the figures on cross-border abortions tend to be greatly understated , since it is optional for irish women to give out their addresses to abortion clinics in the uk and now with cheap flights to spain , there are alternatives to england , bell added . eu-wide policy infringes on national sovereignty while the ipcc has lobbied the european parliament to make abortion a legal right across the european union , some experts say an eu-wide policy would be undemocratic . " the eu could never achieve a consensus when it comes to controversial policies such as abortion .
harmonizing such national laws only serves to antagonize the public towards the eu , " said maciej golubiewski , a policy expert on eu matters at the sobieski institute , a conservative think tank in warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no eu law can influence irelands 's ban on abortion " national sovereignty is the cornerstone of democracy and our political leadership needs to be responsive to what people want , " he said , adding that the existing polish laws on abortion , which are highly restrictive by eu standards , has very broad support among mainstream political parties to both the right and left . hugo brady , an eu justice expert at the london-based centre for european reform , who said he is generally in favor of european integration added that debates about abortion belong to national legislatures . golubiewski pointed out that poland makes exceptions for therapeutic and non-elective abortions .
earlier this year , the european court of human rights awarded 25,000 euros -lrb- us $ 35,691 -rrb- in damages to alicia tysiac , who sued the polish government for being denied an abortion in 2000 .
tysiac , a 36-year-old , disabled single mother of three who lives on a state pension , sought an abortion because her last pregnancy exacerbated a condition that could make her go blind .
since poland permits abortion for medical reasons , the strasbourg court ruled that the country had violated its own laws . ippf had hailed the case as a victory for abortion rights in the eu , but brady said the eu simply does not have the judicial powers to change national practices . " in europe , there is a reluctance to interfere in emotional debates anyway , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german players are spared games in the worst months sv hamburg coach huub stevens warned that " players will be in action all year if the break no longer exists , " but staudt pointed out that players in england appear to have no problems with this - and they have an even heavier overall match schedule .
a longer summer break would be mandatory if hibernation is scrapped , but völler is probably not the only one who believes that there will never be a common agreement over the issue .
" there is no absolute truth , no ideal solution , " said völler . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a victory speech on sunday , oct .
21 , tusk thanked voters " who showed all of europe that in times of difficulty poles can take care of their country in an extraordinarily responsible fashion . " " we 'll do everything to make poland a good home for you , " he vowed , ending the emotional address by singing the polish national anthem along with hundreds of po party faithful gathered at a victory rally in warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski said there were lessons to be learned from the campaign in the wake of the crushing defeat for law and justice , or pis , prime minister kaczynski said : " i wish tusk success .
i congratulate him . " he vowed that pis would be a " hard and decisive opposition , " apparently ruling out any coalition with the archrival liberals .
meanwhile , the po is expected to team up with the peasants ' party to form an outright majority . based on early counts of some three-quarters of the votes , poland 's election commission said the business-friendly po took around 41 percent of the vote , which would give it around 205 of 460 parliamentary seats .
that would put it well past the pis , which took 32 percent of the vote , according to early voter surveys . the left-wing lid took 12 percent while the conservative polish peasants ' party -lrb- psl -rrb- scored 9 percent , exceeding the 5-percent threshold required to enter parliament .
no other party reached 5 percent .
overwhelming turnout turnout soared to around 55 percent , the highest result since poland 's first fully democratic parliamentary election in 1991 .
as a result , some election stations ran out of ballots , and others had to extend voting hours to accommodate the unexpectedly large numbers of voters .
the interest stood in stark contrast to the record low 40-percent turnout in poland 's last parliamentary ballot in september 2005 , which handed kaczynski 's pis a narrow 2.9-percent victory over the liberals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles turned out in force to cast their ballots sunday 's snap ballot came two years early due to the failure of kaczynski 's minority government to forge a stable majority coalition in poland .
more stability ?
once confirmed by poland 's state elections commission in official results , the po victory means political power in poland will cease to be concentrated in the hands of the kaczynski twins .
president lech kaczynski 's term in office ends in 2009 .
with a population of 38 million , poland was by far the largest of 10 mostly ex-communist states to have joined the european union in 2004 and has since become a key player in the 27-member bloc . " it was a battle .
we won .
but tomorrow we have to get to work , " tusk told his supporters during his victory speech at his party 's headquarters . president lech kaczynski made no comment on his twin brother 's defeat in parliament , which experts also saw as a vote against the reigning head of state . the election was closely watched by polands eu partners , especially germany , which has seen its relations to poland strained during the kaczynski brothers ' rule . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fat-free sausage sounds like an oxymoron , but german food researchers and a butcher have come up with a recipe for it .
but the real question is how the beef and pork wieners taste . it looks like sausage .
it smells like sausage .
and it pretty much tastes like sausage . but instead of the usual 25 percent to 40 percent fat content of a regular sausage , butcher josef pointner 's wurst , which was developed with the fraunhofer institute , is only about 2 percent fat .
entirely fat-free would only be possible in a vegetarian sausage . it was pointner 's customers who gave him the idea for the new recipe , which is made with natural ingredients from pork and beef . " more and more customers like ms. huber and ms. meier came into the store and said that their husbands were n't allowed to eat pork or beef anymore , " the butcher said . real meat , more water bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors were n't ready to give the ok to low-fat wurst varieties low-fat varieties of sausage were already available , but even these contained 10 percent to 20 percent fat - which his customers ' doctors probably would n't have approved of .
those types with even less fat are typically made with poultry - a switch neither pointner nor his customers said they were willing to make . to bring the fat content down , pointner started by leaving out the bacon , rind and gristle and added water to the mixture instead of extra grease .
the only drawback to the high water content is that the sausage can dry out more easily than the fatty version when not refrigerated . " the first tries completely flopped , " said pointner .
" they were like chewing gum . " after a few more attempts , the results started tasting a bit less like gum and more like sausage .
the butcher called up the fraunhofer institute , a leading research organization in germany , to share the news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nearly fat-free sausage is no substitute for old-fashioned exercise pointner joined the institute in conducting further research and the team has since developed nearly fat-free recipes for a whole spectrum of german sausage varieties . a major german retailer will begin producing the new sausage in the next few weeks , said fraunhofer 's peter eisner . interest from abroad germany may be home to a disproportionately high number of sausage lovers , but the new product is also making waves abroad . " we 're currently talking with a russian company about starting a factory in moscow , " eisner said .

those types with even less fat are typically made with poultry - a switch neither pointner nor his customers said they were willing to make . to bring the fat content down , pointner started by leaving out the bacon , rind and gristle and added water to the mixture instead of extra grease .
the only drawback to the high water content is that the sausage can dry out more easily than the fatty version when not refrigerated . " the first tries completely flopped , " said pointner .
" they were like chewing gum . " after a few more attempts , the results started tasting a bit less like gum and more like sausage .
the butcher called up the fraunhofer institute , a leading research organization in germany , to share the news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nearly fat-free sausage is no substitute for old-fashioned exercise pointner joined the institute in conducting further research and the team has since developed nearly fat-free recipes for a whole spectrum of german sausage varieties . a major german retailer will begin producing the new sausage in the next few weeks , said fraunhofer 's peter eisner . interest from abroad germany may be home to a disproportionately high number of sausage lovers , but the new product is also making waves abroad . " we 're currently talking with a russian company about starting a factory in moscow , " eisner said .

21 , ending what may become known as the most acrimonious campaigning in swiss history .
accusations of racism in the far-right swiss people party were the focus of the campaign . votes were being counted after a relatively strong turnout estimated at about 50 percent of the 4.9 million voters . the last opinion poll by swiss television on oct .
10 indicated that the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- was set to win 27.3 percent of the vote , 0.6 percent more than its score in the 2003 election .
the left-of-center social democratic party -lrb- sp / ps -rrb- at 21.7 percent while the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp / pdc / ppd -rrb- and the radicals -lrb- fdp / prd -rrb- were neck and neck with 15.4 and 15.5 percent respectively .
the svp and its leader , justice minister christoph blocher , were intensely criticized for a campaigning stance focusing on immigration and crime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp 's black sheep campaign has lost it few voters despite being denounced by the un special rapporteur on racism for inciting racial hatred in its xenophobic campaigning and for pledging to deport non-national criminals , the svp has struck a chord with voters in a country where one in five people is foreign . attempts to label the party as extremist have also failed to derail the svp campaign .
its now notorious campaign poster of a black sheep being kicked out of a field by three white sheep caused outrage with politicians from the other parties but has done little to reduce its growing popularity . the svp campaign also seems to have benefited from the recent outbreak of violence in switzerland which , as one observer put it , replaced the " chocolates and cuckoos " image with one of smashed cars , crushed campaign stands and unflattering headlines in the foreign press about the threat to swiss democracy .
left-wing violence plays into svp 's hands it is widely assumed that the riots in berne on oct .
6 may have played directly into the svp 's hands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police fought protestors with tear gas and batons switzerland was shocked to see scenes of running battles on the streets of the swiss capital with police armed with tear gas fighting back left-wing radicals who disrupted a svp march .
there were 20 people injured , 18 of them officers as the rally in the federal square descended into baton charges under a hail of paving stones and bottles .
until then , the focus of the opposition parties had been on exposing the svp as an extremist organization , in contrast to its self-appointed position at the heart of family , cultural and national values in switzerland .
since the riots , the people 's party has been using the violence to garner further sympathy .
blocher , a millionaire businessman and the minister of justice in the cabinet , blamed the unrest on " the irresponsibility of a left-wing sowing chaos . "
president blames general intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss president calmy-rey called for dialogue and tolerance the swiss president micheline calmy-rey has refused to blame neither left nor right for the divisions and recriminations which have besmirched the campaign , choosing instead to blame everyone , saying the intolerance of the poster campaigns had now spilled onto the streets .
while the right and left wing parties wage their ideological battles away from the streets and back on the podium , the green party continues to make steady gains which , if the rate of their progress is sustained , could be instrumental in the formation of the government .
the greens - the most popular party not represented in the cabinet - could see the strongest gain in support on sunday .
the latest polls see them heading for 10 percent of the vote , up 2.6 percent on the 2003 election , with some observers also predicting that they could further increase that and force their way into government .
a strong green showing at the election may be enough to reduce the majority of the svp .
for that to happen , however , the svp would have to lose ground and while the people 's party stands to have less votes than it did in the 2003 election , it is unlikely that they will lose enough to stop them becoming the majority party in the swiss parliament . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one reason behind such obstinacy was the fear that poland in the future could be outvoted if the european union ever decided to make abortion legal throughout the 27 nation bloc . at present , each eu state has its own national laws , which vary considerably in detail with regard to the upper limit as to when a pregnancy can be terminated and under what circumstances an abortion can be permitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters greet dutch " abortion ship " entering polish waters only three of the eu 's 27 member states outlaw abortion : poland , ireland and malta .

" the eu could never achieve a consensus when it comes to controversial policies such as abortion .

the winter break originated from poor pitch conditions which in the past led to cancellations of matches .
this season there will be no play between dec .
17 and jan .
31 .
germany is the only big european soccer nation which takes this break .
the english premier league takes no time off and rather has a popular full round of action on boxing day .
there is only a short pause in italy and spain over the festive season .
the issue is on the agenda of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , but plans to scrap the break from 2009 onwards have so far not become reality .
a dfl spokesman said " a few parameters have changed " over the years .
changing parameters reopen discussions erwin staudt , the president of bundesliga champions vfb stuttgart , agreed a change of schedule was worth evaluating .
" this is no sacred cow , you can think about it , " staudt said in a survey by the german dpa news agency .
the only consensus is that the weather no longer warrants the break .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pitches remain ice and snow-free with undersoil heating global warming with less snow is one aspect .
another is that icy pitches no longer exist because all german professional clubs have a heating system for the playing field .
cancellations these days only occur if the stands or stadium roofs ca n't be cleared from snow .
money is another factor as a bundesliga round on boxing day would generate big television audiences and advertising income .
those who favor the break say that players get a mid-season rest .
most clubs allow the players a fortnight off with their families over christmas and new year 's day , followed by a training camp in sunny and warm regions .
a break for rejuvenation is clever , say supporters " other countries say that the germans are clever because the players recuperate and get a breather in this period , " said former germany coach rudi völler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german players are spared games in the worst months sv hamburg coach huub stevens warned that " players will be in action all year if the break no longer exists , " but staudt pointed out that players in england appear to have no problems with this - and they have an even heavier overall match schedule .
a longer summer break would be mandatory if hibernation is scrapped , but völler is probably not the only one who believes that there will never be a common agreement over the issue .
" there is no absolute truth , no ideal solution , " said völler . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 21.10.2007 voters end bitter election campaign in switzerland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss parliamentary election campaign descended into violent chaos recently polls closed in switzerland on sunday , oct .
21 , ending what may become known as the most acrimonious campaigning in swiss history .
accusations of racism in the far-right swiss people party were the focus of the campaign . votes were being counted after a relatively strong turnout estimated at about 50 percent of the 4.9 million voters . the last opinion poll by swiss television on oct .
10 indicated that the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- was set to win 27.3 percent of the vote , 0.6 percent more than its score in the 2003 election .
the left-of-center social democratic party -lrb- sp / ps -rrb- at 21.7 percent while the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp / pdc / ppd -rrb- and the radicals -lrb- fdp / prd -rrb- were neck and neck with 15.4 and 15.5 percent respectively .
the svp and its leader , justice minister christoph blocher , were intensely criticized for a campaigning stance focusing on immigration and crime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp 's black sheep campaign has lost it few voters despite being denounced by the un special rapporteur on racism for inciting racial hatred in its xenophobic campaigning and for pledging to deport non-national criminals , the svp has struck a chord with voters in a country where one in five people is foreign . attempts to label the party as extremist have also failed to derail the svp campaign .
its now notorious campaign poster of a black sheep being kicked out of a field by three white sheep caused outrage with politicians from the other parties but has done little to reduce its growing popularity . the svp campaign also seems to have benefited from the recent outbreak of violence in switzerland which , as one observer put it , replaced the " chocolates and cuckoos " image with one of smashed cars , crushed campaign stands and unflattering headlines in the foreign press about the threat to swiss democracy .
left-wing violence plays into svp 's hands it is widely assumed that the riots in berne on oct .
6 may have played directly into the svp 's hands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police fought protestors with tear gas and batons switzerland was shocked to see scenes of running battles on the streets of the swiss capital with police armed with tear gas fighting back left-wing radicals who disrupted a svp march .
there were 20 people injured , 18 of them officers as the rally in the federal square descended into baton charges under a hail of paving stones and bottles .
until then , the focus of the opposition parties had been on exposing the svp as an extremist organization , in contrast to its self-appointed position at the heart of family , cultural and national values in switzerland .
since the riots , the people 's party has been using the violence to garner further sympathy .
blocher , a millionaire businessman and the minister of justice in the cabinet , blamed the unrest on " the irresponsibility of a left-wing sowing chaos . "
president blames general intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss president calmy-rey called for dialogue and tolerance the swiss president micheline calmy-rey has refused to blame neither left nor right for the divisions and recriminations which have besmirched the campaign , choosing instead to blame everyone , saying the intolerance of the poster campaigns had now spilled onto the streets .
while the right and left wing parties wage their ideological battles away from the streets and back on the podium , the green party continues to make steady gains which , if the rate of their progress is sustained , could be instrumental in the formation of the government .
the greens - the most popular party not represented in the cabinet - could see the strongest gain in support on sunday .
the latest polls see them heading for 10 percent of the vote , up 2.6 percent on the 2003 election , with some observers also predicting that they could further increase that and force their way into government .
a strong green showing at the election may be enough to reduce the majority of the svp .
for that to happen , however , the svp would have to lose ground and while the people 's party stands to have less votes than it did in the 2003 election , it is unlikely that they will lose enough to stop them becoming the majority party in the swiss parliament . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but experts say an eu-wide policy that legalizes abortion throughout the bloc infringes on national sovereignty . eu leaders cinched a deal on the european reform treaty on thursday , oct .
18 , but only after overcoming vocal polish objections on voting rights .
one reason behind such obstinacy was the fear that poland in the future could be outvoted if the european union ever decided to make abortion legal throughout the 27 nation bloc . at present , each eu state has its own national laws , which vary considerably in detail with regard to the upper limit as to when a pregnancy can be terminated and under what circumstances an abortion can be permitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters greet dutch " abortion ship " entering polish waters only three of the eu 's 27 member states outlaw abortion : poland , ireland and malta .
in july , portugal legalized abortion up until the 10th week of pregnancy , bringing the overwhelmingly roman catholic country in line with most countries in the eu . poland was also the lone dissenter in the 46-member council of europe that did not sign a declaration against the death penalty as warsaw wanted the document to include condemnations of abortion and euthanasia . the eu 's open borders and guaranteed freedom of movement , however , permit women living in countries with restrictive policies or outright bans to travel abroad to receive an abortion - if they can afford the trip , according to paul bell , a spokesman for the international planned parenthood federation in london . " individual state bans only make access to abortion difficult for the poor , " bell said .
" if a woman can not afford to travel or take time off work , she 'll risk getting an illegal backstreet abortion at home . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abortion became legal in portugal this year between 1980 and 2005 , there were 123,258 women who traveled from ireland to england for abortions , according to the safe and legal abortion rights campaign in ireland . the figures on cross-border abortions tend to be greatly understated , since it is optional for irish women to give out their addresses to abortion clinics in the uk and now with cheap flights to spain , there are alternatives to england , bell added . eu-wide policy infringes on national sovereignty while the ipcc has lobbied the european parliament to make abortion a legal right across the european union , some experts say an eu-wide policy would be undemocratic . " the eu could never achieve a consensus when it comes to controversial policies such as abortion .
harmonizing such national laws only serves to antagonize the public towards the eu , " said maciej golubiewski , a policy expert on eu matters at the sobieski institute , a conservative think tank in warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no eu law can influence irelands 's ban on abortion " national sovereignty is the cornerstone of democracy and our political leadership needs to be responsive to what people want , " he said , adding that the existing polish laws on abortion , which are highly restrictive by eu standards , has very broad support among mainstream political parties to both the right and left . hugo brady , an eu justice expert at the london-based centre for european reform , who said he is generally in favor of european integration added that debates about abortion belong to national legislatures . golubiewski pointed out that poland makes exceptions for therapeutic and non-elective abortions .
earlier this year , the european court of human rights awarded 25,000 euros -lrb- us $ 35,691 -rrb- in damages to alicia tysiac , who sued the polish government for being denied an abortion in 2000 .
tysiac , a 36-year-old , disabled single mother of three who lives on a state pension , sought an abortion because her last pregnancy exacerbated a condition that could make her go blind .
since poland permits abortion for medical reasons , the strasbourg court ruled that the country had violated its own laws . ippf had hailed the case as a victory for abortion rights in the eu , but brady said the eu simply does not have the judicial powers to change national practices . " in europe , there is a reluctance to interfere in emotional debates anyway , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a victory speech on sunday , oct .
21 , tusk thanked voters " who showed all of europe that in times of difficulty poles can take care of their country in an extraordinarily responsible fashion . " " we 'll do everything to make poland a good home for you , " he vowed , ending the emotional address by singing the polish national anthem along with hundreds of po party faithful gathered at a victory rally in warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski said there were lessons to be learned from the campaign in the wake of the crushing defeat for law and justice , or pis , prime minister kaczynski said : " i wish tusk success .
i congratulate him . " he vowed that pis would be a " hard and decisive opposition , " apparently ruling out any coalition with the archrival liberals .
meanwhile , the po is expected to team up with the peasants ' party to form an outright majority . based on early counts of some three-quarters of the votes , poland 's election commission said the business-friendly po took around 41 percent of the vote , which would give it around 205 of 460 parliamentary seats .
that would put it well past the pis , which took 32 percent of the vote , according to early voter surveys . the left-wing lid took 12 percent while the conservative polish peasants ' party -lrb- psl -rrb- scored 9 percent , exceeding the 5-percent threshold required to enter parliament .
no other party reached 5 percent .
overwhelming turnout turnout soared to around 55 percent , the highest result since poland 's first fully democratic parliamentary election in 1991 .
as a result , some election stations ran out of ballots , and others had to extend voting hours to accommodate the unexpectedly large numbers of voters .
the interest stood in stark contrast to the record low 40-percent turnout in poland 's last parliamentary ballot in september 2005 , which handed kaczynski 's pis a narrow 2.9-percent victory over the liberals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles turned out in force to cast their ballots sunday 's snap ballot came two years early due to the failure of kaczynski 's minority government to forge a stable majority coalition in poland .

once confirmed by poland 's state elections commission in official results , the po victory means political power in poland will cease to be concentrated in the hands of the kaczynski twins .
president lech kaczynski 's term in office ends in 2009 .
with a population of 38 million , poland was by far the largest of 10 mostly ex-communist states to have joined the european union in 2004 and has since become a key player in the 27-member bloc . " it was a battle .
we won .
but tomorrow we have to get to work , " tusk told his supporters during his victory speech at his party 's headquarters . president lech kaczynski made no comment on his twin brother 's defeat in parliament , which experts also saw as a vote against the reigning head of state . the election was closely watched by polands eu partners , especially germany , which has seen its relations to poland strained during the kaczynski brothers ' rule . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abortion became legal in portugal this year between 1980 and 2005 , there were 123,258 women who traveled from ireland to england for abortions , according to the safe and legal abortion rights campaign in ireland . the figures on cross-border abortions tend to be greatly understated , since it is optional for irish women to give out their addresses to abortion clinics in the uk and now with cheap flights to spain , there are alternatives to england , bell added . eu-wide policy infringes on national sovereignty while the ipcc has lobbied the european parliament to make abortion a legal right across the european union , some experts say an eu-wide policy would be undemocratic . " the eu could never achieve a consensus when it comes to controversial policies such as abortion .
harmonizing such national laws only serves to antagonize the public towards the eu , " said maciej golubiewski , a policy expert on eu matters at the sobieski institute , a conservative think tank in warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no eu law can influence irelands 's ban on abortion " national sovereignty is the cornerstone of democracy and our political leadership needs to be responsive to what people want , " he said , adding that the existing polish laws on abortion , which are highly restrictive by eu standards , has very broad support among mainstream political parties to both the right and left . hugo brady , an eu justice expert at the london-based centre for european reform , who said he is generally in favor of european integration added that debates about abortion belong to national legislatures . golubiewski pointed out that poland makes exceptions for therapeutic and non-elective abortions .
earlier this year , the european court of human rights awarded 25,000 euros -lrb- us $ 35,691 -rrb- in damages to alicia tysiac , who sued the polish government for being denied an abortion in 2000 .
tysiac , a 36-year-old , disabled single mother of three who lives on a state pension , sought an abortion because her last pregnancy exacerbated a condition that could make her go blind .
since poland permits abortion for medical reasons , the strasbourg court ruled that the country had violated its own laws . ippf had hailed the case as a victory for abortion rights in the eu , but brady said the eu simply does not have the judicial powers to change national practices . " in europe , there is a reluctance to interfere in emotional debates anyway , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a victory speech on sunday , oct .
21 , tusk thanked voters " who showed all of europe that in times of difficulty poles can take care of their country in an extraordinarily responsible fashion . " " we 'll do everything to make poland a good home for you , " he vowed , ending the emotional address by singing the polish national anthem along with hundreds of po party faithful gathered at a victory rally in warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski said there were lessons to be learned from the campaign in the wake of the crushing defeat for law and justice , or pis , prime minister kaczynski said : " i wish tusk success .
i congratulate him . " he vowed that pis would be a " hard and decisive opposition , " apparently ruling out any coalition with the archrival liberals .
meanwhile , the po is expected to team up with the peasants ' party to form an outright majority . based on early counts of some three-quarters of the votes , poland 's election commission said the business-friendly po took around 41 percent of the vote , which would give it around 205 of 460 parliamentary seats .
that would put it well past the pis , which took 32 percent of the vote , according to early voter surveys . the left-wing lid took 12 percent while the conservative polish peasants ' party -lrb- psl -rrb- scored 9 percent , exceeding the 5-percent threshold required to enter parliament .
no other party reached 5 percent .
overwhelming turnout turnout soared to around 55 percent , the highest result since poland 's first fully democratic parliamentary election in 1991 .
as a result , some election stations ran out of ballots , and others had to extend voting hours to accommodate the unexpectedly large numbers of voters .
the interest stood in stark contrast to the record low 40-percent turnout in poland 's last parliamentary ballot in september 2005 , which handed kaczynski 's pis a narrow 2.9-percent victory over the liberals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles turned out in force to cast their ballots sunday 's snap ballot came two years early due to the failure of kaczynski 's minority government to forge a stable majority coalition in poland .

once confirmed by poland 's state elections commission in official results , the po victory means political power in poland will cease to be concentrated in the hands of the kaczynski twins .
president lech kaczynski 's term in office ends in 2009 .
with a population of 38 million , poland was by far the largest of 10 mostly ex-communist states to have joined the european union in 2004 and has since become a key player in the 27-member bloc . " it was a battle .
we won .
but tomorrow we have to get to work , " tusk told his supporters during his victory speech at his party 's headquarters . president lech kaczynski made no comment on his twin brother 's defeat in parliament , which experts also saw as a vote against the reigning head of state . the election was closely watched by polands eu partners , especially germany , which has seen its relations to poland strained during the kaczynski brothers ' rule . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 21.10.2007 bundesliga debates end to winter break großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rather than relaxing over the winter , players might have to get out their thermal undies boxing day soccer in germany is not out of the question as the league and clubs are wondering whether the bundesliga winter break still makes sense . global warming and modern stadiums could make the traditional hibernation period obsolete in the future , even though the six-week layoff allows players to recharge their batteries in mid-season .
the winter break originated from poor pitch conditions which in the past led to cancellations of matches .
this season there will be no play between dec .
17 and jan .
31 .
germany is the only big european soccer nation which takes this break .
the english premier league takes no time off and rather has a popular full round of action on boxing day .
there is only a short pause in italy and spain over the festive season .
the issue is on the agenda of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , but plans to scrap the break from 2009 onwards have so far not become reality .
a dfl spokesman said " a few parameters have changed " over the years .
changing parameters reopen discussions erwin staudt , the president of bundesliga champions vfb stuttgart , agreed a change of schedule was worth evaluating .
" this is no sacred cow , you can think about it , " staudt said in a survey by the german dpa news agency .
the only consensus is that the weather no longer warrants the break .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pitches remain ice and snow-free with undersoil heating global warming with less snow is one aspect .
another is that icy pitches no longer exist because all german professional clubs have a heating system for the playing field .
cancellations these days only occur if the stands or stadium roofs ca n't be cleared from snow .
money is another factor as a bundesliga round on boxing day would generate big television audiences and advertising income .
those who favor the break say that players get a mid-season rest .
most clubs allow the players a fortnight off with their families over christmas and new year 's day , followed by a training camp in sunny and warm regions .
a break for rejuvenation is clever , say supporters " other countries say that the germans are clever because the players recuperate and get a breather in this period , " said former germany coach rudi völler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german players are spared games in the worst months sv hamburg coach huub stevens warned that " players will be in action all year if the break no longer exists , " but staudt pointed out that players in england appear to have no problems with this - and they have an even heavier overall match schedule .
a longer summer break would be mandatory if hibernation is scrapped , but völler is probably not the only one who believes that there will never be a common agreement over the issue .
" there is no absolute truth , no ideal solution , " said völler . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the winter break originated from poor pitch conditions which in the past led to cancellations of matches .
this season there will be no play between dec .
17 and jan .
31 .
germany is the only big european soccer nation which takes this break .
the english premier league takes no time off and rather has a popular full round of action on boxing day .
there is only a short pause in italy and spain over the festive season .
the issue is on the agenda of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , but plans to scrap the break from 2009 onwards have so far not become reality .
a dfl spokesman said " a few parameters have changed " over the years .
changing parameters reopen discussions erwin staudt , the president of bundesliga champions vfb stuttgart , agreed a change of schedule was worth evaluating .
" this is no sacred cow , you can think about it , " staudt said in a survey by the german dpa news agency .
the only consensus is that the weather no longer warrants the break .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pitches remain ice and snow-free with undersoil heating global warming with less snow is one aspect .
another is that icy pitches no longer exist because all german professional clubs have a heating system for the playing field .
cancellations these days only occur if the stands or stadium roofs ca n't be cleared from snow .
money is another factor as a bundesliga round on boxing day would generate big television audiences and advertising income .
those who favor the break say that players get a mid-season rest .
most clubs allow the players a fortnight off with their families over christmas and new year 's day , followed by a training camp in sunny and warm regions .
a break for rejuvenation is clever , say supporters " other countries say that the germans are clever because the players recuperate and get a breather in this period , " said former germany coach rudi völler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german players are spared games in the worst months sv hamburg coach huub stevens warned that " players will be in action all year if the break no longer exists , " but staudt pointed out that players in england appear to have no problems with this - and they have an even heavier overall match schedule .
a longer summer break would be mandatory if hibernation is scrapped , but völler is probably not the only one who believes that there will never be a common agreement over the issue .
" there is no absolute truth , no ideal solution , " said völler . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fat-free sausage sounds like an oxymoron , but german food researchers and a butcher have come up with a recipe for it .
but the real question is how the beef and pork wieners taste . it looks like sausage .
it smells like sausage .
and it pretty much tastes like sausage . but instead of the usual 25 percent to 40 percent fat content of a regular sausage , butcher josef pointner 's wurst , which was developed with the fraunhofer institute , is only about 2 percent fat .
entirely fat-free would only be possible in a vegetarian sausage . it was pointner 's customers who gave him the idea for the new recipe , which is made with natural ingredients from pork and beef . " more and more customers like ms. huber and ms. meier came into the store and said that their husbands were n't allowed to eat pork or beef anymore , " the butcher said . real meat , more water bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors were n't ready to give the ok to low-fat wurst varieties low-fat varieties of sausage were already available , but even these contained 10 percent to 20 percent fat - which his customers ' doctors probably would n't have approved of .
those types with even less fat are typically made with poultry - a switch neither pointner nor his customers said they were willing to make . to bring the fat content down , pointner started by leaving out the bacon , rind and gristle and added water to the mixture instead of extra grease .
the only drawback to the high water content is that the sausage can dry out more easily than the fatty version when not refrigerated . " the first tries completely flopped , " said pointner .
" they were like chewing gum . " after a few more attempts , the results started tasting a bit less like gum and more like sausage .
the butcher called up the fraunhofer institute , a leading research organization in germany , to share the news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nearly fat-free sausage is no substitute for old-fashioned exercise pointner joined the institute in conducting further research and the team has since developed nearly fat-free recipes for a whole spectrum of german sausage varieties . a major german retailer will begin producing the new sausage in the next few weeks , said fraunhofer 's peter eisner . interest from abroad germany may be home to a disproportionately high number of sausage lovers , but the new product is also making waves abroad .

21 , voted in favor of directly electing the country 's president .
the results , however , were overshadowed by kurdish rebel attacks that killed at least 12 turkish soldiers . an ambush by kurdish rebels was responsible for 17 turkish soldiers ' deaths sunday .
at least 32 kurds are reported to have been killed in the clashes .
prime minister tayyip erdogan called a crisis meeting to consider a military strike against rebel bases in iraq . the attack , one of the worst in more than a decade by rebels of the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , came four days after turkey 's parliament approved a motion to allow troops to enter northern iraq to fight guerrillas hiding there . " we are very angry , " erdogan told reporters .
" our parliament has granted us the authority to act and within this framework we will do whatever has to be done . " cross-border military plans exist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the military has plans for operations in iraq , they wo n't be moving in immediately contrary to pkk claims of capturing several turkish soldiers , turkey 's defense minister vecdi gonul said no hostages were being held by kurdish rebels in northern iraq . " there are no hostages , " gonul told the press after meeting in the ukrainian capital with us defense secretary robert gates . gonul also said ankara had plans to cross the border into iraq but would not do so immediately .
the united states , european union , nato and iraq have all called on turkey not to conduct military actions in iraq out of fear they could destabilize the most peaceful part of iraq . considered a terrorist organization by ankara , the pkk on sunday claimed to have captured a group of turkish soldiers in the volatile region on the turkey-iraq border following heavy clashes between the two sides . " we can not expect turkey to remain silent in the face of attacks like these , " murat yetkin , a commentator for the liberal radikal daily told n-tv television .
" this attack , coming on a day when turkey votes in a referendum , is a very clear provocation .
it shows the pkk is not interested in democratic initiatives . " next president elected by popular vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey will elect its next president by popular vote seventy percent of turks who voted in a referendum sunday said " yes " to constitutional reforms that would make it possible to elect the country 's president by popular vote , with two-thirds of the ballots counted , the high electoral board said . the direct election proposal comes from the governing islamic conservative akp party .
several opposition parties had criticized the plans or called on voters to boycott the referendum .
according to turkish media reports , voting was light in some places . the government has been urging a direct election of the president by the people after initially failing to get foreign minister abdullah gül elected president by the parliament . gül has in the interim finally been elected by the parliament and began his seven-year term in august . a proposed change in the constitution would also reduce the presidential term to five years . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 21.10.2007 german butcher develops nearly fat-free sausage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is wurst without fat still wurst ?
fat-free sausage sounds like an oxymoron , but german food researchers and a butcher have come up with a recipe for it .
but the real question is how the beef and pork wieners taste . it looks like sausage .
it smells like sausage .
and it pretty much tastes like sausage . but instead of the usual 25 percent to 40 percent fat content of a regular sausage , butcher josef pointner 's wurst , which was developed with the fraunhofer institute , is only about 2 percent fat .
entirely fat-free would only be possible in a vegetarian sausage . it was pointner 's customers who gave him the idea for the new recipe , which is made with natural ingredients from pork and beef . " more and more customers like ms. huber and ms. meier came into the store and said that their husbands were n't allowed to eat pork or beef anymore , " the butcher said . real meat , more water bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors were n't ready to give the ok to low-fat wurst varieties low-fat varieties of sausage were already available , but even these contained 10 percent to 20 percent fat - which his customers ' doctors probably would n't have approved of .
those types with even less fat are typically made with poultry - a switch neither pointner nor his customers said they were willing to make . to bring the fat content down , pointner started by leaving out the bacon , rind and gristle and added water to the mixture instead of extra grease .
the only drawback to the high water content is that the sausage can dry out more easily than the fatty version when not refrigerated . " the first tries completely flopped , " said pointner .
" they were like chewing gum . " after a few more attempts , the results started tasting a bit less like gum and more like sausage .
the butcher called up the fraunhofer institute , a leading research organization in germany , to share the news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nearly fat-free sausage is no substitute for old-fashioned exercise pointner joined the institute in conducting further research and the team has since developed nearly fat-free recipes for a whole spectrum of german sausage varieties . a major german retailer will begin producing the new sausage in the next few weeks , said fraunhofer 's peter eisner . interest from abroad germany may be home to a disproportionately high number of sausage lovers , but the new product is also making waves abroad . " we 're currently talking with a russian company about starting a factory in moscow , " eisner said .

fat-free sausage sounds like an oxymoron , but german food researchers and a butcher have come up with a recipe for it .
but the real question is how the beef and pork wieners taste . it looks like sausage .
it smells like sausage .
and it pretty much tastes like sausage . but instead of the usual 25 percent to 40 percent fat content of a regular sausage , butcher josef pointner 's wurst , which was developed with the fraunhofer institute , is only about 2 percent fat .
entirely fat-free would only be possible in a vegetarian sausage . it was pointner 's customers who gave him the idea for the new recipe , which is made with natural ingredients from pork and beef . " more and more customers like ms. huber and ms. meier came into the store and said that their husbands were n't allowed to eat pork or beef anymore , " the butcher said . real meat , more water bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors were n't ready to give the ok to low-fat wurst varieties low-fat varieties of sausage were already available , but even these contained 10 percent to 20 percent fat - which his customers ' doctors probably would n't have approved of .
those types with even less fat are typically made with poultry - a switch neither pointner nor his customers said they were willing to make . to bring the fat content down , pointner started by leaving out the bacon , rind and gristle and added water to the mixture instead of extra grease .
the only drawback to the high water content is that the sausage can dry out more easily than the fatty version when not refrigerated . " the first tries completely flopped , " said pointner .
" they were like chewing gum . " after a few more attempts , the results started tasting a bit less like gum and more like sausage .
the butcher called up the fraunhofer institute , a leading research organization in germany , to share the news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nearly fat-free sausage is no substitute for old-fashioned exercise pointner joined the institute in conducting further research and the team has since developed nearly fat-free recipes for a whole spectrum of german sausage varieties . a major german retailer will begin producing the new sausage in the next few weeks , said fraunhofer 's peter eisner . interest from abroad germany may be home to a disproportionately high number of sausage lovers , but the new product is also making waves abroad . " we 're currently talking with a russian company about starting a factory in moscow , " eisner said .

21 , ending what may become known as the most acrimonious campaigning in swiss history .
accusations of racism in the far-right swiss people party were the focus of the campaign . votes were being counted after a relatively strong turnout estimated at about 50 percent of the 4.9 million voters . the last opinion poll by swiss television on oct .
10 indicated that the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- was set to win 27.3 percent of the vote , 0.6 percent more than its score in the 2003 election .
the left-of-center social democratic party -lrb- sp / ps -rrb- at 21.7 percent while the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp / pdc / ppd -rrb- and the radicals -lrb- fdp / prd -rrb- were neck and neck with 15.4 and 15.5 percent respectively .
the svp and its leader , justice minister christoph blocher , were intensely criticized for a campaigning stance focusing on immigration and crime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp 's black sheep campaign has lost it few voters despite being denounced by the un special rapporteur on racism for inciting racial hatred in its xenophobic campaigning and for pledging to deport non-national criminals , the svp has struck a chord with voters in a country where one in five people is foreign . attempts to label the party as extremist have also failed to derail the svp campaign .
its now notorious campaign poster of a black sheep being kicked out of a field by three white sheep caused outrage with politicians from the other parties but has done little to reduce its growing popularity . the svp campaign also seems to have benefited from the recent outbreak of violence in switzerland which , as one observer put it , replaced the " chocolates and cuckoos " image with one of smashed cars , crushed campaign stands and unflattering headlines in the foreign press about the threat to swiss democracy .
left-wing violence plays into svp 's hands it is widely assumed that the riots in berne on oct .
6 may have played directly into the svp 's hands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police fought protestors with tear gas and batons switzerland was shocked to see scenes of running battles on the streets of the swiss capital with police armed with tear gas fighting back left-wing radicals who disrupted a svp march .
there were 20 people injured , 18 of them officers as the rally in the federal square descended into baton charges under a hail of paving stones and bottles .
until then , the focus of the opposition parties had been on exposing the svp as an extremist organization , in contrast to its self-appointed position at the heart of family , cultural and national values in switzerland .
since the riots , the people 's party has been using the violence to garner further sympathy .
blocher , a millionaire businessman and the minister of justice in the cabinet , blamed the unrest on " the irresponsibility of a left-wing sowing chaos . "
president blames general intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss president calmy-rey called for dialogue and tolerance the swiss president micheline calmy-rey has refused to blame neither left nor right for the divisions and recriminations which have besmirched the campaign , choosing instead to blame everyone , saying the intolerance of the poster campaigns had now spilled onto the streets .
while the right and left wing parties wage their ideological battles away from the streets and back on the podium , the green party continues to make steady gains which , if the rate of their progress is sustained , could be instrumental in the formation of the government .
the greens - the most popular party not represented in the cabinet - could see the strongest gain in support on sunday .
the latest polls see them heading for 10 percent of the vote , up 2.6 percent on the 2003 election , with some observers also predicting that they could further increase that and force their way into government .
a strong green showing at the election may be enough to reduce the majority of the svp .
for that to happen , however , the svp would have to lose ground and while the people 's party stands to have less votes than it did in the 2003 election , it is unlikely that they will lose enough to stop them becoming the majority party in the swiss parliament . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , ending what may become known as the most acrimonious campaigning in swiss history .
accusations of racism in the far-right swiss people party were the focus of the campaign . votes were being counted after a relatively strong turnout estimated at about 50 percent of the 4.9 million voters . the last opinion poll by swiss television on oct .
10 indicated that the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- was set to win 27.3 percent of the vote , 0.6 percent more than its score in the 2003 election .
the left-of-center social democratic party -lrb- sp / ps -rrb- at 21.7 percent while the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp / pdc / ppd -rrb- and the radicals -lrb- fdp / prd -rrb- were neck and neck with 15.4 and 15.5 percent respectively .
the svp and its leader , justice minister christoph blocher , were intensely criticized for a campaigning stance focusing on immigration and crime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp 's black sheep campaign has lost it few voters despite being denounced by the un special rapporteur on racism for inciting racial hatred in its xenophobic campaigning and for pledging to deport non-national criminals , the svp has struck a chord with voters in a country where one in five people is foreign . attempts to label the party as extremist have also failed to derail the svp campaign .
its now notorious campaign poster of a black sheep being kicked out of a field by three white sheep caused outrage with politicians from the other parties but has done little to reduce its growing popularity . the svp campaign also seems to have benefited from the recent outbreak of violence in switzerland which , as one observer put it , replaced the " chocolates and cuckoos " image with one of smashed cars , crushed campaign stands and unflattering headlines in the foreign press about the threat to swiss democracy .
left-wing violence plays into svp 's hands it is widely assumed that the riots in berne on oct .
6 may have played directly into the svp 's hands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police fought protestors with tear gas and batons switzerland was shocked to see scenes of running battles on the streets of the swiss capital with police armed with tear gas fighting back left-wing radicals who disrupted a svp march .
there were 20 people injured , 18 of them officers as the rally in the federal square descended into baton charges under a hail of paving stones and bottles .
until then , the focus of the opposition parties had been on exposing the svp as an extremist organization , in contrast to its self-appointed position at the heart of family , cultural and national values in switzerland .
since the riots , the people 's party has been using the violence to garner further sympathy .
blocher , a millionaire businessman and the minister of justice in the cabinet , blamed the unrest on " the irresponsibility of a left-wing sowing chaos . "
president blames general intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss president calmy-rey called for dialogue and tolerance the swiss president micheline calmy-rey has refused to blame neither left nor right for the divisions and recriminations which have besmirched the campaign , choosing instead to blame everyone , saying the intolerance of the poster campaigns had now spilled onto the streets .
while the right and left wing parties wage their ideological battles away from the streets and back on the podium , the green party continues to make steady gains which , if the rate of their progress is sustained , could be instrumental in the formation of the government .
the greens - the most popular party not represented in the cabinet - could see the strongest gain in support on sunday .
the latest polls see them heading for 10 percent of the vote , up 2.6 percent on the 2003 election , with some observers also predicting that they could further increase that and force their way into government .
a strong green showing at the election may be enough to reduce the majority of the svp .
for that to happen , however , the svp would have to lose ground and while the people 's party stands to have less votes than it did in the 2003 election , it is unlikely that they will lose enough to stop them becoming the majority party in the swiss parliament . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but experts say an eu-wide policy that legalizes abortion throughout the bloc infringes on national sovereignty . eu leaders cinched a deal on the european reform treaty on thursday , oct .
18 , but only after overcoming vocal polish objections on voting rights .
one reason behind such obstinacy was the fear that poland in the future could be outvoted if the european union ever decided to make abortion legal throughout the 27 nation bloc . at present , each eu state has its own national laws , which vary considerably in detail with regard to the upper limit as to when a pregnancy can be terminated and under what circumstances an abortion can be permitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters greet dutch " abortion ship " entering polish waters only three of the eu 's 27 member states outlaw abortion : poland , ireland and malta .
in july , portugal legalized abortion up until the 10th week of pregnancy , bringing the overwhelmingly roman catholic country in line with most countries in the eu . poland was also the lone dissenter in the 46-member council of europe that did not sign a declaration against the death penalty as warsaw wanted the document to include condemnations of abortion and euthanasia . the eu 's open borders and guaranteed freedom of movement , however , permit women living in countries with restrictive policies or outright bans to travel abroad to receive an abortion - if they can afford the trip , according to paul bell , a spokesman for the international planned parenthood federation in london . " individual state bans only make access to abortion difficult for the poor , " bell said .
" if a woman can not afford to travel or take time off work , she 'll risk getting an illegal backstreet abortion at home . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abortion became legal in portugal this year between 1980 and 2005 , there were 123,258 women who traveled from ireland to england for abortions , according to the safe and legal abortion rights campaign in ireland . the figures on cross-border abortions tend to be greatly understated , since it is optional for irish women to give out their addresses to abortion clinics in the uk and now with cheap flights to spain , there are alternatives to england , bell added . eu-wide policy infringes on national sovereignty while the ipcc has lobbied the european parliament to make abortion a legal right across the european union , some experts say an eu-wide policy would be undemocratic . " the eu could never achieve a consensus when it comes to controversial policies such as abortion .
harmonizing such national laws only serves to antagonize the public towards the eu , " said maciej golubiewski , a policy expert on eu matters at the sobieski institute , a conservative think tank in warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no eu law can influence irelands 's ban on abortion " national sovereignty is the cornerstone of democracy and our political leadership needs to be responsive to what people want , " he said , adding that the existing polish laws on abortion , which are highly restrictive by eu standards , has very broad support among mainstream political parties to both the right and left . hugo brady , an eu justice expert at the london-based centre for european reform , who said he is generally in favor of european integration added that debates about abortion belong to national legislatures . golubiewski pointed out that poland makes exceptions for therapeutic and non-elective abortions .
earlier this year , the european court of human rights awarded 25,000 euros -lrb- us $ 35,691 -rrb- in damages to alicia tysiac , who sued the polish government for being denied an abortion in 2000 .
tysiac , a 36-year-old , disabled single mother of three who lives on a state pension , sought an abortion because her last pregnancy exacerbated a condition that could make her go blind .
since poland permits abortion for medical reasons , the strasbourg court ruled that the country had violated its own laws . ippf had hailed the case as a victory for abortion rights in the eu , but brady said the eu simply does not have the judicial powers to change national practices .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 21.10.2007 bundesliga debates end to winter break großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rather than relaxing over the winter , players might have to get out their thermal undies boxing day soccer in germany is not out of the question as the league and clubs are wondering whether the bundesliga winter break still makes sense . global warming and modern stadiums could make the traditional hibernation period obsolete in the future , even though the six-week layoff allows players to recharge their batteries in mid-season .
the winter break originated from poor pitch conditions which in the past led to cancellations of matches .
this season there will be no play between dec .
17 and jan .
31 .
germany is the only big european soccer nation which takes this break .
the english premier league takes no time off and rather has a popular full round of action on boxing day .
there is only a short pause in italy and spain over the festive season .
the issue is on the agenda of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , but plans to scrap the break from 2009 onwards have so far not become reality .
a dfl spokesman said " a few parameters have changed " over the years .
changing parameters reopen discussions erwin staudt , the president of bundesliga champions vfb stuttgart , agreed a change of schedule was worth evaluating .
" this is no sacred cow , you can think about it , " staudt said in a survey by the german dpa news agency .
the only consensus is that the weather no longer warrants the break .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pitches remain ice and snow-free with undersoil heating global warming with less snow is one aspect .
another is that icy pitches no longer exist because all german professional clubs have a heating system for the playing field .
cancellations these days only occur if the stands or stadium roofs ca n't be cleared from snow .
money is another factor as a bundesliga round on boxing day would generate big television audiences and advertising income .
those who favor the break say that players get a mid-season rest .
most clubs allow the players a fortnight off with their families over christmas and new year 's day , followed by a training camp in sunny and warm regions .
a break for rejuvenation is clever , say supporters " other countries say that the germans are clever because the players recuperate and get a breather in this period , " said former germany coach rudi völler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german players are spared games in the worst months sv hamburg coach huub stevens warned that " players will be in action all year if the break no longer exists , " but staudt pointed out that players in england appear to have no problems with this - and they have an even heavier overall match schedule .
a longer summer break would be mandatory if hibernation is scrapped , but völler is probably not the only one who believes that there will never be a common agreement over the issue .

21 , voted in favor of directly electing the country 's president .
the results , however , were overshadowed by kurdish rebel attacks that killed at least 12 turkish soldiers . an ambush by kurdish rebels was responsible for 17 turkish soldiers ' deaths sunday .
at least 32 kurds are reported to have been killed in the clashes .
prime minister tayyip erdogan called a crisis meeting to consider a military strike against rebel bases in iraq . the attack , one of the worst in more than a decade by rebels of the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , came four days after turkey 's parliament approved a motion to allow troops to enter northern iraq to fight guerrillas hiding there . " we are very angry , " erdogan told reporters .
" our parliament has granted us the authority to act and within this framework we will do whatever has to be done . " cross-border military plans exist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the military has plans for operations in iraq , they wo n't be moving in immediately contrary to pkk claims of capturing several turkish soldiers , turkey 's defense minister vecdi gonul said no hostages were being held by kurdish rebels in northern iraq . " there are no hostages , " gonul told the press after meeting in the ukrainian capital with us defense secretary robert gates . gonul also said ankara had plans to cross the border into iraq but would not do so immediately .
the united states , european union , nato and iraq have all called on turkey not to conduct military actions in iraq out of fear they could destabilize the most peaceful part of iraq . considered a terrorist organization by ankara , the pkk on sunday claimed to have captured a group of turkish soldiers in the volatile region on the turkey-iraq border following heavy clashes between the two sides . " we can not expect turkey to remain silent in the face of attacks like these , " murat yetkin , a commentator for the liberal radikal daily told n-tv television .
" this attack , coming on a day when turkey votes in a referendum , is a very clear provocation .
it shows the pkk is not interested in democratic initiatives .

several opposition parties had criticized the plans or called on voters to boycott the referendum .
according to turkish media reports , voting was light in some places . the government has been urging a direct election of the president by the people after initially failing to get foreign minister abdullah gül elected president by the parliament . gül has in the interim finally been elected by the parliament and began his seven-year term in august . a proposed change in the constitution would also reduce the presidential term to five years . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 21.10.2007 voters end bitter election campaign in switzerland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss parliamentary election campaign descended into violent chaos recently polls closed in switzerland on sunday , oct .
21 , ending what may become known as the most acrimonious campaigning in swiss history .
accusations of racism in the far-right swiss people party were the focus of the campaign . votes were being counted after a relatively strong turnout estimated at about 50 percent of the 4.9 million voters . the last opinion poll by swiss television on oct .
10 indicated that the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- was set to win 27.3 percent of the vote , 0.6 percent more than its score in the 2003 election .
the left-of-center social democratic party -lrb- sp / ps -rrb- at 21.7 percent while the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp / pdc / ppd -rrb- and the radicals -lrb- fdp / prd -rrb- were neck and neck with 15.4 and 15.5 percent respectively .
the svp and its leader , justice minister christoph blocher , were intensely criticized for a campaigning stance focusing on immigration and crime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp 's black sheep campaign has lost it few voters despite being denounced by the un special rapporteur on racism for inciting racial hatred in its xenophobic campaigning and for pledging to deport non-national criminals , the svp has struck a chord with voters in a country where one in five people is foreign . attempts to label the party as extremist have also failed to derail the svp campaign .
its now notorious campaign poster of a black sheep being kicked out of a field by three white sheep caused outrage with politicians from the other parties but has done little to reduce its growing popularity . the svp campaign also seems to have benefited from the recent outbreak of violence in switzerland which , as one observer put it , replaced the " chocolates and cuckoos " image with one of smashed cars , crushed campaign stands and unflattering headlines in the foreign press about the threat to swiss democracy .
left-wing violence plays into svp 's hands it is widely assumed that the riots in berne on oct .
6 may have played directly into the svp 's hands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police fought protestors with tear gas and batons switzerland was shocked to see scenes of running battles on the streets of the swiss capital with police armed with tear gas fighting back left-wing radicals who disrupted a svp march .
there were 20 people injured , 18 of them officers as the rally in the federal square descended into baton charges under a hail of paving stones and bottles .
until then , the focus of the opposition parties had been on exposing the svp as an extremist organization , in contrast to its self-appointed position at the heart of family , cultural and national values in switzerland .
since the riots , the people 's party has been using the violence to garner further sympathy .
blocher , a millionaire businessman and the minister of justice in the cabinet , blamed the unrest on " the irresponsibility of a left-wing sowing chaos . "
president blames general intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss president calmy-rey called for dialogue and tolerance the swiss president micheline calmy-rey has refused to blame neither left nor right for the divisions and recriminations which have besmirched the campaign , choosing instead to blame everyone , saying the intolerance of the poster campaigns had now spilled onto the streets .
while the right and left wing parties wage their ideological battles away from the streets and back on the podium , the green party continues to make steady gains which , if the rate of their progress is sustained , could be instrumental in the formation of the government .
the greens - the most popular party not represented in the cabinet - could see the strongest gain in support on sunday .
the latest polls see them heading for 10 percent of the vote , up 2.6 percent on the 2003 election , with some observers also predicting that they could further increase that and force their way into government .
a strong green showing at the election may be enough to reduce the majority of the svp .
for that to happen , however , the svp would have to lose ground and while the people 's party stands to have less votes than it did in the 2003 election , it is unlikely that they will lose enough to stop them becoming the majority party in the swiss parliament . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the winter break originated from poor pitch conditions which in the past led to cancellations of matches .
this season there will be no play between dec .
17 and jan .
31 .
germany is the only big european soccer nation which takes this break .
the english premier league takes no time off and rather has a popular full round of action on boxing day .
there is only a short pause in italy and spain over the festive season .
the issue is on the agenda of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , but plans to scrap the break from 2009 onwards have so far not become reality .
a dfl spokesman said " a few parameters have changed " over the years .
changing parameters reopen discussions erwin staudt , the president of bundesliga champions vfb stuttgart , agreed a change of schedule was worth evaluating .
" this is no sacred cow , you can think about it , " staudt said in a survey by the german dpa news agency .
the only consensus is that the weather no longer warrants the break .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pitches remain ice and snow-free with undersoil heating global warming with less snow is one aspect .
another is that icy pitches no longer exist because all german professional clubs have a heating system for the playing field .
cancellations these days only occur if the stands or stadium roofs ca n't be cleared from snow .
money is another factor as a bundesliga round on boxing day would generate big television audiences and advertising income .
those who favor the break say that players get a mid-season rest .
most clubs allow the players a fortnight off with their families over christmas and new year 's day , followed by a training camp in sunny and warm regions .
a break for rejuvenation is clever , say supporters " other countries say that the germans are clever because the players recuperate and get a breather in this period , " said former germany coach rudi völler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german players are spared games in the worst months sv hamburg coach huub stevens warned that " players will be in action all year if the break no longer exists , " but staudt pointed out that players in england appear to have no problems with this - and they have an even heavier overall match schedule .
a longer summer break would be mandatory if hibernation is scrapped , but völler is probably not the only one who believes that there will never be a common agreement over the issue .
" there is no absolute truth , no ideal solution , " said völler . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , ending what may become known as the most acrimonious campaigning in swiss history .
accusations of racism in the far-right swiss people party were the focus of the campaign . votes were being counted after a relatively strong turnout estimated at about 50 percent of the 4.9 million voters . the last opinion poll by swiss television on oct .
10 indicated that the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- was set to win 27.3 percent of the vote , 0.6 percent more than its score in the 2003 election .
the left-of-center social democratic party -lrb- sp / ps -rrb- at 21.7 percent while the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp / pdc / ppd -rrb- and the radicals -lrb- fdp / prd -rrb- were neck and neck with 15.4 and 15.5 percent respectively .
the svp and its leader , justice minister christoph blocher , were intensely criticized for a campaigning stance focusing on immigration and crime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp 's black sheep campaign has lost it few voters despite being denounced by the un special rapporteur on racism for inciting racial hatred in its xenophobic campaigning and for pledging to deport non-national criminals , the svp has struck a chord with voters in a country where one in five people is foreign . attempts to label the party as extremist have also failed to derail the svp campaign .
its now notorious campaign poster of a black sheep being kicked out of a field by three white sheep caused outrage with politicians from the other parties but has done little to reduce its growing popularity . the svp campaign also seems to have benefited from the recent outbreak of violence in switzerland which , as one observer put it , replaced the " chocolates and cuckoos " image with one of smashed cars , crushed campaign stands and unflattering headlines in the foreign press about the threat to swiss democracy .
left-wing violence plays into svp 's hands it is widely assumed that the riots in berne on oct .
6 may have played directly into the svp 's hands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police fought protestors with tear gas and batons switzerland was shocked to see scenes of running battles on the streets of the swiss capital with police armed with tear gas fighting back left-wing radicals who disrupted a svp march .
there were 20 people injured , 18 of them officers as the rally in the federal square descended into baton charges under a hail of paving stones and bottles .
until then , the focus of the opposition parties had been on exposing the svp as an extremist organization , in contrast to its self-appointed position at the heart of family , cultural and national values in switzerland .
since the riots , the people 's party has been using the violence to garner further sympathy .
blocher , a millionaire businessman and the minister of justice in the cabinet , blamed the unrest on " the irresponsibility of a left-wing sowing chaos . "
president blames general intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss president calmy-rey called for dialogue and tolerance the swiss president micheline calmy-rey has refused to blame neither left nor right for the divisions and recriminations which have besmirched the campaign , choosing instead to blame everyone , saying the intolerance of the poster campaigns had now spilled onto the streets .
while the right and left wing parties wage their ideological battles away from the streets and back on the podium , the green party continues to make steady gains which , if the rate of their progress is sustained , could be instrumental in the formation of the government .
the greens - the most popular party not represented in the cabinet - could see the strongest gain in support on sunday .
the latest polls see them heading for 10 percent of the vote , up 2.6 percent on the 2003 election , with some observers also predicting that they could further increase that and force their way into government .
a strong green showing at the election may be enough to reduce the majority of the svp .
for that to happen , however , the svp would have to lose ground and while the people 's party stands to have less votes than it did in the 2003 election , it is unlikely that they will lose enough to stop them becoming the majority party in the swiss parliament . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the left-of-center social democratic party -lrb- sp / ps -rrb- at 21.7 percent while the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp / pdc / ppd -rrb- and the radicals -lrb- fdp / prd -rrb- were neck and neck with 15.4 and 15.5 percent respectively .
the svp and its leader , justice minister christoph blocher , were intensely criticized for a campaigning stance focusing on immigration and crime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp 's black sheep campaign has lost it few voters despite being denounced by the un special rapporteur on racism for inciting racial hatred in its xenophobic campaigning and for pledging to deport non-national criminals , the svp has struck a chord with voters in a country where one in five people is foreign . attempts to label the party as extremist have also failed to derail the svp campaign .
its now notorious campaign poster of a black sheep being kicked out of a field by three white sheep caused outrage with politicians from the other parties but has done little to reduce its growing popularity . the svp campaign also seems to have benefited from the recent outbreak of violence in switzerland which , as one observer put it , replaced the " chocolates and cuckoos " image with one of smashed cars , crushed campaign stands and unflattering headlines in the foreign press about the threat to swiss democracy .
left-wing violence plays into svp 's hands it is widely assumed that the riots in berne on oct .
6 may have played directly into the svp 's hands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police fought protestors with tear gas and batons switzerland was shocked to see scenes of running battles on the streets of the swiss capital with police armed with tear gas fighting back left-wing radicals who disrupted a svp march .
there were 20 people injured , 18 of them officers as the rally in the federal square descended into baton charges under a hail of paving stones and bottles .
until then , the focus of the opposition parties had been on exposing the svp as an extremist organization , in contrast to its self-appointed position at the heart of family , cultural and national values in switzerland .
since the riots , the people 's party has been using the violence to garner further sympathy .
blocher , a millionaire businessman and the minister of justice in the cabinet , blamed the unrest on " the irresponsibility of a left-wing sowing chaos . "
president blames general intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss president calmy-rey called for dialogue and tolerance the swiss president micheline calmy-rey has refused to blame neither left nor right for the divisions and recriminations which have besmirched the campaign , choosing instead to blame everyone , saying the intolerance of the poster campaigns had now spilled onto the streets .
while the right and left wing parties wage their ideological battles away from the streets and back on the podium , the green party continues to make steady gains which , if the rate of their progress is sustained , could be instrumental in the formation of the government .
the greens - the most popular party not represented in the cabinet - could see the strongest gain in support on sunday .
the latest polls see them heading for 10 percent of the vote , up 2.6 percent on the 2003 election , with some observers also predicting that they could further increase that and force their way into government .
a strong green showing at the election may be enough to reduce the majority of the svp .
for that to happen , however , the svp would have to lose ground and while the people 's party stands to have less votes than it did in the 2003 election , it is unlikely that they will lose enough to stop them becoming the majority party in the swiss parliament . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a victory speech on sunday , oct .
21 , tusk thanked voters " who showed all of europe that in times of difficulty poles can take care of their country in an extraordinarily responsible fashion . " " we 'll do everything to make poland a good home for you , " he vowed , ending the emotional address by singing the polish national anthem along with hundreds of po party faithful gathered at a victory rally in warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski said there were lessons to be learned from the campaign in the wake of the crushing defeat for law and justice , or pis , prime minister kaczynski said : " i wish tusk success .
i congratulate him . " he vowed that pis would be a " hard and decisive opposition , " apparently ruling out any coalition with the archrival liberals .
meanwhile , the po is expected to team up with the peasants ' party to form an outright majority . based on early counts of some three-quarters of the votes , poland 's election commission said the business-friendly po took around 41 percent of the vote , which would give it around 205 of 460 parliamentary seats .
that would put it well past the pis , which took 32 percent of the vote , according to early voter surveys . the left-wing lid took 12 percent while the conservative polish peasants ' party -lrb- psl -rrb- scored 9 percent , exceeding the 5-percent threshold required to enter parliament .
no other party reached 5 percent .
overwhelming turnout turnout soared to around 55 percent , the highest result since poland 's first fully democratic parliamentary election in 1991 .
as a result , some election stations ran out of ballots , and others had to extend voting hours to accommodate the unexpectedly large numbers of voters .
the interest stood in stark contrast to the record low 40-percent turnout in poland 's last parliamentary ballot in september 2005 , which handed kaczynski 's pis a narrow 2.9-percent victory over the liberals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles turned out in force to cast their ballots sunday 's snap ballot came two years early due to the failure of kaczynski 's minority government to forge a stable majority coalition in poland .
more stability ?
once confirmed by poland 's state elections commission in official results , the po victory means political power in poland will cease to be concentrated in the hands of the kaczynski twins .
president lech kaczynski 's term in office ends in 2009 .
with a population of 38 million , poland was by far the largest of 10 mostly ex-communist states to have joined the european union in 2004 and has since become a key player in the 27-member bloc . " it was a battle .
we won .
but tomorrow we have to get to work , " tusk told his supporters during his victory speech at his party 's headquarters . president lech kaczynski made no comment on his twin brother 's defeat in parliament , which experts also saw as a vote against the reigning head of state . the election was closely watched by polands eu partners , especially germany , which has seen its relations to poland strained during the kaczynski brothers ' rule . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 21.10.2007 opposition party wins landslide in polish elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victory for tusk this time around poland 's liberal civic platform scored a landslide victory in parliamentary elections amid record turnout at the polls , ending the reign of the right-wing law and justice party of prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . the civic platform , or po , party was led by europe-friendly opposition leader donald tusk .
in a victory speech on sunday , oct .
21 , tusk thanked voters " who showed all of europe that in times of difficulty poles can take care of their country in an extraordinarily responsible fashion . " " we 'll do everything to make poland a good home for you , " he vowed , ending the emotional address by singing the polish national anthem along with hundreds of po party faithful gathered at a victory rally in warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski said there were lessons to be learned from the campaign in the wake of the crushing defeat for law and justice , or pis , prime minister kaczynski said : " i wish tusk success .
i congratulate him . " he vowed that pis would be a " hard and decisive opposition , " apparently ruling out any coalition with the archrival liberals .
meanwhile , the po is expected to team up with the peasants ' party to form an outright majority . based on early counts of some three-quarters of the votes , poland 's election commission said the business-friendly po took around 41 percent of the vote , which would give it around 205 of 460 parliamentary seats .
that would put it well past the pis , which took 32 percent of the vote , according to early voter surveys . the left-wing lid took 12 percent while the conservative polish peasants ' party -lrb- psl -rrb- scored 9 percent , exceeding the 5-percent threshold required to enter parliament .
no other party reached 5 percent .
overwhelming turnout turnout soared to around 55 percent , the highest result since poland 's first fully democratic parliamentary election in 1991 .
as a result , some election stations ran out of ballots , and others had to extend voting hours to accommodate the unexpectedly large numbers of voters .
the interest stood in stark contrast to the record low 40-percent turnout in poland 's last parliamentary ballot in september 2005 , which handed kaczynski 's pis a narrow 2.9-percent victory over the liberals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles turned out in force to cast their ballots sunday 's snap ballot came two years early due to the failure of kaczynski 's minority government to forge a stable majority coalition in poland .
more stability ?
once confirmed by poland 's state elections commission in official results , the po victory means political power in poland will cease to be concentrated in the hands of the kaczynski twins .
president lech kaczynski 's term in office ends in 2009 .
with a population of 38 million , poland was by far the largest of 10 mostly ex-communist states to have joined the european union in 2004 and has since become a key player in the 27-member bloc . " it was a battle .
we won .

fat-free sausage sounds like an oxymoron , but german food researchers and a butcher have come up with a recipe for it .
but the real question is how the beef and pork wieners taste . it looks like sausage .
it smells like sausage .
and it pretty much tastes like sausage . but instead of the usual 25 percent to 40 percent fat content of a regular sausage , butcher josef pointner 's wurst , which was developed with the fraunhofer institute , is only about 2 percent fat .
entirely fat-free would only be possible in a vegetarian sausage . it was pointner 's customers who gave him the idea for the new recipe , which is made with natural ingredients from pork and beef . " more and more customers like ms. huber and ms. meier came into the store and said that their husbands were n't allowed to eat pork or beef anymore , " the butcher said . real meat , more water bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors were n't ready to give the ok to low-fat wurst varieties low-fat varieties of sausage were already available , but even these contained 10 percent to 20 percent fat - which his customers ' doctors probably would n't have approved of .
those types with even less fat are typically made with poultry - a switch neither pointner nor his customers said they were willing to make . to bring the fat content down , pointner started by leaving out the bacon , rind and gristle and added water to the mixture instead of extra grease .

fat-free sausage sounds like an oxymoron , but german food researchers and a butcher have come up with a recipe for it .
but the real question is how the beef and pork wieners taste . it looks like sausage .
it smells like sausage .
and it pretty much tastes like sausage . but instead of the usual 25 percent to 40 percent fat content of a regular sausage , butcher josef pointner 's wurst , which was developed with the fraunhofer institute , is only about 2 percent fat .
entirely fat-free would only be possible in a vegetarian sausage . it was pointner 's customers who gave him the idea for the new recipe , which is made with natural ingredients from pork and beef . " more and more customers like ms. huber and ms. meier came into the store and said that their husbands were n't allowed to eat pork or beef anymore , " the butcher said . real meat , more water bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors were n't ready to give the ok to low-fat wurst varieties low-fat varieties of sausage were already available , but even these contained 10 percent to 20 percent fat - which his customers ' doctors probably would n't have approved of .
those types with even less fat are typically made with poultry - a switch neither pointner nor his customers said they were willing to make . to bring the fat content down , pointner started by leaving out the bacon , rind and gristle and added water to the mixture instead of extra grease .
the only drawback to the high water content is that the sausage can dry out more easily than the fatty version when not refrigerated . " the first tries completely flopped , " said pointner .
" they were like chewing gum . " after a few more attempts , the results started tasting a bit less like gum and more like sausage .

fat-free sausage sounds like an oxymoron , but german food researchers and a butcher have come up with a recipe for it .
but the real question is how the beef and pork wieners taste . it looks like sausage .
it smells like sausage .
and it pretty much tastes like sausage . but instead of the usual 25 percent to 40 percent fat content of a regular sausage , butcher josef pointner 's wurst , which was developed with the fraunhofer institute , is only about 2 percent fat .
entirely fat-free would only be possible in a vegetarian sausage . it was pointner 's customers who gave him the idea for the new recipe , which is made with natural ingredients from pork and beef . " more and more customers like ms. huber and ms. meier came into the store and said that their husbands were n't allowed to eat pork or beef anymore , " the butcher said . real meat , more water bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors were n't ready to give the ok to low-fat wurst varieties low-fat varieties of sausage were already available , but even these contained 10 percent to 20 percent fat - which his customers ' doctors probably would n't have approved of .
those types with even less fat are typically made with poultry - a switch neither pointner nor his customers said they were willing to make . to bring the fat content down , pointner started by leaving out the bacon , rind and gristle and added water to the mixture instead of extra grease .
the only drawback to the high water content is that the sausage can dry out more easily than the fatty version when not refrigerated . " the first tries completely flopped , " said pointner .
" they were like chewing gum . " after a few more attempts , the results started tasting a bit less like gum and more like sausage .
the butcher called up the fraunhofer institute , a leading research organization in germany , to share the news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nearly fat-free sausage is no substitute for old-fashioned exercise pointner joined the institute in conducting further research and the team has since developed nearly fat-free recipes for a whole spectrum of german sausage varieties . a major german retailer will begin producing the new sausage in the next few weeks , said fraunhofer 's peter eisner . interest from abroad germany may be home to a disproportionately high number of sausage lovers , but the new product is also making waves abroad .

in a victory speech on sunday , oct .
21 , tusk thanked voters " who showed all of europe that in times of difficulty poles can take care of their country in an extraordinarily responsible fashion . " " we 'll do everything to make poland a good home for you , " he vowed , ending the emotional address by singing the polish national anthem along with hundreds of po party faithful gathered at a victory rally in warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski said there were lessons to be learned from the campaign in the wake of the crushing defeat for law and justice , or pis , prime minister kaczynski said : " i wish tusk success .
i congratulate him . " he vowed that pis would be a " hard and decisive opposition , " apparently ruling out any coalition with the archrival liberals .
meanwhile , the po is expected to team up with the peasants ' party to form an outright majority . based on early counts of some three-quarters of the votes , poland 's election commission said the business-friendly po took around 41 percent of the vote , which would give it around 205 of 460 parliamentary seats .
that would put it well past the pis , which took 32 percent of the vote , according to early voter surveys . the left-wing lid took 12 percent while the conservative polish peasants ' party -lrb- psl -rrb- scored 9 percent , exceeding the 5-percent threshold required to enter parliament .
no other party reached 5 percent .
overwhelming turnout turnout soared to around 55 percent , the highest result since poland 's first fully democratic parliamentary election in 1991 .
as a result , some election stations ran out of ballots , and others had to extend voting hours to accommodate the unexpectedly large numbers of voters .
the interest stood in stark contrast to the record low 40-percent turnout in poland 's last parliamentary ballot in september 2005 , which handed kaczynski 's pis a narrow 2.9-percent victory over the liberals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles turned out in force to cast their ballots sunday 's snap ballot came two years early due to the failure of kaczynski 's minority government to forge a stable majority coalition in poland .
more stability ?
once confirmed by poland 's state elections commission in official results , the po victory means political power in poland will cease to be concentrated in the hands of the kaczynski twins .
president lech kaczynski 's term in office ends in 2009 .
with a population of 38 million , poland was by far the largest of 10 mostly ex-communist states to have joined the european union in 2004 and has since become a key player in the 27-member bloc . " it was a battle .
we won .
but tomorrow we have to get to work , " tusk told his supporters during his victory speech at his party 's headquarters . president lech kaczynski made no comment on his twin brother 's defeat in parliament , which experts also saw as a vote against the reigning head of state . the election was closely watched by polands eu partners , especially germany , which has seen its relations to poland strained during the kaczynski brothers ' rule . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , voted in favor of directly electing the country 's president .
the results , however , were overshadowed by kurdish rebel attacks that killed at least 12 turkish soldiers . an ambush by kurdish rebels was responsible for 17 turkish soldiers ' deaths sunday .
at least 32 kurds are reported to have been killed in the clashes .
prime minister tayyip erdogan called a crisis meeting to consider a military strike against rebel bases in iraq . the attack , one of the worst in more than a decade by rebels of the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , came four days after turkey 's parliament approved a motion to allow troops to enter northern iraq to fight guerrillas hiding there . " we are very angry , " erdogan told reporters .
" our parliament has granted us the authority to act and within this framework we will do whatever has to be done . " cross-border military plans exist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the military has plans for operations in iraq , they wo n't be moving in immediately contrary to pkk claims of capturing several turkish soldiers , turkey 's defense minister vecdi gonul said no hostages were being held by kurdish rebels in northern iraq . " there are no hostages , " gonul told the press after meeting in the ukrainian capital with us defense secretary robert gates . gonul also said ankara had plans to cross the border into iraq but would not do so immediately .
the united states , european union , nato and iraq have all called on turkey not to conduct military actions in iraq out of fear they could destabilize the most peaceful part of iraq . considered a terrorist organization by ankara , the pkk on sunday claimed to have captured a group of turkish soldiers in the volatile region on the turkey-iraq border following heavy clashes between the two sides . " we can not expect turkey to remain silent in the face of attacks like these , " murat yetkin , a commentator for the liberal radikal daily told n-tv television .
" this attack , coming on a day when turkey votes in a referendum , is a very clear provocation .
it shows the pkk is not interested in democratic initiatives . " next president elected by popular vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey will elect its next president by popular vote seventy percent of turks who voted in a referendum sunday said " yes " to constitutional reforms that would make it possible to elect the country 's president by popular vote , with two-thirds of the ballots counted , the high electoral board said . the direct election proposal comes from the governing islamic conservative akp party .
several opposition parties had criticized the plans or called on voters to boycott the referendum .
according to turkish media reports , voting was light in some places . the government has been urging a direct election of the president by the people after initially failing to get foreign minister abdullah gül elected president by the parliament . gül has in the interim finally been elected by the parliament and began his seven-year term in august . a proposed change in the constitution would also reduce the presidential term to five years . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the winter break originated from poor pitch conditions which in the past led to cancellations of matches .
this season there will be no play between dec .
17 and jan .
31 .
germany is the only big european soccer nation which takes this break .
the english premier league takes no time off and rather has a popular full round of action on boxing day .
there is only a short pause in italy and spain over the festive season .
the issue is on the agenda of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , but plans to scrap the break from 2009 onwards have so far not become reality .
a dfl spokesman said " a few parameters have changed " over the years .
changing parameters reopen discussions erwin staudt , the president of bundesliga champions vfb stuttgart , agreed a change of schedule was worth evaluating .
" this is no sacred cow , you can think about it , " staudt said in a survey by the german dpa news agency .
the only consensus is that the weather no longer warrants the break .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pitches remain ice and snow-free with undersoil heating global warming with less snow is one aspect .
another is that icy pitches no longer exist because all german professional clubs have a heating system for the playing field .
cancellations these days only occur if the stands or stadium roofs ca n't be cleared from snow .
money is another factor as a bundesliga round on boxing day would generate big television audiences and advertising income .
those who favor the break say that players get a mid-season rest .
most clubs allow the players a fortnight off with their families over christmas and new year 's day , followed by a training camp in sunny and warm regions .
a break for rejuvenation is clever , say supporters " other countries say that the germans are clever because the players recuperate and get a breather in this period , " said former germany coach rudi völler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german players are spared games in the worst months sv hamburg coach huub stevens warned that " players will be in action all year if the break no longer exists , " but staudt pointed out that players in england appear to have no problems with this - and they have an even heavier overall match schedule .
a longer summer break would be mandatory if hibernation is scrapped , but völler is probably not the only one who believes that there will never be a common agreement over the issue .
" there is no absolute truth , no ideal solution , " said völler . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fat-free sausage sounds like an oxymoron , but german food researchers and a butcher have come up with a recipe for it .
but the real question is how the beef and pork wieners taste . it looks like sausage .
it smells like sausage .
and it pretty much tastes like sausage . but instead of the usual 25 percent to 40 percent fat content of a regular sausage , butcher josef pointner 's wurst , which was developed with the fraunhofer institute , is only about 2 percent fat .
entirely fat-free would only be possible in a vegetarian sausage . it was pointner 's customers who gave him the idea for the new recipe , which is made with natural ingredients from pork and beef . " more and more customers like ms. huber and ms. meier came into the store and said that their husbands were n't allowed to eat pork or beef anymore , " the butcher said . real meat , more water bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors were n't ready to give the ok to low-fat wurst varieties low-fat varieties of sausage were already available , but even these contained 10 percent to 20 percent fat - which his customers ' doctors probably would n't have approved of .
those types with even less fat are typically made with poultry - a switch neither pointner nor his customers said they were willing to make . to bring the fat content down , pointner started by leaving out the bacon , rind and gristle and added water to the mixture instead of extra grease .
the only drawback to the high water content is that the sausage can dry out more easily than the fatty version when not refrigerated . " the first tries completely flopped , " said pointner .
" they were like chewing gum . " after a few more attempts , the results started tasting a bit less like gum and more like sausage .
the butcher called up the fraunhofer institute , a leading research organization in germany , to share the news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nearly fat-free sausage is no substitute for old-fashioned exercise pointner joined the institute in conducting further research and the team has since developed nearly fat-free recipes for a whole spectrum of german sausage varieties . a major german retailer will begin producing the new sausage in the next few weeks , said fraunhofer 's peter eisner . interest from abroad germany may be home to a disproportionately high number of sausage lovers , but the new product is also making waves abroad . " we 're currently talking with a russian company about starting a factory in moscow , " eisner said .

21 , ending what may become known as the most acrimonious campaigning in swiss history .
accusations of racism in the far-right swiss people party were the focus of the campaign . votes were being counted after a relatively strong turnout estimated at about 50 percent of the 4.9 million voters . the last opinion poll by swiss television on oct .
10 indicated that the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- was set to win 27.3 percent of the vote , 0.6 percent more than its score in the 2003 election .
the left-of-center social democratic party -lrb- sp / ps -rrb- at 21.7 percent while the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp / pdc / ppd -rrb- and the radicals -lrb- fdp / prd -rrb- were neck and neck with 15.4 and 15.5 percent respectively .
the svp and its leader , justice minister christoph blocher , were intensely criticized for a campaigning stance focusing on immigration and crime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp 's black sheep campaign has lost it few voters despite being denounced by the un special rapporteur on racism for inciting racial hatred in its xenophobic campaigning and for pledging to deport non-national criminals , the svp has struck a chord with voters in a country where one in five people is foreign . attempts to label the party as extremist have also failed to derail the svp campaign .
its now notorious campaign poster of a black sheep being kicked out of a field by three white sheep caused outrage with politicians from the other parties but has done little to reduce its growing popularity . the svp campaign also seems to have benefited from the recent outbreak of violence in switzerland which , as one observer put it , replaced the " chocolates and cuckoos " image with one of smashed cars , crushed campaign stands and unflattering headlines in the foreign press about the threat to swiss democracy .
left-wing violence plays into svp 's hands it is widely assumed that the riots in berne on oct .
6 may have played directly into the svp 's hands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police fought protestors with tear gas and batons switzerland was shocked to see scenes of running battles on the streets of the swiss capital with police armed with tear gas fighting back left-wing radicals who disrupted a svp march .
there were 20 people injured , 18 of them officers as the rally in the federal square descended into baton charges under a hail of paving stones and bottles .
until then , the focus of the opposition parties had been on exposing the svp as an extremist organization , in contrast to its self-appointed position at the heart of family , cultural and national values in switzerland .
since the riots , the people 's party has been using the violence to garner further sympathy .
blocher , a millionaire businessman and the minister of justice in the cabinet , blamed the unrest on " the irresponsibility of a left-wing sowing chaos . "
president blames general intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss president calmy-rey called for dialogue and tolerance the swiss president micheline calmy-rey has refused to blame neither left nor right for the divisions and recriminations which have besmirched the campaign , choosing instead to blame everyone , saying the intolerance of the poster campaigns had now spilled onto the streets .
while the right and left wing parties wage their ideological battles away from the streets and back on the podium , the green party continues to make steady gains which , if the rate of their progress is sustained , could be instrumental in the formation of the government .
the greens - the most popular party not represented in the cabinet - could see the strongest gain in support on sunday .
the latest polls see them heading for 10 percent of the vote , up 2.6 percent on the 2003 election , with some observers also predicting that they could further increase that and force their way into government .
a strong green showing at the election may be enough to reduce the majority of the svp .
for that to happen , however , the svp would have to lose ground and while the people 's party stands to have less votes than it did in the 2003 election , it is unlikely that they will lose enough to stop them becoming the majority party in the swiss parliament . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 21.10.2007 voters end bitter election campaign in switzerland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss parliamentary election campaign descended into violent chaos recently polls closed in switzerland on sunday , oct .
21 , ending what may become known as the most acrimonious campaigning in swiss history .
accusations of racism in the far-right swiss people party were the focus of the campaign . votes were being counted after a relatively strong turnout estimated at about 50 percent of the 4.9 million voters . the last opinion poll by swiss television on oct .
10 indicated that the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- was set to win 27.3 percent of the vote , 0.6 percent more than its score in the 2003 election .
the left-of-center social democratic party -lrb- sp / ps -rrb- at 21.7 percent while the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp / pdc / ppd -rrb- and the radicals -lrb- fdp / prd -rrb- were neck and neck with 15.4 and 15.5 percent respectively .
the svp and its leader , justice minister christoph blocher , were intensely criticized for a campaigning stance focusing on immigration and crime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp 's black sheep campaign has lost it few voters despite being denounced by the un special rapporteur on racism for inciting racial hatred in its xenophobic campaigning and for pledging to deport non-national criminals , the svp has struck a chord with voters in a country where one in five people is foreign . attempts to label the party as extremist have also failed to derail the svp campaign .
its now notorious campaign poster of a black sheep being kicked out of a field by three white sheep caused outrage with politicians from the other parties but has done little to reduce its growing popularity . the svp campaign also seems to have benefited from the recent outbreak of violence in switzerland which , as one observer put it , replaced the " chocolates and cuckoos " image with one of smashed cars , crushed campaign stands and unflattering headlines in the foreign press about the threat to swiss democracy .
left-wing violence plays into svp 's hands it is widely assumed that the riots in berne on oct .
6 may have played directly into the svp 's hands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police fought protestors with tear gas and batons switzerland was shocked to see scenes of running battles on the streets of the swiss capital with police armed with tear gas fighting back left-wing radicals who disrupted a svp march .
there were 20 people injured , 18 of them officers as the rally in the federal square descended into baton charges under a hail of paving stones and bottles .
until then , the focus of the opposition parties had been on exposing the svp as an extremist organization , in contrast to its self-appointed position at the heart of family , cultural and national values in switzerland .
since the riots , the people 's party has been using the violence to garner further sympathy .
blocher , a millionaire businessman and the minister of justice in the cabinet , blamed the unrest on " the irresponsibility of a left-wing sowing chaos . "
president blames general intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss president calmy-rey called for dialogue and tolerance the swiss president micheline calmy-rey has refused to blame neither left nor right for the divisions and recriminations which have besmirched the campaign , choosing instead to blame everyone , saying the intolerance of the poster campaigns had now spilled onto the streets .
while the right and left wing parties wage their ideological battles away from the streets and back on the podium , the green party continues to make steady gains which , if the rate of their progress is sustained , could be instrumental in the formation of the government .
the greens - the most popular party not represented in the cabinet - could see the strongest gain in support on sunday .
the latest polls see them heading for 10 percent of the vote , up 2.6 percent on the 2003 election , with some observers also predicting that they could further increase that and force their way into government .
a strong green showing at the election may be enough to reduce the majority of the svp .
for that to happen , however , the svp would have to lose ground and while the people 's party stands to have less votes than it did in the 2003 election , it is unlikely that they will lose enough to stop them becoming the majority party in the swiss parliament . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the winter break originated from poor pitch conditions which in the past led to cancellations of matches .
this season there will be no play between dec .
17 and jan .
31 .
germany is the only big european soccer nation which takes this break .
the english premier league takes no time off and rather has a popular full round of action on boxing day .
there is only a short pause in italy and spain over the festive season .
the issue is on the agenda of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , but plans to scrap the break from 2009 onwards have so far not become reality .
a dfl spokesman said " a few parameters have changed " over the years .
changing parameters reopen discussions erwin staudt , the president of bundesliga champions vfb stuttgart , agreed a change of schedule was worth evaluating .
" this is no sacred cow , you can think about it , " staudt said in a survey by the german dpa news agency .
the only consensus is that the weather no longer warrants the break .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pitches remain ice and snow-free with undersoil heating global warming with less snow is one aspect .
another is that icy pitches no longer exist because all german professional clubs have a heating system for the playing field .
cancellations these days only occur if the stands or stadium roofs ca n't be cleared from snow .
money is another factor as a bundesliga round on boxing day would generate big television audiences and advertising income .
those who favor the break say that players get a mid-season rest .
most clubs allow the players a fortnight off with their families over christmas and new year 's day , followed by a training camp in sunny and warm regions .
a break for rejuvenation is clever , say supporters " other countries say that the germans are clever because the players recuperate and get a breather in this period , " said former germany coach rudi völler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german players are spared games in the worst months sv hamburg coach huub stevens warned that " players will be in action all year if the break no longer exists , " but staudt pointed out that players in england appear to have no problems with this - and they have an even heavier overall match schedule .
a longer summer break would be mandatory if hibernation is scrapped , but völler is probably not the only one who believes that there will never be a common agreement over the issue .

fat-free sausage sounds like an oxymoron , but german food researchers and a butcher have come up with a recipe for it .
but the real question is how the beef and pork wieners taste . it looks like sausage .
it smells like sausage .
and it pretty much tastes like sausage . but instead of the usual 25 percent to 40 percent fat content of a regular sausage , butcher josef pointner 's wurst , which was developed with the fraunhofer institute , is only about 2 percent fat .
entirely fat-free would only be possible in a vegetarian sausage . it was pointner 's customers who gave him the idea for the new recipe , which is made with natural ingredients from pork and beef .

those types with even less fat are typically made with poultry - a switch neither pointner nor his customers said they were willing to make . to bring the fat content down , pointner started by leaving out the bacon , rind and gristle and added water to the mixture instead of extra grease .
the only drawback to the high water content is that the sausage can dry out more easily than the fatty version when not refrigerated . " the first tries completely flopped , " said pointner .
" they were like chewing gum . " after a few more attempts , the results started tasting a bit less like gum and more like sausage .
the butcher called up the fraunhofer institute , a leading research organization in germany , to share the news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nearly fat-free sausage is no substitute for old-fashioned exercise pointner joined the institute in conducting further research and the team has since developed nearly fat-free recipes for a whole spectrum of german sausage varieties . a major german retailer will begin producing the new sausage in the next few weeks , said fraunhofer 's peter eisner . interest from abroad germany may be home to a disproportionately high number of sausage lovers , but the new product is also making waves abroad .

the winter break originated from poor pitch conditions which in the past led to cancellations of matches .
this season there will be no play between dec .
17 and jan .
31 .
germany is the only big european soccer nation which takes this break .
the english premier league takes no time off and rather has a popular full round of action on boxing day .
there is only a short pause in italy and spain over the festive season .
the issue is on the agenda of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , but plans to scrap the break from 2009 onwards have so far not become reality .
a dfl spokesman said " a few parameters have changed " over the years .
changing parameters reopen discussions erwin staudt , the president of bundesliga champions vfb stuttgart , agreed a change of schedule was worth evaluating .
" this is no sacred cow , you can think about it , " staudt said in a survey by the german dpa news agency .
the only consensus is that the weather no longer warrants the break .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pitches remain ice and snow-free with undersoil heating global warming with less snow is one aspect .
another is that icy pitches no longer exist because all german professional clubs have a heating system for the playing field .
cancellations these days only occur if the stands or stadium roofs ca n't be cleared from snow .
money is another factor as a bundesliga round on boxing day would generate big television audiences and advertising income .
those who favor the break say that players get a mid-season rest .
most clubs allow the players a fortnight off with their families over christmas and new year 's day , followed by a training camp in sunny and warm regions .
a break for rejuvenation is clever , say supporters " other countries say that the germans are clever because the players recuperate and get a breather in this period , " said former germany coach rudi völler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german players are spared games in the worst months sv hamburg coach huub stevens warned that " players will be in action all year if the break no longer exists , " but staudt pointed out that players in england appear to have no problems with this - and they have an even heavier overall match schedule .

fat-free sausage sounds like an oxymoron , but german food researchers and a butcher have come up with a recipe for it .
but the real question is how the beef and pork wieners taste . it looks like sausage .
it smells like sausage .
and it pretty much tastes like sausage . but instead of the usual 25 percent to 40 percent fat content of a regular sausage , butcher josef pointner 's wurst , which was developed with the fraunhofer institute , is only about 2 percent fat .
entirely fat-free would only be possible in a vegetarian sausage . it was pointner 's customers who gave him the idea for the new recipe , which is made with natural ingredients from pork and beef . " more and more customers like ms. huber and ms. meier came into the store and said that their husbands were n't allowed to eat pork or beef anymore , " the butcher said . real meat , more water bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors were n't ready to give the ok to low-fat wurst varieties low-fat varieties of sausage were already available , but even these contained 10 percent to 20 percent fat - which his customers ' doctors probably would n't have approved of .
those types with even less fat are typically made with poultry - a switch neither pointner nor his customers said they were willing to make . to bring the fat content down , pointner started by leaving out the bacon , rind and gristle and added water to the mixture instead of extra grease .
the only drawback to the high water content is that the sausage can dry out more easily than the fatty version when not refrigerated . " the first tries completely flopped , " said pointner .
" they were like chewing gum . " after a few more attempts , the results started tasting a bit less like gum and more like sausage .
the butcher called up the fraunhofer institute , a leading research organization in germany , to share the news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nearly fat-free sausage is no substitute for old-fashioned exercise pointner joined the institute in conducting further research and the team has since developed nearly fat-free recipes for a whole spectrum of german sausage varieties . a major german retailer will begin producing the new sausage in the next few weeks , said fraunhofer 's peter eisner . interest from abroad germany may be home to a disproportionately high number of sausage lovers , but the new product is also making waves abroad . " we 're currently talking with a russian company about starting a factory in moscow , " eisner said .
a partner in beijing wants to offer the wurst in international hotels , and interest has come from the us , latin america and other parts of europe as well . marcus bösch -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , ending what may become known as the most acrimonious campaigning in swiss history .
accusations of racism in the far-right swiss people party were the focus of the campaign . votes were being counted after a relatively strong turnout estimated at about 50 percent of the 4.9 million voters . the last opinion poll by swiss television on oct .
10 indicated that the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- was set to win 27.3 percent of the vote , 0.6 percent more than its score in the 2003 election .
the left-of-center social democratic party -lrb- sp / ps -rrb- at 21.7 percent while the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp / pdc / ppd -rrb- and the radicals -lrb- fdp / prd -rrb- were neck and neck with 15.4 and 15.5 percent respectively .
the svp and its leader , justice minister christoph blocher , were intensely criticized for a campaigning stance focusing on immigration and crime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp 's black sheep campaign has lost it few voters despite being denounced by the un special rapporteur on racism for inciting racial hatred in its xenophobic campaigning and for pledging to deport non-national criminals , the svp has struck a chord with voters in a country where one in five people is foreign . attempts to label the party as extremist have also failed to derail the svp campaign .
its now notorious campaign poster of a black sheep being kicked out of a field by three white sheep caused outrage with politicians from the other parties but has done little to reduce its growing popularity . the svp campaign also seems to have benefited from the recent outbreak of violence in switzerland which , as one observer put it , replaced the " chocolates and cuckoos " image with one of smashed cars , crushed campaign stands and unflattering headlines in the foreign press about the threat to swiss democracy .
left-wing violence plays into svp 's hands it is widely assumed that the riots in berne on oct .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police fought protestors with tear gas and batons switzerland was shocked to see scenes of running battles on the streets of the swiss capital with police armed with tear gas fighting back left-wing radicals who disrupted a svp march .
there were 20 people injured , 18 of them officers as the rally in the federal square descended into baton charges under a hail of paving stones and bottles .
until then , the focus of the opposition parties had been on exposing the svp as an extremist organization , in contrast to its self-appointed position at the heart of family , cultural and national values in switzerland .
since the riots , the people 's party has been using the violence to garner further sympathy .
blocher , a millionaire businessman and the minister of justice in the cabinet , blamed the unrest on " the irresponsibility of a left-wing sowing chaos . "
president blames general intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss president calmy-rey called for dialogue and tolerance the swiss president micheline calmy-rey has refused to blame neither left nor right for the divisions and recriminations which have besmirched the campaign , choosing instead to blame everyone , saying the intolerance of the poster campaigns had now spilled onto the streets .
while the right and left wing parties wage their ideological battles away from the streets and back on the podium , the green party continues to make steady gains which , if the rate of their progress is sustained , could be instrumental in the formation of the government .
the greens - the most popular party not represented in the cabinet - could see the strongest gain in support on sunday .
the latest polls see them heading for 10 percent of the vote , up 2.6 percent on the 2003 election , with some observers also predicting that they could further increase that and force their way into government .
a strong green showing at the election may be enough to reduce the majority of the svp .
for that to happen , however , the svp would have to lose ground and while the people 's party stands to have less votes than it did in the 2003 election , it is unlikely that they will lose enough to stop them becoming the majority party in the swiss parliament . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 21.10.2007 voters end bitter election campaign in switzerland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss parliamentary election campaign descended into violent chaos recently polls closed in switzerland on sunday , oct .
21 , ending what may become known as the most acrimonious campaigning in swiss history .
accusations of racism in the far-right swiss people party were the focus of the campaign . votes were being counted after a relatively strong turnout estimated at about 50 percent of the 4.9 million voters . the last opinion poll by swiss television on oct .
10 indicated that the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- was set to win 27.3 percent of the vote , 0.6 percent more than its score in the 2003 election .
the left-of-center social democratic party -lrb- sp / ps -rrb- at 21.7 percent while the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp / pdc / ppd -rrb- and the radicals -lrb- fdp / prd -rrb- were neck and neck with 15.4 and 15.5 percent respectively .
the svp and its leader , justice minister christoph blocher , were intensely criticized for a campaigning stance focusing on immigration and crime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp 's black sheep campaign has lost it few voters despite being denounced by the un special rapporteur on racism for inciting racial hatred in its xenophobic campaigning and for pledging to deport non-national criminals , the svp has struck a chord with voters in a country where one in five people is foreign . attempts to label the party as extremist have also failed to derail the svp campaign .
its now notorious campaign poster of a black sheep being kicked out of a field by three white sheep caused outrage with politicians from the other parties but has done little to reduce its growing popularity . the svp campaign also seems to have benefited from the recent outbreak of violence in switzerland which , as one observer put it , replaced the " chocolates and cuckoos " image with one of smashed cars , crushed campaign stands and unflattering headlines in the foreign press about the threat to swiss democracy .
left-wing violence plays into svp 's hands it is widely assumed that the riots in berne on oct .
6 may have played directly into the svp 's hands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police fought protestors with tear gas and batons switzerland was shocked to see scenes of running battles on the streets of the swiss capital with police armed with tear gas fighting back left-wing radicals who disrupted a svp march .
there were 20 people injured , 18 of them officers as the rally in the federal square descended into baton charges under a hail of paving stones and bottles .
until then , the focus of the opposition parties had been on exposing the svp as an extremist organization , in contrast to its self-appointed position at the heart of family , cultural and national values in switzerland .
since the riots , the people 's party has been using the violence to garner further sympathy .
blocher , a millionaire businessman and the minister of justice in the cabinet , blamed the unrest on " the irresponsibility of a left-wing sowing chaos . "
president blames general intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss president calmy-rey called for dialogue and tolerance the swiss president micheline calmy-rey has refused to blame neither left nor right for the divisions and recriminations which have besmirched the campaign , choosing instead to blame everyone , saying the intolerance of the poster campaigns had now spilled onto the streets .
while the right and left wing parties wage their ideological battles away from the streets and back on the podium , the green party continues to make steady gains which , if the rate of their progress is sustained , could be instrumental in the formation of the government .
the greens - the most popular party not represented in the cabinet - could see the strongest gain in support on sunday .
the latest polls see them heading for 10 percent of the vote , up 2.6 percent on the 2003 election , with some observers also predicting that they could further increase that and force their way into government .
a strong green showing at the election may be enough to reduce the majority of the svp .
for that to happen , however , the svp would have to lose ground and while the people 's party stands to have less votes than it did in the 2003 election , it is unlikely that they will lose enough to stop them becoming the majority party in the swiss parliament . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , ending what may become known as the most acrimonious campaigning in swiss history .
accusations of racism in the far-right swiss people party were the focus of the campaign . votes were being counted after a relatively strong turnout estimated at about 50 percent of the 4.9 million voters . the last opinion poll by swiss television on oct .
10 indicated that the swiss people 's party -lrb- svp -rrb- was set to win 27.3 percent of the vote , 0.6 percent more than its score in the 2003 election .
the left-of-center social democratic party -lrb- sp / ps -rrb- at 21.7 percent while the christian democratic party -lrb- cvp / pdc / ppd -rrb- and the radicals -lrb- fdp / prd -rrb- were neck and neck with 15.4 and 15.5 percent respectively .
the svp and its leader , justice minister christoph blocher , were intensely criticized for a campaigning stance focusing on immigration and crime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the svp 's black sheep campaign has lost it few voters despite being denounced by the un special rapporteur on racism for inciting racial hatred in its xenophobic campaigning and for pledging to deport non-national criminals , the svp has struck a chord with voters in a country where one in five people is foreign . attempts to label the party as extremist have also failed to derail the svp campaign .
its now notorious campaign poster of a black sheep being kicked out of a field by three white sheep caused outrage with politicians from the other parties but has done little to reduce its growing popularity . the svp campaign also seems to have benefited from the recent outbreak of violence in switzerland which , as one observer put it , replaced the " chocolates and cuckoos " image with one of smashed cars , crushed campaign stands and unflattering headlines in the foreign press about the threat to swiss democracy .
left-wing violence plays into svp 's hands it is widely assumed that the riots in berne on oct .
6 may have played directly into the svp 's hands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police fought protestors with tear gas and batons switzerland was shocked to see scenes of running battles on the streets of the swiss capital with police armed with tear gas fighting back left-wing radicals who disrupted a svp march .
there were 20 people injured , 18 of them officers as the rally in the federal square descended into baton charges under a hail of paving stones and bottles .
until then , the focus of the opposition parties had been on exposing the svp as an extremist organization , in contrast to its self-appointed position at the heart of family , cultural and national values in switzerland .
since the riots , the people 's party has been using the violence to garner further sympathy .
blocher , a millionaire businessman and the minister of justice in the cabinet , blamed the unrest on " the irresponsibility of a left-wing sowing chaos . "
president blames general intolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss president calmy-rey called for dialogue and tolerance the swiss president micheline calmy-rey has refused to blame neither left nor right for the divisions and recriminations which have besmirched the campaign , choosing instead to blame everyone , saying the intolerance of the poster campaigns had now spilled onto the streets .
while the right and left wing parties wage their ideological battles away from the streets and back on the podium , the green party continues to make steady gains which , if the rate of their progress is sustained , could be instrumental in the formation of the government .
the greens - the most popular party not represented in the cabinet - could see the strongest gain in support on sunday .
the latest polls see them heading for 10 percent of the vote , up 2.6 percent on the 2003 election , with some observers also predicting that they could further increase that and force their way into government .
a strong green showing at the election may be enough to reduce the majority of the svp .
for that to happen , however , the svp would have to lose ground and while the people 's party stands to have less votes than it did in the 2003 election , it is unlikely that they will lose enough to stop them becoming the majority party in the swiss parliament . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 21.10.2007 common abortion policy remains out of reach in eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abortion issue divides europeans along religious and cultural lines an eu citizen denied an abortion in her own country can freely travel to a member state where it is legal .
but experts say an eu-wide policy that legalizes abortion throughout the bloc infringes on national sovereignty . eu leaders cinched a deal on the european reform treaty on thursday , oct .
18 , but only after overcoming vocal polish objections on voting rights .
one reason behind such obstinacy was the fear that poland in the future could be outvoted if the european union ever decided to make abortion legal throughout the 27 nation bloc . at present , each eu state has its own national laws , which vary considerably in detail with regard to the upper limit as to when a pregnancy can be terminated and under what circumstances an abortion can be permitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters greet dutch " abortion ship " entering polish waters only three of the eu 's 27 member states outlaw abortion : poland , ireland and malta .
in july , portugal legalized abortion up until the 10th week of pregnancy , bringing the overwhelmingly roman catholic country in line with most countries in the eu . poland was also the lone dissenter in the 46-member council of europe that did not sign a declaration against the death penalty as warsaw wanted the document to include condemnations of abortion and euthanasia . the eu 's open borders and guaranteed freedom of movement , however , permit women living in countries with restrictive policies or outright bans to travel abroad to receive an abortion - if they can afford the trip , according to paul bell , a spokesman for the international planned parenthood federation in london . " individual state bans only make access to abortion difficult for the poor , " bell said .
" if a woman can not afford to travel or take time off work , she 'll risk getting an illegal backstreet abortion at home . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abortion became legal in portugal this year between 1980 and 2005 , there were 123,258 women who traveled from ireland to england for abortions , according to the safe and legal abortion rights campaign in ireland . the figures on cross-border abortions tend to be greatly understated , since it is optional for irish women to give out their addresses to abortion clinics in the uk and now with cheap flights to spain , there are alternatives to england , bell added . eu-wide policy infringes on national sovereignty while the ipcc has lobbied the european parliament to make abortion a legal right across the european union , some experts say an eu-wide policy would be undemocratic . " the eu could never achieve a consensus when it comes to controversial policies such as abortion .
harmonizing such national laws only serves to antagonize the public towards the eu , " said maciej golubiewski , a policy expert on eu matters at the sobieski institute , a conservative think tank in warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no eu law can influence irelands 's ban on abortion " national sovereignty is the cornerstone of democracy and our political leadership needs to be responsive to what people want , " he said , adding that the existing polish laws on abortion , which are highly restrictive by eu standards , has very broad support among mainstream political parties to both the right and left . hugo brady , an eu justice expert at the london-based centre for european reform , who said he is generally in favor of european integration added that debates about abortion belong to national legislatures . golubiewski pointed out that poland makes exceptions for therapeutic and non-elective abortions .
earlier this year , the european court of human rights awarded 25,000 euros -lrb- us $ 35,691 -rrb- in damages to alicia tysiac , who sued the polish government for being denied an abortion in 2000 .
tysiac , a 36-year-old , disabled single mother of three who lives on a state pension , sought an abortion because her last pregnancy exacerbated a condition that could make her go blind .
since poland permits abortion for medical reasons , the strasbourg court ruled that the country had violated its own laws . ippf had hailed the case as a victory for abortion rights in the eu , but brady said the eu simply does not have the judicial powers to change national practices .

21 , voted in favor of directly electing the country 's president .
the results , however , were overshadowed by kurdish rebel attacks that killed at least 12 turkish soldiers . an ambush by kurdish rebels was responsible for 17 turkish soldiers ' deaths sunday .
at least 32 kurds are reported to have been killed in the clashes .
prime minister tayyip erdogan called a crisis meeting to consider a military strike against rebel bases in iraq . the attack , one of the worst in more than a decade by rebels of the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , came four days after turkey 's parliament approved a motion to allow troops to enter northern iraq to fight guerrillas hiding there . " we are very angry , " erdogan told reporters .
" our parliament has granted us the authority to act and within this framework we will do whatever has to be done . " cross-border military plans exist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the military has plans for operations in iraq , they wo n't be moving in immediately contrary to pkk claims of capturing several turkish soldiers , turkey 's defense minister vecdi gonul said no hostages were being held by kurdish rebels in northern iraq . " there are no hostages , " gonul told the press after meeting in the ukrainian capital with us defense secretary robert gates . gonul also said ankara had plans to cross the border into iraq but would not do so immediately .
the united states , european union , nato and iraq have all called on turkey not to conduct military actions in iraq out of fear they could destabilize the most peaceful part of iraq . considered a terrorist organization by ankara , the pkk on sunday claimed to have captured a group of turkish soldiers in the volatile region on the turkey-iraq border following heavy clashes between the two sides . " we can not expect turkey to remain silent in the face of attacks like these , " murat yetkin , a commentator for the liberal radikal daily told n-tv television .
" this attack , coming on a day when turkey votes in a referendum , is a very clear provocation .
it shows the pkk is not interested in democratic initiatives . " next president elected by popular vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey will elect its next president by popular vote seventy percent of turks who voted in a referendum sunday said " yes " to constitutional reforms that would make it possible to elect the country 's president by popular vote , with two-thirds of the ballots counted , the high electoral board said . the direct election proposal comes from the governing islamic conservative akp party .
several opposition parties had criticized the plans or called on voters to boycott the referendum .
according to turkish media reports , voting was light in some places . the government has been urging a direct election of the president by the people after initially failing to get foreign minister abdullah gül elected president by the parliament . gül has in the interim finally been elected by the parliament and began his seven-year term in august . a proposed change in the constitution would also reduce the presidential term to five years . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 21.10.2007 opposition party wins landslide in polish elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victory for tusk this time around poland 's liberal civic platform scored a landslide victory in parliamentary elections amid record turnout at the polls , ending the reign of the right-wing law and justice party of prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . the civic platform , or po , party was led by europe-friendly opposition leader donald tusk .
in a victory speech on sunday , oct .
21 , tusk thanked voters " who showed all of europe that in times of difficulty poles can take care of their country in an extraordinarily responsible fashion . " " we 'll do everything to make poland a good home for you , " he vowed , ending the emotional address by singing the polish national anthem along with hundreds of po party faithful gathered at a victory rally in warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski said there were lessons to be learned from the campaign in the wake of the crushing defeat for law and justice , or pis , prime minister kaczynski said : " i wish tusk success .
i congratulate him . " he vowed that pis would be a " hard and decisive opposition , " apparently ruling out any coalition with the archrival liberals .
meanwhile , the po is expected to team up with the peasants ' party to form an outright majority . based on early counts of some three-quarters of the votes , poland 's election commission said the business-friendly po took around 41 percent of the vote , which would give it around 205 of 460 parliamentary seats .
that would put it well past the pis , which took 32 percent of the vote , according to early voter surveys . the left-wing lid took 12 percent while the conservative polish peasants ' party -lrb- psl -rrb- scored 9 percent , exceeding the 5-percent threshold required to enter parliament .
no other party reached 5 percent .
overwhelming turnout turnout soared to around 55 percent , the highest result since poland 's first fully democratic parliamentary election in 1991 .
as a result , some election stations ran out of ballots , and others had to extend voting hours to accommodate the unexpectedly large numbers of voters .
the interest stood in stark contrast to the record low 40-percent turnout in poland 's last parliamentary ballot in september 2005 , which handed kaczynski 's pis a narrow 2.9-percent victory over the liberals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles turned out in force to cast their ballots sunday 's snap ballot came two years early due to the failure of kaczynski 's minority government to forge a stable majority coalition in poland .
more stability ?
once confirmed by poland 's state elections commission in official results , the po victory means political power in poland will cease to be concentrated in the hands of the kaczynski twins .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 21.10.2007 opposition party wins landslide in polish elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victory for tusk this time around poland 's liberal civic platform scored a landslide victory in parliamentary elections amid record turnout at the polls , ending the reign of the right-wing law and justice party of prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski . the civic platform , or po , party was led by europe-friendly opposition leader donald tusk .
in a victory speech on sunday , oct .
21 , tusk thanked voters " who showed all of europe that in times of difficulty poles can take care of their country in an extraordinarily responsible fashion . " " we 'll do everything to make poland a good home for you , " he vowed , ending the emotional address by singing the polish national anthem along with hundreds of po party faithful gathered at a victory rally in warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski said there were lessons to be learned from the campaign in the wake of the crushing defeat for law and justice , or pis , prime minister kaczynski said : " i wish tusk success .
i congratulate him . " he vowed that pis would be a " hard and decisive opposition , " apparently ruling out any coalition with the archrival liberals .
meanwhile , the po is expected to team up with the peasants ' party to form an outright majority . based on early counts of some three-quarters of the votes , poland 's election commission said the business-friendly po took around 41 percent of the vote , which would give it around 205 of 460 parliamentary seats .
that would put it well past the pis , which took 32 percent of the vote , according to early voter surveys . the left-wing lid took 12 percent while the conservative polish peasants ' party -lrb- psl -rrb- scored 9 percent , exceeding the 5-percent threshold required to enter parliament .
no other party reached 5 percent .
overwhelming turnout turnout soared to around 55 percent , the highest result since poland 's first fully democratic parliamentary election in 1991 .
as a result , some election stations ran out of ballots , and others had to extend voting hours to accommodate the unexpectedly large numbers of voters .
the interest stood in stark contrast to the record low 40-percent turnout in poland 's last parliamentary ballot in september 2005 , which handed kaczynski 's pis a narrow 2.9-percent victory over the liberals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles turned out in force to cast their ballots sunday 's snap ballot came two years early due to the failure of kaczynski 's minority government to forge a stable majority coalition in poland .
more stability ?
once confirmed by poland 's state elections commission in official results , the po victory means political power in poland will cease to be concentrated in the hands of the kaczynski twins .
president lech kaczynski 's term in office ends in 2009 .
with a population of 38 million , poland was by far the largest of 10 mostly ex-communist states to have joined the european union in 2004 and has since become a key player in the 27-member bloc . " it was a battle .
we won .
but tomorrow we have to get to work , " tusk told his supporters during his victory speech at his party 's headquarters . president lech kaczynski made no comment on his twin brother 's defeat in parliament , which experts also saw as a vote against the reigning head of state . the election was closely watched by polands eu partners , especially germany , which has seen its relations to poland strained during the kaczynski brothers ' rule . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a victory speech on sunday , oct .
21 , tusk thanked voters " who showed all of europe that in times of difficulty poles can take care of their country in an extraordinarily responsible fashion . " " we 'll do everything to make poland a good home for you , " he vowed , ending the emotional address by singing the polish national anthem along with hundreds of po party faithful gathered at a victory rally in warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski said there were lessons to be learned from the campaign in the wake of the crushing defeat for law and justice , or pis , prime minister kaczynski said : " i wish tusk success .
i congratulate him . " he vowed that pis would be a " hard and decisive opposition , " apparently ruling out any coalition with the archrival liberals .
meanwhile , the po is expected to team up with the peasants ' party to form an outright majority . based on early counts of some three-quarters of the votes , poland 's election commission said the business-friendly po took around 41 percent of the vote , which would give it around 205 of 460 parliamentary seats .
that would put it well past the pis , which took 32 percent of the vote , according to early voter surveys . the left-wing lid took 12 percent while the conservative polish peasants ' party -lrb- psl -rrb- scored 9 percent , exceeding the 5-percent threshold required to enter parliament .
no other party reached 5 percent .
overwhelming turnout turnout soared to around 55 percent , the highest result since poland 's first fully democratic parliamentary election in 1991 .
as a result , some election stations ran out of ballots , and others had to extend voting hours to accommodate the unexpectedly large numbers of voters .
the interest stood in stark contrast to the record low 40-percent turnout in poland 's last parliamentary ballot in september 2005 , which handed kaczynski 's pis a narrow 2.9-percent victory over the liberals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles turned out in force to cast their ballots sunday 's snap ballot came two years early due to the failure of kaczynski 's minority government to forge a stable majority coalition in poland .
more stability ?
once confirmed by poland 's state elections commission in official results , the po victory means political power in poland will cease to be concentrated in the hands of the kaczynski twins .
president lech kaczynski 's term in office ends in 2009 .
with a population of 38 million , poland was by far the largest of 10 mostly ex-communist states to have joined the european union in 2004 and has since become a key player in the 27-member bloc . " it was a battle .
we won .
but tomorrow we have to get to work , " tusk told his supporters during his victory speech at his party 's headquarters . president lech kaczynski made no comment on his twin brother 's defeat in parliament , which experts also saw as a vote against the reigning head of state . the election was closely watched by polands eu partners , especially germany , which has seen its relations to poland strained during the kaczynski brothers ' rule . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but experts say an eu-wide policy that legalizes abortion throughout the bloc infringes on national sovereignty . eu leaders cinched a deal on the european reform treaty on thursday , oct .
18 , but only after overcoming vocal polish objections on voting rights .
one reason behind such obstinacy was the fear that poland in the future could be outvoted if the european union ever decided to make abortion legal throughout the 27 nation bloc . at present , each eu state has its own national laws , which vary considerably in detail with regard to the upper limit as to when a pregnancy can be terminated and under what circumstances an abortion can be permitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters greet dutch " abortion ship " entering polish waters only three of the eu 's 27 member states outlaw abortion : poland , ireland and malta .
in july , portugal legalized abortion up until the 10th week of pregnancy , bringing the overwhelmingly roman catholic country in line with most countries in the eu . poland was also the lone dissenter in the 46-member council of europe that did not sign a declaration against the death penalty as warsaw wanted the document to include condemnations of abortion and euthanasia . the eu 's open borders and guaranteed freedom of movement , however , permit women living in countries with restrictive policies or outright bans to travel abroad to receive an abortion - if they can afford the trip , according to paul bell , a spokesman for the international planned parenthood federation in london . " individual state bans only make access to abortion difficult for the poor , " bell said .
" if a woman can not afford to travel or take time off work , she 'll risk getting an illegal backstreet abortion at home . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abortion became legal in portugal this year between 1980 and 2005 , there were 123,258 women who traveled from ireland to england for abortions , according to the safe and legal abortion rights campaign in ireland . the figures on cross-border abortions tend to be greatly understated , since it is optional for irish women to give out their addresses to abortion clinics in the uk and now with cheap flights to spain , there are alternatives to england , bell added . eu-wide policy infringes on national sovereignty while the ipcc has lobbied the european parliament to make abortion a legal right across the european union , some experts say an eu-wide policy would be undemocratic . " the eu could never achieve a consensus when it comes to controversial policies such as abortion .
harmonizing such national laws only serves to antagonize the public towards the eu , " said maciej golubiewski , a policy expert on eu matters at the sobieski institute , a conservative think tank in warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no eu law can influence irelands 's ban on abortion " national sovereignty is the cornerstone of democracy and our political leadership needs to be responsive to what people want , " he said , adding that the existing polish laws on abortion , which are highly restrictive by eu standards , has very broad support among mainstream political parties to both the right and left . hugo brady , an eu justice expert at the london-based centre for european reform , who said he is generally in favor of european integration added that debates about abortion belong to national legislatures . golubiewski pointed out that poland makes exceptions for therapeutic and non-elective abortions .
earlier this year , the european court of human rights awarded 25,000 euros -lrb- us $ 35,691 -rrb- in damages to alicia tysiac , who sued the polish government for being denied an abortion in 2000 .
tysiac , a 36-year-old , disabled single mother of three who lives on a state pension , sought an abortion because her last pregnancy exacerbated a condition that could make her go blind .
since poland permits abortion for medical reasons , the strasbourg court ruled that the country had violated its own laws . ippf had hailed the case as a victory for abortion rights in the eu , but brady said the eu simply does not have the judicial powers to change national practices .

several opposition parties had criticized the plans or called on voters to boycott the referendum .
according to turkish media reports , voting was light in some places . the government has been urging a direct election of the president by the people after initially failing to get foreign minister abdullah gül elected president by the parliament . gül has in the interim finally been elected by the parliament and began his seven-year term in august . a proposed change in the constitution would also reduce the presidential term to five years . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a victory speech on sunday , oct .
21 , tusk thanked voters " who showed all of europe that in times of difficulty poles can take care of their country in an extraordinarily responsible fashion . " " we 'll do everything to make poland a good home for you , " he vowed , ending the emotional address by singing the polish national anthem along with hundreds of po party faithful gathered at a victory rally in warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski said there were lessons to be learned from the campaign in the wake of the crushing defeat for law and justice , or pis , prime minister kaczynski said : " i wish tusk success .
i congratulate him . " he vowed that pis would be a " hard and decisive opposition , " apparently ruling out any coalition with the archrival liberals .
meanwhile , the po is expected to team up with the peasants ' party to form an outright majority . based on early counts of some three-quarters of the votes , poland 's election commission said the business-friendly po took around 41 percent of the vote , which would give it around 205 of 460 parliamentary seats .
that would put it well past the pis , which took 32 percent of the vote , according to early voter surveys . the left-wing lid took 12 percent while the conservative polish peasants ' party -lrb- psl -rrb- scored 9 percent , exceeding the 5-percent threshold required to enter parliament .
no other party reached 5 percent .
overwhelming turnout turnout soared to around 55 percent , the highest result since poland 's first fully democratic parliamentary election in 1991 .
as a result , some election stations ran out of ballots , and others had to extend voting hours to accommodate the unexpectedly large numbers of voters .
the interest stood in stark contrast to the record low 40-percent turnout in poland 's last parliamentary ballot in september 2005 , which handed kaczynski 's pis a narrow 2.9-percent victory over the liberals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles turned out in force to cast their ballots sunday 's snap ballot came two years early due to the failure of kaczynski 's minority government to forge a stable majority coalition in poland .
more stability ?
once confirmed by poland 's state elections commission in official results , the po victory means political power in poland will cease to be concentrated in the hands of the kaczynski twins .
president lech kaczynski 's term in office ends in 2009 .
with a population of 38 million , poland was by far the largest of 10 mostly ex-communist states to have joined the european union in 2004 and has since become a key player in the 27-member bloc . " it was a battle .
we won .
but tomorrow we have to get to work , " tusk told his supporters during his victory speech at his party 's headquarters . president lech kaczynski made no comment on his twin brother 's defeat in parliament , which experts also saw as a vote against the reigning head of state . the election was closely watched by polands eu partners , especially germany , which has seen its relations to poland strained during the kaczynski brothers ' rule . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but experts say an eu-wide policy that legalizes abortion throughout the bloc infringes on national sovereignty . eu leaders cinched a deal on the european reform treaty on thursday , oct .
18 , but only after overcoming vocal polish objections on voting rights .
one reason behind such obstinacy was the fear that poland in the future could be outvoted if the european union ever decided to make abortion legal throughout the 27 nation bloc . at present , each eu state has its own national laws , which vary considerably in detail with regard to the upper limit as to when a pregnancy can be terminated and under what circumstances an abortion can be permitted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters greet dutch " abortion ship " entering polish waters only three of the eu 's 27 member states outlaw abortion : poland , ireland and malta .
in july , portugal legalized abortion up until the 10th week of pregnancy , bringing the overwhelmingly roman catholic country in line with most countries in the eu . poland was also the lone dissenter in the 46-member council of europe that did not sign a declaration against the death penalty as warsaw wanted the document to include condemnations of abortion and euthanasia . the eu 's open borders and guaranteed freedom of movement , however , permit women living in countries with restrictive policies or outright bans to travel abroad to receive an abortion - if they can afford the trip , according to paul bell , a spokesman for the international planned parenthood federation in london . " individual state bans only make access to abortion difficult for the poor , " bell said .
" if a woman can not afford to travel or take time off work , she 'll risk getting an illegal backstreet abortion at home . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abortion became legal in portugal this year between 1980 and 2005 , there were 123,258 women who traveled from ireland to england for abortions , according to the safe and legal abortion rights campaign in ireland . the figures on cross-border abortions tend to be greatly understated , since it is optional for irish women to give out their addresses to abortion clinics in the uk and now with cheap flights to spain , there are alternatives to england , bell added . eu-wide policy infringes on national sovereignty while the ipcc has lobbied the european parliament to make abortion a legal right across the european union , some experts say an eu-wide policy would be undemocratic . " the eu could never achieve a consensus when it comes to controversial policies such as abortion .
harmonizing such national laws only serves to antagonize the public towards the eu , " said maciej golubiewski , a policy expert on eu matters at the sobieski institute , a conservative think tank in warsaw . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no eu law can influence irelands 's ban on abortion " national sovereignty is the cornerstone of democracy and our political leadership needs to be responsive to what people want , " he said , adding that the existing polish laws on abortion , which are highly restrictive by eu standards , has very broad support among mainstream political parties to both the right and left . hugo brady , an eu justice expert at the london-based centre for european reform , who said he is generally in favor of european integration added that debates about abortion belong to national legislatures . golubiewski pointed out that poland makes exceptions for therapeutic and non-elective abortions .
earlier this year , the european court of human rights awarded 25,000 euros -lrb- us $ 35,691 -rrb- in damages to alicia tysiac , who sued the polish government for being denied an abortion in 2000 .
tysiac , a 36-year-old , disabled single mother of three who lives on a state pension , sought an abortion because her last pregnancy exacerbated a condition that could make her go blind .
since poland permits abortion for medical reasons , the strasbourg court ruled that the country had violated its own laws . ippf had hailed the case as a victory for abortion rights in the eu , but brady said the eu simply does not have the judicial powers to change national practices .

the grade ii-listed y dolydd in llanfyllin is under threat , but there are attempts to turn it into a community arts centre .
it is the only building in wales on the list , drawn up by the victorian society , which is worried its rural setting puts funding in doubt .
in 2004 , the workhouse , built in 1838 , featured in the bbc restoration series .
the society said that the workhouse , built by the county surveyor thomas penson , was a large complex of buildings and a " significant example " of its type .
" a building preservation trust owns the building and there has been a lot of local support for finding a good reuse , " it added .
it raises the profile of the building , and it confirms that it 's a building of national importance john hainsworth , y dolydd building preservation trust " however , the building 's isolated rural setting has worked against it and , with funding doubtful , the future of the building looks increasingly doubtful . "
john hainsworth , of y dolydd building preservation trust , said the victorian society list confirmed the workhouse was of national importance .
" it raises the profile of the building , and it confirms that it 's a building of national importance . "
mr hainsworth said the trust had until december to raise £ 340,000 to repay a loan from the architectural heritage fund used to buy the building .
the latest plans are to convert the workhouse into a community arts centre , office space and accommodation for tourists .

but he has reached even greater heights for his new fundraiser - trekking for ten days to reach everest base camp .
peters , 48 , from dyserth , denbighshire , will play with other musicians such as squeeze 's glenn tilbrook at 19,000ft .
the group are raising money for a cancer centre in nepal , but first they faced a three-hour trek followed by a four-hour climb to reach their special stage .
speaking from the himalayas on saturday , peters , said his training in north wales had helped him get ready .
" it 's been pretty hard with the altitude .
we have had to acclimatise , " said peters , a keen walker , who helped organise the everest rocks trek .
" there are a lot of people on our trek - 40 people , not including the sherpas and porters - and 18 went down with mountain sickness yesterday .
it 's been an amazing cultural experience on many levels mike peters " i have been pretty good so far. and have been able to stand up to the altitude but i did a lot of training in north wales in snowdonia . "
peters first beat leukaemia 12 years ago .

" we have got some great musicians on the trek and we 're stopping to play music wherever we go . "
he added : " having the music with us has been pretty special .
last night in the lodge the power went out and we had a big sing-song with all the sherpas in nepalese and it was a pretty magical moment . "
after completing their everest gig , the musicians will thank local people for their support with a concert in kathmandu .
" i sang one of our welsh songs - new south wales - in one of the himalayan villages on the way up and all the local children , they loved it , " peters said .
" it 's been an amazing cultural experience on many levels . "

the 65-year-old , whose death sentence was overturned twice before a third jury convicted him in the early 1990s , is alive on the state 's death row - but only just .
although no physical evidence placed him at the scene , he was convicted of shooting troy wicker in his bed after being paid $ 10,000 by the victim 's wife , with whom he had had an affair .
the twists and turns of the case , and the tangled relationships involved , are worthy of a grim detective novel .
but ultimately the jury , and state law , dictated arthur should die .
he missed his last appointment with a lethal-injection syringe by only a few hours at the end of last month .
alabama 's governor has made it clear he wants arthur to die as soon as possible , and that the current furore over the chemicals used to deliver the ultimate punishment is an annoying distraction .
although many death penalty abolitionists are viewing the us supreme court 's decision to review the constitutionality of the existing chemical cocktail with hope , the fact is that states like alabama guard their rights very carefully - and few more so than the right to execution .
' i want justice ' the founder of alabama victims ' rights group vocal -lrb- victims of crime and leniency -rrb- , miriam shenane , is more than just irritated by arthur 's latest stay of execution .
putting them to death , even with the electric chair , is not nearly as horrible as what they did to my daughter miriam shenane victims of crime and leniency she says the governor has traumatised the victim 's family , and others all over the state .
" what do we have to do ?
put a mask over them and just take away their oxygen ?
i want justice , " she said , in her office in the state capital , montgomery .
the white walls are covered in photographs of " angels " - the word she uses to describe all the innocent people who have been murdered in alabama .
her own daughter was raped and murdered by three men , one of whom has been executed .
she would feel much better if the other two followed him .
" putting them to death , even with the electric chair , is not nearly as horrible as what they did to my daughter . "
' murder my father ' tommy arthur 's daughter , sherrie arthur stone , was still a teenager when her father was first sentenced to death .
sherrie arthur stone believes dna evidence would clear her father for years , she thought he was probably guilty , and deserved the jail time he spent earlier in his life .
but now she is convinced of his innocence , fuelled largely by her disillusionment with a judicial system she views as callous and incompetent in alabama .
articulate and earnest , but clearly scarred by years of legal and emotional battle , she stopped living in the state a long time ago .
" i was basically told by investigators , if i did n't leave the state , i 'd be found dead on a back road , " she told the bbc .
" they clearly want to murder my father , which is what this is going to be .
it 's not going to be an execution , it 's going to be a murder . "
amnesty international supports her argument that dna testing of the evidence - which has yet to take place - could exonerate arthur .
tool of justice the state is equally adamant that they will not allow that to happen - even if arthur 's family pays for the dna testing .
clay crenshaw believes there have been no miscarriages of justice " there have been three federal judges now ... they have all agreed that the results of dna testing would not show that arthur is innocent , " said clay crenshaw , alabama 's deputy attorney general in charge of capital cases .
it might strike many as a paradox , but mr crenshaw believes that in a culture that values human life above all , the right to take that life away is an essential tool of justice .
" the reason to have the death penalty is to keep those people who commit these violent acts off of the street , and hopefully prevent other people from committing those type of crimes , " he added .
he believes that the unofficial moratorium on executions in many states over the lethal injection issue is not the beginning of the end for the death penalty in states like alabama .
" to me it appears the opposite is happening , " he said , arguing that states that make use of the death penalty are determined to cling on to it by whatever means necessary .
historic injustice less than a mile from the rather shabby state government buildings in downtown montgomery is the office of the equal justice initiative , which is home to a clutch of lawyers who are determined to close death row down .
some death penalty critics say it is tied to a history of racial injustice executive director bryan stevenson says the entire prosecutorial system in his home state is riddled with incompetence and not-so-latent racism , that perpetuates an historic injustice between black and white in the entire deep south .
sitting on top of that system is the death penalty , he says .

the 65-year-old , whose death sentence was overturned twice before a third jury convicted him in the early 1990s , is alive on the state 's death row - but only just .
although no physical evidence placed him at the scene , he was convicted of shooting troy wicker in his bed after being paid $ 10,000 by the victim 's wife , with whom he had had an affair .
the twists and turns of the case , and the tangled relationships involved , are worthy of a grim detective novel .
but ultimately the jury , and state law , dictated arthur should die .
he missed his last appointment with a lethal-injection syringe by only a few hours at the end of last month .
alabama 's governor has made it clear he wants arthur to die as soon as possible , and that the current furore over the chemicals used to deliver the ultimate punishment is an annoying distraction .
although many death penalty abolitionists are viewing the us supreme court 's decision to review the constitutionality of the existing chemical cocktail with hope , the fact is that states like alabama guard their rights very carefully - and few more so than the right to execution .
' i want justice ' the founder of alabama victims ' rights group vocal -lrb- victims of crime and leniency -rrb- , miriam shenane , is more than just irritated by arthur 's latest stay of execution .
putting them to death , even with the electric chair , is not nearly as horrible as what they did to my daughter miriam shenane victims of crime and leniency she says the governor has traumatised the victim 's family , and others all over the state .
" what do we have to do ?
put a mask over them and just take away their oxygen ?
i want justice , " she said , in her office in the state capital , montgomery .
the white walls are covered in photographs of " angels " - the word she uses to describe all the innocent people who have been murdered in alabama .
her own daughter was raped and murdered by three men , one of whom has been executed .
she would feel much better if the other two followed him .
" putting them to death , even with the electric chair , is not nearly as horrible as what they did to my daughter . "
' murder my father ' tommy arthur 's daughter , sherrie arthur stone , was still a teenager when her father was first sentenced to death .
sherrie arthur stone believes dna evidence would clear her father for years , she thought he was probably guilty , and deserved the jail time he spent earlier in his life .
but now she is convinced of his innocence , fuelled largely by her disillusionment with a judicial system she views as callous and incompetent in alabama .
articulate and earnest , but clearly scarred by years of legal and emotional battle , she stopped living in the state a long time ago .
" i was basically told by investigators , if i did n't leave the state , i 'd be found dead on a back road , " she told the bbc .
" they clearly want to murder my father , which is what this is going to be .
it 's not going to be an execution , it 's going to be a murder . "
amnesty international supports her argument that dna testing of the evidence - which has yet to take place - could exonerate arthur .
tool of justice the state is equally adamant that they will not allow that to happen - even if arthur 's family pays for the dna testing .
clay crenshaw believes there have been no miscarriages of justice " there have been three federal judges now ... they have all agreed that the results of dna testing would not show that arthur is innocent , " said clay crenshaw , alabama 's deputy attorney general in charge of capital cases .
it might strike many as a paradox , but mr crenshaw believes that in a culture that values human life above all , the right to take that life away is an essential tool of justice .
" the reason to have the death penalty is to keep those people who commit these violent acts off of the street , and hopefully prevent other people from committing those type of crimes , " he added .
he believes that the unofficial moratorium on executions in many states over the lethal injection issue is not the beginning of the end for the death penalty in states like alabama .
" to me it appears the opposite is happening , " he said , arguing that states that make use of the death penalty are determined to cling on to it by whatever means necessary .
historic injustice less than a mile from the rather shabby state government buildings in downtown montgomery is the office of the equal justice initiative , which is home to a clutch of lawyers who are determined to close death row down .
some death penalty critics say it is tied to a history of racial injustice executive director bryan stevenson says the entire prosecutorial system in his home state is riddled with incompetence and not-so-latent racism , that perpetuates an historic injustice between black and white in the entire deep south .
sitting on top of that system is the death penalty , he says .
