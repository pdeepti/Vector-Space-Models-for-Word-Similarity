" many brewers have no choice but to raise their prices , " said kai schuerholt , a spokesman for the german brewers ' association .
" they decided not to pass on the three-percentage point rise in value-added tax that came into force in germany on jan .
1 , but in this case they have no alternative . "
the german arm of belgian brewer inbev , which owns the beck 's and franziskaner brands , confirmed it would be implementing " slight " price rises , while germany 's radeberger said it was considering a similar move .
it is hard to overstate the importance of beer in germany - it is drunk in vast quantities and the market is fiercely competitive and extremely price-sensitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's oktoberfest is one big beer-drinking party a half-liter -lrb- one pint -rrb- glass currently costs as little as three euros -lrb- four dollars -rrb- in a bar or restaurant , a price that makes drinkers in most other western european countries green with envy .
average annual consumption of beer in germany last year was 111.6 liters per head , equivalent to every one of the country 's 82 million people drinking a 0.31-liter glass every day , according to figures released on friday .
energy security vs. food security ?
but the price of barley , which is used to make malt , an essential ingredient in brewing , has doubled in the space of a year from 200 to 400 euros per ton on the german market .
brewers and farmers say an extremely poor barley harvest in 2006 has exacerbated an emerging trend of converting barley fields to growing the plants used in biofuels , such as rapeseed .
the amount of land used for growing barley in germany is receding by 5 percent a year .
the march of biofuels is inexorable .
of the 12 million hectares -lrb- 30 million acres -rrb- farmed in germany , two million are already being used for plants that can be turned into biofuel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed fields are commonplace in germany " biofuels are monopolizing the land , " said manfred weizbauer , the head of the german millers ' federation , which is calling for a cut in the subsidies granted to biofuel crops .
" the german government has got to be reasonable and not give more importance to energy security than to food security , " he said .
the impact of the biofuels is not restricted to beer , with the price of bread likely to rise by 10 percent as a result of reduced grain production , the german bakers ' federation has warned .
sign of the times germany is not alone in experiencing the effects of converting arable land to new uses .
although it is not suffering the potentially catastrophic consequences felt by mexico , where the phenomenon has caused maize prices to climb sharply , german millers fear the effects of steadily rising cereal prices .
the biofuels policy is encouraged by the european union , which wants vehicle fuel to contain at least 10 percent of the " green " fuel by 2020 .
but jens redemacher , the head of the cereals division of the federation of german farmers , said the brewers also had themselves to blame .
" they have demanded lower and lower prices for barley which has caused farmers to abandon growing it because it was no longer profitable .
so biofuels are not the only culprits , " he said .
the food industry is " just going to have to get used to having a competitor for the purchase of cereals , especially those used for biofuels , " redemacher said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the booze wars : a german city takes on public drinking while the german states and the federal government argue over a blanket ban on smoking in public places , others want to restrict the use of another legal drug : alcohol .

" we 're going to use less blood in the beginning so the actors do n't slip , " producer barrie kosky said in an interview with berliner zeitung before sunday 's premiere .
the opera is n't recommended for viewers under 16 .
whether despite or because of the blood , murder and nudity , sunday 's crowd at berlin 's komische oper cheered the modern version of the ancient tale , and culture magazine cicero called it " a great evening of humanity . "
sacrifice at abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geraldine mcgreevy plays the priestess iphigenia iphigenia , the title character , is a priestess and prisoner of king thoas on the island of tauris .
the king , who heard in an oracle that he was going to be killed at the hands of a foreigner , orders iphigenia to kill anyone who makes it onto the island in a sacrifice to goddess diana .
the opera opens with the priestess doing her job .
iphigenia drags a lifeless body across the stage to the rhythm of the music , slits its necks and collects the dripping blood .
soldiers in us fatigues bring iphigenia more victims and before the executions , the soldiers pose for pictures with the corpses , whose heads are wrapped in plastic bags .
" it was n't the naked seniors that hurt , but the over-naturalism of the beginning , where thoas ' prisoners were humiliated by their myrmidon charges a la abu ghraib , " cicero wrote , referring to the disrobed actors who appear in the background .
" the issue is still too close , as if one could ignore the fact that each reference also has to do with living people , who maybe do n't want to become just threads in the fabric of the world 's collective images , " the magazine continued .
for kosky , sacrifice is the most interesting part of the opera . " the idea of sacrifice runs through so many cultures , " he said , mentioning the story of abraham and isaac , which is significant to christian , jews and muslims .
a subtle love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the love story plays out between pylades -lrb- right -rrb- and orestes like abraham , iphigenia stops her knife in mid-air during one of the many sacrifices .
she recognized her brother orestes , who had come to the island with his boyfriend , pylades , after having killed his mother .
her brother 's appearance forces the priestess to choose between her heart and duty .
her heart wins out and she lets her brother live .
throughout the opera , the audience is left wondering about orestes ' sexuality .
" somebody once told me there was no love story in iphigenia , " kosky told the berliner zeitung .
" but i think there is one , and it happens between two men .
but this is no gay pride production .
the audience members have to decide for themselves what happened between the two of them . " christoph willibald gluck , one of germany ’ s great opera composers and a reformer of the genre , set the greek mythological tale of priestess iphigenia in 1779 .

it 's a result that 's not surprising and the french are now hopeful that a serious debate will take place until the second round of voting .
that 's also desirable from a german point of view , because maybe it would make it easier for us to understand what to think of the two candidates when it comes to european policy and the franco-german relationship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anke hagedorn the election campaign so far has been a slick one - there was no overriding issue that really stuck .
it 's a far cry from the last presidential elections five years ago , when one topic , domestic safety , dominated .
this time the candidates sounded off on a whole range of issues and staged an equal number of gimmicky appearances , hoping to pull in voters . clad in jeans and sunglasses , sarkozy in the end presented himself as a mixture of cowboy and white knight , sitting on a white horse .
his message : i take charge , but i 've got my feet firmly on the ground and am also a nature-lover . centrist candidate francois bayrou , who portrayed himself as a farmer and father of six children and who had not been taken seriously by anyone at the beginning , eventually finished with a respectable result .
earlier , sarkozy enjoyed alternating between the role of savior of the nation and sacrificial lamb .
one day he flirted with trade unions while courting employers on the next .
he openly tried to woo right-extremist voters of the front national with proposals such as expelling all illegals in france and founding a ministry for immigration and national identity .
he did not tolerate competitors , be it among political adversaries or within his own ranks .
everyone , who stood in his way , was brushed aside without mercy .
editors in chief had to hand in resignations for negative coverage of sarkozy .
he threatened azouz begag , until recently minister for equal opportunities , because the latter had allegedly not been loyal .
it 's a bad omen when one thinks about what this man could do when he actually commands power .
usually dressed in a white business suit and wearing a glowing smile , segolene royal on the other hand presented herself as the new jeanne d 'arc .
she developed a new kind of communication tactic for the campaign , so-called participatory democracy .
she stood in the middle of an audience and made people believe that she was listening to them .
the only problem was it did n't work .
she usually seemed uptight and not ready for dialogue .
few managed to get to ask questions and many did n't get any answers .
it quickly led people to become disenchanted after a sky-rocketing start to the campaign .
francois bayrou hit the nail on the head when he talked about the dilemma of the voters .
" everyone 's uncertain , " he said .
" some , because they know where sarkozy would lead them and others , because they do not know where royal would take them . "
one can only hope that both candidates realize before may 6 that voters expect more than a superficial exchange of words .
they want concrete solutions , because there 's a lot of work to do in the grande nation , which has lost a lot of greatness in recent times - especially when it comes to the economy .
france has the highest unemployment rate within the euro zone , one of the lowest economic growth rates and a record trade deficit .

" we 're going to use less blood in the beginning so the actors do n't slip , " producer barrie kosky said in an interview with berliner zeitung before sunday 's premiere .
the opera is n't recommended for viewers under 16 .
whether despite or because of the blood , murder and nudity , sunday 's crowd at berlin 's komische oper cheered the modern version of the ancient tale , and culture magazine cicero called it " a great evening of humanity . "
sacrifice at abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geraldine mcgreevy plays the priestess iphigenia iphigenia , the title character , is a priestess and prisoner of king thoas on the island of tauris .
the king , who heard in an oracle that he was going to be killed at the hands of a foreigner , orders iphigenia to kill anyone who makes it onto the island in a sacrifice to goddess diana .
the opera opens with the priestess doing her job .
iphigenia drags a lifeless body across the stage to the rhythm of the music , slits its necks and collects the dripping blood .
soldiers in us fatigues bring iphigenia more victims and before the executions , the soldiers pose for pictures with the corpses , whose heads are wrapped in plastic bags .
" it was n't the naked seniors that hurt , but the over-naturalism of the beginning , where thoas ' prisoners were humiliated by their myrmidon charges a la abu ghraib , " cicero wrote , referring to the disrobed actors who appear in the background .
" the issue is still too close , as if one could ignore the fact that each reference also has to do with living people , who maybe do n't want to become just threads in the fabric of the world 's collective images , " the magazine continued .
for kosky , sacrifice is the most interesting part of the opera . " the idea of sacrifice runs through so many cultures , " he said , mentioning the story of abraham and isaac , which is significant to christian , jews and muslims .
a subtle love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the love story plays out between pylades -lrb- right -rrb- and orestes like abraham , iphigenia stops her knife in mid-air during one of the many sacrifices .
she recognized her brother orestes , who had come to the island with his boyfriend , pylades , after having killed his mother .
her brother 's appearance forces the priestess to choose between her heart and duty .
her heart wins out and she lets her brother live .
throughout the opera , the audience is left wondering about orestes ' sexuality .
" somebody once told me there was no love story in iphigenia , " kosky told the berliner zeitung .
" but i think there is one , and it happens between two men .
but this is no gay pride production .
the audience members have to decide for themselves what happened between the two of them . " christoph willibald gluck , one of germany ’ s great opera composers and a reformer of the genre , set the greek mythological tale of priestess iphigenia in 1779 .

royal 's result was a huge relief for the opposition socialist party which had feared a repeat of the 2002 shock when then prime minister lionel jospin was humiliatingly knocked out of the race in the first round by far-right national front leader jean-marie le pen .
this time le pen was in shock after he came in fourth , with 10.51 percent .

" we 're going to use less blood in the beginning so the actors do n't slip , " producer barrie kosky said in an interview with berliner zeitung before sunday 's premiere .
the opera is n't recommended for viewers under 16 .
whether despite or because of the blood , murder and nudity , sunday 's crowd at berlin 's komische oper cheered the modern version of the ancient tale , and culture magazine cicero called it " a great evening of humanity . "
sacrifice at abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geraldine mcgreevy plays the priestess iphigenia iphigenia , the title character , is a priestess and prisoner of king thoas on the island of tauris .
the king , who heard in an oracle that he was going to be killed at the hands of a foreigner , orders iphigenia to kill anyone who makes it onto the island in a sacrifice to goddess diana .
the opera opens with the priestess doing her job .
iphigenia drags a lifeless body across the stage to the rhythm of the music , slits its necks and collects the dripping blood .
soldiers in us fatigues bring iphigenia more victims and before the executions , the soldiers pose for pictures with the corpses , whose heads are wrapped in plastic bags .
" it was n't the naked seniors that hurt , but the over-naturalism of the beginning , where thoas ' prisoners were humiliated by their myrmidon charges a la abu ghraib , " cicero wrote , referring to the disrobed actors who appear in the background .
" the issue is still too close , as if one could ignore the fact that each reference also has to do with living people , who maybe do n't want to become just threads in the fabric of the world 's collective images , " the magazine continued .
for kosky , sacrifice is the most interesting part of the opera . " the idea of sacrifice runs through so many cultures , " he said , mentioning the story of abraham and isaac , which is significant to christian , jews and muslims .
a subtle love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the love story plays out between pylades -lrb- right -rrb- and orestes like abraham , iphigenia stops her knife in mid-air during one of the many sacrifices .
she recognized her brother orestes , who had come to the island with his boyfriend , pylades , after having killed his mother .
her brother 's appearance forces the priestess to choose between her heart and duty .
her heart wins out and she lets her brother live .
throughout the opera , the audience is left wondering about orestes ' sexuality .
" somebody once told me there was no love story in iphigenia , " kosky told the berliner zeitung .
" but i think there is one , and it happens between two men .
but this is no gay pride production .
the audience members have to decide for themselves what happened between the two of them . " christoph willibald gluck , one of germany ’ s great opera composers and a reformer of the genre , set the greek mythological tale of priestess iphigenia in 1779 .

in an interview published monday , german chancellor angela merkel said she did not expect washington to adopt european goals on climate protection at an eu-us summit next week . " i do not think the us will adopt the european climate protection goals , " merkel told the daily münchener merkur . but she said there was growing awareness in the united states and within the us government that reducing greenhouse gas emissions was crucial . " i have been pleased at international meetings to see a growing feeling for a common , global responsibility -lrb- for climate protection -rrb- , " she said .

" we 're going to use less blood in the beginning so the actors do n't slip , " producer barrie kosky said in an interview with berliner zeitung before sunday 's premiere .
the opera is n't recommended for viewers under 16 .
whether despite or because of the blood , murder and nudity , sunday 's crowd at berlin 's komische oper cheered the modern version of the ancient tale , and culture magazine cicero called it " a great evening of humanity . "
sacrifice at abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geraldine mcgreevy plays the priestess iphigenia iphigenia , the title character , is a priestess and prisoner of king thoas on the island of tauris .
the king , who heard in an oracle that he was going to be killed at the hands of a foreigner , orders iphigenia to kill anyone who makes it onto the island in a sacrifice to goddess diana .
the opera opens with the priestess doing her job .
iphigenia drags a lifeless body across the stage to the rhythm of the music , slits its necks and collects the dripping blood .
soldiers in us fatigues bring iphigenia more victims and before the executions , the soldiers pose for pictures with the corpses , whose heads are wrapped in plastic bags .
" it was n't the naked seniors that hurt , but the over-naturalism of the beginning , where thoas ' prisoners were humiliated by their myrmidon charges a la abu ghraib , " cicero wrote , referring to the disrobed actors who appear in the background .
" the issue is still too close , as if one could ignore the fact that each reference also has to do with living people , who maybe do n't want to become just threads in the fabric of the world 's collective images , " the magazine continued .
for kosky , sacrifice is the most interesting part of the opera . " the idea of sacrifice runs through so many cultures , " he said , mentioning the story of abraham and isaac , which is significant to christian , jews and muslims .
a subtle love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the love story plays out between pylades -lrb- right -rrb- and orestes like abraham , iphigenia stops her knife in mid-air during one of the many sacrifices .
she recognized her brother orestes , who had come to the island with his boyfriend , pylades , after having killed his mother .
her brother 's appearance forces the priestess to choose between her heart and duty .
her heart wins out and she lets her brother live .
throughout the opera , the audience is left wondering about orestes ' sexuality .
" somebody once told me there was no love story in iphigenia , " kosky told the berliner zeitung .
" but i think there is one , and it happens between two men .
but this is no gay pride production .
the audience members have to decide for themselves what happened between the two of them . " christoph willibald gluck , one of germany ’ s great opera composers and a reformer of the genre , set the greek mythological tale of priestess iphigenia in 1779 .

people wanted to wipe out the memory of april 21 , " he wrote , referring to the 2002 election first round , when huge abstention and a high vote for the political extremes meant that national front leader jean-marie le pen qualified for round two instead of the socialist lionel jospin .
" what it means is that this time there will be no sense of frustration on the eve of the second round .
people will have the means to make a clear choice .
they will make one , and the country will discover what direction it has chosen , and what direction it must now take , " he wrote . for christophe barbier , editor of l 'express news magazine , " the french wanted so much to have this head-to-head between royal and sarkozy - between a left in the process of renewal and a confident new right . "
barbier added that sarkozy should have the advantage ahead of the second round run-off on may 6 , counting on carry-over votes from far-right leader jean-marie le pen and centrist francois bayrou .
" but nothing is decided , " he added .
" segolene royal has one important weapon : the ' anyone but sarko ' option .
we can expect a second round which brings out all his character faults and ideological excesses .
in short - it 's back to where we were at the start of the campaign . " british newspapers on monday also noted that the high turnout in the first-round of french elections was a sign of the polls ' importance , and warned that a fierce clash was forthcoming . the daily telegraph , a right-wing paper , wrote france is " as its people recognize , in trouble - and this election is , as the high turnout yesterday indicates , its best chance to turn things around . "
in an editorial titled " france needs sarkozy " it continued to say that between the two candidates left , " it is mr sarkozy who is likeliest to embrace the painful structural changes that france so desperately needs .
but before that , he needs to win an election - far from a sure thing , especially in this most fascinating of contests . " in germany , business daily financial times deutschland warned that the two weeks until the final round would be marked by " extreme polarization " as the campaign grows " tougher , more ruthless and more personal . "
but it said royal and sarkozy did not represent two radically different ends of the political spectrum .
" to the contrary : the last weeks have shown that each candidate constantly took on board the populist demands of the other to try to best his or her opponent .
in the end , there may be a close outcome and a france deeply divided into two camps . " the conservative broadsheet frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also noted the remarkably high turnout at the polls .
" apparently the french were fascinated by a campaign that was fixated on personalities . "
it said that royal had done better than expected while sarkozy could be satisfied with meeting his goal of seizing 30 percent of the vote in the first round .
" with a campaign that started with a liberal tone , then took on more and more gaullist accents and at the end leaned sharply to the right , he exhausted his own voter potential while luring le pen voters . " spanish daily el pais meanwhile said that royal 's " only chance to defeat sarkozy will be to seek bayrou 's support , but this will not be easy .
sarkozy is still the best armed candidate to enter the elysee which does not mean that his victory is guaranteed because of the powerful rejection and hatred he provokes among some french voters , " the paper said . for italy 's la stampa , " the absolute novelty is the presence of a woman who had been expected to be defeated in the first round ... the french will now be able to choose not only between two very different political options but also between a man and woman , " the newspaper said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sarkozy , royal open duel for french presidency conservative nicolas sarkozy and socialist segolene royal face off in a dramatic left-right battle for the french presidency after winning round one of an election marked by a near record turnout .

people wanted to wipe out the memory of april 21 , " he wrote , referring to the 2002 election first round , when huge abstention and a high vote for the political extremes meant that national front leader jean-marie le pen qualified for round two instead of the socialist lionel jospin .
" what it means is that this time there will be no sense of frustration on the eve of the second round .
people will have the means to make a clear choice .
they will make one , and the country will discover what direction it has chosen , and what direction it must now take , " he wrote . for christophe barbier , editor of l 'express news magazine , " the french wanted so much to have this head-to-head between royal and sarkozy - between a left in the process of renewal and a confident new right . "
barbier added that sarkozy should have the advantage ahead of the second round run-off on may 6 , counting on carry-over votes from far-right leader jean-marie le pen and centrist francois bayrou .
" but nothing is decided , " he added .
" segolene royal has one important weapon : the ' anyone but sarko ' option .
we can expect a second round which brings out all his character faults and ideological excesses .
in short - it 's back to where we were at the start of the campaign . " british newspapers on monday also noted that the high turnout in the first-round of french elections was a sign of the polls ' importance , and warned that a fierce clash was forthcoming . the daily telegraph , a right-wing paper , wrote france is " as its people recognize , in trouble - and this election is , as the high turnout yesterday indicates , its best chance to turn things around . "
in an editorial titled " france needs sarkozy " it continued to say that between the two candidates left , " it is mr sarkozy who is likeliest to embrace the painful structural changes that france so desperately needs .
but before that , he needs to win an election - far from a sure thing , especially in this most fascinating of contests . " in germany , business daily financial times deutschland warned that the two weeks until the final round would be marked by " extreme polarization " as the campaign grows " tougher , more ruthless and more personal . "
but it said royal and sarkozy did not represent two radically different ends of the political spectrum .
" to the contrary : the last weeks have shown that each candidate constantly took on board the populist demands of the other to try to best his or her opponent .
in the end , there may be a close outcome and a france deeply divided into two camps . " the conservative broadsheet frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also noted the remarkably high turnout at the polls .
" apparently the french were fascinated by a campaign that was fixated on personalities . "
it said that royal had done better than expected while sarkozy could be satisfied with meeting his goal of seizing 30 percent of the vote in the first round .
" with a campaign that started with a liberal tone , then took on more and more gaullist accents and at the end leaned sharply to the right , he exhausted his own voter potential while luring le pen voters . " spanish daily el pais meanwhile said that royal 's " only chance to defeat sarkozy will be to seek bayrou 's support , but this will not be easy .
sarkozy is still the best armed candidate to enter the elysee which does not mean that his victory is guaranteed because of the powerful rejection and hatred he provokes among some french voters , " the paper said . for italy 's la stampa , " the absolute novelty is the presence of a woman who had been expected to be defeated in the first round ... the french will now be able to choose not only between two very different political options but also between a man and woman , " the newspaper said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sarkozy , royal open duel for french presidency conservative nicolas sarkozy and socialist segolene royal face off in a dramatic left-right battle for the french presidency after winning round one of an election marked by a near record turnout .

" we 're going to use less blood in the beginning so the actors do n't slip , " producer barrie kosky said in an interview with berliner zeitung before sunday 's premiere .
the opera is n't recommended for viewers under 16 .
whether despite or because of the blood , murder and nudity , sunday 's crowd at berlin 's komische oper cheered the modern version of the ancient tale , and culture magazine cicero called it " a great evening of humanity . "
sacrifice at abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geraldine mcgreevy plays the priestess iphigenia iphigenia , the title character , is a priestess and prisoner of king thoas on the island of tauris .
the king , who heard in an oracle that he was going to be killed at the hands of a foreigner , orders iphigenia to kill anyone who makes it onto the island in a sacrifice to goddess diana .
the opera opens with the priestess doing her job .
iphigenia drags a lifeless body across the stage to the rhythm of the music , slits its necks and collects the dripping blood .
soldiers in us fatigues bring iphigenia more victims and before the executions , the soldiers pose for pictures with the corpses , whose heads are wrapped in plastic bags .
" it was n't the naked seniors that hurt , but the over-naturalism of the beginning , where thoas ' prisoners were humiliated by their myrmidon charges a la abu ghraib , " cicero wrote , referring to the disrobed actors who appear in the background .
" the issue is still too close , as if one could ignore the fact that each reference also has to do with living people , who maybe do n't want to become just threads in the fabric of the world 's collective images , " the magazine continued .
for kosky , sacrifice is the most interesting part of the opera . " the idea of sacrifice runs through so many cultures , " he said , mentioning the story of abraham and isaac , which is significant to christian , jews and muslims .
a subtle love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the love story plays out between pylades -lrb- right -rrb- and orestes like abraham , iphigenia stops her knife in mid-air during one of the many sacrifices .
she recognized her brother orestes , who had come to the island with his boyfriend , pylades , after having killed his mother .
her brother 's appearance forces the priestess to choose between her heart and duty .
her heart wins out and she lets her brother live .
throughout the opera , the audience is left wondering about orestes ' sexuality .
" somebody once told me there was no love story in iphigenia , " kosky told the berliner zeitung .
" but i think there is one , and it happens between two men .
but this is no gay pride production .
the audience members have to decide for themselves what happened between the two of them . " christoph willibald gluck , one of germany ’ s great opera composers and a reformer of the genre , set the greek mythological tale of priestess iphigenia in 1779 .

royal 's result was a huge relief for the opposition socialist party which had feared a repeat of the 2002 shock when then prime minister lionel jospin was humiliatingly knocked out of the race in the first round by far-right national front leader jean-marie le pen .
this time le pen was in shock after he came in fourth , with 10.51 percent .
democratic awakening bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy thanked supporters on sunday jean-marie colombani , editor-in-chief of le monde newspaper , said the highest turnout for more than 40 years - 84.6 percent - showed that the french had undergone a " democratic awakening " and that " people wanted to wipe out the memory " of le pen 's success in 2002 .
none of the other eight candidates gained more than five percent , according to final figures from the interior ministry .
sarkozy and royal will now square off in the second round on may 6 , and will put their starkly different visions to a public test in a face-to-face televised debate on may 2 .
a clear choice ?
" i want only one thing : to rally the french people around a new french dream , " sarkozy , 52 , the governing party 's candidate , told cheering supporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal during her speech after the election royal , 53 and aiming to become france 's first woman president , pledged to be the champion of those who want to change france " without brutalizing it .
" we have a clear choice between two , very different projects for society , " she told a post-election rally .
an opinion poll by ipsos after the first round predicted sarkozy would beat royal by 54 percent to 46 in the run-off .
back to campaigning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will bayrou play a decisive role ?
both candidates went straight back onto the campaign trail monday , looking to woo the all important electorate of centrist francois bayrou , who came in third with 18.55 percent .
sarkozy 's lieutenant brice hortefeux said the frontrunner would not entertain " backroom deals " with bayrou , but said " the door is not closed " to negotiations .
bayrou 's small union for a french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- party has in the past aligned itself with sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- in parliament but the candidate has veered to the left during the campaign .
" we will not start negotiating in the wings as some usually do , " said jean-christophe lagarde , a deputy from bayrou 's udf party .
" we will think about the best way to ensure that the views of the people who said ' we want to change politics in this country ' are respected . "
bayrou , a 55-year-old former education minister , had campaigned on a platform that rejected the traditional left and right divide and called for a unity government made up of moderates from both camps . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : it 's time to get serious in france deutsche welle 's anke hagedorn says that nicolas sarkozy and segolene royal now need to focus on the issues rather than appearances before they square off again in the race for the french presidency on may 6 .

in an interview published monday , german chancellor angela merkel said she did not expect washington to adopt european goals on climate protection at an eu-us summit next week . " i do not think the us will adopt the european climate protection goals , " merkel told the daily münchener merkur . but she said there was growing awareness in the united states and within the us government that reducing greenhouse gas emissions was crucial . " i have been pleased at international meetings to see a growing feeling for a common , global responsibility -lrb- for climate protection -rrb- , " she said .
" on some issues , the us is even surpassing european targets , for example in the use of biofuels . " germany currently holds the rotating presidency of both the group of eight club of rich nations and the european union . not that different after all ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the us and eu really closer together on climate protection than people think ?
the us ambassador to the eu , boyden gray , said earlier this month that the gap between the united states and eu over how to tackle global warming is narrower than many might think . " both sides of the atlantic now agree it 's the same and it 's a constructive change , " he said .

in an interview published monday , german chancellor angela merkel said she did not expect washington to adopt european goals on climate protection at an eu-us summit next week . " i do not think the us will adopt the european climate protection goals , " merkel told the daily münchener merkur . but she said there was growing awareness in the united states and within the us government that reducing greenhouse gas emissions was crucial . " i have been pleased at international meetings to see a growing feeling for a common , global responsibility -lrb- for climate protection -rrb- , " she said .
" on some issues , the us is even surpassing european targets , for example in the use of biofuels .

"
the unusually warm weather has meant a great start to the season in germany .
but others in europe are n't pleased . there 's a continual stream of people bustling in and out of the store on the böser asparagus farm in bruchsal in the southern german state of baden-württemberg .
the unseasonably warm april temperatures have caused the asparagus to shoot earlier than normal .
this has caused record harvests for this time of the year , but it 's still not as much as farmers originally hoped for . " with such a mild winter , we thought we would just need a couple of rays of sun , and the asparagus would appear , " said wolfgang böser , the chairman of the association of south german asparagus and strawberry farmers .
" but then we had a cold snap . " " still , the harvest is in full swing and straight after easter , production just shot up , " he said . fresh is best many of the customers here have driven a long way to buy kilos of fresh white asparagus , and it 's not because the prized vegetable is necessarily cheaper direct from the farm - it 's because germans are obsessed with freshness when it comes to asparagus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh asparagus squeaks when it 's rubbed together " i know it comes fresh from the field in the morning and afternoon , and i will pay the price , " one man said , clutching two bursting bags of white asparagus spears . during the asparagus season , which traditionally runs from mid-april to june 24 , germans buy nearly 50 percent of their asparagus directly from farmers ' shops and market stalls .
this is a significant figure , considering that germans usually only purchase 7 percent of all of their fruit and vegetables direct . " we sell about 85 percent of our asparagus here in the farm shop or in the restaurant we have on site , " said böser , whose 38-hectare -lrb- 94-acre -rrb- farm produces three to four tons of asparagus a day at the height of the season . asparagus obsession during its short season , asparagus features prominently on restaurant menus and café chalkboards across the country , reflecting germans ' obsession with the prized vegetable .
in fact , they eat more white asparagus than anyone else in the world , chomping their way through 1.35 kilos -lrb- three pounds -rrb- per head . it is n't difficult for gourmets to find fresh local asparagus , since with a production of some 82,000 tons , germany is the biggest asparagus grower in europe .
the area under asparagus production in the country has doubled in the past 12 years to nearly 20,000 hectares , making asparagus the country 's biggest vegetable crop in terms of area and value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german demand for asparagus has increased 40 percent in the past decade the increased german cultivation has caused imports of fresh asparagus to drop significantly - from 50 percent to 25 percent .
this is because germans are so picky about the freshness of " edible ivory " that they prefer the local product . " there is n't a pronounced preference for ' grown in germany ' with most other types of vegetables , such as lettuce and cauliflower " said christoph behr , the head of the horticulture department at the center for market and price reporting office . " but germans want german asparagus and only buy imported asparagus before the local season starts , or if it 's extremely cheap , " he said . exporting countries suffering according to behr , the countries hardest hit by the increased german production are france and the netherlands .
but spain and greece , whose season begins several weeks before the german one , are also being affected . " the problem is that more asparagus is being grown under sheeting or tunnels in germany , so the season is continually starting earlier , " behr said .
" this means that exporting countries are cutting back on cultivation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least three-quarters of german asparagus is grown under plastic sheeting for an earlier harvest to get white asparagus , the plant needs to grow in the dark and the spear has to be cut before it emerges from the soil and is exposed to the light - a growing method that is very labor intensive and makes white asparagus about one and a half to two times more expensive than the green variety .
but it seems germans are so enamored with " white gold " that they are happy to pay the price difference . " it has a very strong tradition , " behr said .
" it has a different taste - it 's not as highly-flavored , but it 's what the germans are used to .

" many brewers have no choice but to raise their prices , " said kai schuerholt , a spokesman for the german brewers ' association .
" they decided not to pass on the three-percentage point rise in value-added tax that came into force in germany on jan .
1 , but in this case they have no alternative . "
the german arm of belgian brewer inbev , which owns the beck 's and franziskaner brands , confirmed it would be implementing " slight " price rises , while germany 's radeberger said it was considering a similar move .
it is hard to overstate the importance of beer in germany - it is drunk in vast quantities and the market is fiercely competitive and extremely price-sensitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's oktoberfest is one big beer-drinking party a half-liter -lrb- one pint -rrb- glass currently costs as little as three euros -lrb- four dollars -rrb- in a bar or restaurant , a price that makes drinkers in most other western european countries green with envy .
average annual consumption of beer in germany last year was 111.6 liters per head , equivalent to every one of the country 's 82 million people drinking a 0.31-liter glass every day , according to figures released on friday .
energy security vs. food security ?
but the price of barley , which is used to make malt , an essential ingredient in brewing , has doubled in the space of a year from 200 to 400 euros per ton on the german market .
brewers and farmers say an extremely poor barley harvest in 2006 has exacerbated an emerging trend of converting barley fields to growing the plants used in biofuels , such as rapeseed .
the amount of land used for growing barley in germany is receding by 5 percent a year .
the march of biofuels is inexorable .
of the 12 million hectares -lrb- 30 million acres -rrb- farmed in germany , two million are already being used for plants that can be turned into biofuel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed fields are commonplace in germany " biofuels are monopolizing the land , " said manfred weizbauer , the head of the german millers ' federation , which is calling for a cut in the subsidies granted to biofuel crops .
" the german government has got to be reasonable and not give more importance to energy security than to food security , " he said .
the impact of the biofuels is not restricted to beer , with the price of bread likely to rise by 10 percent as a result of reduced grain production , the german bakers ' federation has warned .
sign of the times germany is not alone in experiencing the effects of converting arable land to new uses .
although it is not suffering the potentially catastrophic consequences felt by mexico , where the phenomenon has caused maize prices to climb sharply , german millers fear the effects of steadily rising cereal prices .
the biofuels policy is encouraged by the european union , which wants vehicle fuel to contain at least 10 percent of the " green " fuel by 2020 .
but jens redemacher , the head of the cereals division of the federation of german farmers , said the brewers also had themselves to blame .
" they have demanded lower and lower prices for barley which has caused farmers to abandon growing it because it was no longer profitable .
so biofuels are not the only culprits , " he said .
the food industry is " just going to have to get used to having a competitor for the purchase of cereals , especially those used for biofuels , " redemacher said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the booze wars : a german city takes on public drinking while the german states and the federal government argue over a blanket ban on smoking in public places , others want to restrict the use of another legal drug : alcohol .

"
the unusually warm weather has meant a great start to the season in germany .
but others in europe are n't pleased . there 's a continual stream of people bustling in and out of the store on the böser asparagus farm in bruchsal in the southern german state of baden-württemberg .
the unseasonably warm april temperatures have caused the asparagus to shoot earlier than normal .
this has caused record harvests for this time of the year , but it 's still not as much as farmers originally hoped for . " with such a mild winter , we thought we would just need a couple of rays of sun , and the asparagus would appear , " said wolfgang böser , the chairman of the association of south german asparagus and strawberry farmers .
" but then we had a cold snap . " " still , the harvest is in full swing and straight after easter , production just shot up , " he said . fresh is best many of the customers here have driven a long way to buy kilos of fresh white asparagus , and it 's not because the prized vegetable is necessarily cheaper direct from the farm - it 's because germans are obsessed with freshness when it comes to asparagus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh asparagus squeaks when it 's rubbed together " i know it comes fresh from the field in the morning and afternoon , and i will pay the price , " one man said , clutching two bursting bags of white asparagus spears . during the asparagus season , which traditionally runs from mid-april to june 24 , germans buy nearly 50 percent of their asparagus directly from farmers ' shops and market stalls .
this is a significant figure , considering that germans usually only purchase 7 percent of all of their fruit and vegetables direct . " we sell about 85 percent of our asparagus here in the farm shop or in the restaurant we have on site , " said böser , whose 38-hectare -lrb- 94-acre -rrb- farm produces three to four tons of asparagus a day at the height of the season . asparagus obsession during its short season , asparagus features prominently on restaurant menus and café chalkboards across the country , reflecting germans ' obsession with the prized vegetable .
in fact , they eat more white asparagus than anyone else in the world , chomping their way through 1.35 kilos -lrb- three pounds -rrb- per head . it is n't difficult for gourmets to find fresh local asparagus , since with a production of some 82,000 tons , germany is the biggest asparagus grower in europe .
the area under asparagus production in the country has doubled in the past 12 years to nearly 20,000 hectares , making asparagus the country 's biggest vegetable crop in terms of area and value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german demand for asparagus has increased 40 percent in the past decade the increased german cultivation has caused imports of fresh asparagus to drop significantly - from 50 percent to 25 percent .
this is because germans are so picky about the freshness of " edible ivory " that they prefer the local product . " there is n't a pronounced preference for ' grown in germany ' with most other types of vegetables , such as lettuce and cauliflower " said christoph behr , the head of the horticulture department at the center for market and price reporting office . " but germans want german asparagus and only buy imported asparagus before the local season starts , or if it 's extremely cheap , " he said . exporting countries suffering according to behr , the countries hardest hit by the increased german production are france and the netherlands .
but spain and greece , whose season begins several weeks before the german one , are also being affected . " the problem is that more asparagus is being grown under sheeting or tunnels in germany , so the season is continually starting earlier , " behr said .
" this means that exporting countries are cutting back on cultivation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least three-quarters of german asparagus is grown under plastic sheeting for an earlier harvest to get white asparagus , the plant needs to grow in the dark and the spear has to be cut before it emerges from the soil and is exposed to the light - a growing method that is very labor intensive and makes white asparagus about one and a half to two times more expensive than the green variety .

"
the unusually warm weather has meant a great start to the season in germany .
but others in europe are n't pleased . there 's a continual stream of people bustling in and out of the store on the böser asparagus farm in bruchsal in the southern german state of baden-württemberg .
the unseasonably warm april temperatures have caused the asparagus to shoot earlier than normal .
this has caused record harvests for this time of the year , but it 's still not as much as farmers originally hoped for . " with such a mild winter , we thought we would just need a couple of rays of sun , and the asparagus would appear , " said wolfgang böser , the chairman of the association of south german asparagus and strawberry farmers .
" but then we had a cold snap . " " still , the harvest is in full swing and straight after easter , production just shot up , " he said . fresh is best many of the customers here have driven a long way to buy kilos of fresh white asparagus , and it 's not because the prized vegetable is necessarily cheaper direct from the farm - it 's because germans are obsessed with freshness when it comes to asparagus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh asparagus squeaks when it 's rubbed together " i know it comes fresh from the field in the morning and afternoon , and i will pay the price , " one man said , clutching two bursting bags of white asparagus spears . during the asparagus season , which traditionally runs from mid-april to june 24 , germans buy nearly 50 percent of their asparagus directly from farmers ' shops and market stalls .
this is a significant figure , considering that germans usually only purchase 7 percent of all of their fruit and vegetables direct . " we sell about 85 percent of our asparagus here in the farm shop or in the restaurant we have on site , " said böser , whose 38-hectare -lrb- 94-acre -rrb- farm produces three to four tons of asparagus a day at the height of the season . asparagus obsession during its short season , asparagus features prominently on restaurant menus and café chalkboards across the country , reflecting germans ' obsession with the prized vegetable .
in fact , they eat more white asparagus than anyone else in the world , chomping their way through 1.35 kilos -lrb- three pounds -rrb- per head . it is n't difficult for gourmets to find fresh local asparagus , since with a production of some 82,000 tons , germany is the biggest asparagus grower in europe .
the area under asparagus production in the country has doubled in the past 12 years to nearly 20,000 hectares , making asparagus the country 's biggest vegetable crop in terms of area and value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german demand for asparagus has increased 40 percent in the past decade the increased german cultivation has caused imports of fresh asparagus to drop significantly - from 50 percent to 25 percent .
this is because germans are so picky about the freshness of " edible ivory " that they prefer the local product . " there is n't a pronounced preference for ' grown in germany ' with most other types of vegetables , such as lettuce and cauliflower " said christoph behr , the head of the horticulture department at the center for market and price reporting office . " but germans want german asparagus and only buy imported asparagus before the local season starts , or if it 's extremely cheap , " he said . exporting countries suffering according to behr , the countries hardest hit by the increased german production are france and the netherlands .
but spain and greece , whose season begins several weeks before the german one , are also being affected . " the problem is that more asparagus is being grown under sheeting or tunnels in germany , so the season is continually starting earlier , " behr said .
" this means that exporting countries are cutting back on cultivation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least three-quarters of german asparagus is grown under plastic sheeting for an earlier harvest to get white asparagus , the plant needs to grow in the dark and the spear has to be cut before it emerges from the soil and is exposed to the light - a growing method that is very labor intensive and makes white asparagus about one and a half to two times more expensive than the green variety .
but it seems germans are so enamored with " white gold " that they are happy to pay the price difference . " it has a very strong tradition , " behr said .

the german arm of belgian brewer inbev , which owns the beck 's and franziskaner brands , confirmed it would be implementing " slight " price rises , while germany 's radeberger said it was considering a similar move .

energy security vs. food security ?
but the price of barley , which is used to make malt , an essential ingredient in brewing , has doubled in the space of a year from 200 to 400 euros per ton on the german market .
brewers and farmers say an extremely poor barley harvest in 2006 has exacerbated an emerging trend of converting barley fields to growing the plants used in biofuels , such as rapeseed .
the amount of land used for growing barley in germany is receding by 5 percent a year .
the march of biofuels is inexorable .
of the 12 million hectares -lrb- 30 million acres -rrb- farmed in germany , two million are already being used for plants that can be turned into biofuel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed fields are commonplace in germany " biofuels are monopolizing the land , " said manfred weizbauer , the head of the german millers ' federation , which is calling for a cut in the subsidies granted to biofuel crops .
" the german government has got to be reasonable and not give more importance to energy security than to food security , " he said .
the impact of the biofuels is not restricted to beer , with the price of bread likely to rise by 10 percent as a result of reduced grain production , the german bakers ' federation has warned .
sign of the times germany is not alone in experiencing the effects of converting arable land to new uses .
although it is not suffering the potentially catastrophic consequences felt by mexico , where the phenomenon has caused maize prices to climb sharply , german millers fear the effects of steadily rising cereal prices .
the biofuels policy is encouraged by the european union , which wants vehicle fuel to contain at least 10 percent of the " green " fuel by 2020 .
but jens redemacher , the head of the cereals division of the federation of german farmers , said the brewers also had themselves to blame .
" they have demanded lower and lower prices for barley which has caused farmers to abandon growing it because it was no longer profitable .

it 's a result that 's not surprising and the french are now hopeful that a serious debate will take place until the second round of voting .
that 's also desirable from a german point of view , because maybe it would make it easier for us to understand what to think of the two candidates when it comes to european policy and the franco-german relationship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anke hagedorn the election campaign so far has been a slick one - there was no overriding issue that really stuck .
it 's a far cry from the last presidential elections five years ago , when one topic , domestic safety , dominated .
this time the candidates sounded off on a whole range of issues and staged an equal number of gimmicky appearances , hoping to pull in voters . clad in jeans and sunglasses , sarkozy in the end presented himself as a mixture of cowboy and white knight , sitting on a white horse .
his message : i take charge , but i 've got my feet firmly on the ground and am also a nature-lover . centrist candidate francois bayrou , who portrayed himself as a farmer and father of six children and who had not been taken seriously by anyone at the beginning , eventually finished with a respectable result .
earlier , sarkozy enjoyed alternating between the role of savior of the nation and sacrificial lamb .
one day he flirted with trade unions while courting employers on the next .
he openly tried to woo right-extremist voters of the front national with proposals such as expelling all illegals in france and founding a ministry for immigration and national identity .
he did not tolerate competitors , be it among political adversaries or within his own ranks .
everyone , who stood in his way , was brushed aside without mercy .
editors in chief had to hand in resignations for negative coverage of sarkozy .
he threatened azouz begag , until recently minister for equal opportunities , because the latter had allegedly not been loyal .
it 's a bad omen when one thinks about what this man could do when he actually commands power .
usually dressed in a white business suit and wearing a glowing smile , segolene royal on the other hand presented herself as the new jeanne d 'arc .
she developed a new kind of communication tactic for the campaign , so-called participatory democracy .
she stood in the middle of an audience and made people believe that she was listening to them .
the only problem was it did n't work .
she usually seemed uptight and not ready for dialogue .
few managed to get to ask questions and many did n't get any answers .
it quickly led people to become disenchanted after a sky-rocketing start to the campaign .
francois bayrou hit the nail on the head when he talked about the dilemma of the voters .
" everyone 's uncertain , " he said .
" some , because they know where sarkozy would lead them and others , because they do not know where royal would take them . "
one can only hope that both candidates realize before may 6 that voters expect more than a superficial exchange of words .
they want concrete solutions , because there 's a lot of work to do in the grande nation , which has lost a lot of greatness in recent times - especially when it comes to the economy .
france has the highest unemployment rate within the euro zone , one of the lowest economic growth rates and a record trade deficit .
it 'll take more than a white horse or a white business suit to fix that .

it 's a result that 's not surprising and the french are now hopeful that a serious debate will take place until the second round of voting .
that 's also desirable from a german point of view , because maybe it would make it easier for us to understand what to think of the two candidates when it comes to european policy and the franco-german relationship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anke hagedorn the election campaign so far has been a slick one - there was no overriding issue that really stuck .
it 's a far cry from the last presidential elections five years ago , when one topic , domestic safety , dominated .
this time the candidates sounded off on a whole range of issues and staged an equal number of gimmicky appearances , hoping to pull in voters . clad in jeans and sunglasses , sarkozy in the end presented himself as a mixture of cowboy and white knight , sitting on a white horse .
his message : i take charge , but i 've got my feet firmly on the ground and am also a nature-lover . centrist candidate francois bayrou , who portrayed himself as a farmer and father of six children and who had not been taken seriously by anyone at the beginning , eventually finished with a respectable result .
earlier , sarkozy enjoyed alternating between the role of savior of the nation and sacrificial lamb .
one day he flirted with trade unions while courting employers on the next .
he openly tried to woo right-extremist voters of the front national with proposals such as expelling all illegals in france and founding a ministry for immigration and national identity .
he did not tolerate competitors , be it among political adversaries or within his own ranks .
everyone , who stood in his way , was brushed aside without mercy .
editors in chief had to hand in resignations for negative coverage of sarkozy .
he threatened azouz begag , until recently minister for equal opportunities , because the latter had allegedly not been loyal .
it 's a bad omen when one thinks about what this man could do when he actually commands power .
usually dressed in a white business suit and wearing a glowing smile , segolene royal on the other hand presented herself as the new jeanne d 'arc .
she developed a new kind of communication tactic for the campaign , so-called participatory democracy .
she stood in the middle of an audience and made people believe that she was listening to them .
the only problem was it did n't work .
she usually seemed uptight and not ready for dialogue .
few managed to get to ask questions and many did n't get any answers .
it quickly led people to become disenchanted after a sky-rocketing start to the campaign .
francois bayrou hit the nail on the head when he talked about the dilemma of the voters .
" everyone 's uncertain , " he said .
" some , because they know where sarkozy would lead them and others , because they do not know where royal would take them . "
one can only hope that both candidates realize before may 6 that voters expect more than a superficial exchange of words .
they want concrete solutions , because there 's a lot of work to do in the grande nation , which has lost a lot of greatness in recent times - especially when it comes to the economy .
france has the highest unemployment rate within the euro zone , one of the lowest economic growth rates and a record trade deficit .
it 'll take more than a white horse or a white business suit to fix that .

in an interview published monday , german chancellor angela merkel said she did not expect washington to adopt european goals on climate protection at an eu-us summit next week . " i do not think the us will adopt the european climate protection goals , " merkel told the daily münchener merkur . but she said there was growing awareness in the united states and within the us government that reducing greenhouse gas emissions was crucial . " i have been pleased at international meetings to see a growing feeling for a common , global responsibility -lrb- for climate protection -rrb- , " she said .
" on some issues , the us is even surpassing european targets , for example in the use of biofuels . " germany currently holds the rotating presidency of both the group of eight club of rich nations and the european union . not that different after all ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the us and eu really closer together on climate protection than people think ?
the us ambassador to the eu , boyden gray , said earlier this month that the gap between the united states and eu over how to tackle global warming is narrower than many might think . " both sides of the atlantic now agree it 's the same and it 's a constructive change , " he said .
" i do n't see that much difference . " gray was responding to criticism from european environment commissioner stavros dimas , who tartly compared eu plans to cut greenhouse-gas emissions through ever-tighter , legally binding curbs with the us voluntary approach . thinking beyond kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the next us president make environmentalists happier ?
the eu championed the kyoto protocol to reduce harmful emissions after it was abandoned by the united states in march 2001 . but the treaty has been almost crippled by the absence of the united states , which alone accounts for about a quarter of all this pollution . exploratory negotiations are under way for determining what treaty should follow kyoto after the accord expires at the end of 2012 . germany helped broker an agreement last month under which the 27 eu member states will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels over the next 13 years . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german paper teams up with environmentalists to save planet germany 's leading mass-market newspaper has joined the country 's major environment organizations in a nationwide campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .

gäfgen had given the police a number of false locations for the boy 's whereabouts .

in an interview published monday , german chancellor angela merkel said she did not expect washington to adopt european goals on climate protection at an eu-us summit next week . " i do not think the us will adopt the european climate protection goals , " merkel told the daily münchener merkur . but she said there was growing awareness in the united states and within the us government that reducing greenhouse gas emissions was crucial . " i have been pleased at international meetings to see a growing feeling for a common , global responsibility -lrb- for climate protection -rrb- , " she said .
" on some issues , the us is even surpassing european targets , for example in the use of biofuels . " germany currently holds the rotating presidency of both the group of eight club of rich nations and the european union . not that different after all ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the us and eu really closer together on climate protection than people think ?
the us ambassador to the eu , boyden gray , said earlier this month that the gap between the united states and eu over how to tackle global warming is narrower than many might think . " both sides of the atlantic now agree it 's the same and it 's a constructive change , " he said .
" i do n't see that much difference . " gray was responding to criticism from european environment commissioner stavros dimas , who tartly compared eu plans to cut greenhouse-gas emissions through ever-tighter , legally binding curbs with the us voluntary approach . thinking beyond kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the next us president make environmentalists happier ?
the eu championed the kyoto protocol to reduce harmful emissions after it was abandoned by the united states in march 2001 . but the treaty has been almost crippled by the absence of the united states , which alone accounts for about a quarter of all this pollution . exploratory negotiations are under way for determining what treaty should follow kyoto after the accord expires at the end of 2012 . germany helped broker an agreement last month under which the 27 eu member states will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels over the next 13 years . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german paper teams up with environmentalists to save planet germany 's leading mass-market newspaper has joined the country 's major environment organizations in a nationwide campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .

though relatively wealthy , europe will also struggle , a new report says .
-lrb- 12.04.2007 -rrb- eu urges germany to do more to combat climate change a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases .

in an interview published monday , german chancellor angela merkel said she did not expect washington to adopt european goals on climate protection at an eu-us summit next week . " i do not think the us will adopt the european climate protection goals , " merkel told the daily münchener merkur . but she said there was growing awareness in the united states and within the us government that reducing greenhouse gas emissions was crucial . " i have been pleased at international meetings to see a growing feeling for a common , global responsibility -lrb- for climate protection -rrb- , " she said .
" on some issues , the us is even surpassing european targets , for example in the use of biofuels . " germany currently holds the rotating presidency of both the group of eight club of rich nations and the european union . not that different after all ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the us and eu really closer together on climate protection than people think ?
the us ambassador to the eu , boyden gray , said earlier this month that the gap between the united states and eu over how to tackle global warming is narrower than many might think . " both sides of the atlantic now agree it 's the same and it 's a constructive change , " he said .
" i do n't see that much difference . " gray was responding to criticism from european environment commissioner stavros dimas , who tartly compared eu plans to cut greenhouse-gas emissions through ever-tighter , legally binding curbs with the us voluntary approach . thinking beyond kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the next us president make environmentalists happier ?
the eu championed the kyoto protocol to reduce harmful emissions after it was abandoned by the united states in march 2001 . but the treaty has been almost crippled by the absence of the united states , which alone accounts for about a quarter of all this pollution . exploratory negotiations are under way for determining what treaty should follow kyoto after the accord expires at the end of 2012 . germany helped broker an agreement last month under which the 27 eu member states will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels over the next 13 years . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german paper teams up with environmentalists to save planet germany 's leading mass-market newspaper has joined the country 's major environment organizations in a nationwide campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .

though relatively wealthy , europe will also struggle , a new report says .
-lrb- 12.04.2007 -rrb- eu urges germany to do more to combat climate change a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases .

the german arm of belgian brewer inbev , which owns the beck 's and franziskaner brands , confirmed it would be implementing " slight " price rises , while germany 's radeberger said it was considering a similar move .

average annual consumption of beer in germany last year was 111.6 liters per head , equivalent to every one of the country 's 82 million people drinking a 0.31-liter glass every day , according to figures released on friday .
energy security vs. food security ?
but the price of barley , which is used to make malt , an essential ingredient in brewing , has doubled in the space of a year from 200 to 400 euros per ton on the german market .
brewers and farmers say an extremely poor barley harvest in 2006 has exacerbated an emerging trend of converting barley fields to growing the plants used in biofuels , such as rapeseed .
the amount of land used for growing barley in germany is receding by 5 percent a year .
the march of biofuels is inexorable .
of the 12 million hectares -lrb- 30 million acres -rrb- farmed in germany , two million are already being used for plants that can be turned into biofuel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed fields are commonplace in germany " biofuels are monopolizing the land , " said manfred weizbauer , the head of the german millers ' federation , which is calling for a cut in the subsidies granted to biofuel crops .
" the german government has got to be reasonable and not give more importance to energy security than to food security , " he said .
the impact of the biofuels is not restricted to beer , with the price of bread likely to rise by 10 percent as a result of reduced grain production , the german bakers ' federation has warned .
sign of the times germany is not alone in experiencing the effects of converting arable land to new uses .
although it is not suffering the potentially catastrophic consequences felt by mexico , where the phenomenon has caused maize prices to climb sharply , german millers fear the effects of steadily rising cereal prices .
the biofuels policy is encouraged by the european union , which wants vehicle fuel to contain at least 10 percent of the " green " fuel by 2020 .
but jens redemacher , the head of the cereals division of the federation of german farmers , said the brewers also had themselves to blame .
" they have demanded lower and lower prices for barley which has caused farmers to abandon growing it because it was no longer profitable .
so biofuels are not the only culprits , " he said .

" we 're going to use less blood in the beginning so the actors do n't slip , " producer barrie kosky said in an interview with berliner zeitung before sunday 's premiere .
the opera is n't recommended for viewers under 16 .
whether despite or because of the blood , murder and nudity , sunday 's crowd at berlin 's komische oper cheered the modern version of the ancient tale , and culture magazine cicero called it " a great evening of humanity . "
sacrifice at abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geraldine mcgreevy plays the priestess iphigenia iphigenia , the title character , is a priestess and prisoner of king thoas on the island of tauris .
the king , who heard in an oracle that he was going to be killed at the hands of a foreigner , orders iphigenia to kill anyone who makes it onto the island in a sacrifice to goddess diana .
the opera opens with the priestess doing her job .
iphigenia drags a lifeless body across the stage to the rhythm of the music , slits its necks and collects the dripping blood .
soldiers in us fatigues bring iphigenia more victims and before the executions , the soldiers pose for pictures with the corpses , whose heads are wrapped in plastic bags .
" it was n't the naked seniors that hurt , but the over-naturalism of the beginning , where thoas ' prisoners were humiliated by their myrmidon charges a la abu ghraib , " cicero wrote , referring to the disrobed actors who appear in the background .
" the issue is still too close , as if one could ignore the fact that each reference also has to do with living people , who maybe do n't want to become just threads in the fabric of the world 's collective images , " the magazine continued .

her brother 's appearance forces the priestess to choose between her heart and duty .
her heart wins out and she lets her brother live .
throughout the opera , the audience is left wondering about orestes ' sexuality .
" somebody once told me there was no love story in iphigenia , " kosky told the berliner zeitung .
" but i think there is one , and it happens between two men .
but this is no gay pride production .
the audience members have to decide for themselves what happened between the two of them . " christoph willibald gluck , one of germany ’ s great opera composers and a reformer of the genre , set the greek mythological tale of priestess iphigenia in 1779 .

in an interview published monday , german chancellor angela merkel said she did not expect washington to adopt european goals on climate protection at an eu-us summit next week . " i do not think the us will adopt the european climate protection goals , " merkel told the daily münchener merkur . but she said there was growing awareness in the united states and within the us government that reducing greenhouse gas emissions was crucial . " i have been pleased at international meetings to see a growing feeling for a common , global responsibility -lrb- for climate protection -rrb- , " she said .
" on some issues , the us is even surpassing european targets , for example in the use of biofuels . " germany currently holds the rotating presidency of both the group of eight club of rich nations and the european union . not that different after all ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the us and eu really closer together on climate protection than people think ?
the us ambassador to the eu , boyden gray , said earlier this month that the gap between the united states and eu over how to tackle global warming is narrower than many might think . " both sides of the atlantic now agree it 's the same and it 's a constructive change , " he said .
" i do n't see that much difference . " gray was responding to criticism from european environment commissioner stavros dimas , who tartly compared eu plans to cut greenhouse-gas emissions through ever-tighter , legally binding curbs with the us voluntary approach . thinking beyond kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the next us president make environmentalists happier ?
the eu championed the kyoto protocol to reduce harmful emissions after it was abandoned by the united states in march 2001 . but the treaty has been almost crippled by the absence of the united states , which alone accounts for about a quarter of all this pollution . exploratory negotiations are under way for determining what treaty should follow kyoto after the accord expires at the end of 2012 . germany helped broker an agreement last month under which the 27 eu member states will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels over the next 13 years . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german paper teams up with environmentalists to save planet germany 's leading mass-market newspaper has joined the country 's major environment organizations in a nationwide campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
-lrb- 18.04.2007 -rrb- report : climate change poses serious challenge for europe the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that the world 's poorest countries will be affected most by climate change .
though relatively wealthy , europe will also struggle , a new report says .
-lrb- 12.04.2007 -rrb- eu urges germany to do more to combat climate change a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases .
-lrb- 07.04.2007 -rrb- feedback do you think merkel is doing enough to convince the us to work towards climate protection ?

" we 're going to use less blood in the beginning so the actors do n't slip , " producer barrie kosky said in an interview with berliner zeitung before sunday 's premiere .
the opera is n't recommended for viewers under 16 .
whether despite or because of the blood , murder and nudity , sunday 's crowd at berlin 's komische oper cheered the modern version of the ancient tale , and culture magazine cicero called it " a great evening of humanity . "
sacrifice at abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geraldine mcgreevy plays the priestess iphigenia iphigenia , the title character , is a priestess and prisoner of king thoas on the island of tauris .
the king , who heard in an oracle that he was going to be killed at the hands of a foreigner , orders iphigenia to kill anyone who makes it onto the island in a sacrifice to goddess diana .
the opera opens with the priestess doing her job .
iphigenia drags a lifeless body across the stage to the rhythm of the music , slits its necks and collects the dripping blood .
soldiers in us fatigues bring iphigenia more victims and before the executions , the soldiers pose for pictures with the corpses , whose heads are wrapped in plastic bags .
" it was n't the naked seniors that hurt , but the over-naturalism of the beginning , where thoas ' prisoners were humiliated by their myrmidon charges a la abu ghraib , " cicero wrote , referring to the disrobed actors who appear in the background .
" the issue is still too close , as if one could ignore the fact that each reference also has to do with living people , who maybe do n't want to become just threads in the fabric of the world 's collective images , " the magazine continued .
for kosky , sacrifice is the most interesting part of the opera . " the idea of sacrifice runs through so many cultures , " he said , mentioning the story of abraham and isaac , which is significant to christian , jews and muslims .
a subtle love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the love story plays out between pylades -lrb- right -rrb- and orestes like abraham , iphigenia stops her knife in mid-air during one of the many sacrifices .
she recognized her brother orestes , who had come to the island with his boyfriend , pylades , after having killed his mother .
her brother 's appearance forces the priestess to choose between her heart and duty .
her heart wins out and she lets her brother live .
throughout the opera , the audience is left wondering about orestes ' sexuality .
" somebody once told me there was no love story in iphigenia , " kosky told the berliner zeitung .
" but i think there is one , and it happens between two men .
but this is no gay pride production .
the audience members have to decide for themselves what happened between the two of them . " christoph willibald gluck , one of germany ’ s great opera composers and a reformer of the genre , set the greek mythological tale of priestess iphigenia in 1779 .

people wanted to wipe out the memory of april 21 , " he wrote , referring to the 2002 election first round , when huge abstention and a high vote for the political extremes meant that national front leader jean-marie le pen qualified for round two instead of the socialist lionel jospin .
" what it means is that this time there will be no sense of frustration on the eve of the second round .
people will have the means to make a clear choice .
they will make one , and the country will discover what direction it has chosen , and what direction it must now take , " he wrote . for christophe barbier , editor of l 'express news magazine , " the french wanted so much to have this head-to-head between royal and sarkozy - between a left in the process of renewal and a confident new right . "
barbier added that sarkozy should have the advantage ahead of the second round run-off on may 6 , counting on carry-over votes from far-right leader jean-marie le pen and centrist francois bayrou .
" but nothing is decided , " he added .
" segolene royal has one important weapon : the ' anyone but sarko ' option .
we can expect a second round which brings out all his character faults and ideological excesses .
in short - it 's back to where we were at the start of the campaign . " british newspapers on monday also noted that the high turnout in the first-round of french elections was a sign of the polls ' importance , and warned that a fierce clash was forthcoming . the daily telegraph , a right-wing paper , wrote france is " as its people recognize , in trouble - and this election is , as the high turnout yesterday indicates , its best chance to turn things around . "
in an editorial titled " france needs sarkozy " it continued to say that between the two candidates left , " it is mr sarkozy who is likeliest to embrace the painful structural changes that france so desperately needs .
but before that , he needs to win an election - far from a sure thing , especially in this most fascinating of contests . " in germany , business daily financial times deutschland warned that the two weeks until the final round would be marked by " extreme polarization " as the campaign grows " tougher , more ruthless and more personal . "
but it said royal and sarkozy did not represent two radically different ends of the political spectrum .
" to the contrary : the last weeks have shown that each candidate constantly took on board the populist demands of the other to try to best his or her opponent .
in the end , there may be a close outcome and a france deeply divided into two camps . " the conservative broadsheet frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also noted the remarkably high turnout at the polls .
" apparently the french were fascinated by a campaign that was fixated on personalities . "
it said that royal had done better than expected while sarkozy could be satisfied with meeting his goal of seizing 30 percent of the vote in the first round .
" with a campaign that started with a liberal tone , then took on more and more gaullist accents and at the end leaned sharply to the right , he exhausted his own voter potential while luring le pen voters . " spanish daily el pais meanwhile said that royal 's " only chance to defeat sarkozy will be to seek bayrou 's support , but this will not be easy .
sarkozy is still the best armed candidate to enter the elysee which does not mean that his victory is guaranteed because of the powerful rejection and hatred he provokes among some french voters , " the paper said . for italy 's la stampa , " the absolute novelty is the presence of a woman who had been expected to be defeated in the first round ... the french will now be able to choose not only between two very different political options but also between a man and woman , " the newspaper said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sarkozy , royal open duel for french presidency conservative nicolas sarkozy and socialist segolene royal face off in a dramatic left-right battle for the french presidency after winning round one of an election marked by a near record turnout .

people wanted to wipe out the memory of april 21 , " he wrote , referring to the 2002 election first round , when huge abstention and a high vote for the political extremes meant that national front leader jean-marie le pen qualified for round two instead of the socialist lionel jospin .
" what it means is that this time there will be no sense of frustration on the eve of the second round .
people will have the means to make a clear choice .
they will make one , and the country will discover what direction it has chosen , and what direction it must now take , " he wrote . for christophe barbier , editor of l 'express news magazine , " the french wanted so much to have this head-to-head between royal and sarkozy - between a left in the process of renewal and a confident new right . "
barbier added that sarkozy should have the advantage ahead of the second round run-off on may 6 , counting on carry-over votes from far-right leader jean-marie le pen and centrist francois bayrou .
" but nothing is decided , " he added .
" segolene royal has one important weapon : the ' anyone but sarko ' option .
we can expect a second round which brings out all his character faults and ideological excesses .
in short - it 's back to where we were at the start of the campaign . " british newspapers on monday also noted that the high turnout in the first-round of french elections was a sign of the polls ' importance , and warned that a fierce clash was forthcoming . the daily telegraph , a right-wing paper , wrote france is " as its people recognize , in trouble - and this election is , as the high turnout yesterday indicates , its best chance to turn things around . "
in an editorial titled " france needs sarkozy " it continued to say that between the two candidates left , " it is mr sarkozy who is likeliest to embrace the painful structural changes that france so desperately needs .
but before that , he needs to win an election - far from a sure thing , especially in this most fascinating of contests . " in germany , business daily financial times deutschland warned that the two weeks until the final round would be marked by " extreme polarization " as the campaign grows " tougher , more ruthless and more personal . "
but it said royal and sarkozy did not represent two radically different ends of the political spectrum .
" to the contrary : the last weeks have shown that each candidate constantly took on board the populist demands of the other to try to best his or her opponent .
in the end , there may be a close outcome and a france deeply divided into two camps . " the conservative broadsheet frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also noted the remarkably high turnout at the polls .
" apparently the french were fascinated by a campaign that was fixated on personalities . "
it said that royal had done better than expected while sarkozy could be satisfied with meeting his goal of seizing 30 percent of the vote in the first round .

royal 's result was a huge relief for the opposition socialist party which had feared a repeat of the 2002 shock when then prime minister lionel jospin was humiliatingly knocked out of the race in the first round by far-right national front leader jean-marie le pen .
this time le pen was in shock after he came in fourth , with 10.51 percent .
democratic awakening bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy thanked supporters on sunday jean-marie colombani , editor-in-chief of le monde newspaper , said the highest turnout for more than 40 years - 84.6 percent - showed that the french had undergone a " democratic awakening " and that " people wanted to wipe out the memory " of le pen 's success in 2002 .
none of the other eight candidates gained more than five percent , according to final figures from the interior ministry .
sarkozy and royal will now square off in the second round on may 6 , and will put their starkly different visions to a public test in a face-to-face televised debate on may 2 .

an opinion poll by ipsos after the first round predicted sarkozy would beat royal by 54 percent to 46 in the run-off .
back to campaigning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will bayrou play a decisive role ?
both candidates went straight back onto the campaign trail monday , looking to woo the all important electorate of centrist francois bayrou , who came in third with 18.55 percent .
sarkozy 's lieutenant brice hortefeux said the frontrunner would not entertain " backroom deals " with bayrou , but said " the door is not closed " to negotiations .
bayrou 's small union for a french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- party has in the past aligned itself with sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- in parliament but the candidate has veered to the left during the campaign .
" we will not start negotiating in the wings as some usually do , " said jean-christophe lagarde , a deputy from bayrou 's udf party .
" we will think about the best way to ensure that the views of the people who said ' we want to change politics in this country ' are respected . "
bayrou , a 55-year-old former education minister , had campaigned on a platform that rejected the traditional left and right divide and called for a unity government made up of moderates from both camps . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : it 's time to get serious in france deutsche welle 's anke hagedorn says that nicolas sarkozy and segolene royal now need to focus on the issues rather than appearances before they square off again in the race for the french presidency on may 6 .

royal 's result was a huge relief for the opposition socialist party which had feared a repeat of the 2002 shock when then prime minister lionel jospin was humiliatingly knocked out of the race in the first round by far-right national front leader jean-marie le pen .
this time le pen was in shock after he came in fourth , with 10.51 percent .
democratic awakening bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy thanked supporters on sunday jean-marie colombani , editor-in-chief of le monde newspaper , said the highest turnout for more than 40 years - 84.6 percent - showed that the french had undergone a " democratic awakening " and that " people wanted to wipe out the memory " of le pen 's success in 2002 .
none of the other eight candidates gained more than five percent , according to final figures from the interior ministry .
sarkozy and royal will now square off in the second round on may 6 , and will put their starkly different visions to a public test in a face-to-face televised debate on may 2 .

both candidates went straight back onto the campaign trail monday , looking to woo the all important electorate of centrist francois bayrou , who came in third with 18.55 percent .
sarkozy 's lieutenant brice hortefeux said the frontrunner would not entertain " backroom deals " with bayrou , but said " the door is not closed " to negotiations .
bayrou 's small union for a french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- party has in the past aligned itself with sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- in parliament but the candidate has veered to the left during the campaign .
" we will not start negotiating in the wings as some usually do , " said jean-christophe lagarde , a deputy from bayrou 's udf party .
" we will think about the best way to ensure that the views of the people who said ' we want to change politics in this country ' are respected . "

people wanted to wipe out the memory of april 21 , " he wrote , referring to the 2002 election first round , when huge abstention and a high vote for the political extremes meant that national front leader jean-marie le pen qualified for round two instead of the socialist lionel jospin .
" what it means is that this time there will be no sense of frustration on the eve of the second round .
people will have the means to make a clear choice .
they will make one , and the country will discover what direction it has chosen , and what direction it must now take , " he wrote . for christophe barbier , editor of l 'express news magazine , " the french wanted so much to have this head-to-head between royal and sarkozy - between a left in the process of renewal and a confident new right . "

" we 're going to use less blood in the beginning so the actors do n't slip , " producer barrie kosky said in an interview with berliner zeitung before sunday 's premiere .
the opera is n't recommended for viewers under 16 .
whether despite or because of the blood , murder and nudity , sunday 's crowd at berlin 's komische oper cheered the modern version of the ancient tale , and culture magazine cicero called it " a great evening of humanity . "
sacrifice at abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geraldine mcgreevy plays the priestess iphigenia iphigenia , the title character , is a priestess and prisoner of king thoas on the island of tauris .
the king , who heard in an oracle that he was going to be killed at the hands of a foreigner , orders iphigenia to kill anyone who makes it onto the island in a sacrifice to goddess diana .
the opera opens with the priestess doing her job .
iphigenia drags a lifeless body across the stage to the rhythm of the music , slits its necks and collects the dripping blood .
soldiers in us fatigues bring iphigenia more victims and before the executions , the soldiers pose for pictures with the corpses , whose heads are wrapped in plastic bags .
" it was n't the naked seniors that hurt , but the over-naturalism of the beginning , where thoas ' prisoners were humiliated by their myrmidon charges a la abu ghraib , " cicero wrote , referring to the disrobed actors who appear in the background .
" the issue is still too close , as if one could ignore the fact that each reference also has to do with living people , who maybe do n't want to become just threads in the fabric of the world 's collective images , " the magazine continued .
for kosky , sacrifice is the most interesting part of the opera . " the idea of sacrifice runs through so many cultures , " he said , mentioning the story of abraham and isaac , which is significant to christian , jews and muslims .
a subtle love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the love story plays out between pylades -lrb- right -rrb- and orestes like abraham , iphigenia stops her knife in mid-air during one of the many sacrifices .
she recognized her brother orestes , who had come to the island with his boyfriend , pylades , after having killed his mother .
her brother 's appearance forces the priestess to choose between her heart and duty .
her heart wins out and she lets her brother live .
throughout the opera , the audience is left wondering about orestes ' sexuality .
" somebody once told me there was no love story in iphigenia , " kosky told the berliner zeitung .
" but i think there is one , and it happens between two men .
but this is no gay pride production .
the audience members have to decide for themselves what happened between the two of them . " christoph willibald gluck , one of germany ’ s great opera composers and a reformer of the genre , set the greek mythological tale of priestess iphigenia in 1779 .

"
the unusually warm weather has meant a great start to the season in germany .
but others in europe are n't pleased . there 's a continual stream of people bustling in and out of the store on the böser asparagus farm in bruchsal in the southern german state of baden-württemberg .
the unseasonably warm april temperatures have caused the asparagus to shoot earlier than normal .
this has caused record harvests for this time of the year , but it 's still not as much as farmers originally hoped for . " with such a mild winter , we thought we would just need a couple of rays of sun , and the asparagus would appear , " said wolfgang böser , the chairman of the association of south german asparagus and strawberry farmers .
" but then we had a cold snap . " " still , the harvest is in full swing and straight after easter , production just shot up , " he said . fresh is best many of the customers here have driven a long way to buy kilos of fresh white asparagus , and it 's not because the prized vegetable is necessarily cheaper direct from the farm - it 's because germans are obsessed with freshness when it comes to asparagus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh asparagus squeaks when it 's rubbed together " i know it comes fresh from the field in the morning and afternoon , and i will pay the price , " one man said , clutching two bursting bags of white asparagus spears . during the asparagus season , which traditionally runs from mid-april to june 24 , germans buy nearly 50 percent of their asparagus directly from farmers ' shops and market stalls .
this is a significant figure , considering that germans usually only purchase 7 percent of all of their fruit and vegetables direct . " we sell about 85 percent of our asparagus here in the farm shop or in the restaurant we have on site , " said böser , whose 38-hectare -lrb- 94-acre -rrb- farm produces three to four tons of asparagus a day at the height of the season . asparagus obsession during its short season , asparagus features prominently on restaurant menus and café chalkboards across the country , reflecting germans ' obsession with the prized vegetable .
in fact , they eat more white asparagus than anyone else in the world , chomping their way through 1.35 kilos -lrb- three pounds -rrb- per head . it is n't difficult for gourmets to find fresh local asparagus , since with a production of some 82,000 tons , germany is the biggest asparagus grower in europe .
the area under asparagus production in the country has doubled in the past 12 years to nearly 20,000 hectares , making asparagus the country 's biggest vegetable crop in terms of area and value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german demand for asparagus has increased 40 percent in the past decade the increased german cultivation has caused imports of fresh asparagus to drop significantly - from 50 percent to 25 percent .
this is because germans are so picky about the freshness of " edible ivory " that they prefer the local product . " there is n't a pronounced preference for ' grown in germany ' with most other types of vegetables , such as lettuce and cauliflower " said christoph behr , the head of the horticulture department at the center for market and price reporting office . " but germans want german asparagus and only buy imported asparagus before the local season starts , or if it 's extremely cheap , " he said . exporting countries suffering according to behr , the countries hardest hit by the increased german production are france and the netherlands .
but spain and greece , whose season begins several weeks before the german one , are also being affected . " the problem is that more asparagus is being grown under sheeting or tunnels in germany , so the season is continually starting earlier , " behr said .
" this means that exporting countries are cutting back on cultivation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least three-quarters of german asparagus is grown under plastic sheeting for an earlier harvest to get white asparagus , the plant needs to grow in the dark and the spear has to be cut before it emerges from the soil and is exposed to the light - a growing method that is very labor intensive and makes white asparagus about one and a half to two times more expensive than the green variety .
but it seems germans are so enamored with " white gold " that they are happy to pay the price difference . " it has a very strong tradition , " behr said .

"
the unusually warm weather has meant a great start to the season in germany .
but others in europe are n't pleased . there 's a continual stream of people bustling in and out of the store on the böser asparagus farm in bruchsal in the southern german state of baden-württemberg .
the unseasonably warm april temperatures have caused the asparagus to shoot earlier than normal .
this has caused record harvests for this time of the year , but it 's still not as much as farmers originally hoped for . " with such a mild winter , we thought we would just need a couple of rays of sun , and the asparagus would appear , " said wolfgang böser , the chairman of the association of south german asparagus and strawberry farmers .
" but then we had a cold snap . " " still , the harvest is in full swing and straight after easter , production just shot up , " he said . fresh is best many of the customers here have driven a long way to buy kilos of fresh white asparagus , and it 's not because the prized vegetable is necessarily cheaper direct from the farm - it 's because germans are obsessed with freshness when it comes to asparagus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh asparagus squeaks when it 's rubbed together " i know it comes fresh from the field in the morning and afternoon , and i will pay the price , " one man said , clutching two bursting bags of white asparagus spears . during the asparagus season , which traditionally runs from mid-april to june 24 , germans buy nearly 50 percent of their asparagus directly from farmers ' shops and market stalls .
this is a significant figure , considering that germans usually only purchase 7 percent of all of their fruit and vegetables direct . " we sell about 85 percent of our asparagus here in the farm shop or in the restaurant we have on site , " said böser , whose 38-hectare -lrb- 94-acre -rrb- farm produces three to four tons of asparagus a day at the height of the season . asparagus obsession during its short season , asparagus features prominently on restaurant menus and café chalkboards across the country , reflecting germans ' obsession with the prized vegetable .
in fact , they eat more white asparagus than anyone else in the world , chomping their way through 1.35 kilos -lrb- three pounds -rrb- per head . it is n't difficult for gourmets to find fresh local asparagus , since with a production of some 82,000 tons , germany is the biggest asparagus grower in europe .
the area under asparagus production in the country has doubled in the past 12 years to nearly 20,000 hectares , making asparagus the country 's biggest vegetable crop in terms of area and value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german demand for asparagus has increased 40 percent in the past decade the increased german cultivation has caused imports of fresh asparagus to drop significantly - from 50 percent to 25 percent .
this is because germans are so picky about the freshness of " edible ivory " that they prefer the local product . " there is n't a pronounced preference for ' grown in germany ' with most other types of vegetables , such as lettuce and cauliflower " said christoph behr , the head of the horticulture department at the center for market and price reporting office . " but germans want german asparagus and only buy imported asparagus before the local season starts , or if it 's extremely cheap , " he said . exporting countries suffering according to behr , the countries hardest hit by the increased german production are france and the netherlands .
but spain and greece , whose season begins several weeks before the german one , are also being affected . " the problem is that more asparagus is being grown under sheeting or tunnels in germany , so the season is continually starting earlier , " behr said .
" this means that exporting countries are cutting back on cultivation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least three-quarters of german asparagus is grown under plastic sheeting for an earlier harvest to get white asparagus , the plant needs to grow in the dark and the spear has to be cut before it emerges from the soil and is exposed to the light - a growing method that is very labor intensive and makes white asparagus about one and a half to two times more expensive than the green variety .
but it seems germans are so enamored with " white gold " that they are happy to pay the price difference . " it has a very strong tradition , " behr said .

it 's a result that 's not surprising and the french are now hopeful that a serious debate will take place until the second round of voting .
that 's also desirable from a german point of view , because maybe it would make it easier for us to understand what to think of the two candidates when it comes to european policy and the franco-german relationship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anke hagedorn the election campaign so far has been a slick one - there was no overriding issue that really stuck .
it 's a far cry from the last presidential elections five years ago , when one topic , domestic safety , dominated .
this time the candidates sounded off on a whole range of issues and staged an equal number of gimmicky appearances , hoping to pull in voters . clad in jeans and sunglasses , sarkozy in the end presented himself as a mixture of cowboy and white knight , sitting on a white horse .
his message : i take charge , but i 've got my feet firmly on the ground and am also a nature-lover . centrist candidate francois bayrou , who portrayed himself as a farmer and father of six children and who had not been taken seriously by anyone at the beginning , eventually finished with a respectable result .
earlier , sarkozy enjoyed alternating between the role of savior of the nation and sacrificial lamb .
one day he flirted with trade unions while courting employers on the next .
he openly tried to woo right-extremist voters of the front national with proposals such as expelling all illegals in france and founding a ministry for immigration and national identity .
he did not tolerate competitors , be it among political adversaries or within his own ranks .
everyone , who stood in his way , was brushed aside without mercy .
editors in chief had to hand in resignations for negative coverage of sarkozy .
he threatened azouz begag , until recently minister for equal opportunities , because the latter had allegedly not been loyal .
it 's a bad omen when one thinks about what this man could do when he actually commands power .
usually dressed in a white business suit and wearing a glowing smile , segolene royal on the other hand presented herself as the new jeanne d 'arc .
she developed a new kind of communication tactic for the campaign , so-called participatory democracy .
she stood in the middle of an audience and made people believe that she was listening to them .
the only problem was it did n't work .
she usually seemed uptight and not ready for dialogue .
few managed to get to ask questions and many did n't get any answers .
it quickly led people to become disenchanted after a sky-rocketing start to the campaign .
francois bayrou hit the nail on the head when he talked about the dilemma of the voters .
" everyone 's uncertain , " he said .
" some , because they know where sarkozy would lead them and others , because they do not know where royal would take them . "
one can only hope that both candidates realize before may 6 that voters expect more than a superficial exchange of words .
they want concrete solutions , because there 's a lot of work to do in the grande nation , which has lost a lot of greatness in recent times - especially when it comes to the economy .
france has the highest unemployment rate within the euro zone , one of the lowest economic growth rates and a record trade deficit .
it 'll take more than a white horse or a white business suit to fix that .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pat cox heads the citizens ' initiative that is campaigning for the nurses ' release the five nurses from bulgaria and the palestinian doctor who have been imprisoned in libya for eight years and sentenced to death must finally be set free , cox said . libya has accused the nurses and doctor of having deliberately infected 426 children in the city of benghazi with hiv - an accusation that the eu sees as completely absurd .
investigations have shown that the infections were a result of poor hygienic conditions in the hospital . appeals to the eu family members of the detainees have been putting pressure on the eu to do more for the detainees . " we 've heard enough words of solidarity , " said marian georgiev , the son of another doctor who has n't been arrested , but has been restricted from leaving libya .

financial aid has also been offered to the children 's families . eu diplomats assume that libya is drawing out the process in order to boost up the price .
on the other hand , diplomats warn that too much pressure could have a negative effect . " they 're at the end of their strength " in 2001 , several bulgarian journalists and relatives of the detainees managed to speak briefly with the prisoners .
one woman complained of severe torture with electroshock devices and inhumane conditions . earlier this year , the daughter-in-law of one of the detainees was able to visit the prison . " they are very weak , " she reported in brussels after the visit .
" after eight years of detainment , they 're at the end of their strength .
for this reason , we are appealing to the media not to forget these people . " six fractions in the european parliament have expressed their support for the family members ' appeal .
bulgaria has been an eu member since its accession to the bloc on jan .
1 , 2007 . the eu should put more pressure on libya , even if the country 's strong oil trade may put economic interests at stake , said graham watson from the liberal party . " i challenge the eu not only to discuss sanctions but the foreign minister of each and every member state should ask the libyan ambassador to its country each week what progress has been made toward the release of the nurses and the doctor , " watson said . bernd riegert -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european papers condemn libyan death sentence for medics libya 's sentencing of five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor to death for allegedly spreading the aids virus among children has european commentators up in arms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 23.04.2007 germans dig for " white gold " as demand for asparagus grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans eat the most white asparagus in the world white asparagus has been called the " vegetable of kings , " " edible ivory , " or simply " white gold . "
the unusually warm weather has meant a great start to the season in germany .
but others in europe are n't pleased . there 's a continual stream of people bustling in and out of the store on the böser asparagus farm in bruchsal in the southern german state of baden-württemberg .
the unseasonably warm april temperatures have caused the asparagus to shoot earlier than normal .
this has caused record harvests for this time of the year , but it 's still not as much as farmers originally hoped for . " with such a mild winter , we thought we would just need a couple of rays of sun , and the asparagus would appear , " said wolfgang böser , the chairman of the association of south german asparagus and strawberry farmers .
" but then we had a cold snap . " " still , the harvest is in full swing and straight after easter , production just shot up , " he said . fresh is best many of the customers here have driven a long way to buy kilos of fresh white asparagus , and it 's not because the prized vegetable is necessarily cheaper direct from the farm - it 's because germans are obsessed with freshness when it comes to asparagus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh asparagus squeaks when it 's rubbed together " i know it comes fresh from the field in the morning and afternoon , and i will pay the price , " one man said , clutching two bursting bags of white asparagus spears . during the asparagus season , which traditionally runs from mid-april to june 24 , germans buy nearly 50 percent of their asparagus directly from farmers ' shops and market stalls .
this is a significant figure , considering that germans usually only purchase 7 percent of all of their fruit and vegetables direct . " we sell about 85 percent of our asparagus here in the farm shop or in the restaurant we have on site , " said böser , whose 38-hectare -lrb- 94-acre -rrb- farm produces three to four tons of asparagus a day at the height of the season . asparagus obsession during its short season , asparagus features prominently on restaurant menus and café chalkboards across the country , reflecting germans ' obsession with the prized vegetable .
in fact , they eat more white asparagus than anyone else in the world , chomping their way through 1.35 kilos -lrb- three pounds -rrb- per head . it is n't difficult for gourmets to find fresh local asparagus , since with a production of some 82,000 tons , germany is the biggest asparagus grower in europe .
the area under asparagus production in the country has doubled in the past 12 years to nearly 20,000 hectares , making asparagus the country 's biggest vegetable crop in terms of area and value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german demand for asparagus has increased 40 percent in the past decade the increased german cultivation has caused imports of fresh asparagus to drop significantly - from 50 percent to 25 percent .
this is because germans are so picky about the freshness of " edible ivory " that they prefer the local product . " there is n't a pronounced preference for ' grown in germany ' with most other types of vegetables , such as lettuce and cauliflower " said christoph behr , the head of the horticulture department at the center for market and price reporting office . " but germans want german asparagus and only buy imported asparagus before the local season starts , or if it 's extremely cheap , " he said . exporting countries suffering according to behr , the countries hardest hit by the increased german production are france and the netherlands .
but spain and greece , whose season begins several weeks before the german one , are also being affected . " the problem is that more asparagus is being grown under sheeting or tunnels in germany , so the season is continually starting earlier , " behr said .
" this means that exporting countries are cutting back on cultivation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least three-quarters of german asparagus is grown under plastic sheeting for an earlier harvest to get white asparagus , the plant needs to grow in the dark and the spear has to be cut before it emerges from the soil and is exposed to the light - a growing method that is very labor intensive and makes white asparagus about one and a half to two times more expensive than the green variety .
but it seems germans are so enamored with " white gold " that they are happy to pay the price difference . " it has a very strong tradition , " behr said .
" it has a different taste - it 's not as highly-flavored , but it 's what the germans are used to .

" we 're going to use less blood in the beginning so the actors do n't slip , " producer barrie kosky said in an interview with berliner zeitung before sunday 's premiere .
the opera is n't recommended for viewers under 16 .
whether despite or because of the blood , murder and nudity , sunday 's crowd at berlin 's komische oper cheered the modern version of the ancient tale , and culture magazine cicero called it " a great evening of humanity . "
sacrifice at abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geraldine mcgreevy plays the priestess iphigenia iphigenia , the title character , is a priestess and prisoner of king thoas on the island of tauris .
the king , who heard in an oracle that he was going to be killed at the hands of a foreigner , orders iphigenia to kill anyone who makes it onto the island in a sacrifice to goddess diana .
the opera opens with the priestess doing her job .
iphigenia drags a lifeless body across the stage to the rhythm of the music , slits its necks and collects the dripping blood .
soldiers in us fatigues bring iphigenia more victims and before the executions , the soldiers pose for pictures with the corpses , whose heads are wrapped in plastic bags .
" it was n't the naked seniors that hurt , but the over-naturalism of the beginning , where thoas ' prisoners were humiliated by their myrmidon charges a la abu ghraib , " cicero wrote , referring to the disrobed actors who appear in the background .
" the issue is still too close , as if one could ignore the fact that each reference also has to do with living people , who maybe do n't want to become just threads in the fabric of the world 's collective images , " the magazine continued .
for kosky , sacrifice is the most interesting part of the opera . " the idea of sacrifice runs through so many cultures , " he said , mentioning the story of abraham and isaac , which is significant to christian , jews and muslims .
a subtle love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the love story plays out between pylades -lrb- right -rrb- and orestes like abraham , iphigenia stops her knife in mid-air during one of the many sacrifices .
she recognized her brother orestes , who had come to the island with his boyfriend , pylades , after having killed his mother .
her brother 's appearance forces the priestess to choose between her heart and duty .
her heart wins out and she lets her brother live .
throughout the opera , the audience is left wondering about orestes ' sexuality .
" somebody once told me there was no love story in iphigenia , " kosky told the berliner zeitung .
" but i think there is one , and it happens between two men .

"
the unusually warm weather has meant a great start to the season in germany .
but others in europe are n't pleased . there 's a continual stream of people bustling in and out of the store on the böser asparagus farm in bruchsal in the southern german state of baden-württemberg .
the unseasonably warm april temperatures have caused the asparagus to shoot earlier than normal .
this has caused record harvests for this time of the year , but it 's still not as much as farmers originally hoped for . " with such a mild winter , we thought we would just need a couple of rays of sun , and the asparagus would appear , " said wolfgang böser , the chairman of the association of south german asparagus and strawberry farmers .
" but then we had a cold snap . " " still , the harvest is in full swing and straight after easter , production just shot up , " he said . fresh is best many of the customers here have driven a long way to buy kilos of fresh white asparagus , and it 's not because the prized vegetable is necessarily cheaper direct from the farm - it 's because germans are obsessed with freshness when it comes to asparagus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh asparagus squeaks when it 's rubbed together " i know it comes fresh from the field in the morning and afternoon , and i will pay the price , " one man said , clutching two bursting bags of white asparagus spears . during the asparagus season , which traditionally runs from mid-april to june 24 , germans buy nearly 50 percent of their asparagus directly from farmers ' shops and market stalls .
this is a significant figure , considering that germans usually only purchase 7 percent of all of their fruit and vegetables direct . " we sell about 85 percent of our asparagus here in the farm shop or in the restaurant we have on site , " said böser , whose 38-hectare -lrb- 94-acre -rrb- farm produces three to four tons of asparagus a day at the height of the season . asparagus obsession during its short season , asparagus features prominently on restaurant menus and café chalkboards across the country , reflecting germans ' obsession with the prized vegetable .
in fact , they eat more white asparagus than anyone else in the world , chomping their way through 1.35 kilos -lrb- three pounds -rrb- per head . it is n't difficult for gourmets to find fresh local asparagus , since with a production of some 82,000 tons , germany is the biggest asparagus grower in europe .
the area under asparagus production in the country has doubled in the past 12 years to nearly 20,000 hectares , making asparagus the country 's biggest vegetable crop in terms of area and value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german demand for asparagus has increased 40 percent in the past decade the increased german cultivation has caused imports of fresh asparagus to drop significantly - from 50 percent to 25 percent .
this is because germans are so picky about the freshness of " edible ivory " that they prefer the local product . " there is n't a pronounced preference for ' grown in germany ' with most other types of vegetables , such as lettuce and cauliflower " said christoph behr , the head of the horticulture department at the center for market and price reporting office . " but germans want german asparagus and only buy imported asparagus before the local season starts , or if it 's extremely cheap , " he said . exporting countries suffering according to behr , the countries hardest hit by the increased german production are france and the netherlands .
but spain and greece , whose season begins several weeks before the german one , are also being affected . " the problem is that more asparagus is being grown under sheeting or tunnels in germany , so the season is continually starting earlier , " behr said .
" this means that exporting countries are cutting back on cultivation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least three-quarters of german asparagus is grown under plastic sheeting for an earlier harvest to get white asparagus , the plant needs to grow in the dark and the spear has to be cut before it emerges from the soil and is exposed to the light - a growing method that is very labor intensive and makes white asparagus about one and a half to two times more expensive than the green variety .
but it seems germans are so enamored with " white gold " that they are happy to pay the price difference . " it has a very strong tradition , " behr said .
" it has a different taste - it 's not as highly-flavored , but it 's what the germans are used to .

in an interview published monday , german chancellor angela merkel said she did not expect washington to adopt european goals on climate protection at an eu-us summit next week . " i do not think the us will adopt the european climate protection goals , " merkel told the daily münchener merkur . but she said there was growing awareness in the united states and within the us government that reducing greenhouse gas emissions was crucial . " i have been pleased at international meetings to see a growing feeling for a common , global responsibility -lrb- for climate protection -rrb- , " she said .
" on some issues , the us is even surpassing european targets , for example in the use of biofuels . " germany currently holds the rotating presidency of both the group of eight club of rich nations and the european union . not that different after all ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the us and eu really closer together on climate protection than people think ?
the us ambassador to the eu , boyden gray , said earlier this month that the gap between the united states and eu over how to tackle global warming is narrower than many might think . " both sides of the atlantic now agree it 's the same and it 's a constructive change , " he said .
" i do n't see that much difference . " gray was responding to criticism from european environment commissioner stavros dimas , who tartly compared eu plans to cut greenhouse-gas emissions through ever-tighter , legally binding curbs with the us voluntary approach . thinking beyond kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the next us president make environmentalists happier ?
the eu championed the kyoto protocol to reduce harmful emissions after it was abandoned by the united states in march 2001 . but the treaty has been almost crippled by the absence of the united states , which alone accounts for about a quarter of all this pollution . exploratory negotiations are under way for determining what treaty should follow kyoto after the accord expires at the end of 2012 . germany helped broker an agreement last month under which the 27 eu member states will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels over the next 13 years . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german paper teams up with environmentalists to save planet germany 's leading mass-market newspaper has joined the country 's major environment organizations in a nationwide campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .

though relatively wealthy , europe will also struggle , a new report says .
-lrb- 12.04.2007 -rrb- eu urges germany to do more to combat climate change a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases .

royal 's result was a huge relief for the opposition socialist party which had feared a repeat of the 2002 shock when then prime minister lionel jospin was humiliatingly knocked out of the race in the first round by far-right national front leader jean-marie le pen .
this time le pen was in shock after he came in fourth , with 10.51 percent .

none of the other eight candidates gained more than five percent , according to final figures from the interior ministry .
sarkozy and royal will now square off in the second round on may 6 , and will put their starkly different visions to a public test in a face-to-face televised debate on may 2 .

both candidates went straight back onto the campaign trail monday , looking to woo the all important electorate of centrist francois bayrou , who came in third with 18.55 percent .
sarkozy 's lieutenant brice hortefeux said the frontrunner would not entertain " backroom deals " with bayrou , but said " the door is not closed " to negotiations .
bayrou 's small union for a french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- party has in the past aligned itself with sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- in parliament but the candidate has veered to the left during the campaign .
" we will not start negotiating in the wings as some usually do , " said jean-christophe lagarde , a deputy from bayrou 's udf party .
" we will think about the best way to ensure that the views of the people who said ' we want to change politics in this country ' are respected . "

royal 's result was a huge relief for the opposition socialist party which had feared a repeat of the 2002 shock when then prime minister lionel jospin was humiliatingly knocked out of the race in the first round by far-right national front leader jean-marie le pen .
this time le pen was in shock after he came in fourth , with 10.51 percent .
democratic awakening bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy thanked supporters on sunday jean-marie colombani , editor-in-chief of le monde newspaper , said the highest turnout for more than 40 years - 84.6 percent - showed that the french had undergone a " democratic awakening " and that " people wanted to wipe out the memory " of le pen 's success in 2002 .
none of the other eight candidates gained more than five percent , according to final figures from the interior ministry .
sarkozy and royal will now square off in the second round on may 6 , and will put their starkly different visions to a public test in a face-to-face televised debate on may 2 .
a clear choice ?
" i want only one thing : to rally the french people around a new french dream , " sarkozy , 52 , the governing party 's candidate , told cheering supporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal during her speech after the election royal , 53 and aiming to become france 's first woman president , pledged to be the champion of those who want to change france " without brutalizing it .
" we have a clear choice between two , very different projects for society , " she told a post-election rally .
an opinion poll by ipsos after the first round predicted sarkozy would beat royal by 54 percent to 46 in the run-off .
back to campaigning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will bayrou play a decisive role ?
both candidates went straight back onto the campaign trail monday , looking to woo the all important electorate of centrist francois bayrou , who came in third with 18.55 percent .
sarkozy 's lieutenant brice hortefeux said the frontrunner would not entertain " backroom deals " with bayrou , but said " the door is not closed " to negotiations .
bayrou 's small union for a french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- party has in the past aligned itself with sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- in parliament but the candidate has veered to the left during the campaign .
" we will not start negotiating in the wings as some usually do , " said jean-christophe lagarde , a deputy from bayrou 's udf party .
" we will think about the best way to ensure that the views of the people who said ' we want to change politics in this country ' are respected . "
bayrou , a 55-year-old former education minister , had campaigned on a platform that rejected the traditional left and right divide and called for a unity government made up of moderates from both camps . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : it 's time to get serious in france deutsche welle 's anke hagedorn says that nicolas sarkozy and segolene royal now need to focus on the issues rather than appearances before they square off again in the race for the french presidency on may 6 .

people wanted to wipe out the memory of april 21 , " he wrote , referring to the 2002 election first round , when huge abstention and a high vote for the political extremes meant that national front leader jean-marie le pen qualified for round two instead of the socialist lionel jospin .
" what it means is that this time there will be no sense of frustration on the eve of the second round .
people will have the means to make a clear choice .
they will make one , and the country will discover what direction it has chosen , and what direction it must now take , " he wrote . for christophe barbier , editor of l 'express news magazine , " the french wanted so much to have this head-to-head between royal and sarkozy - between a left in the process of renewal and a confident new right . "
barbier added that sarkozy should have the advantage ahead of the second round run-off on may 6 , counting on carry-over votes from far-right leader jean-marie le pen and centrist francois bayrou .
" but nothing is decided , " he added .
" segolene royal has one important weapon : the ' anyone but sarko ' option .
we can expect a second round which brings out all his character faults and ideological excesses .
in short - it 's back to where we were at the start of the campaign . " british newspapers on monday also noted that the high turnout in the first-round of french elections was a sign of the polls ' importance , and warned that a fierce clash was forthcoming . the daily telegraph , a right-wing paper , wrote france is " as its people recognize , in trouble - and this election is , as the high turnout yesterday indicates , its best chance to turn things around . "
in an editorial titled " france needs sarkozy " it continued to say that between the two candidates left , " it is mr sarkozy who is likeliest to embrace the painful structural changes that france so desperately needs .
but before that , he needs to win an election - far from a sure thing , especially in this most fascinating of contests . " in germany , business daily financial times deutschland warned that the two weeks until the final round would be marked by " extreme polarization " as the campaign grows " tougher , more ruthless and more personal . "
but it said royal and sarkozy did not represent two radically different ends of the political spectrum .
" to the contrary : the last weeks have shown that each candidate constantly took on board the populist demands of the other to try to best his or her opponent .
in the end , there may be a close outcome and a france deeply divided into two camps . " the conservative broadsheet frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also noted the remarkably high turnout at the polls .
" apparently the french were fascinated by a campaign that was fixated on personalities . "
it said that royal had done better than expected while sarkozy could be satisfied with meeting his goal of seizing 30 percent of the vote in the first round .
" with a campaign that started with a liberal tone , then took on more and more gaullist accents and at the end leaned sharply to the right , he exhausted his own voter potential while luring le pen voters . " spanish daily el pais meanwhile said that royal 's " only chance to defeat sarkozy will be to seek bayrou 's support , but this will not be easy .
sarkozy is still the best armed candidate to enter the elysee which does not mean that his victory is guaranteed because of the powerful rejection and hatred he provokes among some french voters , " the paper said . for italy 's la stampa , " the absolute novelty is the presence of a woman who had been expected to be defeated in the first round ... the french will now be able to choose not only between two very different political options but also between a man and woman , " the newspaper said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sarkozy , royal open duel for french presidency conservative nicolas sarkozy and socialist segolene royal face off in a dramatic left-right battle for the french presidency after winning round one of an election marked by a near record turnout .

the german arm of belgian brewer inbev , which owns the beck 's and franziskaner brands , confirmed it would be implementing " slight " price rises , while germany 's radeberger said it was considering a similar move .
it is hard to overstate the importance of beer in germany - it is drunk in vast quantities and the market is fiercely competitive and extremely price-sensitive .

average annual consumption of beer in germany last year was 111.6 liters per head , equivalent to every one of the country 's 82 million people drinking a 0.31-liter glass every day , according to figures released on friday .
energy security vs. food security ?
but the price of barley , which is used to make malt , an essential ingredient in brewing , has doubled in the space of a year from 200 to 400 euros per ton on the german market .
brewers and farmers say an extremely poor barley harvest in 2006 has exacerbated an emerging trend of converting barley fields to growing the plants used in biofuels , such as rapeseed .
the amount of land used for growing barley in germany is receding by 5 percent a year .
the march of biofuels is inexorable .
of the 12 million hectares -lrb- 30 million acres -rrb- farmed in germany , two million are already being used for plants that can be turned into biofuel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed fields are commonplace in germany " biofuels are monopolizing the land , " said manfred weizbauer , the head of the german millers ' federation , which is calling for a cut in the subsidies granted to biofuel crops .
" the german government has got to be reasonable and not give more importance to energy security than to food security , " he said .
the impact of the biofuels is not restricted to beer , with the price of bread likely to rise by 10 percent as a result of reduced grain production , the german bakers ' federation has warned .
sign of the times germany is not alone in experiencing the effects of converting arable land to new uses .
although it is not suffering the potentially catastrophic consequences felt by mexico , where the phenomenon has caused maize prices to climb sharply , german millers fear the effects of steadily rising cereal prices .
the biofuels policy is encouraged by the european union , which wants vehicle fuel to contain at least 10 percent of the " green " fuel by 2020 .
but jens redemacher , the head of the cereals division of the federation of german farmers , said the brewers also had themselves to blame .
" they have demanded lower and lower prices for barley which has caused farmers to abandon growing it because it was no longer profitable .
so biofuels are not the only culprits , " he said .
the food industry is " just going to have to get used to having a competitor for the purchase of cereals , especially those used for biofuels , " redemacher said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the booze wars : a german city takes on public drinking while the german states and the federal government argue over a blanket ban on smoking in public places , others want to restrict the use of another legal drug : alcohol .

brewers and farmers say an extremely poor barley harvest in 2006 has exacerbated an emerging trend of converting barley fields to growing the plants used in biofuels , such as rapeseed .
the amount of land used for growing barley in germany is receding by 5 percent a year .
the march of biofuels is inexorable .
of the 12 million hectares -lrb- 30 million acres -rrb- farmed in germany , two million are already being used for plants that can be turned into biofuel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed fields are commonplace in germany " biofuels are monopolizing the land , " said manfred weizbauer , the head of the german millers ' federation , which is calling for a cut in the subsidies granted to biofuel crops .
" the german government has got to be reasonable and not give more importance to energy security than to food security , " he said .
the impact of the biofuels is not restricted to beer , with the price of bread likely to rise by 10 percent as a result of reduced grain production , the german bakers ' federation has warned .
sign of the times germany is not alone in experiencing the effects of converting arable land to new uses .
although it is not suffering the potentially catastrophic consequences felt by mexico , where the phenomenon has caused maize prices to climb sharply , german millers fear the effects of steadily rising cereal prices .
the biofuels policy is encouraged by the european union , which wants vehicle fuel to contain at least 10 percent of the " green " fuel by 2020 .
but jens redemacher , the head of the cereals division of the federation of german farmers , said the brewers also had themselves to blame .
" they have demanded lower and lower prices for barley which has caused farmers to abandon growing it because it was no longer profitable .
so biofuels are not the only culprits , " he said .
the food industry is " just going to have to get used to having a competitor for the purchase of cereals , especially those used for biofuels , " redemacher said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the booze wars : a german city takes on public drinking while the german states and the federal government argue over a blanket ban on smoking in public places , others want to restrict the use of another legal drug : alcohol .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 23.04.2007 germans dig for " white gold " as demand for asparagus grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans eat the most white asparagus in the world white asparagus has been called the " vegetable of kings , " " edible ivory , " or simply " white gold . "
the unusually warm weather has meant a great start to the season in germany .
but others in europe are n't pleased . there 's a continual stream of people bustling in and out of the store on the böser asparagus farm in bruchsal in the southern german state of baden-württemberg .
the unseasonably warm april temperatures have caused the asparagus to shoot earlier than normal .
this has caused record harvests for this time of the year , but it 's still not as much as farmers originally hoped for . " with such a mild winter , we thought we would just need a couple of rays of sun , and the asparagus would appear , " said wolfgang böser , the chairman of the association of south german asparagus and strawberry farmers .
" but then we had a cold snap . " " still , the harvest is in full swing and straight after easter , production just shot up , " he said . fresh is best many of the customers here have driven a long way to buy kilos of fresh white asparagus , and it 's not because the prized vegetable is necessarily cheaper direct from the farm - it 's because germans are obsessed with freshness when it comes to asparagus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh asparagus squeaks when it 's rubbed together " i know it comes fresh from the field in the morning and afternoon , and i will pay the price , " one man said , clutching two bursting bags of white asparagus spears . during the asparagus season , which traditionally runs from mid-april to june 24 , germans buy nearly 50 percent of their asparagus directly from farmers ' shops and market stalls .
this is a significant figure , considering that germans usually only purchase 7 percent of all of their fruit and vegetables direct . " we sell about 85 percent of our asparagus here in the farm shop or in the restaurant we have on site , " said böser , whose 38-hectare -lrb- 94-acre -rrb- farm produces three to four tons of asparagus a day at the height of the season . asparagus obsession during its short season , asparagus features prominently on restaurant menus and café chalkboards across the country , reflecting germans ' obsession with the prized vegetable .
in fact , they eat more white asparagus than anyone else in the world , chomping their way through 1.35 kilos -lrb- three pounds -rrb- per head . it is n't difficult for gourmets to find fresh local asparagus , since with a production of some 82,000 tons , germany is the biggest asparagus grower in europe .
the area under asparagus production in the country has doubled in the past 12 years to nearly 20,000 hectares , making asparagus the country 's biggest vegetable crop in terms of area and value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german demand for asparagus has increased 40 percent in the past decade the increased german cultivation has caused imports of fresh asparagus to drop significantly - from 50 percent to 25 percent .
this is because germans are so picky about the freshness of " edible ivory " that they prefer the local product . " there is n't a pronounced preference for ' grown in germany ' with most other types of vegetables , such as lettuce and cauliflower " said christoph behr , the head of the horticulture department at the center for market and price reporting office . " but germans want german asparagus and only buy imported asparagus before the local season starts , or if it 's extremely cheap , " he said . exporting countries suffering according to behr , the countries hardest hit by the increased german production are france and the netherlands .
but spain and greece , whose season begins several weeks before the german one , are also being affected . " the problem is that more asparagus is being grown under sheeting or tunnels in germany , so the season is continually starting earlier , " behr said .
" this means that exporting countries are cutting back on cultivation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least three-quarters of german asparagus is grown under plastic sheeting for an earlier harvest to get white asparagus , the plant needs to grow in the dark and the spear has to be cut before it emerges from the soil and is exposed to the light - a growing method that is very labor intensive and makes white asparagus about one and a half to two times more expensive than the green variety .
but it seems germans are so enamored with " white gold " that they are happy to pay the price difference . " it has a very strong tradition , " behr said .
" it has a different taste - it 's not as highly-flavored , but it 's what the germans are used to .

"
the unusually warm weather has meant a great start to the season in germany .
but others in europe are n't pleased . there 's a continual stream of people bustling in and out of the store on the böser asparagus farm in bruchsal in the southern german state of baden-württemberg .
the unseasonably warm april temperatures have caused the asparagus to shoot earlier than normal .
this has caused record harvests for this time of the year , but it 's still not as much as farmers originally hoped for . " with such a mild winter , we thought we would just need a couple of rays of sun , and the asparagus would appear , " said wolfgang böser , the chairman of the association of south german asparagus and strawberry farmers .
" but then we had a cold snap . " " still , the harvest is in full swing and straight after easter , production just shot up , " he said . fresh is best many of the customers here have driven a long way to buy kilos of fresh white asparagus , and it 's not because the prized vegetable is necessarily cheaper direct from the farm - it 's because germans are obsessed with freshness when it comes to asparagus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh asparagus squeaks when it 's rubbed together " i know it comes fresh from the field in the morning and afternoon , and i will pay the price , " one man said , clutching two bursting bags of white asparagus spears . during the asparagus season , which traditionally runs from mid-april to june 24 , germans buy nearly 50 percent of their asparagus directly from farmers ' shops and market stalls .
this is a significant figure , considering that germans usually only purchase 7 percent of all of their fruit and vegetables direct . " we sell about 85 percent of our asparagus here in the farm shop or in the restaurant we have on site , " said böser , whose 38-hectare -lrb- 94-acre -rrb- farm produces three to four tons of asparagus a day at the height of the season . asparagus obsession during its short season , asparagus features prominently on restaurant menus and café chalkboards across the country , reflecting germans ' obsession with the prized vegetable .
in fact , they eat more white asparagus than anyone else in the world , chomping their way through 1.35 kilos -lrb- three pounds -rrb- per head . it is n't difficult for gourmets to find fresh local asparagus , since with a production of some 82,000 tons , germany is the biggest asparagus grower in europe .
the area under asparagus production in the country has doubled in the past 12 years to nearly 20,000 hectares , making asparagus the country 's biggest vegetable crop in terms of area and value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german demand for asparagus has increased 40 percent in the past decade the increased german cultivation has caused imports of fresh asparagus to drop significantly - from 50 percent to 25 percent .
this is because germans are so picky about the freshness of " edible ivory " that they prefer the local product . " there is n't a pronounced preference for ' grown in germany ' with most other types of vegetables , such as lettuce and cauliflower " said christoph behr , the head of the horticulture department at the center for market and price reporting office . " but germans want german asparagus and only buy imported asparagus before the local season starts , or if it 's extremely cheap , " he said . exporting countries suffering according to behr , the countries hardest hit by the increased german production are france and the netherlands .
but spain and greece , whose season begins several weeks before the german one , are also being affected . " the problem is that more asparagus is being grown under sheeting or tunnels in germany , so the season is continually starting earlier , " behr said .
" this means that exporting countries are cutting back on cultivation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least three-quarters of german asparagus is grown under plastic sheeting for an earlier harvest to get white asparagus , the plant needs to grow in the dark and the spear has to be cut before it emerges from the soil and is exposed to the light - a growing method that is very labor intensive and makes white asparagus about one and a half to two times more expensive than the green variety .
but it seems germans are so enamored with " white gold " that they are happy to pay the price difference . " it has a very strong tradition , " behr said .
" it has a different taste - it 's not as highly-flavored , but it 's what the germans are used to .

it 's a result that 's not surprising and the french are now hopeful that a serious debate will take place until the second round of voting .
that 's also desirable from a german point of view , because maybe it would make it easier for us to understand what to think of the two candidates when it comes to european policy and the franco-german relationship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anke hagedorn the election campaign so far has been a slick one - there was no overriding issue that really stuck .
it 's a far cry from the last presidential elections five years ago , when one topic , domestic safety , dominated .
this time the candidates sounded off on a whole range of issues and staged an equal number of gimmicky appearances , hoping to pull in voters . clad in jeans and sunglasses , sarkozy in the end presented himself as a mixture of cowboy and white knight , sitting on a white horse .
his message : i take charge , but i 've got my feet firmly on the ground and am also a nature-lover . centrist candidate francois bayrou , who portrayed himself as a farmer and father of six children and who had not been taken seriously by anyone at the beginning , eventually finished with a respectable result .
earlier , sarkozy enjoyed alternating between the role of savior of the nation and sacrificial lamb .
one day he flirted with trade unions while courting employers on the next .
he openly tried to woo right-extremist voters of the front national with proposals such as expelling all illegals in france and founding a ministry for immigration and national identity .
he did not tolerate competitors , be it among political adversaries or within his own ranks .
everyone , who stood in his way , was brushed aside without mercy .
editors in chief had to hand in resignations for negative coverage of sarkozy .
he threatened azouz begag , until recently minister for equal opportunities , because the latter had allegedly not been loyal .
it 's a bad omen when one thinks about what this man could do when he actually commands power .
usually dressed in a white business suit and wearing a glowing smile , segolene royal on the other hand presented herself as the new jeanne d 'arc .
she developed a new kind of communication tactic for the campaign , so-called participatory democracy .
she stood in the middle of an audience and made people believe that she was listening to them .
the only problem was it did n't work .
she usually seemed uptight and not ready for dialogue .
few managed to get to ask questions and many did n't get any answers .
it quickly led people to become disenchanted after a sky-rocketing start to the campaign .
francois bayrou hit the nail on the head when he talked about the dilemma of the voters .
" everyone 's uncertain , " he said .
" some , because they know where sarkozy would lead them and others , because they do not know where royal would take them . "
one can only hope that both candidates realize before may 6 that voters expect more than a superficial exchange of words .
they want concrete solutions , because there 's a lot of work to do in the grande nation , which has lost a lot of greatness in recent times - especially when it comes to the economy .
france has the highest unemployment rate within the euro zone , one of the lowest economic growth rates and a record trade deficit .
it 'll take more than a white horse or a white business suit to fix that .

" we 're going to use less blood in the beginning so the actors do n't slip , " producer barrie kosky said in an interview with berliner zeitung before sunday 's premiere .
the opera is n't recommended for viewers under 16 .

the king , who heard in an oracle that he was going to be killed at the hands of a foreigner , orders iphigenia to kill anyone who makes it onto the island in a sacrifice to goddess diana .
the opera opens with the priestess doing her job .
iphigenia drags a lifeless body across the stage to the rhythm of the music , slits its necks and collects the dripping blood .
soldiers in us fatigues bring iphigenia more victims and before the executions , the soldiers pose for pictures with the corpses , whose heads are wrapped in plastic bags .
" it was n't the naked seniors that hurt , but the over-naturalism of the beginning , where thoas ' prisoners were humiliated by their myrmidon charges a la abu ghraib , " cicero wrote , referring to the disrobed actors who appear in the background .
" the issue is still too close , as if one could ignore the fact that each reference also has to do with living people , who maybe do n't want to become just threads in the fabric of the world 's collective images , " the magazine continued .
for kosky , sacrifice is the most interesting part of the opera . " the idea of sacrifice runs through so many cultures , " he said , mentioning the story of abraham and isaac , which is significant to christian , jews and muslims .
a subtle love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the love story plays out between pylades -lrb- right -rrb- and orestes like abraham , iphigenia stops her knife in mid-air during one of the many sacrifices .
she recognized her brother orestes , who had come to the island with his boyfriend , pylades , after having killed his mother .
her brother 's appearance forces the priestess to choose between her heart and duty .
her heart wins out and she lets her brother live .
throughout the opera , the audience is left wondering about orestes ' sexuality .
" somebody once told me there was no love story in iphigenia , " kosky told the berliner zeitung .
" but i think there is one , and it happens between two men .
but this is no gay pride production .
the audience members have to decide for themselves what happened between the two of them . " christoph willibald gluck , one of germany ’ s great opera composers and a reformer of the genre , set the greek mythological tale of priestess iphigenia in 1779 .

it 's a result that 's not surprising and the french are now hopeful that a serious debate will take place until the second round of voting .
that 's also desirable from a german point of view , because maybe it would make it easier for us to understand what to think of the two candidates when it comes to european policy and the franco-german relationship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anke hagedorn the election campaign so far has been a slick one - there was no overriding issue that really stuck .
it 's a far cry from the last presidential elections five years ago , when one topic , domestic safety , dominated .
this time the candidates sounded off on a whole range of issues and staged an equal number of gimmicky appearances , hoping to pull in voters . clad in jeans and sunglasses , sarkozy in the end presented himself as a mixture of cowboy and white knight , sitting on a white horse .
his message : i take charge , but i 've got my feet firmly on the ground and am also a nature-lover . centrist candidate francois bayrou , who portrayed himself as a farmer and father of six children and who had not been taken seriously by anyone at the beginning , eventually finished with a respectable result .
earlier , sarkozy enjoyed alternating between the role of savior of the nation and sacrificial lamb .
one day he flirted with trade unions while courting employers on the next .
he openly tried to woo right-extremist voters of the front national with proposals such as expelling all illegals in france and founding a ministry for immigration and national identity .
he did not tolerate competitors , be it among political adversaries or within his own ranks .
everyone , who stood in his way , was brushed aside without mercy .
editors in chief had to hand in resignations for negative coverage of sarkozy .
he threatened azouz begag , until recently minister for equal opportunities , because the latter had allegedly not been loyal .
it 's a bad omen when one thinks about what this man could do when he actually commands power .
usually dressed in a white business suit and wearing a glowing smile , segolene royal on the other hand presented herself as the new jeanne d 'arc .
she developed a new kind of communication tactic for the campaign , so-called participatory democracy .
she stood in the middle of an audience and made people believe that she was listening to them .
the only problem was it did n't work .
she usually seemed uptight and not ready for dialogue .
few managed to get to ask questions and many did n't get any answers .
it quickly led people to become disenchanted after a sky-rocketing start to the campaign .
francois bayrou hit the nail on the head when he talked about the dilemma of the voters .
" everyone 's uncertain , " he said .
" some , because they know where sarkozy would lead them and others , because they do not know where royal would take them . "
one can only hope that both candidates realize before may 6 that voters expect more than a superficial exchange of words .
they want concrete solutions , because there 's a lot of work to do in the grande nation , which has lost a lot of greatness in recent times - especially when it comes to the economy .
france has the highest unemployment rate within the euro zone , one of the lowest economic growth rates and a record trade deficit .

"
the unusually warm weather has meant a great start to the season in germany .
but others in europe are n't pleased . there 's a continual stream of people bustling in and out of the store on the böser asparagus farm in bruchsal in the southern german state of baden-württemberg .
the unseasonably warm april temperatures have caused the asparagus to shoot earlier than normal .
this has caused record harvests for this time of the year , but it 's still not as much as farmers originally hoped for . " with such a mild winter , we thought we would just need a couple of rays of sun , and the asparagus would appear , " said wolfgang böser , the chairman of the association of south german asparagus and strawberry farmers .
" but then we had a cold snap . " " still , the harvest is in full swing and straight after easter , production just shot up , " he said . fresh is best many of the customers here have driven a long way to buy kilos of fresh white asparagus , and it 's not because the prized vegetable is necessarily cheaper direct from the farm - it 's because germans are obsessed with freshness when it comes to asparagus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh asparagus squeaks when it 's rubbed together " i know it comes fresh from the field in the morning and afternoon , and i will pay the price , " one man said , clutching two bursting bags of white asparagus spears . during the asparagus season , which traditionally runs from mid-april to june 24 , germans buy nearly 50 percent of their asparagus directly from farmers ' shops and market stalls .
this is a significant figure , considering that germans usually only purchase 7 percent of all of their fruit and vegetables direct . " we sell about 85 percent of our asparagus here in the farm shop or in the restaurant we have on site , " said böser , whose 38-hectare -lrb- 94-acre -rrb- farm produces three to four tons of asparagus a day at the height of the season . asparagus obsession during its short season , asparagus features prominently on restaurant menus and café chalkboards across the country , reflecting germans ' obsession with the prized vegetable .
in fact , they eat more white asparagus than anyone else in the world , chomping their way through 1.35 kilos -lrb- three pounds -rrb- per head . it is n't difficult for gourmets to find fresh local asparagus , since with a production of some 82,000 tons , germany is the biggest asparagus grower in europe .
the area under asparagus production in the country has doubled in the past 12 years to nearly 20,000 hectares , making asparagus the country 's biggest vegetable crop in terms of area and value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german demand for asparagus has increased 40 percent in the past decade the increased german cultivation has caused imports of fresh asparagus to drop significantly - from 50 percent to 25 percent .
this is because germans are so picky about the freshness of " edible ivory " that they prefer the local product . " there is n't a pronounced preference for ' grown in germany ' with most other types of vegetables , such as lettuce and cauliflower " said christoph behr , the head of the horticulture department at the center for market and price reporting office . " but germans want german asparagus and only buy imported asparagus before the local season starts , or if it 's extremely cheap , " he said . exporting countries suffering according to behr , the countries hardest hit by the increased german production are france and the netherlands .
but spain and greece , whose season begins several weeks before the german one , are also being affected . " the problem is that more asparagus is being grown under sheeting or tunnels in germany , so the season is continually starting earlier , " behr said .
" this means that exporting countries are cutting back on cultivation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least three-quarters of german asparagus is grown under plastic sheeting for an earlier harvest to get white asparagus , the plant needs to grow in the dark and the spear has to be cut before it emerges from the soil and is exposed to the light - a growing method that is very labor intensive and makes white asparagus about one and a half to two times more expensive than the green variety .
but it seems germans are so enamored with " white gold " that they are happy to pay the price difference . " it has a very strong tradition , " behr said .
" it has a different taste - it 's not as highly-flavored , but it 's what the germans are used to .

"
the unusually warm weather has meant a great start to the season in germany .
but others in europe are n't pleased . there 's a continual stream of people bustling in and out of the store on the böser asparagus farm in bruchsal in the southern german state of baden-württemberg .
the unseasonably warm april temperatures have caused the asparagus to shoot earlier than normal .
this has caused record harvests for this time of the year , but it 's still not as much as farmers originally hoped for . " with such a mild winter , we thought we would just need a couple of rays of sun , and the asparagus would appear , " said wolfgang böser , the chairman of the association of south german asparagus and strawberry farmers .
" but then we had a cold snap . " " still , the harvest is in full swing and straight after easter , production just shot up , " he said . fresh is best many of the customers here have driven a long way to buy kilos of fresh white asparagus , and it 's not because the prized vegetable is necessarily cheaper direct from the farm - it 's because germans are obsessed with freshness when it comes to asparagus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh asparagus squeaks when it 's rubbed together " i know it comes fresh from the field in the morning and afternoon , and i will pay the price , " one man said , clutching two bursting bags of white asparagus spears . during the asparagus season , which traditionally runs from mid-april to june 24 , germans buy nearly 50 percent of their asparagus directly from farmers ' shops and market stalls .
this is a significant figure , considering that germans usually only purchase 7 percent of all of their fruit and vegetables direct . " we sell about 85 percent of our asparagus here in the farm shop or in the restaurant we have on site , " said böser , whose 38-hectare -lrb- 94-acre -rrb- farm produces three to four tons of asparagus a day at the height of the season . asparagus obsession during its short season , asparagus features prominently on restaurant menus and café chalkboards across the country , reflecting germans ' obsession with the prized vegetable .
in fact , they eat more white asparagus than anyone else in the world , chomping their way through 1.35 kilos -lrb- three pounds -rrb- per head . it is n't difficult for gourmets to find fresh local asparagus , since with a production of some 82,000 tons , germany is the biggest asparagus grower in europe .
the area under asparagus production in the country has doubled in the past 12 years to nearly 20,000 hectares , making asparagus the country 's biggest vegetable crop in terms of area and value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german demand for asparagus has increased 40 percent in the past decade the increased german cultivation has caused imports of fresh asparagus to drop significantly - from 50 percent to 25 percent .
this is because germans are so picky about the freshness of " edible ivory " that they prefer the local product . " there is n't a pronounced preference for ' grown in germany ' with most other types of vegetables , such as lettuce and cauliflower " said christoph behr , the head of the horticulture department at the center for market and price reporting office . " but germans want german asparagus and only buy imported asparagus before the local season starts , or if it 's extremely cheap , " he said . exporting countries suffering according to behr , the countries hardest hit by the increased german production are france and the netherlands .
but spain and greece , whose season begins several weeks before the german one , are also being affected . " the problem is that more asparagus is being grown under sheeting or tunnels in germany , so the season is continually starting earlier , " behr said .
" this means that exporting countries are cutting back on cultivation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least three-quarters of german asparagus is grown under plastic sheeting for an earlier harvest to get white asparagus , the plant needs to grow in the dark and the spear has to be cut before it emerges from the soil and is exposed to the light - a growing method that is very labor intensive and makes white asparagus about one and a half to two times more expensive than the green variety .
but it seems germans are so enamored with " white gold " that they are happy to pay the price difference . " it has a very strong tradition , " behr said .
" it has a different taste - it 's not as highly-flavored , but it 's what the germans are used to .

gäfgen had given the police a number of false locations for the boy 's whereabouts .

the german arm of belgian brewer inbev , which owns the beck 's and franziskaner brands , confirmed it would be implementing " slight " price rises , while germany 's radeberger said it was considering a similar move .

average annual consumption of beer in germany last year was 111.6 liters per head , equivalent to every one of the country 's 82 million people drinking a 0.31-liter glass every day , according to figures released on friday .

but the price of barley , which is used to make malt , an essential ingredient in brewing , has doubled in the space of a year from 200 to 400 euros per ton on the german market .
brewers and farmers say an extremely poor barley harvest in 2006 has exacerbated an emerging trend of converting barley fields to growing the plants used in biofuels , such as rapeseed .
the amount of land used for growing barley in germany is receding by 5 percent a year .
the march of biofuels is inexorable .
of the 12 million hectares -lrb- 30 million acres -rrb- farmed in germany , two million are already being used for plants that can be turned into biofuel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed fields are commonplace in germany " biofuels are monopolizing the land , " said manfred weizbauer , the head of the german millers ' federation , which is calling for a cut in the subsidies granted to biofuel crops .
" the german government has got to be reasonable and not give more importance to energy security than to food security , " he said .
the impact of the biofuels is not restricted to beer , with the price of bread likely to rise by 10 percent as a result of reduced grain production , the german bakers ' federation has warned .
sign of the times germany is not alone in experiencing the effects of converting arable land to new uses .
although it is not suffering the potentially catastrophic consequences felt by mexico , where the phenomenon has caused maize prices to climb sharply , german millers fear the effects of steadily rising cereal prices .
the biofuels policy is encouraged by the european union , which wants vehicle fuel to contain at least 10 percent of the " green " fuel by 2020 .
but jens redemacher , the head of the cereals division of the federation of german farmers , said the brewers also had themselves to blame .
" they have demanded lower and lower prices for barley which has caused farmers to abandon growing it because it was no longer profitable .

" many brewers have no choice but to raise their prices , " said kai schuerholt , a spokesman for the german brewers ' association .
" they decided not to pass on the three-percentage point rise in value-added tax that came into force in germany on jan .
1 , but in this case they have no alternative . "
the german arm of belgian brewer inbev , which owns the beck 's and franziskaner brands , confirmed it would be implementing " slight " price rises , while germany 's radeberger said it was considering a similar move .
it is hard to overstate the importance of beer in germany - it is drunk in vast quantities and the market is fiercely competitive and extremely price-sensitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's oktoberfest is one big beer-drinking party a half-liter -lrb- one pint -rrb- glass currently costs as little as three euros -lrb- four dollars -rrb- in a bar or restaurant , a price that makes drinkers in most other western european countries green with envy .
average annual consumption of beer in germany last year was 111.6 liters per head , equivalent to every one of the country 's 82 million people drinking a 0.31-liter glass every day , according to figures released on friday .
energy security vs. food security ?
but the price of barley , which is used to make malt , an essential ingredient in brewing , has doubled in the space of a year from 200 to 400 euros per ton on the german market .
brewers and farmers say an extremely poor barley harvest in 2006 has exacerbated an emerging trend of converting barley fields to growing the plants used in biofuels , such as rapeseed .
the amount of land used for growing barley in germany is receding by 5 percent a year .
the march of biofuels is inexorable .
of the 12 million hectares -lrb- 30 million acres -rrb- farmed in germany , two million are already being used for plants that can be turned into biofuel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed fields are commonplace in germany " biofuels are monopolizing the land , " said manfred weizbauer , the head of the german millers ' federation , which is calling for a cut in the subsidies granted to biofuel crops .
" the german government has got to be reasonable and not give more importance to energy security than to food security , " he said .
the impact of the biofuels is not restricted to beer , with the price of bread likely to rise by 10 percent as a result of reduced grain production , the german bakers ' federation has warned .
sign of the times germany is not alone in experiencing the effects of converting arable land to new uses .
although it is not suffering the potentially catastrophic consequences felt by mexico , where the phenomenon has caused maize prices to climb sharply , german millers fear the effects of steadily rising cereal prices .
the biofuels policy is encouraged by the european union , which wants vehicle fuel to contain at least 10 percent of the " green " fuel by 2020 .
but jens redemacher , the head of the cereals division of the federation of german farmers , said the brewers also had themselves to blame .
" they have demanded lower and lower prices for barley which has caused farmers to abandon growing it because it was no longer profitable .
so biofuels are not the only culprits , " he said .
the food industry is " just going to have to get used to having a competitor for the purchase of cereals , especially those used for biofuels , " redemacher said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the booze wars : a german city takes on public drinking while the german states and the federal government argue over a blanket ban on smoking in public places , others want to restrict the use of another legal drug : alcohol .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 23.04.2007 merkel expects few us concessions on climate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans might love knut , but are they doing enough to protect his habitat ?
in an interview published monday , german chancellor angela merkel said she did not expect washington to adopt european goals on climate protection at an eu-us summit next week . " i do not think the us will adopt the european climate protection goals , " merkel told the daily münchener merkur . but she said there was growing awareness in the united states and within the us government that reducing greenhouse gas emissions was crucial . " i have been pleased at international meetings to see a growing feeling for a common , global responsibility -lrb- for climate protection -rrb- , " she said .
" on some issues , the us is even surpassing european targets , for example in the use of biofuels . " germany currently holds the rotating presidency of both the group of eight club of rich nations and the european union . not that different after all ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the us and eu really closer together on climate protection than people think ?
the us ambassador to the eu , boyden gray , said earlier this month that the gap between the united states and eu over how to tackle global warming is narrower than many might think . " both sides of the atlantic now agree it 's the same and it 's a constructive change , " he said .
" i do n't see that much difference . " gray was responding to criticism from european environment commissioner stavros dimas , who tartly compared eu plans to cut greenhouse-gas emissions through ever-tighter , legally binding curbs with the us voluntary approach . thinking beyond kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the next us president make environmentalists happier ?
the eu championed the kyoto protocol to reduce harmful emissions after it was abandoned by the united states in march 2001 . but the treaty has been almost crippled by the absence of the united states , which alone accounts for about a quarter of all this pollution . exploratory negotiations are under way for determining what treaty should follow kyoto after the accord expires at the end of 2012 . germany helped broker an agreement last month under which the 27 eu member states will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels over the next 13 years . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german paper teams up with environmentalists to save planet germany 's leading mass-market newspaper has joined the country 's major environment organizations in a nationwide campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .

though relatively wealthy , europe will also struggle , a new report says .
-lrb- 12.04.2007 -rrb- eu urges germany to do more to combat climate change a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases .

" what it means is that this time there will be no sense of frustration on the eve of the second round .
people will have the means to make a clear choice .
they will make one , and the country will discover what direction it has chosen , and what direction it must now take , " he wrote . for christophe barbier , editor of l 'express news magazine , " the french wanted so much to have this head-to-head between royal and sarkozy - between a left in the process of renewal and a confident new right . "
barbier added that sarkozy should have the advantage ahead of the second round run-off on may 6 , counting on carry-over votes from far-right leader jean-marie le pen and centrist francois bayrou .
" but nothing is decided , " he added .
" segolene royal has one important weapon : the ' anyone but sarko ' option .

"
in an editorial titled " france needs sarkozy " it continued to say that between the two candidates left , " it is mr sarkozy who is likeliest to embrace the painful structural changes that france so desperately needs .
but before that , he needs to win an election - far from a sure thing , especially in this most fascinating of contests . " in germany , business daily financial times deutschland warned that the two weeks until the final round would be marked by " extreme polarization " as the campaign grows " tougher , more ruthless and more personal . "
but it said royal and sarkozy did not represent two radically different ends of the political spectrum .
" to the contrary : the last weeks have shown that each candidate constantly took on board the populist demands of the other to try to best his or her opponent .
in the end , there may be a close outcome and a france deeply divided into two camps . " the conservative broadsheet frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also noted the remarkably high turnout at the polls .
" apparently the french were fascinated by a campaign that was fixated on personalities . "
it said that royal had done better than expected while sarkozy could be satisfied with meeting his goal of seizing 30 percent of the vote in the first round .
" with a campaign that started with a liberal tone , then took on more and more gaullist accents and at the end leaned sharply to the right , he exhausted his own voter potential while luring le pen voters . " spanish daily el pais meanwhile said that royal 's " only chance to defeat sarkozy will be to seek bayrou 's support , but this will not be easy .

" we 're going to use less blood in the beginning so the actors do n't slip , " producer barrie kosky said in an interview with berliner zeitung before sunday 's premiere .
the opera is n't recommended for viewers under 16 .
whether despite or because of the blood , murder and nudity , sunday 's crowd at berlin 's komische oper cheered the modern version of the ancient tale , and culture magazine cicero called it " a great evening of humanity . "
sacrifice at abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geraldine mcgreevy plays the priestess iphigenia iphigenia , the title character , is a priestess and prisoner of king thoas on the island of tauris .
the king , who heard in an oracle that he was going to be killed at the hands of a foreigner , orders iphigenia to kill anyone who makes it onto the island in a sacrifice to goddess diana .
the opera opens with the priestess doing her job .
iphigenia drags a lifeless body across the stage to the rhythm of the music , slits its necks and collects the dripping blood .
soldiers in us fatigues bring iphigenia more victims and before the executions , the soldiers pose for pictures with the corpses , whose heads are wrapped in plastic bags .
" it was n't the naked seniors that hurt , but the over-naturalism of the beginning , where thoas ' prisoners were humiliated by their myrmidon charges a la abu ghraib , " cicero wrote , referring to the disrobed actors who appear in the background .
" the issue is still too close , as if one could ignore the fact that each reference also has to do with living people , who maybe do n't want to become just threads in the fabric of the world 's collective images , " the magazine continued .
for kosky , sacrifice is the most interesting part of the opera . " the idea of sacrifice runs through so many cultures , " he said , mentioning the story of abraham and isaac , which is significant to christian , jews and muslims .
a subtle love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the love story plays out between pylades -lrb- right -rrb- and orestes like abraham , iphigenia stops her knife in mid-air during one of the many sacrifices .
she recognized her brother orestes , who had come to the island with his boyfriend , pylades , after having killed his mother .
her brother 's appearance forces the priestess to choose between her heart and duty .
her heart wins out and she lets her brother live .
throughout the opera , the audience is left wondering about orestes ' sexuality .
" somebody once told me there was no love story in iphigenia , " kosky told the berliner zeitung .
" but i think there is one , and it happens between two men .
but this is no gay pride production .
the audience members have to decide for themselves what happened between the two of them . " christoph willibald gluck , one of germany ’ s great opera composers and a reformer of the genre , set the greek mythological tale of priestess iphigenia in 1779 .

a subtle love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the love story plays out between pylades -lrb- right -rrb- and orestes like abraham , iphigenia stops her knife in mid-air during one of the many sacrifices .
she recognized her brother orestes , who had come to the island with his boyfriend , pylades , after having killed his mother .
her brother 's appearance forces the priestess to choose between her heart and duty .
her heart wins out and she lets her brother live .
throughout the opera , the audience is left wondering about orestes ' sexuality .
" somebody once told me there was no love story in iphigenia , " kosky told the berliner zeitung .
" but i think there is one , and it happens between two men .
but this is no gay pride production .
the audience members have to decide for themselves what happened between the two of them . " christoph willibald gluck , one of germany ’ s great opera composers and a reformer of the genre , set the greek mythological tale of priestess iphigenia in 1779 .

people wanted to wipe out the memory of april 21 , " he wrote , referring to the 2002 election first round , when huge abstention and a high vote for the political extremes meant that national front leader jean-marie le pen qualified for round two instead of the socialist lionel jospin .
" what it means is that this time there will be no sense of frustration on the eve of the second round .
people will have the means to make a clear choice .
they will make one , and the country will discover what direction it has chosen , and what direction it must now take , " he wrote . for christophe barbier , editor of l 'express news magazine , " the french wanted so much to have this head-to-head between royal and sarkozy - between a left in the process of renewal and a confident new right . "
barbier added that sarkozy should have the advantage ahead of the second round run-off on may 6 , counting on carry-over votes from far-right leader jean-marie le pen and centrist francois bayrou .
" but nothing is decided , " he added .
" segolene royal has one important weapon : the ' anyone but sarko ' option .
we can expect a second round which brings out all his character faults and ideological excesses .
in short - it 's back to where we were at the start of the campaign . " british newspapers on monday also noted that the high turnout in the first-round of french elections was a sign of the polls ' importance , and warned that a fierce clash was forthcoming . the daily telegraph , a right-wing paper , wrote france is " as its people recognize , in trouble - and this election is , as the high turnout yesterday indicates , its best chance to turn things around . "
in an editorial titled " france needs sarkozy " it continued to say that between the two candidates left , " it is mr sarkozy who is likeliest to embrace the painful structural changes that france so desperately needs .
but before that , he needs to win an election - far from a sure thing , especially in this most fascinating of contests . " in germany , business daily financial times deutschland warned that the two weeks until the final round would be marked by " extreme polarization " as the campaign grows " tougher , more ruthless and more personal . "
but it said royal and sarkozy did not represent two radically different ends of the political spectrum .
" to the contrary : the last weeks have shown that each candidate constantly took on board the populist demands of the other to try to best his or her opponent .
in the end , there may be a close outcome and a france deeply divided into two camps . " the conservative broadsheet frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also noted the remarkably high turnout at the polls .
" apparently the french were fascinated by a campaign that was fixated on personalities . "
it said that royal had done better than expected while sarkozy could be satisfied with meeting his goal of seizing 30 percent of the vote in the first round .
" with a campaign that started with a liberal tone , then took on more and more gaullist accents and at the end leaned sharply to the right , he exhausted his own voter potential while luring le pen voters . " spanish daily el pais meanwhile said that royal 's " only chance to defeat sarkozy will be to seek bayrou 's support , but this will not be easy .
sarkozy is still the best armed candidate to enter the elysee which does not mean that his victory is guaranteed because of the powerful rejection and hatred he provokes among some french voters , " the paper said . for italy 's la stampa , " the absolute novelty is the presence of a woman who had been expected to be defeated in the first round ... the french will now be able to choose not only between two very different political options but also between a man and woman , " the newspaper said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sarkozy , royal open duel for french presidency conservative nicolas sarkozy and socialist segolene royal face off in a dramatic left-right battle for the french presidency after winning round one of an election marked by a near record turnout .

it 's a result that 's not surprising and the french are now hopeful that a serious debate will take place until the second round of voting .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anke hagedorn the election campaign so far has been a slick one - there was no overriding issue that really stuck .
it 's a far cry from the last presidential elections five years ago , when one topic , domestic safety , dominated .
this time the candidates sounded off on a whole range of issues and staged an equal number of gimmicky appearances , hoping to pull in voters . clad in jeans and sunglasses , sarkozy in the end presented himself as a mixture of cowboy and white knight , sitting on a white horse .
his message : i take charge , but i 've got my feet firmly on the ground and am also a nature-lover . centrist candidate francois bayrou , who portrayed himself as a farmer and father of six children and who had not been taken seriously by anyone at the beginning , eventually finished with a respectable result .
earlier , sarkozy enjoyed alternating between the role of savior of the nation and sacrificial lamb .
one day he flirted with trade unions while courting employers on the next .
he openly tried to woo right-extremist voters of the front national with proposals such as expelling all illegals in france and founding a ministry for immigration and national identity .

it quickly led people to become disenchanted after a sky-rocketing start to the campaign .
francois bayrou hit the nail on the head when he talked about the dilemma of the voters .
" everyone 's uncertain , " he said .
" some , because they know where sarkozy would lead them and others , because they do not know where royal would take them . "
one can only hope that both candidates realize before may 6 that voters expect more than a superficial exchange of words .

his message : i take charge , but i 've got my feet firmly on the ground and am also a nature-lover . centrist candidate francois bayrou , who portrayed himself as a farmer and father of six children and who had not been taken seriously by anyone at the beginning , eventually finished with a respectable result .
earlier , sarkozy enjoyed alternating between the role of savior of the nation and sacrificial lamb .
one day he flirted with trade unions while courting employers on the next .
he openly tried to woo right-extremist voters of the front national with proposals such as expelling all illegals in france and founding a ministry for immigration and national identity .

" some , because they know where sarkozy would lead them and others , because they do not know where royal would take them . "
one can only hope that both candidates realize before may 6 that voters expect more than a superficial exchange of words .

it 's a result that 's not surprising and the french are now hopeful that a serious debate will take place until the second round of voting .
that 's also desirable from a german point of view , because maybe it would make it easier for us to understand what to think of the two candidates when it comes to european policy and the franco-german relationship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anke hagedorn the election campaign so far has been a slick one - there was no overriding issue that really stuck .
it 's a far cry from the last presidential elections five years ago , when one topic , domestic safety , dominated .
this time the candidates sounded off on a whole range of issues and staged an equal number of gimmicky appearances , hoping to pull in voters . clad in jeans and sunglasses , sarkozy in the end presented himself as a mixture of cowboy and white knight , sitting on a white horse .
his message : i take charge , but i 've got my feet firmly on the ground and am also a nature-lover . centrist candidate francois bayrou , who portrayed himself as a farmer and father of six children and who had not been taken seriously by anyone at the beginning , eventually finished with a respectable result .
earlier , sarkozy enjoyed alternating between the role of savior of the nation and sacrificial lamb .
one day he flirted with trade unions while courting employers on the next .
he openly tried to woo right-extremist voters of the front national with proposals such as expelling all illegals in france and founding a ministry for immigration and national identity .
he did not tolerate competitors , be it among political adversaries or within his own ranks .
everyone , who stood in his way , was brushed aside without mercy .
editors in chief had to hand in resignations for negative coverage of sarkozy .
he threatened azouz begag , until recently minister for equal opportunities , because the latter had allegedly not been loyal .
it 's a bad omen when one thinks about what this man could do when he actually commands power .
usually dressed in a white business suit and wearing a glowing smile , segolene royal on the other hand presented herself as the new jeanne d 'arc .
she developed a new kind of communication tactic for the campaign , so-called participatory democracy .
she stood in the middle of an audience and made people believe that she was listening to them .
the only problem was it did n't work .
she usually seemed uptight and not ready for dialogue .
few managed to get to ask questions and many did n't get any answers .
it quickly led people to become disenchanted after a sky-rocketing start to the campaign .
francois bayrou hit the nail on the head when he talked about the dilemma of the voters .
" everyone 's uncertain , " he said .
" some , because they know where sarkozy would lead them and others , because they do not know where royal would take them . "
one can only hope that both candidates realize before may 6 that voters expect more than a superficial exchange of words .
they want concrete solutions , because there 's a lot of work to do in the grande nation , which has lost a lot of greatness in recent times - especially when it comes to the economy .
france has the highest unemployment rate within the euro zone , one of the lowest economic growth rates and a record trade deficit .

it 's a result that 's not surprising and the french are now hopeful that a serious debate will take place until the second round of voting .
that 's also desirable from a german point of view , because maybe it would make it easier for us to understand what to think of the two candidates when it comes to european policy and the franco-german relationship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anke hagedorn the election campaign so far has been a slick one - there was no overriding issue that really stuck .
it 's a far cry from the last presidential elections five years ago , when one topic , domestic safety , dominated .
this time the candidates sounded off on a whole range of issues and staged an equal number of gimmicky appearances , hoping to pull in voters . clad in jeans and sunglasses , sarkozy in the end presented himself as a mixture of cowboy and white knight , sitting on a white horse .
his message : i take charge , but i 've got my feet firmly on the ground and am also a nature-lover . centrist candidate francois bayrou , who portrayed himself as a farmer and father of six children and who had not been taken seriously by anyone at the beginning , eventually finished with a respectable result .
earlier , sarkozy enjoyed alternating between the role of savior of the nation and sacrificial lamb .
one day he flirted with trade unions while courting employers on the next .
he openly tried to woo right-extremist voters of the front national with proposals such as expelling all illegals in france and founding a ministry for immigration and national identity .
he did not tolerate competitors , be it among political adversaries or within his own ranks .
everyone , who stood in his way , was brushed aside without mercy .
editors in chief had to hand in resignations for negative coverage of sarkozy .
he threatened azouz begag , until recently minister for equal opportunities , because the latter had allegedly not been loyal .
it 's a bad omen when one thinks about what this man could do when he actually commands power .
usually dressed in a white business suit and wearing a glowing smile , segolene royal on the other hand presented herself as the new jeanne d 'arc .
she developed a new kind of communication tactic for the campaign , so-called participatory democracy .
she stood in the middle of an audience and made people believe that she was listening to them .
the only problem was it did n't work .
she usually seemed uptight and not ready for dialogue .
few managed to get to ask questions and many did n't get any answers .
it quickly led people to become disenchanted after a sky-rocketing start to the campaign .
francois bayrou hit the nail on the head when he talked about the dilemma of the voters .
" everyone 's uncertain , " he said .
" some , because they know where sarkozy would lead them and others , because they do not know where royal would take them . "
one can only hope that both candidates realize before may 6 that voters expect more than a superficial exchange of words .
they want concrete solutions , because there 's a lot of work to do in the grande nation , which has lost a lot of greatness in recent times - especially when it comes to the economy .
france has the highest unemployment rate within the euro zone , one of the lowest economic growth rates and a record trade deficit .
it 'll take more than a white horse or a white business suit to fix that .

royal 's result was a huge relief for the opposition socialist party which had feared a repeat of the 2002 shock when then prime minister lionel jospin was humiliatingly knocked out of the race in the first round by far-right national front leader jean-marie le pen .
this time le pen was in shock after he came in fourth , with 10.51 percent .
democratic awakening bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy thanked supporters on sunday jean-marie colombani , editor-in-chief of le monde newspaper , said the highest turnout for more than 40 years - 84.6 percent - showed that the french had undergone a " democratic awakening " and that " people wanted to wipe out the memory " of le pen 's success in 2002 .
none of the other eight candidates gained more than five percent , according to final figures from the interior ministry .
sarkozy and royal will now square off in the second round on may 6 , and will put their starkly different visions to a public test in a face-to-face televised debate on may 2 .
a clear choice ?
" i want only one thing : to rally the french people around a new french dream , " sarkozy , 52 , the governing party 's candidate , told cheering supporters .

" we have a clear choice between two , very different projects for society , " she told a post-election rally .
an opinion poll by ipsos after the first round predicted sarkozy would beat royal by 54 percent to 46 in the run-off .
back to campaigning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will bayrou play a decisive role ?
both candidates went straight back onto the campaign trail monday , looking to woo the all important electorate of centrist francois bayrou , who came in third with 18.55 percent .
sarkozy 's lieutenant brice hortefeux said the frontrunner would not entertain " backroom deals " with bayrou , but said " the door is not closed " to negotiations .
bayrou 's small union for a french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- party has in the past aligned itself with sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- in parliament but the candidate has veered to the left during the campaign .
" we will not start negotiating in the wings as some usually do , " said jean-christophe lagarde , a deputy from bayrou 's udf party .
" we will think about the best way to ensure that the views of the people who said ' we want to change politics in this country ' are respected . "
bayrou , a 55-year-old former education minister , had campaigned on a platform that rejected the traditional left and right divide and called for a unity government made up of moderates from both camps . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : it 's time to get serious in france deutsche welle 's anke hagedorn says that nicolas sarkozy and segolene royal now need to focus on the issues rather than appearances before they square off again in the race for the french presidency on may 6 .

in an interview published monday , german chancellor angela merkel said she did not expect washington to adopt european goals on climate protection at an eu-us summit next week . " i do not think the us will adopt the european climate protection goals , " merkel told the daily münchener merkur . but she said there was growing awareness in the united states and within the us government that reducing greenhouse gas emissions was crucial . " i have been pleased at international meetings to see a growing feeling for a common , global responsibility -lrb- for climate protection -rrb- , " she said .
" on some issues , the us is even surpassing european targets , for example in the use of biofuels . " germany currently holds the rotating presidency of both the group of eight club of rich nations and the european union . not that different after all ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the us and eu really closer together on climate protection than people think ?
the us ambassador to the eu , boyden gray , said earlier this month that the gap between the united states and eu over how to tackle global warming is narrower than many might think . " both sides of the atlantic now agree it 's the same and it 's a constructive change , " he said .
" i do n't see that much difference . " gray was responding to criticism from european environment commissioner stavros dimas , who tartly compared eu plans to cut greenhouse-gas emissions through ever-tighter , legally binding curbs with the us voluntary approach . thinking beyond kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the next us president make environmentalists happier ?
the eu championed the kyoto protocol to reduce harmful emissions after it was abandoned by the united states in march 2001 . but the treaty has been almost crippled by the absence of the united states , which alone accounts for about a quarter of all this pollution . exploratory negotiations are under way for determining what treaty should follow kyoto after the accord expires at the end of 2012 . germany helped broker an agreement last month under which the 27 eu member states will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels over the next 13 years . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german paper teams up with environmentalists to save planet germany 's leading mass-market newspaper has joined the country 's major environment organizations in a nationwide campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .

though relatively wealthy , europe will also struggle , a new report says .

" we 're going to use less blood in the beginning so the actors do n't slip , " producer barrie kosky said in an interview with berliner zeitung before sunday 's premiere .
the opera is n't recommended for viewers under 16 .

the king , who heard in an oracle that he was going to be killed at the hands of a foreigner , orders iphigenia to kill anyone who makes it onto the island in a sacrifice to goddess diana .
the opera opens with the priestess doing her job .

soldiers in us fatigues bring iphigenia more victims and before the executions , the soldiers pose for pictures with the corpses , whose heads are wrapped in plastic bags .

her brother 's appearance forces the priestess to choose between her heart and duty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 23.04.2007 germany 's cheap beer tradition under threat from biofuels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of biofuels is affecting the price of germany 's most cherished beverage germans will have to dig deeper in their pockets to enjoy their beloved beer in the next few months as barley is increasingly displaced in the country 's fields by heavily subsidized crops used for biofuels . " many brewers have no choice but to raise their prices , " said kai schuerholt , a spokesman for the german brewers ' association .
" they decided not to pass on the three-percentage point rise in value-added tax that came into force in germany on jan .
1 , but in this case they have no alternative . "
the german arm of belgian brewer inbev , which owns the beck 's and franziskaner brands , confirmed it would be implementing " slight " price rises , while germany 's radeberger said it was considering a similar move .
it is hard to overstate the importance of beer in germany - it is drunk in vast quantities and the market is fiercely competitive and extremely price-sensitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's oktoberfest is one big beer-drinking party a half-liter -lrb- one pint -rrb- glass currently costs as little as three euros -lrb- four dollars -rrb- in a bar or restaurant , a price that makes drinkers in most other western european countries green with envy .
average annual consumption of beer in germany last year was 111.6 liters per head , equivalent to every one of the country 's 82 million people drinking a 0.31-liter glass every day , according to figures released on friday .
energy security vs. food security ?
but the price of barley , which is used to make malt , an essential ingredient in brewing , has doubled in the space of a year from 200 to 400 euros per ton on the german market .
brewers and farmers say an extremely poor barley harvest in 2006 has exacerbated an emerging trend of converting barley fields to growing the plants used in biofuels , such as rapeseed .
the amount of land used for growing barley in germany is receding by 5 percent a year .
the march of biofuels is inexorable .
of the 12 million hectares -lrb- 30 million acres -rrb- farmed in germany , two million are already being used for plants that can be turned into biofuel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed fields are commonplace in germany " biofuels are monopolizing the land , " said manfred weizbauer , the head of the german millers ' federation , which is calling for a cut in the subsidies granted to biofuel crops .
" the german government has got to be reasonable and not give more importance to energy security than to food security , " he said .
the impact of the biofuels is not restricted to beer , with the price of bread likely to rise by 10 percent as a result of reduced grain production , the german bakers ' federation has warned .
sign of the times germany is not alone in experiencing the effects of converting arable land to new uses .
although it is not suffering the potentially catastrophic consequences felt by mexico , where the phenomenon has caused maize prices to climb sharply , german millers fear the effects of steadily rising cereal prices .
the biofuels policy is encouraged by the european union , which wants vehicle fuel to contain at least 10 percent of the " green " fuel by 2020 .
but jens redemacher , the head of the cereals division of the federation of german farmers , said the brewers also had themselves to blame .
" they have demanded lower and lower prices for barley which has caused farmers to abandon growing it because it was no longer profitable .
so biofuels are not the only culprits , " he said .
the food industry is " just going to have to get used to having a competitor for the purchase of cereals , especially those used for biofuels , " redemacher said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the booze wars : a german city takes on public drinking while the german states and the federal government argue over a blanket ban on smoking in public places , others want to restrict the use of another legal drug : alcohol .

but the price of barley , which is used to make malt , an essential ingredient in brewing , has doubled in the space of a year from 200 to 400 euros per ton on the german market .
brewers and farmers say an extremely poor barley harvest in 2006 has exacerbated an emerging trend of converting barley fields to growing the plants used in biofuels , such as rapeseed .
the amount of land used for growing barley in germany is receding by 5 percent a year .
the march of biofuels is inexorable .

" the german government has got to be reasonable and not give more importance to energy security than to food security , " he said .
the impact of the biofuels is not restricted to beer , with the price of bread likely to rise by 10 percent as a result of reduced grain production , the german bakers ' federation has warned .
sign of the times germany is not alone in experiencing the effects of converting arable land to new uses .
although it is not suffering the potentially catastrophic consequences felt by mexico , where the phenomenon has caused maize prices to climb sharply , german millers fear the effects of steadily rising cereal prices .
the biofuels policy is encouraged by the european union , which wants vehicle fuel to contain at least 10 percent of the " green " fuel by 2020 .
but jens redemacher , the head of the cereals division of the federation of german farmers , said the brewers also had themselves to blame .
" they have demanded lower and lower prices for barley which has caused farmers to abandon growing it because it was no longer profitable .

" we 're going to use less blood in the beginning so the actors do n't slip , " producer barrie kosky said in an interview with berliner zeitung before sunday 's premiere .
the opera is n't recommended for viewers under 16 .
whether despite or because of the blood , murder and nudity , sunday 's crowd at berlin 's komische oper cheered the modern version of the ancient tale , and culture magazine cicero called it " a great evening of humanity . "
sacrifice at abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geraldine mcgreevy plays the priestess iphigenia iphigenia , the title character , is a priestess and prisoner of king thoas on the island of tauris .
the king , who heard in an oracle that he was going to be killed at the hands of a foreigner , orders iphigenia to kill anyone who makes it onto the island in a sacrifice to goddess diana .
the opera opens with the priestess doing her job .
iphigenia drags a lifeless body across the stage to the rhythm of the music , slits its necks and collects the dripping blood .
soldiers in us fatigues bring iphigenia more victims and before the executions , the soldiers pose for pictures with the corpses , whose heads are wrapped in plastic bags .
" it was n't the naked seniors that hurt , but the over-naturalism of the beginning , where thoas ' prisoners were humiliated by their myrmidon charges a la abu ghraib , " cicero wrote , referring to the disrobed actors who appear in the background .
" the issue is still too close , as if one could ignore the fact that each reference also has to do with living people , who maybe do n't want to become just threads in the fabric of the world 's collective images , " the magazine continued .
for kosky , sacrifice is the most interesting part of the opera . " the idea of sacrifice runs through so many cultures , " he said , mentioning the story of abraham and isaac , which is significant to christian , jews and muslims .
a subtle love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the love story plays out between pylades -lrb- right -rrb- and orestes like abraham , iphigenia stops her knife in mid-air during one of the many sacrifices .
she recognized her brother orestes , who had come to the island with his boyfriend , pylades , after having killed his mother .
her brother 's appearance forces the priestess to choose between her heart and duty .
her heart wins out and she lets her brother live .
throughout the opera , the audience is left wondering about orestes ' sexuality .
" somebody once told me there was no love story in iphigenia , " kosky told the berliner zeitung .
" but i think there is one , and it happens between two men .
but this is no gay pride production .
the audience members have to decide for themselves what happened between the two of them . " christoph willibald gluck , one of germany ’ s great opera composers and a reformer of the genre , set the greek mythological tale of priestess iphigenia in 1779 .

" former president boris yeltsin died today , " the spokesman said on monday . yeltsin was known to have suffered from heart problems and is reported to have died of coronary and vascular failure .
russia 's interfax news agency quoted an anonymous medical source as saying the former president died of heart failure . presidential predecessor and political rival mikhail gorbachev extended his sympathies to yeltsin 's family on monday , saying yeltsin had performed a great service to his country but also committed " serious mistakes . " " i offer my deepest condolences to the family of a man on whose shoulders rested many great deeds for the good of the country and serious mistakes - a tragic fate , " the former soviet leader was quoted by interfax as saying . yeltsin , who won two presidential elections and was post-soviet russia 's first leader , was largely regarded in his own country as a contradictory figure .
though admired for his defiance of the soviet system , he also led the country in a crushing war in chechnya . " a historic figure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yeltsin is remembered by many for a 1991 speech he gave from the top of a tank in moscow a man with a penchant for flamboyant gestures , yeltsin will perhaps be best remembered around the world for bravely clambering onto a tank sent into moscow in 1991 by communist hardliners attempting a coup in the dying days of the soviet union . he then introduced historic reforms that dragged a bankrupt communist economy into the modern age , unleashed political pluralism and allowed a vibrant , freewheeling media . " i think he will always be remembered as the man who brought down communism , " said yeltsin 's former advisor , alexander nekrasov , told britain 's sky news .
" that 's what his legacy is . " an overwhelming majority of russians continue to blame yeltsin for russia 's slide from superpower status to economic basket case and second fiddle to the united states on the international stage . the white house on monday mourned yeltsin as " a historic figure " and offered its condolences to his widow , his relatives , and all of russia . " he was an historic figure during a time of great change and challenge for russia .
our condolences go to mrs yeltsin , their family and the people of russia , " said national security spokesman gordon johndroe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yeltsin passed the office of president to putin at the beginning of 2000 born to a peasant family in 1931 near the ural mountains city of ekaterinburg , yeltsin became a construction engineer before embarking on a political career in the communist party . he was elected the russian federation 's first president in june 1991 and served until dec .
31 , 1999 , resigning for health reasons several months before his term ended and handing over power to then prime minister vladimir putin . one of putin 's first acts in office was to grant yeltsin immunity from prosecution , sparing him the fury of those who blamed him for trading away valuable state assets , starting two bloody wars in chechnya and allowing the 1998 economic collapse . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic former russian president yeltsin has died feedback what do you remeber yeltsin for most ?

" former president boris yeltsin died today , " the spokesman said on monday . yeltsin was known to have suffered from heart problems and is reported to have died of coronary and vascular failure .
russia 's interfax news agency quoted an anonymous medical source as saying the former president died of heart failure . presidential predecessor and political rival mikhail gorbachev extended his sympathies to yeltsin 's family on monday , saying yeltsin had performed a great service to his country but also committed " serious mistakes . " " i offer my deepest condolences to the family of a man on whose shoulders rested many great deeds for the good of the country and serious mistakes - a tragic fate , " the former soviet leader was quoted by interfax as saying . yeltsin , who won two presidential elections and was post-soviet russia 's first leader , was largely regarded in his own country as a contradictory figure .
though admired for his defiance of the soviet system , he also led the country in a crushing war in chechnya . " a historic figure " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yeltsin is remembered by many for a 1991 speech he gave from the top of a tank in moscow a man with a penchant for flamboyant gestures , yeltsin will perhaps be best remembered around the world for bravely clambering onto a tank sent into moscow in 1991 by communist hardliners attempting a coup in the dying days of the soviet union . he then introduced historic reforms that dragged a bankrupt communist economy into the modern age , unleashed political pluralism and allowed a vibrant , freewheeling media . " i think he will always be remembered as the man who brought down communism , " said yeltsin 's former advisor , alexander nekrasov , told britain 's sky news .
" that 's what his legacy is . " an overwhelming majority of russians continue to blame yeltsin for russia 's slide from superpower status to economic basket case and second fiddle to the united states on the international stage . the white house on monday mourned yeltsin as " a historic figure " and offered its condolences to his widow , his relatives , and all of russia . " he was an historic figure during a time of great change and challenge for russia .
our condolences go to mrs yeltsin , their family and the people of russia , " said national security spokesman gordon johndroe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yeltsin passed the office of president to putin at the beginning of 2000 born to a peasant family in 1931 near the ural mountains city of ekaterinburg , yeltsin became a construction engineer before embarking on a political career in the communist party . he was elected the russian federation 's first president in june 1991 and served until dec .
31 , 1999 , resigning for health reasons several months before his term ended and handing over power to then prime minister vladimir putin . one of putin 's first acts in office was to grant yeltsin immunity from prosecution , sparing him the fury of those who blamed him for trading away valuable state assets , starting two bloody wars in chechnya and allowing the 1998 economic collapse . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic former russian president yeltsin has died feedback what do you remeber yeltsin for most ?

"
the unusually warm weather has meant a great start to the season in germany .
but others in europe are n't pleased . there 's a continual stream of people bustling in and out of the store on the böser asparagus farm in bruchsal in the southern german state of baden-württemberg .
the unseasonably warm april temperatures have caused the asparagus to shoot earlier than normal .
this has caused record harvests for this time of the year , but it 's still not as much as farmers originally hoped for . " with such a mild winter , we thought we would just need a couple of rays of sun , and the asparagus would appear , " said wolfgang böser , the chairman of the association of south german asparagus and strawberry farmers .
" but then we had a cold snap . " " still , the harvest is in full swing and straight after easter , production just shot up , " he said . fresh is best many of the customers here have driven a long way to buy kilos of fresh white asparagus , and it 's not because the prized vegetable is necessarily cheaper direct from the farm - it 's because germans are obsessed with freshness when it comes to asparagus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh asparagus squeaks when it 's rubbed together " i know it comes fresh from the field in the morning and afternoon , and i will pay the price , " one man said , clutching two bursting bags of white asparagus spears . during the asparagus season , which traditionally runs from mid-april to june 24 , germans buy nearly 50 percent of their asparagus directly from farmers ' shops and market stalls .
this is a significant figure , considering that germans usually only purchase 7 percent of all of their fruit and vegetables direct . " we sell about 85 percent of our asparagus here in the farm shop or in the restaurant we have on site , " said böser , whose 38-hectare -lrb- 94-acre -rrb- farm produces three to four tons of asparagus a day at the height of the season . asparagus obsession during its short season , asparagus features prominently on restaurant menus and café chalkboards across the country , reflecting germans ' obsession with the prized vegetable .
in fact , they eat more white asparagus than anyone else in the world , chomping their way through 1.35 kilos -lrb- three pounds -rrb- per head . it is n't difficult for gourmets to find fresh local asparagus , since with a production of some 82,000 tons , germany is the biggest asparagus grower in europe .
the area under asparagus production in the country has doubled in the past 12 years to nearly 20,000 hectares , making asparagus the country 's biggest vegetable crop in terms of area and value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german demand for asparagus has increased 40 percent in the past decade the increased german cultivation has caused imports of fresh asparagus to drop significantly - from 50 percent to 25 percent .
this is because germans are so picky about the freshness of " edible ivory " that they prefer the local product . " there is n't a pronounced preference for ' grown in germany ' with most other types of vegetables , such as lettuce and cauliflower " said christoph behr , the head of the horticulture department at the center for market and price reporting office . " but germans want german asparagus and only buy imported asparagus before the local season starts , or if it 's extremely cheap , " he said . exporting countries suffering according to behr , the countries hardest hit by the increased german production are france and the netherlands .
but spain and greece , whose season begins several weeks before the german one , are also being affected . " the problem is that more asparagus is being grown under sheeting or tunnels in germany , so the season is continually starting earlier , " behr said .
" this means that exporting countries are cutting back on cultivation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least three-quarters of german asparagus is grown under plastic sheeting for an earlier harvest to get white asparagus , the plant needs to grow in the dark and the spear has to be cut before it emerges from the soil and is exposed to the light - a growing method that is very labor intensive and makes white asparagus about one and a half to two times more expensive than the green variety .
but it seems germans are so enamored with " white gold " that they are happy to pay the price difference . " it has a very strong tradition , " behr said .

" we sell about 85 percent of our asparagus here in the farm shop or in the restaurant we have on site , " said böser , whose 38-hectare -lrb- 94-acre -rrb- farm produces three to four tons of asparagus a day at the height of the season . asparagus obsession during its short season , asparagus features prominently on restaurant menus and café chalkboards across the country , reflecting germans ' obsession with the prized vegetable .
in fact , they eat more white asparagus than anyone else in the world , chomping their way through 1.35 kilos -lrb- three pounds -rrb- per head . it is n't difficult for gourmets to find fresh local asparagus , since with a production of some 82,000 tons , germany is the biggest asparagus grower in europe .
the area under asparagus production in the country has doubled in the past 12 years to nearly 20,000 hectares , making asparagus the country 's biggest vegetable crop in terms of area and value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german demand for asparagus has increased 40 percent in the past decade the increased german cultivation has caused imports of fresh asparagus to drop significantly - from 50 percent to 25 percent .
this is because germans are so picky about the freshness of " edible ivory " that they prefer the local product . " there is n't a pronounced preference for ' grown in germany ' with most other types of vegetables , such as lettuce and cauliflower " said christoph behr , the head of the horticulture department at the center for market and price reporting office . " but germans want german asparagus and only buy imported asparagus before the local season starts , or if it 's extremely cheap , " he said . exporting countries suffering according to behr , the countries hardest hit by the increased german production are france and the netherlands .
but spain and greece , whose season begins several weeks before the german one , are also being affected . " the problem is that more asparagus is being grown under sheeting or tunnels in germany , so the season is continually starting earlier , " behr said .
" this means that exporting countries are cutting back on cultivation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least three-quarters of german asparagus is grown under plastic sheeting for an earlier harvest to get white asparagus , the plant needs to grow in the dark and the spear has to be cut before it emerges from the soil and is exposed to the light - a growing method that is very labor intensive and makes white asparagus about one and a half to two times more expensive than the green variety .
but it seems germans are so enamored with " white gold " that they are happy to pay the price difference . " it has a very strong tradition , " behr said .
" it has a different taste - it 's not as highly-flavored , but it 's what the germans are used to .

in an interview published monday , german chancellor angela merkel said she did not expect washington to adopt european goals on climate protection at an eu-us summit next week . " i do not think the us will adopt the european climate protection goals , " merkel told the daily münchener merkur . but she said there was growing awareness in the united states and within the us government that reducing greenhouse gas emissions was crucial . " i have been pleased at international meetings to see a growing feeling for a common , global responsibility -lrb- for climate protection -rrb- , " she said .
" on some issues , the us is even surpassing european targets , for example in the use of biofuels . " germany currently holds the rotating presidency of both the group of eight club of rich nations and the european union . not that different after all ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the us and eu really closer together on climate protection than people think ?
the us ambassador to the eu , boyden gray , said earlier this month that the gap between the united states and eu over how to tackle global warming is narrower than many might think . " both sides of the atlantic now agree it 's the same and it 's a constructive change , " he said .
" i do n't see that much difference .

the eu championed the kyoto protocol to reduce harmful emissions after it was abandoned by the united states in march 2001 . but the treaty has been almost crippled by the absence of the united states , which alone accounts for about a quarter of all this pollution . exploratory negotiations are under way for determining what treaty should follow kyoto after the accord expires at the end of 2012 . germany helped broker an agreement last month under which the 27 eu member states will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels over the next 13 years . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german paper teams up with environmentalists to save planet germany 's leading mass-market newspaper has joined the country 's major environment organizations in a nationwide campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .

people wanted to wipe out the memory of april 21 , " he wrote , referring to the 2002 election first round , when huge abstention and a high vote for the political extremes meant that national front leader jean-marie le pen qualified for round two instead of the socialist lionel jospin .
" what it means is that this time there will be no sense of frustration on the eve of the second round .
people will have the means to make a clear choice .
they will make one , and the country will discover what direction it has chosen , and what direction it must now take , " he wrote . for christophe barbier , editor of l 'express news magazine , " the french wanted so much to have this head-to-head between royal and sarkozy - between a left in the process of renewal and a confident new right . "
barbier added that sarkozy should have the advantage ahead of the second round run-off on may 6 , counting on carry-over votes from far-right leader jean-marie le pen and centrist francois bayrou .
" but nothing is decided , " he added .
" segolene royal has one important weapon : the ' anyone but sarko ' option .
we can expect a second round which brings out all his character faults and ideological excesses .
in short - it 's back to where we were at the start of the campaign . " british newspapers on monday also noted that the high turnout in the first-round of french elections was a sign of the polls ' importance , and warned that a fierce clash was forthcoming . the daily telegraph , a right-wing paper , wrote france is " as its people recognize , in trouble - and this election is , as the high turnout yesterday indicates , its best chance to turn things around . "
in an editorial titled " france needs sarkozy " it continued to say that between the two candidates left , " it is mr sarkozy who is likeliest to embrace the painful structural changes that france so desperately needs .
but before that , he needs to win an election - far from a sure thing , especially in this most fascinating of contests . " in germany , business daily financial times deutschland warned that the two weeks until the final round would be marked by " extreme polarization " as the campaign grows " tougher , more ruthless and more personal . "
but it said royal and sarkozy did not represent two radically different ends of the political spectrum .
" to the contrary : the last weeks have shown that each candidate constantly took on board the populist demands of the other to try to best his or her opponent .
in the end , there may be a close outcome and a france deeply divided into two camps . " the conservative broadsheet frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also noted the remarkably high turnout at the polls .
" apparently the french were fascinated by a campaign that was fixated on personalities . "
it said that royal had done better than expected while sarkozy could be satisfied with meeting his goal of seizing 30 percent of the vote in the first round .
" with a campaign that started with a liberal tone , then took on more and more gaullist accents and at the end leaned sharply to the right , he exhausted his own voter potential while luring le pen voters . " spanish daily el pais meanwhile said that royal 's " only chance to defeat sarkozy will be to seek bayrou 's support , but this will not be easy .
sarkozy is still the best armed candidate to enter the elysee which does not mean that his victory is guaranteed because of the powerful rejection and hatred he provokes among some french voters , " the paper said . for italy 's la stampa , " the absolute novelty is the presence of a woman who had been expected to be defeated in the first round ... the french will now be able to choose not only between two very different political options but also between a man and woman , " the newspaper said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sarkozy , royal open duel for french presidency conservative nicolas sarkozy and socialist segolene royal face off in a dramatic left-right battle for the french presidency after winning round one of an election marked by a near record turnout .

people wanted to wipe out the memory of april 21 , " he wrote , referring to the 2002 election first round , when huge abstention and a high vote for the political extremes meant that national front leader jean-marie le pen qualified for round two instead of the socialist lionel jospin .
" what it means is that this time there will be no sense of frustration on the eve of the second round .
people will have the means to make a clear choice .
they will make one , and the country will discover what direction it has chosen , and what direction it must now take , " he wrote . for christophe barbier , editor of l 'express news magazine , " the french wanted so much to have this head-to-head between royal and sarkozy - between a left in the process of renewal and a confident new right . "
barbier added that sarkozy should have the advantage ahead of the second round run-off on may 6 , counting on carry-over votes from far-right leader jean-marie le pen and centrist francois bayrou .
" but nothing is decided , " he added .
" segolene royal has one important weapon : the ' anyone but sarko ' option .
we can expect a second round which brings out all his character faults and ideological excesses .
in short - it 's back to where we were at the start of the campaign . " british newspapers on monday also noted that the high turnout in the first-round of french elections was a sign of the polls ' importance , and warned that a fierce clash was forthcoming . the daily telegraph , a right-wing paper , wrote france is " as its people recognize , in trouble - and this election is , as the high turnout yesterday indicates , its best chance to turn things around . "
in an editorial titled " france needs sarkozy " it continued to say that between the two candidates left , " it is mr sarkozy who is likeliest to embrace the painful structural changes that france so desperately needs .
but before that , he needs to win an election - far from a sure thing , especially in this most fascinating of contests . " in germany , business daily financial times deutschland warned that the two weeks until the final round would be marked by " extreme polarization " as the campaign grows " tougher , more ruthless and more personal . "
but it said royal and sarkozy did not represent two radically different ends of the political spectrum .
" to the contrary : the last weeks have shown that each candidate constantly took on board the populist demands of the other to try to best his or her opponent .
in the end , there may be a close outcome and a france deeply divided into two camps . " the conservative broadsheet frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also noted the remarkably high turnout at the polls .
" apparently the french were fascinated by a campaign that was fixated on personalities . "
it said that royal had done better than expected while sarkozy could be satisfied with meeting his goal of seizing 30 percent of the vote in the first round .
" with a campaign that started with a liberal tone , then took on more and more gaullist accents and at the end leaned sharply to the right , he exhausted his own voter potential while luring le pen voters . " spanish daily el pais meanwhile said that royal 's " only chance to defeat sarkozy will be to seek bayrou 's support , but this will not be easy .
sarkozy is still the best armed candidate to enter the elysee which does not mean that his victory is guaranteed because of the powerful rejection and hatred he provokes among some french voters , " the paper said . for italy 's la stampa , " the absolute novelty is the presence of a woman who had been expected to be defeated in the first round ... the french will now be able to choose not only between two very different political options but also between a man and woman , " the newspaper said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sarkozy , royal open duel for french presidency conservative nicolas sarkozy and socialist segolene royal face off in a dramatic left-right battle for the french presidency after winning round one of an election marked by a near record turnout .

in an interview published monday , german chancellor angela merkel said she did not expect washington to adopt european goals on climate protection at an eu-us summit next week . " i do not think the us will adopt the european climate protection goals , " merkel told the daily münchener merkur . but she said there was growing awareness in the united states and within the us government that reducing greenhouse gas emissions was crucial . " i have been pleased at international meetings to see a growing feeling for a common , global responsibility -lrb- for climate protection -rrb- , " she said .

the eu championed the kyoto protocol to reduce harmful emissions after it was abandoned by the united states in march 2001 . but the treaty has been almost crippled by the absence of the united states , which alone accounts for about a quarter of all this pollution . exploratory negotiations are under way for determining what treaty should follow kyoto after the accord expires at the end of 2012 . germany helped broker an agreement last month under which the 27 eu member states will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels over the next 13 years . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german paper teams up with environmentalists to save planet germany 's leading mass-market newspaper has joined the country 's major environment organizations in a nationwide campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .

investigations have shown that the infections were a result of poor hygienic conditions in the hospital . appeals to the eu family members of the detainees have been putting pressure on the eu to do more for the detainees . " we 've heard enough words of solidarity , " said marian georgiev , the son of another doctor who has n't been arrested , but has been restricted from leaving libya .

on the other hand , diplomats warn that too much pressure could have a negative effect . " they 're at the end of their strength " in 2001 , several bulgarian journalists and relatives of the detainees managed to speak briefly with the prisoners .
one woman complained of severe torture with electroshock devices and inhumane conditions . earlier this year , the daughter-in-law of one of the detainees was able to visit the prison . " they are very weak , " she reported in brussels after the visit .
" after eight years of detainment , they 're at the end of their strength .
for this reason , we are appealing to the media not to forget these people . " six fractions in the european parliament have expressed their support for the family members ' appeal .
bulgaria has been an eu member since its accession to the bloc on jan .
1 , 2007 . the eu should put more pressure on libya , even if the country 's strong oil trade may put economic interests at stake , said graham watson from the liberal party . " i challenge the eu not only to discuss sanctions but the foreign minister of each and every member state should ask the libyan ambassador to its country each week what progress has been made toward the release of the nurses and the doctor , " watson said . bernd riegert -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european papers condemn libyan death sentence for medics libya 's sentencing of five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor to death for allegedly spreading the aids virus among children has european commentators up in arms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : france 's next president : sarko vs. sego police , protesters battle after sarkozy win sarkozy favored as french elect new president conservative sarkozy is france 's next president as election nears , french duo fight to a draw in last debate opinion -pipe- 23.04.2007 opinion : it 's time to get serious in france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's anke hagedorn says that nicolas sarkozy and segolene royal now need to focus on the issues rather than appearances before they square off again in the race for the french presidency on may 6 . the french have decided : sego and sarko , as segolene royal and nicolas sarkozy are often referred to , will re-enter the race for the french presidency .
it 's a result that 's not surprising and the french are now hopeful that a serious debate will take place until the second round of voting .
that 's also desirable from a german point of view , because maybe it would make it easier for us to understand what to think of the two candidates when it comes to european policy and the franco-german relationship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anke hagedorn the election campaign so far has been a slick one - there was no overriding issue that really stuck .
it 's a far cry from the last presidential elections five years ago , when one topic , domestic safety , dominated .
this time the candidates sounded off on a whole range of issues and staged an equal number of gimmicky appearances , hoping to pull in voters . clad in jeans and sunglasses , sarkozy in the end presented himself as a mixture of cowboy and white knight , sitting on a white horse .
his message : i take charge , but i 've got my feet firmly on the ground and am also a nature-lover . centrist candidate francois bayrou , who portrayed himself as a farmer and father of six children and who had not been taken seriously by anyone at the beginning , eventually finished with a respectable result .
earlier , sarkozy enjoyed alternating between the role of savior of the nation and sacrificial lamb .
one day he flirted with trade unions while courting employers on the next .
he openly tried to woo right-extremist voters of the front national with proposals such as expelling all illegals in france and founding a ministry for immigration and national identity .
he did not tolerate competitors , be it among political adversaries or within his own ranks .
everyone , who stood in his way , was brushed aside without mercy .
editors in chief had to hand in resignations for negative coverage of sarkozy .
he threatened azouz begag , until recently minister for equal opportunities , because the latter had allegedly not been loyal .
it 's a bad omen when one thinks about what this man could do when he actually commands power .
usually dressed in a white business suit and wearing a glowing smile , segolene royal on the other hand presented herself as the new jeanne d 'arc .
she developed a new kind of communication tactic for the campaign , so-called participatory democracy .
she stood in the middle of an audience and made people believe that she was listening to them .
the only problem was it did n't work .
she usually seemed uptight and not ready for dialogue .
few managed to get to ask questions and many did n't get any answers .
it quickly led people to become disenchanted after a sky-rocketing start to the campaign .
francois bayrou hit the nail on the head when he talked about the dilemma of the voters .
" everyone 's uncertain , " he said .
" some , because they know where sarkozy would lead them and others , because they do not know where royal would take them . "
one can only hope that both candidates realize before may 6 that voters expect more than a superficial exchange of words .
they want concrete solutions , because there 's a lot of work to do in the grande nation , which has lost a lot of greatness in recent times - especially when it comes to the economy .
france has the highest unemployment rate within the euro zone , one of the lowest economic growth rates and a record trade deficit .
it 'll take more than a white horse or a white business suit to fix that .

royal 's result was a huge relief for the opposition socialist party which had feared a repeat of the 2002 shock when then prime minister lionel jospin was humiliatingly knocked out of the race in the first round by far-right national front leader jean-marie le pen .
this time le pen was in shock after he came in fourth , with 10.51 percent .
democratic awakening bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy thanked supporters on sunday jean-marie colombani , editor-in-chief of le monde newspaper , said the highest turnout for more than 40 years - 84.6 percent - showed that the french had undergone a " democratic awakening " and that " people wanted to wipe out the memory " of le pen 's success in 2002 .
none of the other eight candidates gained more than five percent , according to final figures from the interior ministry .
sarkozy and royal will now square off in the second round on may 6 , and will put their starkly different visions to a public test in a face-to-face televised debate on may 2 .

both candidates went straight back onto the campaign trail monday , looking to woo the all important electorate of centrist francois bayrou , who came in third with 18.55 percent .
sarkozy 's lieutenant brice hortefeux said the frontrunner would not entertain " backroom deals " with bayrou , but said " the door is not closed " to negotiations .
bayrou 's small union for a french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- party has in the past aligned itself with sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- in parliament but the candidate has veered to the left during the campaign .
" we will not start negotiating in the wings as some usually do , " said jean-christophe lagarde , a deputy from bayrou 's udf party .
" we will think about the best way to ensure that the views of the people who said ' we want to change politics in this country ' are respected . "

royal 's result was a huge relief for the opposition socialist party which had feared a repeat of the 2002 shock when then prime minister lionel jospin was humiliatingly knocked out of the race in the first round by far-right national front leader jean-marie le pen .
this time le pen was in shock after he came in fourth , with 10.51 percent .
democratic awakening bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy thanked supporters on sunday jean-marie colombani , editor-in-chief of le monde newspaper , said the highest turnout for more than 40 years - 84.6 percent - showed that the french had undergone a " democratic awakening " and that " people wanted to wipe out the memory " of le pen 's success in 2002 .
none of the other eight candidates gained more than five percent , according to final figures from the interior ministry .
sarkozy and royal will now square off in the second round on may 6 , and will put their starkly different visions to a public test in a face-to-face televised debate on may 2 .

people wanted to wipe out the memory of april 21 , " he wrote , referring to the 2002 election first round , when huge abstention and a high vote for the political extremes meant that national front leader jean-marie le pen qualified for round two instead of the socialist lionel jospin .
" what it means is that this time there will be no sense of frustration on the eve of the second round .
people will have the means to make a clear choice .
they will make one , and the country will discover what direction it has chosen , and what direction it must now take , " he wrote . for christophe barbier , editor of l 'express news magazine , " the french wanted so much to have this head-to-head between royal and sarkozy - between a left in the process of renewal and a confident new right . "
barbier added that sarkozy should have the advantage ahead of the second round run-off on may 6 , counting on carry-over votes from far-right leader jean-marie le pen and centrist francois bayrou .
" but nothing is decided , " he added .
" segolene royal has one important weapon : the ' anyone but sarko ' option .
we can expect a second round which brings out all his character faults and ideological excesses .
in short - it 's back to where we were at the start of the campaign . " british newspapers on monday also noted that the high turnout in the first-round of french elections was a sign of the polls ' importance , and warned that a fierce clash was forthcoming . the daily telegraph , a right-wing paper , wrote france is " as its people recognize , in trouble - and this election is , as the high turnout yesterday indicates , its best chance to turn things around . "
in an editorial titled " france needs sarkozy " it continued to say that between the two candidates left , " it is mr sarkozy who is likeliest to embrace the painful structural changes that france so desperately needs .
but before that , he needs to win an election - far from a sure thing , especially in this most fascinating of contests . " in germany , business daily financial times deutschland warned that the two weeks until the final round would be marked by " extreme polarization " as the campaign grows " tougher , more ruthless and more personal . "
but it said royal and sarkozy did not represent two radically different ends of the political spectrum .
" to the contrary : the last weeks have shown that each candidate constantly took on board the populist demands of the other to try to best his or her opponent .
in the end , there may be a close outcome and a france deeply divided into two camps . " the conservative broadsheet frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also noted the remarkably high turnout at the polls .
" apparently the french were fascinated by a campaign that was fixated on personalities . "
it said that royal had done better than expected while sarkozy could be satisfied with meeting his goal of seizing 30 percent of the vote in the first round .
" with a campaign that started with a liberal tone , then took on more and more gaullist accents and at the end leaned sharply to the right , he exhausted his own voter potential while luring le pen voters . " spanish daily el pais meanwhile said that royal 's " only chance to defeat sarkozy will be to seek bayrou 's support , but this will not be easy .
sarkozy is still the best armed candidate to enter the elysee which does not mean that his victory is guaranteed because of the powerful rejection and hatred he provokes among some french voters , " the paper said . for italy 's la stampa , " the absolute novelty is the presence of a woman who had been expected to be defeated in the first round ... the french will now be able to choose not only between two very different political options but also between a man and woman , " the newspaper said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sarkozy , royal open duel for french presidency conservative nicolas sarkozy and socialist segolene royal face off in a dramatic left-right battle for the french presidency after winning round one of an election marked by a near record turnout .

investigations have shown that the infections were a result of poor hygienic conditions in the hospital . appeals to the eu family members of the detainees have been putting pressure on the eu to do more for the detainees . " we 've heard enough words of solidarity , " said marian georgiev , the son of another doctor who has n't been arrested , but has been restricted from leaving libya .

on the other hand , diplomats warn that too much pressure could have a negative effect . " they 're at the end of their strength " in 2001 , several bulgarian journalists and relatives of the detainees managed to speak briefly with the prisoners .
one woman complained of severe torture with electroshock devices and inhumane conditions . earlier this year , the daughter-in-law of one of the detainees was able to visit the prison . " they are very weak , " she reported in brussels after the visit .
" after eight years of detainment , they 're at the end of their strength .
for this reason , we are appealing to the media not to forget these people . " six fractions in the european parliament have expressed their support for the family members ' appeal .
bulgaria has been an eu member since its accession to the bloc on jan .
1 , 2007 . the eu should put more pressure on libya , even if the country 's strong oil trade may put economic interests at stake , said graham watson from the liberal party . " i challenge the eu not only to discuss sanctions but the foreign minister of each and every member state should ask the libyan ambassador to its country each week what progress has been made toward the release of the nurses and the doctor , " watson said . bernd riegert -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european papers condemn libyan death sentence for medics libya 's sentencing of five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor to death for allegedly spreading the aids virus among children has european commentators up in arms .

in an interview published monday , german chancellor angela merkel said she did not expect washington to adopt european goals on climate protection at an eu-us summit next week . " i do not think the us will adopt the european climate protection goals , " merkel told the daily münchener merkur . but she said there was growing awareness in the united states and within the us government that reducing greenhouse gas emissions was crucial . " i have been pleased at international meetings to see a growing feeling for a common , global responsibility -lrb- for climate protection -rrb- , " she said .
" on some issues , the us is even surpassing european targets , for example in the use of biofuels . " germany currently holds the rotating presidency of both the group of eight club of rich nations and the european union . not that different after all ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the us and eu really closer together on climate protection than people think ?
the us ambassador to the eu , boyden gray , said earlier this month that the gap between the united states and eu over how to tackle global warming is narrower than many might think . " both sides of the atlantic now agree it 's the same and it 's a constructive change , " he said .
" i do n't see that much difference . " gray was responding to criticism from european environment commissioner stavros dimas , who tartly compared eu plans to cut greenhouse-gas emissions through ever-tighter , legally binding curbs with the us voluntary approach . thinking beyond kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the next us president make environmentalists happier ?
the eu championed the kyoto protocol to reduce harmful emissions after it was abandoned by the united states in march 2001 . but the treaty has been almost crippled by the absence of the united states , which alone accounts for about a quarter of all this pollution . exploratory negotiations are under way for determining what treaty should follow kyoto after the accord expires at the end of 2012 . germany helped broker an agreement last month under which the 27 eu member states will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels over the next 13 years . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german paper teams up with environmentalists to save planet germany 's leading mass-market newspaper has joined the country 's major environment organizations in a nationwide campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .

though relatively wealthy , europe will also struggle , a new report says .
-lrb- 12.04.2007 -rrb- eu urges germany to do more to combat climate change a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases .

but the price of barley , which is used to make malt , an essential ingredient in brewing , has doubled in the space of a year from 200 to 400 euros per ton on the german market .
brewers and farmers say an extremely poor barley harvest in 2006 has exacerbated an emerging trend of converting barley fields to growing the plants used in biofuels , such as rapeseed .
the amount of land used for growing barley in germany is receding by 5 percent a year .
the march of biofuels is inexorable .
of the 12 million hectares -lrb- 30 million acres -rrb- farmed in germany , two million are already being used for plants that can be turned into biofuel .

" the german government has got to be reasonable and not give more importance to energy security than to food security , " he said .
the impact of the biofuels is not restricted to beer , with the price of bread likely to rise by 10 percent as a result of reduced grain production , the german bakers ' federation has warned .
sign of the times germany is not alone in experiencing the effects of converting arable land to new uses .
although it is not suffering the potentially catastrophic consequences felt by mexico , where the phenomenon has caused maize prices to climb sharply , german millers fear the effects of steadily rising cereal prices .
the biofuels policy is encouraged by the european union , which wants vehicle fuel to contain at least 10 percent of the " green " fuel by 2020 .
but jens redemacher , the head of the cereals division of the federation of german farmers , said the brewers also had themselves to blame .
" they have demanded lower and lower prices for barley which has caused farmers to abandon growing it because it was no longer profitable .
so biofuels are not the only culprits , " he said .

" said pat cox , former president of the european parliament and current president of the citizens ' organization " european movement . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pat cox heads the citizens ' initiative that is campaigning for the nurses ' release the five nurses from bulgaria and the palestinian doctor who have been imprisoned in libya for eight years and sentenced to death must finally be set free , cox said . libya has accused the nurses and doctor of having deliberately infected 426 children in the city of benghazi with hiv - an accusation that the eu sees as completely absurd .
investigations have shown that the infections were a result of poor hygienic conditions in the hospital . appeals to the eu family members of the detainees have been putting pressure on the eu to do more for the detainees . " we 've heard enough words of solidarity , " said marian georgiev , the son of another doctor who has n't been arrested , but has been restricted from leaving libya . " so far the european institutions have n't really helped us , " georgiev said .

on the other hand , diplomats warn that too much pressure could have a negative effect . " they 're at the end of their strength " in 2001 , several bulgarian journalists and relatives of the detainees managed to speak briefly with the prisoners .
one woman complained of severe torture with electroshock devices and inhumane conditions . earlier this year , the daughter-in-law of one of the detainees was able to visit the prison . " they are very weak , " she reported in brussels after the visit .
" after eight years of detainment , they 're at the end of their strength .
for this reason , we are appealing to the media not to forget these people . " six fractions in the european parliament have expressed their support for the family members ' appeal .
bulgaria has been an eu member since its accession to the bloc on jan .
1 , 2007 . the eu should put more pressure on libya , even if the country 's strong oil trade may put economic interests at stake , said graham watson from the liberal party . " i challenge the eu not only to discuss sanctions but the foreign minister of each and every member state should ask the libyan ambassador to its country each week what progress has been made toward the release of the nurses and the doctor , " watson said . bernd riegert -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european papers condemn libyan death sentence for medics libya 's sentencing of five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor to death for allegedly spreading the aids virus among children has european commentators up in arms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 23.04.2007 germany 's cheap beer tradition under threat from biofuels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of biofuels is affecting the price of germany 's most cherished beverage germans will have to dig deeper in their pockets to enjoy their beloved beer in the next few months as barley is increasingly displaced in the country 's fields by heavily subsidized crops used for biofuels . " many brewers have no choice but to raise their prices , " said kai schuerholt , a spokesman for the german brewers ' association .
" they decided not to pass on the three-percentage point rise in value-added tax that came into force in germany on jan .
1 , but in this case they have no alternative . "
the german arm of belgian brewer inbev , which owns the beck 's and franziskaner brands , confirmed it would be implementing " slight " price rises , while germany 's radeberger said it was considering a similar move .
it is hard to overstate the importance of beer in germany - it is drunk in vast quantities and the market is fiercely competitive and extremely price-sensitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's oktoberfest is one big beer-drinking party a half-liter -lrb- one pint -rrb- glass currently costs as little as three euros -lrb- four dollars -rrb- in a bar or restaurant , a price that makes drinkers in most other western european countries green with envy .
average annual consumption of beer in germany last year was 111.6 liters per head , equivalent to every one of the country 's 82 million people drinking a 0.31-liter glass every day , according to figures released on friday .
energy security vs. food security ?
but the price of barley , which is used to make malt , an essential ingredient in brewing , has doubled in the space of a year from 200 to 400 euros per ton on the german market .
brewers and farmers say an extremely poor barley harvest in 2006 has exacerbated an emerging trend of converting barley fields to growing the plants used in biofuels , such as rapeseed .
the amount of land used for growing barley in germany is receding by 5 percent a year .
the march of biofuels is inexorable .
of the 12 million hectares -lrb- 30 million acres -rrb- farmed in germany , two million are already being used for plants that can be turned into biofuel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed fields are commonplace in germany " biofuels are monopolizing the land , " said manfred weizbauer , the head of the german millers ' federation , which is calling for a cut in the subsidies granted to biofuel crops .
" the german government has got to be reasonable and not give more importance to energy security than to food security , " he said .
the impact of the biofuels is not restricted to beer , with the price of bread likely to rise by 10 percent as a result of reduced grain production , the german bakers ' federation has warned .
sign of the times germany is not alone in experiencing the effects of converting arable land to new uses .
although it is not suffering the potentially catastrophic consequences felt by mexico , where the phenomenon has caused maize prices to climb sharply , german millers fear the effects of steadily rising cereal prices .
the biofuels policy is encouraged by the european union , which wants vehicle fuel to contain at least 10 percent of the " green " fuel by 2020 .
but jens redemacher , the head of the cereals division of the federation of german farmers , said the brewers also had themselves to blame .
" they have demanded lower and lower prices for barley which has caused farmers to abandon growing it because it was no longer profitable .
so biofuels are not the only culprits , " he said .
the food industry is " just going to have to get used to having a competitor for the purchase of cereals , especially those used for biofuels , " redemacher said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the booze wars : a german city takes on public drinking while the german states and the federal government argue over a blanket ban on smoking in public places , others want to restrict the use of another legal drug : alcohol .

" we 're going to use less blood in the beginning so the actors do n't slip , " producer barrie kosky said in an interview with berliner zeitung before sunday 's premiere .
the opera is n't recommended for viewers under 16 .
whether despite or because of the blood , murder and nudity , sunday 's crowd at berlin 's komische oper cheered the modern version of the ancient tale , and culture magazine cicero called it " a great evening of humanity . "
sacrifice at abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geraldine mcgreevy plays the priestess iphigenia iphigenia , the title character , is a priestess and prisoner of king thoas on the island of tauris .
the king , who heard in an oracle that he was going to be killed at the hands of a foreigner , orders iphigenia to kill anyone who makes it onto the island in a sacrifice to goddess diana .
the opera opens with the priestess doing her job .
iphigenia drags a lifeless body across the stage to the rhythm of the music , slits its necks and collects the dripping blood .
soldiers in us fatigues bring iphigenia more victims and before the executions , the soldiers pose for pictures with the corpses , whose heads are wrapped in plastic bags .
" it was n't the naked seniors that hurt , but the over-naturalism of the beginning , where thoas ' prisoners were humiliated by their myrmidon charges a la abu ghraib , " cicero wrote , referring to the disrobed actors who appear in the background .

" we 're going to use less blood in the beginning so the actors do n't slip , " producer barrie kosky said in an interview with berliner zeitung before sunday 's premiere .
the opera is n't recommended for viewers under 16 .
whether despite or because of the blood , murder and nudity , sunday 's crowd at berlin 's komische oper cheered the modern version of the ancient tale , and culture magazine cicero called it " a great evening of humanity . "
sacrifice at abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geraldine mcgreevy plays the priestess iphigenia iphigenia , the title character , is a priestess and prisoner of king thoas on the island of tauris .
the king , who heard in an oracle that he was going to be killed at the hands of a foreigner , orders iphigenia to kill anyone who makes it onto the island in a sacrifice to goddess diana .
the opera opens with the priestess doing her job .
iphigenia drags a lifeless body across the stage to the rhythm of the music , slits its necks and collects the dripping blood .
soldiers in us fatigues bring iphigenia more victims and before the executions , the soldiers pose for pictures with the corpses , whose heads are wrapped in plastic bags .
" it was n't the naked seniors that hurt , but the over-naturalism of the beginning , where thoas ' prisoners were humiliated by their myrmidon charges a la abu ghraib , " cicero wrote , referring to the disrobed actors who appear in the background .

" we 're going to use less blood in the beginning so the actors do n't slip , " producer barrie kosky said in an interview with berliner zeitung before sunday 's premiere .
the opera is n't recommended for viewers under 16 .
whether despite or because of the blood , murder and nudity , sunday 's crowd at berlin 's komische oper cheered the modern version of the ancient tale , and culture magazine cicero called it " a great evening of humanity . "
sacrifice at abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geraldine mcgreevy plays the priestess iphigenia iphigenia , the title character , is a priestess and prisoner of king thoas on the island of tauris .
the king , who heard in an oracle that he was going to be killed at the hands of a foreigner , orders iphigenia to kill anyone who makes it onto the island in a sacrifice to goddess diana .
the opera opens with the priestess doing her job .
iphigenia drags a lifeless body across the stage to the rhythm of the music , slits its necks and collects the dripping blood .
soldiers in us fatigues bring iphigenia more victims and before the executions , the soldiers pose for pictures with the corpses , whose heads are wrapped in plastic bags .
" it was n't the naked seniors that hurt , but the over-naturalism of the beginning , where thoas ' prisoners were humiliated by their myrmidon charges a la abu ghraib , " cicero wrote , referring to the disrobed actors who appear in the background .
" the issue is still too close , as if one could ignore the fact that each reference also has to do with living people , who maybe do n't want to become just threads in the fabric of the world 's collective images , " the magazine continued .
for kosky , sacrifice is the most interesting part of the opera . " the idea of sacrifice runs through so many cultures , " he said , mentioning the story of abraham and isaac , which is significant to christian , jews and muslims .
a subtle love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the love story plays out between pylades -lrb- right -rrb- and orestes like abraham , iphigenia stops her knife in mid-air during one of the many sacrifices .
she recognized her brother orestes , who had come to the island with his boyfriend , pylades , after having killed his mother .
her brother 's appearance forces the priestess to choose between her heart and duty .
her heart wins out and she lets her brother live .
throughout the opera , the audience is left wondering about orestes ' sexuality .
" somebody once told me there was no love story in iphigenia , " kosky told the berliner zeitung .
" but i think there is one , and it happens between two men .
but this is no gay pride production .
the audience members have to decide for themselves what happened between the two of them . " christoph willibald gluck , one of germany ’ s great opera composers and a reformer of the genre , set the greek mythological tale of priestess iphigenia in 1779 .
even then , it was rewarded with great success . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de curtain opens on idomeneo without incident ringed by riot police , one of berlin 's three opera houses monday staged a controversial production of mozart 's opera idomeneo , three months after fears of violence had led to its sudden cancellation .

" many brewers have no choice but to raise their prices , " said kai schuerholt , a spokesman for the german brewers ' association .
" they decided not to pass on the three-percentage point rise in value-added tax that came into force in germany on jan .
1 , but in this case they have no alternative . "
the german arm of belgian brewer inbev , which owns the beck 's and franziskaner brands , confirmed it would be implementing " slight " price rises , while germany 's radeberger said it was considering a similar move .
it is hard to overstate the importance of beer in germany - it is drunk in vast quantities and the market is fiercely competitive and extremely price-sensitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's oktoberfest is one big beer-drinking party a half-liter -lrb- one pint -rrb- glass currently costs as little as three euros -lrb- four dollars -rrb- in a bar or restaurant , a price that makes drinkers in most other western european countries green with envy .
average annual consumption of beer in germany last year was 111.6 liters per head , equivalent to every one of the country 's 82 million people drinking a 0.31-liter glass every day , according to figures released on friday .
energy security vs. food security ?
but the price of barley , which is used to make malt , an essential ingredient in brewing , has doubled in the space of a year from 200 to 400 euros per ton on the german market .
brewers and farmers say an extremely poor barley harvest in 2006 has exacerbated an emerging trend of converting barley fields to growing the plants used in biofuels , such as rapeseed .
the amount of land used for growing barley in germany is receding by 5 percent a year .
the march of biofuels is inexorable .
of the 12 million hectares -lrb- 30 million acres -rrb- farmed in germany , two million are already being used for plants that can be turned into biofuel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed fields are commonplace in germany " biofuels are monopolizing the land , " said manfred weizbauer , the head of the german millers ' federation , which is calling for a cut in the subsidies granted to biofuel crops .
" the german government has got to be reasonable and not give more importance to energy security than to food security , " he said .
the impact of the biofuels is not restricted to beer , with the price of bread likely to rise by 10 percent as a result of reduced grain production , the german bakers ' federation has warned .
sign of the times germany is not alone in experiencing the effects of converting arable land to new uses .
although it is not suffering the potentially catastrophic consequences felt by mexico , where the phenomenon has caused maize prices to climb sharply , german millers fear the effects of steadily rising cereal prices .
the biofuels policy is encouraged by the european union , which wants vehicle fuel to contain at least 10 percent of the " green " fuel by 2020 .
but jens redemacher , the head of the cereals division of the federation of german farmers , said the brewers also had themselves to blame .
" they have demanded lower and lower prices for barley which has caused farmers to abandon growing it because it was no longer profitable .
so biofuels are not the only culprits , " he said .
the food industry is " just going to have to get used to having a competitor for the purchase of cereals , especially those used for biofuels , " redemacher said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the booze wars : a german city takes on public drinking while the german states and the federal government argue over a blanket ban on smoking in public places , others want to restrict the use of another legal drug : alcohol .

now a new initiative in brussels is demanding the eu step up its effort to help free the women . " bring them home ! " said pat cox , former president of the european parliament and current president of the citizens ' organization " european movement . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pat cox heads the citizens ' initiative that is campaigning for the nurses ' release the five nurses from bulgaria and the palestinian doctor who have been imprisoned in libya for eight years and sentenced to death must finally be set free , cox said . libya has accused the nurses and doctor of having deliberately infected 426 children in the city of benghazi with hiv - an accusation that the eu sees as completely absurd .
investigations have shown that the infections were a result of poor hygienic conditions in the hospital . appeals to the eu family members of the detainees have been putting pressure on the eu to do more for the detainees . " we 've heard enough words of solidarity , " said marian georgiev , the son of another doctor who has n't been arrested , but has been restricted from leaving libya . " so far the european institutions have n't really helped us , " georgiev said .
" we 're demanding effective involvement that brings results , so that we have leverage to rescue the innocent nurses . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of libyans , some relatives of the infected children , cheered the verdict death verdict political relations between the eu and the libyan regime under moammar gadhafi have improved over the past few years .
the eu covers the cost of medical treatment for the hiv-infected children and supports the hospital in benghazi .
financial aid has also been offered to the children 's families . eu diplomats assume that libya is drawing out the process in order to boost up the price .
on the other hand , diplomats warn that too much pressure could have a negative effect . " they 're at the end of their strength " in 2001 , several bulgarian journalists and relatives of the detainees managed to speak briefly with the prisoners .
one woman complained of severe torture with electroshock devices and inhumane conditions . earlier this year , the daughter-in-law of one of the detainees was able to visit the prison . " they are very weak , " she reported in brussels after the visit .

" we 're going to use less blood in the beginning so the actors do n't slip , " producer barrie kosky said in an interview with berliner zeitung before sunday 's premiere .
the opera is n't recommended for viewers under 16 .
whether despite or because of the blood , murder and nudity , sunday 's crowd at berlin 's komische oper cheered the modern version of the ancient tale , and culture magazine cicero called it " a great evening of humanity . "
sacrifice at abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geraldine mcgreevy plays the priestess iphigenia iphigenia , the title character , is a priestess and prisoner of king thoas on the island of tauris .
the king , who heard in an oracle that he was going to be killed at the hands of a foreigner , orders iphigenia to kill anyone who makes it onto the island in a sacrifice to goddess diana .
the opera opens with the priestess doing her job .
iphigenia drags a lifeless body across the stage to the rhythm of the music , slits its necks and collects the dripping blood .
soldiers in us fatigues bring iphigenia more victims and before the executions , the soldiers pose for pictures with the corpses , whose heads are wrapped in plastic bags .
" it was n't the naked seniors that hurt , but the over-naturalism of the beginning , where thoas ' prisoners were humiliated by their myrmidon charges a la abu ghraib , " cicero wrote , referring to the disrobed actors who appear in the background .
" the issue is still too close , as if one could ignore the fact that each reference also has to do with living people , who maybe do n't want to become just threads in the fabric of the world 's collective images , " the magazine continued .
for kosky , sacrifice is the most interesting part of the opera . " the idea of sacrifice runs through so many cultures , " he said , mentioning the story of abraham and isaac , which is significant to christian , jews and muslims .
a subtle love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the love story plays out between pylades -lrb- right -rrb- and orestes like abraham , iphigenia stops her knife in mid-air during one of the many sacrifices .
she recognized her brother orestes , who had come to the island with his boyfriend , pylades , after having killed his mother .
her brother 's appearance forces the priestess to choose between her heart and duty .
her heart wins out and she lets her brother live .
throughout the opera , the audience is left wondering about orestes ' sexuality .
" somebody once told me there was no love story in iphigenia , " kosky told the berliner zeitung .
" but i think there is one , and it happens between two men .
but this is no gay pride production .
the audience members have to decide for themselves what happened between the two of them . " christoph willibald gluck , one of germany ’ s great opera composers and a reformer of the genre , set the greek mythological tale of priestess iphigenia in 1779 .
even then , it was rewarded with great success . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de curtain opens on idomeneo without incident ringed by riot police , one of berlin 's three opera houses monday staged a controversial production of mozart 's opera idomeneo , three months after fears of violence had led to its sudden cancellation .

"
the unusually warm weather has meant a great start to the season in germany .
but others in europe are n't pleased . there 's a continual stream of people bustling in and out of the store on the böser asparagus farm in bruchsal in the southern german state of baden-württemberg .
the unseasonably warm april temperatures have caused the asparagus to shoot earlier than normal .
this has caused record harvests for this time of the year , but it 's still not as much as farmers originally hoped for . " with such a mild winter , we thought we would just need a couple of rays of sun , and the asparagus would appear , " said wolfgang böser , the chairman of the association of south german asparagus and strawberry farmers .
" but then we had a cold snap . " " still , the harvest is in full swing and straight after easter , production just shot up , " he said . fresh is best many of the customers here have driven a long way to buy kilos of fresh white asparagus , and it 's not because the prized vegetable is necessarily cheaper direct from the farm - it 's because germans are obsessed with freshness when it comes to asparagus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh asparagus squeaks when it 's rubbed together " i know it comes fresh from the field in the morning and afternoon , and i will pay the price , " one man said , clutching two bursting bags of white asparagus spears . during the asparagus season , which traditionally runs from mid-april to june 24 , germans buy nearly 50 percent of their asparagus directly from farmers ' shops and market stalls .
this is a significant figure , considering that germans usually only purchase 7 percent of all of their fruit and vegetables direct . " we sell about 85 percent of our asparagus here in the farm shop or in the restaurant we have on site , " said böser , whose 38-hectare -lrb- 94-acre -rrb- farm produces three to four tons of asparagus a day at the height of the season . asparagus obsession during its short season , asparagus features prominently on restaurant menus and café chalkboards across the country , reflecting germans ' obsession with the prized vegetable .
in fact , they eat more white asparagus than anyone else in the world , chomping their way through 1.35 kilos -lrb- three pounds -rrb- per head . it is n't difficult for gourmets to find fresh local asparagus , since with a production of some 82,000 tons , germany is the biggest asparagus grower in europe .
the area under asparagus production in the country has doubled in the past 12 years to nearly 20,000 hectares , making asparagus the country 's biggest vegetable crop in terms of area and value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german demand for asparagus has increased 40 percent in the past decade the increased german cultivation has caused imports of fresh asparagus to drop significantly - from 50 percent to 25 percent .
this is because germans are so picky about the freshness of " edible ivory " that they prefer the local product . " there is n't a pronounced preference for ' grown in germany ' with most other types of vegetables , such as lettuce and cauliflower " said christoph behr , the head of the horticulture department at the center for market and price reporting office . " but germans want german asparagus and only buy imported asparagus before the local season starts , or if it 's extremely cheap , " he said . exporting countries suffering according to behr , the countries hardest hit by the increased german production are france and the netherlands .
but spain and greece , whose season begins several weeks before the german one , are also being affected . " the problem is that more asparagus is being grown under sheeting or tunnels in germany , so the season is continually starting earlier , " behr said .
" this means that exporting countries are cutting back on cultivation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least three-quarters of german asparagus is grown under plastic sheeting for an earlier harvest to get white asparagus , the plant needs to grow in the dark and the spear has to be cut before it emerges from the soil and is exposed to the light - a growing method that is very labor intensive and makes white asparagus about one and a half to two times more expensive than the green variety .
but it seems germans are so enamored with " white gold " that they are happy to pay the price difference . " it has a very strong tradition , " behr said .

"
the unusually warm weather has meant a great start to the season in germany .
but others in europe are n't pleased . there 's a continual stream of people bustling in and out of the store on the böser asparagus farm in bruchsal in the southern german state of baden-württemberg .
the unseasonably warm april temperatures have caused the asparagus to shoot earlier than normal .
this has caused record harvests for this time of the year , but it 's still not as much as farmers originally hoped for . " with such a mild winter , we thought we would just need a couple of rays of sun , and the asparagus would appear , " said wolfgang böser , the chairman of the association of south german asparagus and strawberry farmers .
" but then we had a cold snap . " " still , the harvest is in full swing and straight after easter , production just shot up , " he said . fresh is best many of the customers here have driven a long way to buy kilos of fresh white asparagus , and it 's not because the prized vegetable is necessarily cheaper direct from the farm - it 's because germans are obsessed with freshness when it comes to asparagus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh asparagus squeaks when it 's rubbed together " i know it comes fresh from the field in the morning and afternoon , and i will pay the price , " one man said , clutching two bursting bags of white asparagus spears . during the asparagus season , which traditionally runs from mid-april to june 24 , germans buy nearly 50 percent of their asparagus directly from farmers ' shops and market stalls .
this is a significant figure , considering that germans usually only purchase 7 percent of all of their fruit and vegetables direct . " we sell about 85 percent of our asparagus here in the farm shop or in the restaurant we have on site , " said böser , whose 38-hectare -lrb- 94-acre -rrb- farm produces three to four tons of asparagus a day at the height of the season . asparagus obsession during its short season , asparagus features prominently on restaurant menus and café chalkboards across the country , reflecting germans ' obsession with the prized vegetable .
in fact , they eat more white asparagus than anyone else in the world , chomping their way through 1.35 kilos -lrb- three pounds -rrb- per head . it is n't difficult for gourmets to find fresh local asparagus , since with a production of some 82,000 tons , germany is the biggest asparagus grower in europe .
the area under asparagus production in the country has doubled in the past 12 years to nearly 20,000 hectares , making asparagus the country 's biggest vegetable crop in terms of area and value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german demand for asparagus has increased 40 percent in the past decade the increased german cultivation has caused imports of fresh asparagus to drop significantly - from 50 percent to 25 percent .
this is because germans are so picky about the freshness of " edible ivory " that they prefer the local product . " there is n't a pronounced preference for ' grown in germany ' with most other types of vegetables , such as lettuce and cauliflower " said christoph behr , the head of the horticulture department at the center for market and price reporting office . " but germans want german asparagus and only buy imported asparagus before the local season starts , or if it 's extremely cheap , " he said . exporting countries suffering according to behr , the countries hardest hit by the increased german production are france and the netherlands .
but spain and greece , whose season begins several weeks before the german one , are also being affected . " the problem is that more asparagus is being grown under sheeting or tunnels in germany , so the season is continually starting earlier , " behr said .
" this means that exporting countries are cutting back on cultivation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least three-quarters of german asparagus is grown under plastic sheeting for an earlier harvest to get white asparagus , the plant needs to grow in the dark and the spear has to be cut before it emerges from the soil and is exposed to the light - a growing method that is very labor intensive and makes white asparagus about one and a half to two times more expensive than the green variety .
but it seems germans are so enamored with " white gold " that they are happy to pay the price difference . " it has a very strong tradition , " behr said .

this has caused record harvests for this time of the year , but it 's still not as much as farmers originally hoped for . " with such a mild winter , we thought we would just need a couple of rays of sun , and the asparagus would appear , " said wolfgang böser , the chairman of the association of south german asparagus and strawberry farmers .
" but then we had a cold snap . " " still , the harvest is in full swing and straight after easter , production just shot up , " he said . fresh is best many of the customers here have driven a long way to buy kilos of fresh white asparagus , and it 's not because the prized vegetable is necessarily cheaper direct from the farm - it 's because germans are obsessed with freshness when it comes to asparagus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fresh asparagus squeaks when it 's rubbed together " i know it comes fresh from the field in the morning and afternoon , and i will pay the price , " one man said , clutching two bursting bags of white asparagus spears . during the asparagus season , which traditionally runs from mid-april to june 24 , germans buy nearly 50 percent of their asparagus directly from farmers ' shops and market stalls .
this is a significant figure , considering that germans usually only purchase 7 percent of all of their fruit and vegetables direct . " we sell about 85 percent of our asparagus here in the farm shop or in the restaurant we have on site , " said böser , whose 38-hectare -lrb- 94-acre -rrb- farm produces three to four tons of asparagus a day at the height of the season . asparagus obsession during its short season , asparagus features prominently on restaurant menus and café chalkboards across the country , reflecting germans ' obsession with the prized vegetable .
in fact , they eat more white asparagus than anyone else in the world , chomping their way through 1.35 kilos -lrb- three pounds -rrb- per head . it is n't difficult for gourmets to find fresh local asparagus , since with a production of some 82,000 tons , germany is the biggest asparagus grower in europe .
the area under asparagus production in the country has doubled in the past 12 years to nearly 20,000 hectares , making asparagus the country 's biggest vegetable crop in terms of area and value . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german demand for asparagus has increased 40 percent in the past decade the increased german cultivation has caused imports of fresh asparagus to drop significantly - from 50 percent to 25 percent .
this is because germans are so picky about the freshness of " edible ivory " that they prefer the local product . " there is n't a pronounced preference for ' grown in germany ' with most other types of vegetables , such as lettuce and cauliflower " said christoph behr , the head of the horticulture department at the center for market and price reporting office . " but germans want german asparagus and only buy imported asparagus before the local season starts , or if it 's extremely cheap , " he said . exporting countries suffering according to behr , the countries hardest hit by the increased german production are france and the netherlands .
but spain and greece , whose season begins several weeks before the german one , are also being affected . " the problem is that more asparagus is being grown under sheeting or tunnels in germany , so the season is continually starting earlier , " behr said .
" this means that exporting countries are cutting back on cultivation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least three-quarters of german asparagus is grown under plastic sheeting for an earlier harvest to get white asparagus , the plant needs to grow in the dark and the spear has to be cut before it emerges from the soil and is exposed to the light - a growing method that is very labor intensive and makes white asparagus about one and a half to two times more expensive than the green variety .
but it seems germans are so enamored with " white gold " that they are happy to pay the price difference . " it has a very strong tradition , " behr said .
" it has a different taste - it 's not as highly-flavored , but it 's what the germans are used to .

" we 're going to use less blood in the beginning so the actors do n't slip , " producer barrie kosky said in an interview with berliner zeitung before sunday 's premiere .
the opera is n't recommended for viewers under 16 .
whether despite or because of the blood , murder and nudity , sunday 's crowd at berlin 's komische oper cheered the modern version of the ancient tale , and culture magazine cicero called it " a great evening of humanity . "
sacrifice at abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geraldine mcgreevy plays the priestess iphigenia iphigenia , the title character , is a priestess and prisoner of king thoas on the island of tauris .
the king , who heard in an oracle that he was going to be killed at the hands of a foreigner , orders iphigenia to kill anyone who makes it onto the island in a sacrifice to goddess diana .
the opera opens with the priestess doing her job .
iphigenia drags a lifeless body across the stage to the rhythm of the music , slits its necks and collects the dripping blood .
soldiers in us fatigues bring iphigenia more victims and before the executions , the soldiers pose for pictures with the corpses , whose heads are wrapped in plastic bags .
" it was n't the naked seniors that hurt , but the over-naturalism of the beginning , where thoas ' prisoners were humiliated by their myrmidon charges a la abu ghraib , " cicero wrote , referring to the disrobed actors who appear in the background .
" the issue is still too close , as if one could ignore the fact that each reference also has to do with living people , who maybe do n't want to become just threads in the fabric of the world 's collective images , " the magazine continued .
for kosky , sacrifice is the most interesting part of the opera . " the idea of sacrifice runs through so many cultures , " he said , mentioning the story of abraham and isaac , which is significant to christian , jews and muslims .
a subtle love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the love story plays out between pylades -lrb- right -rrb- and orestes like abraham , iphigenia stops her knife in mid-air during one of the many sacrifices .
she recognized her brother orestes , who had come to the island with his boyfriend , pylades , after having killed his mother .
her brother 's appearance forces the priestess to choose between her heart and duty .
her heart wins out and she lets her brother live .
throughout the opera , the audience is left wondering about orestes ' sexuality .
" somebody once told me there was no love story in iphigenia , " kosky told the berliner zeitung .
" but i think there is one , and it happens between two men .
but this is no gay pride production .
the audience members have to decide for themselves what happened between the two of them . " christoph willibald gluck , one of germany ’ s great opera composers and a reformer of the genre , set the greek mythological tale of priestess iphigenia in 1779 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 23.04.2007 germany 's cheap beer tradition under threat from biofuels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of biofuels is affecting the price of germany 's most cherished beverage germans will have to dig deeper in their pockets to enjoy their beloved beer in the next few months as barley is increasingly displaced in the country 's fields by heavily subsidized crops used for biofuels . " many brewers have no choice but to raise their prices , " said kai schuerholt , a spokesman for the german brewers ' association .
" they decided not to pass on the three-percentage point rise in value-added tax that came into force in germany on jan .
1 , but in this case they have no alternative . "
the german arm of belgian brewer inbev , which owns the beck 's and franziskaner brands , confirmed it would be implementing " slight " price rises , while germany 's radeberger said it was considering a similar move .
it is hard to overstate the importance of beer in germany - it is drunk in vast quantities and the market is fiercely competitive and extremely price-sensitive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's oktoberfest is one big beer-drinking party a half-liter -lrb- one pint -rrb- glass currently costs as little as three euros -lrb- four dollars -rrb- in a bar or restaurant , a price that makes drinkers in most other western european countries green with envy .
average annual consumption of beer in germany last year was 111.6 liters per head , equivalent to every one of the country 's 82 million people drinking a 0.31-liter glass every day , according to figures released on friday .
energy security vs. food security ?
but the price of barley , which is used to make malt , an essential ingredient in brewing , has doubled in the space of a year from 200 to 400 euros per ton on the german market .
brewers and farmers say an extremely poor barley harvest in 2006 has exacerbated an emerging trend of converting barley fields to growing the plants used in biofuels , such as rapeseed .
the amount of land used for growing barley in germany is receding by 5 percent a year .
the march of biofuels is inexorable .
of the 12 million hectares -lrb- 30 million acres -rrb- farmed in germany , two million are already being used for plants that can be turned into biofuel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rapeseed fields are commonplace in germany " biofuels are monopolizing the land , " said manfred weizbauer , the head of the german millers ' federation , which is calling for a cut in the subsidies granted to biofuel crops .
" the german government has got to be reasonable and not give more importance to energy security than to food security , " he said .
the impact of the biofuels is not restricted to beer , with the price of bread likely to rise by 10 percent as a result of reduced grain production , the german bakers ' federation has warned .
sign of the times germany is not alone in experiencing the effects of converting arable land to new uses .
although it is not suffering the potentially catastrophic consequences felt by mexico , where the phenomenon has caused maize prices to climb sharply , german millers fear the effects of steadily rising cereal prices .
the biofuels policy is encouraged by the european union , which wants vehicle fuel to contain at least 10 percent of the " green " fuel by 2020 .
but jens redemacher , the head of the cereals division of the federation of german farmers , said the brewers also had themselves to blame .
" they have demanded lower and lower prices for barley which has caused farmers to abandon growing it because it was no longer profitable .
so biofuels are not the only culprits , " he said .
the food industry is " just going to have to get used to having a competitor for the purchase of cereals , especially those used for biofuels , " redemacher said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the booze wars : a german city takes on public drinking while the german states and the federal government argue over a blanket ban on smoking in public places , others want to restrict the use of another legal drug : alcohol .

in an interview published monday , german chancellor angela merkel said she did not expect washington to adopt european goals on climate protection at an eu-us summit next week . " i do not think the us will adopt the european climate protection goals , " merkel told the daily münchener merkur . but she said there was growing awareness in the united states and within the us government that reducing greenhouse gas emissions was crucial . " i have been pleased at international meetings to see a growing feeling for a common , global responsibility -lrb- for climate protection -rrb- , " she said .
" on some issues , the us is even surpassing european targets , for example in the use of biofuels .

the us ambassador to the eu , boyden gray , said earlier this month that the gap between the united states and eu over how to tackle global warming is narrower than many might think . " both sides of the atlantic now agree it 's the same and it 's a constructive change , " he said .
" i do n't see that much difference .

the eu championed the kyoto protocol to reduce harmful emissions after it was abandoned by the united states in march 2001 . but the treaty has been almost crippled by the absence of the united states , which alone accounts for about a quarter of all this pollution . exploratory negotiations are under way for determining what treaty should follow kyoto after the accord expires at the end of 2012 . germany helped broker an agreement last month under which the 27 eu member states will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels over the next 13 years . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german paper teams up with environmentalists to save planet germany 's leading mass-market newspaper has joined the country 's major environment organizations in a nationwide campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .

people wanted to wipe out the memory of april 21 , " he wrote , referring to the 2002 election first round , when huge abstention and a high vote for the political extremes meant that national front leader jean-marie le pen qualified for round two instead of the socialist lionel jospin .
" what it means is that this time there will be no sense of frustration on the eve of the second round .
people will have the means to make a clear choice .
they will make one , and the country will discover what direction it has chosen , and what direction it must now take , " he wrote . for christophe barbier , editor of l 'express news magazine , " the french wanted so much to have this head-to-head between royal and sarkozy - between a left in the process of renewal and a confident new right . "
barbier added that sarkozy should have the advantage ahead of the second round run-off on may 6 , counting on carry-over votes from far-right leader jean-marie le pen and centrist francois bayrou .
" but nothing is decided , " he added .
" segolene royal has one important weapon : the ' anyone but sarko ' option .
we can expect a second round which brings out all his character faults and ideological excesses .
in short - it 's back to where we were at the start of the campaign . " british newspapers on monday also noted that the high turnout in the first-round of french elections was a sign of the polls ' importance , and warned that a fierce clash was forthcoming . the daily telegraph , a right-wing paper , wrote france is " as its people recognize , in trouble - and this election is , as the high turnout yesterday indicates , its best chance to turn things around . "
in an editorial titled " france needs sarkozy " it continued to say that between the two candidates left , " it is mr sarkozy who is likeliest to embrace the painful structural changes that france so desperately needs .
but before that , he needs to win an election - far from a sure thing , especially in this most fascinating of contests . " in germany , business daily financial times deutschland warned that the two weeks until the final round would be marked by " extreme polarization " as the campaign grows " tougher , more ruthless and more personal . "
but it said royal and sarkozy did not represent two radically different ends of the political spectrum .
" to the contrary : the last weeks have shown that each candidate constantly took on board the populist demands of the other to try to best his or her opponent .
in the end , there may be a close outcome and a france deeply divided into two camps . " the conservative broadsheet frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also noted the remarkably high turnout at the polls .
" apparently the french were fascinated by a campaign that was fixated on personalities . "
it said that royal had done better than expected while sarkozy could be satisfied with meeting his goal of seizing 30 percent of the vote in the first round .
" with a campaign that started with a liberal tone , then took on more and more gaullist accents and at the end leaned sharply to the right , he exhausted his own voter potential while luring le pen voters . " spanish daily el pais meanwhile said that royal 's " only chance to defeat sarkozy will be to seek bayrou 's support , but this will not be easy .
sarkozy is still the best armed candidate to enter the elysee which does not mean that his victory is guaranteed because of the powerful rejection and hatred he provokes among some french voters , " the paper said . for italy 's la stampa , " the absolute novelty is the presence of a woman who had been expected to be defeated in the first round ... the french will now be able to choose not only between two very different political options but also between a man and woman , " the newspaper said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sarkozy , royal open duel for french presidency conservative nicolas sarkozy and socialist segolene royal face off in a dramatic left-right battle for the french presidency after winning round one of an election marked by a near record turnout .

it 's a result that 's not surprising and the french are now hopeful that a serious debate will take place until the second round of voting .
that 's also desirable from a german point of view , because maybe it would make it easier for us to understand what to think of the two candidates when it comes to european policy and the franco-german relationship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anke hagedorn the election campaign so far has been a slick one - there was no overriding issue that really stuck .
it 's a far cry from the last presidential elections five years ago , when one topic , domestic safety , dominated .
this time the candidates sounded off on a whole range of issues and staged an equal number of gimmicky appearances , hoping to pull in voters . clad in jeans and sunglasses , sarkozy in the end presented himself as a mixture of cowboy and white knight , sitting on a white horse .
his message : i take charge , but i 've got my feet firmly on the ground and am also a nature-lover . centrist candidate francois bayrou , who portrayed himself as a farmer and father of six children and who had not been taken seriously by anyone at the beginning , eventually finished with a respectable result .
earlier , sarkozy enjoyed alternating between the role of savior of the nation and sacrificial lamb .
one day he flirted with trade unions while courting employers on the next .
he openly tried to woo right-extremist voters of the front national with proposals such as expelling all illegals in france and founding a ministry for immigration and national identity .
he did not tolerate competitors , be it among political adversaries or within his own ranks .
everyone , who stood in his way , was brushed aside without mercy .
editors in chief had to hand in resignations for negative coverage of sarkozy .
he threatened azouz begag , until recently minister for equal opportunities , because the latter had allegedly not been loyal .
it 's a bad omen when one thinks about what this man could do when he actually commands power .
usually dressed in a white business suit and wearing a glowing smile , segolene royal on the other hand presented herself as the new jeanne d 'arc .
she developed a new kind of communication tactic for the campaign , so-called participatory democracy .
she stood in the middle of an audience and made people believe that she was listening to them .
the only problem was it did n't work .
she usually seemed uptight and not ready for dialogue .
few managed to get to ask questions and many did n't get any answers .
it quickly led people to become disenchanted after a sky-rocketing start to the campaign .
francois bayrou hit the nail on the head when he talked about the dilemma of the voters .
" everyone 's uncertain , " he said .
" some , because they know where sarkozy would lead them and others , because they do not know where royal would take them . "
one can only hope that both candidates realize before may 6 that voters expect more than a superficial exchange of words .
they want concrete solutions , because there 's a lot of work to do in the grande nation , which has lost a lot of greatness in recent times - especially when it comes to the economy .
france has the highest unemployment rate within the euro zone , one of the lowest economic growth rates and a record trade deficit .
it 'll take more than a white horse or a white business suit to fix that .

editors in chief had to hand in resignations for negative coverage of sarkozy .
he threatened azouz begag , until recently minister for equal opportunities , because the latter had allegedly not been loyal .
it 's a bad omen when one thinks about what this man could do when he actually commands power .
usually dressed in a white business suit and wearing a glowing smile , segolene royal on the other hand presented herself as the new jeanne d 'arc .
she developed a new kind of communication tactic for the campaign , so-called participatory democracy .
she stood in the middle of an audience and made people believe that she was listening to them .
the only problem was it did n't work .
she usually seemed uptight and not ready for dialogue .
few managed to get to ask questions and many did n't get any answers .
it quickly led people to become disenchanted after a sky-rocketing start to the campaign .
francois bayrou hit the nail on the head when he talked about the dilemma of the voters .
" everyone 's uncertain , " he said .
" some , because they know where sarkozy would lead them and others , because they do not know where royal would take them . "
one can only hope that both candidates realize before may 6 that voters expect more than a superficial exchange of words .
they want concrete solutions , because there 's a lot of work to do in the grande nation , which has lost a lot of greatness in recent times - especially when it comes to the economy .
france has the highest unemployment rate within the euro zone , one of the lowest economic growth rates and a record trade deficit .
it 'll take more than a white horse or a white business suit to fix that .

" what it means is that this time there will be no sense of frustration on the eve of the second round .

"
barbier added that sarkozy should have the advantage ahead of the second round run-off on may 6 , counting on carry-over votes from far-right leader jean-marie le pen and centrist francois bayrou .
" but nothing is decided , " he added .
" segolene royal has one important weapon : the ' anyone but sarko ' option .
we can expect a second round which brings out all his character faults and ideological excesses .
in short - it 's back to where we were at the start of the campaign . " british newspapers on monday also noted that the high turnout in the first-round of french elections was a sign of the polls ' importance , and warned that a fierce clash was forthcoming . the daily telegraph , a right-wing paper , wrote france is " as its people recognize , in trouble - and this election is , as the high turnout yesterday indicates , its best chance to turn things around .

but it said royal and sarkozy did not represent two radically different ends of the political spectrum .
" to the contrary : the last weeks have shown that each candidate constantly took on board the populist demands of the other to try to best his or her opponent .
in the end , there may be a close outcome and a france deeply divided into two camps . " the conservative broadsheet frankfurter allgemeine zeitung also noted the remarkably high turnout at the polls .
" apparently the french were fascinated by a campaign that was fixated on personalities . "
it said that royal had done better than expected while sarkozy could be satisfied with meeting his goal of seizing 30 percent of the vote in the first round .
" with a campaign that started with a liberal tone , then took on more and more gaullist accents and at the end leaned sharply to the right , he exhausted his own voter potential while luring le pen voters . " spanish daily el pais meanwhile said that royal 's " only chance to defeat sarkozy will be to seek bayrou 's support , but this will not be easy .
sarkozy is still the best armed candidate to enter the elysee which does not mean that his victory is guaranteed because of the powerful rejection and hatred he provokes among some french voters , " the paper said . for italy 's la stampa , " the absolute novelty is the presence of a woman who had been expected to be defeated in the first round ... the french will now be able to choose not only between two very different political options but also between a man and woman , " the newspaper said . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sarkozy , royal open duel for french presidency conservative nicolas sarkozy and socialist segolene royal face off in a dramatic left-right battle for the french presidency after winning round one of an election marked by a near record turnout .

" we 're going to use less blood in the beginning so the actors do n't slip , " producer barrie kosky said in an interview with berliner zeitung before sunday 's premiere .
the opera is n't recommended for viewers under 16 .
whether despite or because of the blood , murder and nudity , sunday 's crowd at berlin 's komische oper cheered the modern version of the ancient tale , and culture magazine cicero called it " a great evening of humanity . "
sacrifice at abu ghraib bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geraldine mcgreevy plays the priestess iphigenia iphigenia , the title character , is a priestess and prisoner of king thoas on the island of tauris .
the king , who heard in an oracle that he was going to be killed at the hands of a foreigner , orders iphigenia to kill anyone who makes it onto the island in a sacrifice to goddess diana .
the opera opens with the priestess doing her job .
iphigenia drags a lifeless body across the stage to the rhythm of the music , slits its necks and collects the dripping blood .
soldiers in us fatigues bring iphigenia more victims and before the executions , the soldiers pose for pictures with the corpses , whose heads are wrapped in plastic bags .
" it was n't the naked seniors that hurt , but the over-naturalism of the beginning , where thoas ' prisoners were humiliated by their myrmidon charges a la abu ghraib , " cicero wrote , referring to the disrobed actors who appear in the background .
" the issue is still too close , as if one could ignore the fact that each reference also has to do with living people , who maybe do n't want to become just threads in the fabric of the world 's collective images , " the magazine continued .
for kosky , sacrifice is the most interesting part of the opera . " the idea of sacrifice runs through so many cultures , " he said , mentioning the story of abraham and isaac , which is significant to christian , jews and muslims .
a subtle love story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the love story plays out between pylades -lrb- right -rrb- and orestes like abraham , iphigenia stops her knife in mid-air during one of the many sacrifices .
she recognized her brother orestes , who had come to the island with his boyfriend , pylades , after having killed his mother .
her brother 's appearance forces the priestess to choose between her heart and duty .
her heart wins out and she lets her brother live .
throughout the opera , the audience is left wondering about orestes ' sexuality .
" somebody once told me there was no love story in iphigenia , " kosky told the berliner zeitung .
" but i think there is one , and it happens between two men .
but this is no gay pride production .
the audience members have to decide for themselves what happened between the two of them . " christoph willibald gluck , one of germany ’ s great opera composers and a reformer of the genre , set the greek mythological tale of priestess iphigenia in 1779 .

in an interview published monday , german chancellor angela merkel said she did not expect washington to adopt european goals on climate protection at an eu-us summit next week . " i do not think the us will adopt the european climate protection goals , " merkel told the daily münchener merkur . but she said there was growing awareness in the united states and within the us government that reducing greenhouse gas emissions was crucial . " i have been pleased at international meetings to see a growing feeling for a common , global responsibility -lrb- for climate protection -rrb- , " she said .
" on some issues , the us is even surpassing european targets , for example in the use of biofuels . " germany currently holds the rotating presidency of both the group of eight club of rich nations and the european union . not that different after all ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the us and eu really closer together on climate protection than people think ?
the us ambassador to the eu , boyden gray , said earlier this month that the gap between the united states and eu over how to tackle global warming is narrower than many might think . " both sides of the atlantic now agree it 's the same and it 's a constructive change , " he said .
" i do n't see that much difference . " gray was responding to criticism from european environment commissioner stavros dimas , who tartly compared eu plans to cut greenhouse-gas emissions through ever-tighter , legally binding curbs with the us voluntary approach . thinking beyond kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the next us president make environmentalists happier ?
the eu championed the kyoto protocol to reduce harmful emissions after it was abandoned by the united states in march 2001 . but the treaty has been almost crippled by the absence of the united states , which alone accounts for about a quarter of all this pollution . exploratory negotiations are under way for determining what treaty should follow kyoto after the accord expires at the end of 2012 . germany helped broker an agreement last month under which the 27 eu member states will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels over the next 13 years . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german paper teams up with environmentalists to save planet germany 's leading mass-market newspaper has joined the country 's major environment organizations in a nationwide campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
-lrb- 18.04.2007 -rrb- report : climate change poses serious challenge for europe the intergovernmental panel on climate change has said that the world 's poorest countries will be affected most by climate change .
though relatively wealthy , europe will also struggle , a new report says .
-lrb- 12.04.2007 -rrb- eu urges germany to do more to combat climate change a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases .

in an interview published monday , german chancellor angela merkel said she did not expect washington to adopt european goals on climate protection at an eu-us summit next week . " i do not think the us will adopt the european climate protection goals , " merkel told the daily münchener merkur . but she said there was growing awareness in the united states and within the us government that reducing greenhouse gas emissions was crucial . " i have been pleased at international meetings to see a growing feeling for a common , global responsibility -lrb- for climate protection -rrb- , " she said .
" on some issues , the us is even surpassing european targets , for example in the use of biofuels . " germany currently holds the rotating presidency of both the group of eight club of rich nations and the european union . not that different after all ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the us and eu really closer together on climate protection than people think ?
the us ambassador to the eu , boyden gray , said earlier this month that the gap between the united states and eu over how to tackle global warming is narrower than many might think . " both sides of the atlantic now agree it 's the same and it 's a constructive change , " he said .
" i do n't see that much difference . " gray was responding to criticism from european environment commissioner stavros dimas , who tartly compared eu plans to cut greenhouse-gas emissions through ever-tighter , legally binding curbs with the us voluntary approach . thinking beyond kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the next us president make environmentalists happier ?
the eu championed the kyoto protocol to reduce harmful emissions after it was abandoned by the united states in march 2001 . but the treaty has been almost crippled by the absence of the united states , which alone accounts for about a quarter of all this pollution . exploratory negotiations are under way for determining what treaty should follow kyoto after the accord expires at the end of 2012 . germany helped broker an agreement last month under which the 27 eu member states will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels over the next 13 years . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german paper teams up with environmentalists to save planet germany 's leading mass-market newspaper has joined the country 's major environment organizations in a nationwide campaign to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .

though relatively wealthy , europe will also struggle , a new report says .
-lrb- 12.04.2007 -rrb- eu urges germany to do more to combat climate change a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases .

it 's a result that 's not surprising and the french are now hopeful that a serious debate will take place until the second round of voting .
that 's also desirable from a german point of view , because maybe it would make it easier for us to understand what to think of the two candidates when it comes to european policy and the franco-german relationship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anke hagedorn the election campaign so far has been a slick one - there was no overriding issue that really stuck .
it 's a far cry from the last presidential elections five years ago , when one topic , domestic safety , dominated .
this time the candidates sounded off on a whole range of issues and staged an equal number of gimmicky appearances , hoping to pull in voters . clad in jeans and sunglasses , sarkozy in the end presented himself as a mixture of cowboy and white knight , sitting on a white horse .
his message : i take charge , but i 've got my feet firmly on the ground and am also a nature-lover . centrist candidate francois bayrou , who portrayed himself as a farmer and father of six children and who had not been taken seriously by anyone at the beginning , eventually finished with a respectable result .
earlier , sarkozy enjoyed alternating between the role of savior of the nation and sacrificial lamb .
one day he flirted with trade unions while courting employers on the next .
he openly tried to woo right-extremist voters of the front national with proposals such as expelling all illegals in france and founding a ministry for immigration and national identity .
he did not tolerate competitors , be it among political adversaries or within his own ranks .
everyone , who stood in his way , was brushed aside without mercy .
editors in chief had to hand in resignations for negative coverage of sarkozy .
he threatened azouz begag , until recently minister for equal opportunities , because the latter had allegedly not been loyal .
it 's a bad omen when one thinks about what this man could do when he actually commands power .
usually dressed in a white business suit and wearing a glowing smile , segolene royal on the other hand presented herself as the new jeanne d 'arc .
she developed a new kind of communication tactic for the campaign , so-called participatory democracy .
she stood in the middle of an audience and made people believe that she was listening to them .
the only problem was it did n't work .
she usually seemed uptight and not ready for dialogue .
few managed to get to ask questions and many did n't get any answers .
it quickly led people to become disenchanted after a sky-rocketing start to the campaign .
francois bayrou hit the nail on the head when he talked about the dilemma of the voters .
" everyone 's uncertain , " he said .
" some , because they know where sarkozy would lead them and others , because they do not know where royal would take them . "
one can only hope that both candidates realize before may 6 that voters expect more than a superficial exchange of words .
they want concrete solutions , because there 's a lot of work to do in the grande nation , which has lost a lot of greatness in recent times - especially when it comes to the economy .
france has the highest unemployment rate within the euro zone , one of the lowest economic growth rates and a record trade deficit .
it 'll take more than a white horse or a white business suit to fix that .

royal 's result was a huge relief for the opposition socialist party which had feared a repeat of the 2002 shock when then prime minister lionel jospin was humiliatingly knocked out of the race in the first round by far-right national front leader jean-marie le pen .
this time le pen was in shock after he came in fourth , with 10.51 percent .

none of the other eight candidates gained more than five percent , according to final figures from the interior ministry .

royal 's result was a huge relief for the opposition socialist party which had feared a repeat of the 2002 shock when then prime minister lionel jospin was humiliatingly knocked out of the race in the first round by far-right national front leader jean-marie le pen .
this time le pen was in shock after he came in fourth , with 10.51 percent .
democratic awakening bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy thanked supporters on sunday jean-marie colombani , editor-in-chief of le monde newspaper , said the highest turnout for more than 40 years - 84.6 percent - showed that the french had undergone a " democratic awakening " and that " people wanted to wipe out the memory " of le pen 's success in 2002 .
none of the other eight candidates gained more than five percent , according to final figures from the interior ministry .
sarkozy and royal will now square off in the second round on may 6 , and will put their starkly different visions to a public test in a face-to-face televised debate on may 2 .
a clear choice ?
" i want only one thing : to rally the french people around a new french dream , " sarkozy , 52 , the governing party 's candidate , told cheering supporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal during her speech after the election royal , 53 and aiming to become france 's first woman president , pledged to be the champion of those who want to change france " without brutalizing it .
" we have a clear choice between two , very different projects for society , " she told a post-election rally .
an opinion poll by ipsos after the first round predicted sarkozy would beat royal by 54 percent to 46 in the run-off .
back to campaigning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will bayrou play a decisive role ?
both candidates went straight back onto the campaign trail monday , looking to woo the all important electorate of centrist francois bayrou , who came in third with 18.55 percent .
sarkozy 's lieutenant brice hortefeux said the frontrunner would not entertain " backroom deals " with bayrou , but said " the door is not closed " to negotiations .
bayrou 's small union for a french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- party has in the past aligned itself with sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- in parliament but the candidate has veered to the left during the campaign .
" we will not start negotiating in the wings as some usually do , " said jean-christophe lagarde , a deputy from bayrou 's udf party .
" we will think about the best way to ensure that the views of the people who said ' we want to change politics in this country ' are respected . "
bayrou , a 55-year-old former education minister , had campaigned on a platform that rejected the traditional left and right divide and called for a unity government made up of moderates from both camps . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : it 's time to get serious in france deutsche welle 's anke hagedorn says that nicolas sarkozy and segolene royal now need to focus on the issues rather than appearances before they square off again in the race for the french presidency on may 6 .

najib razak has denied having any connection with the killing , and says he never met the murdered woman , mongolian model altantuya shaariibuu .
mr najib 's key political advisor abdul razak baginda is currently awaiting trial in connection with her killing .
mr najib 's political opponents have made the murder an issue in a key by-election campaign .
the remains of the mongolian model were found outside kuala lumpur in october .
she had been shot twice in the head and her remains blown up with plastic explosives .
according to the police she was kidnapped outside the home of abdul razak baginda , a political analyst and a close associate of mr najib .
until last week the deputy prime minister had ignored attempts to link him to the murder .
but when opposition leader anwar ibrahim demanded he reveal what he knew about the killing , mr najib hit back saying he had nothing to do with the affair and had never met the woman .
he refused to rise to mr anwar 's challenge to sue him over the allegations , saying he had no wish to embarrass his former colleague because he has a wife and children .
mr najib is perhaps the most whispered against politician in malaysia - however he is also one of the most astute .
analysts say it would have been extraordinary if he had allowed himself to become embroiled in such a gruesome affair .

almost 40,000 incidents of the crime were reported in the region between april 2005 and 2006 a countryside alliance investigation has shown .
the worst hit area was cardiff with 14,125 fly tipping incidents at a cost to taxpayers of £ 662,108 .
a countryside alliance spokesman said fly tippers were breaking the law and ruining beauty spots .
other fly-tipping hotspots in south wales included caerphilly where 2356 incidents were reported at a cost of £ 114,461 .
carmarthenshire was also hit hard with 791 reports of dumping at a cost of £ 128,004 .
swansea was second behind cardiff with 8214 reported incidents of fly-tipping at a cost of £ 469,483 .

" many people believe that fly-tipping is something they can get away with and that the victim is faceless - this is nonsense , " he said .

"
the countryside alliance 's national investigation found there were 2.5 million incidents of unlawful rubbish dumping across the uk in the year to april 2006 .
this cost local authorities just under £ 100m but less than one in 100 cases led to a prosecution .
the results of the investigation were published at the beginning of national fly-tipping awareness week as part of the countryside alliance 's national ' fly-tipping - scrap it ' campaign .

the bbc news website has been given unprecedented access to the talented staff and ground-breaking technology at the firm .
over the next three days we will be looking at the work of the firm and of parent company lucasfilm itself .
the letterman digital arts center nestles on one of the hills of san francisco in the historic presidio district of the city .
it is home to ilm , parts of lucasfilm , video game developers lucasarts and other arms of the entertainment multimedia empire built by star wars creator george lucas .
artists , animators , technicians and staff are housed in a state of the art digital complex covering 850,000 sq ft on 23 acres of land , which overlooks the golden gate bridge .
" that 's actually a matte painting and we can change it , " says miles perkins , director of marketing and communications at lucasfilm , who leads my tour .
" sometimes it 's the eiffel tower , " he adds .
optical illusion he is , of course , joking , but it would not be beyond the powers of ilm to produce such an optical illusion , even on that scale . "
we tend to anticipate what the future technologies are three to five years out . "
michael sanders , digital supervisor ilm has worked on more than 250 films since it was set up by lucas to provide special effects for star wars , released 30 years ago next month .
" in each film you do n't have a director who comes back to you and says ' can you give me exactly what you gave someone else a year ago ? ' , " explains mr perkins .
" they are always asking for more , for something no-one has ever seen before .
if they wanted one wave a year ago , now they want two waves , or an entire ocean . "
oscar win after a long hiatus , the firm recently picked up its 15th oscar for visual effects , for the work done on pirates of the caribbean : dead man 's chest .
visual effects have come a long way since the days of clay models and stop frame animation and recently ilm has been blurring the lines between live performance and digital effects .
much of the ground-breaking work has been done by the motion capture team led by digital supervisor michael sanders .
deep inside the center at the motion capture sound stage he is helping the firm seamlessly meld live action and computer generated material .
creature integration " every year at ilm we are able to outdo ourselves with the technology of motion capture and creature integration , " he explains .
" a few years ago it was a post-production process ; shooting it on our stage and then integrating it into the film .
" over time we have realised that making it real time and making it integrated with live action gives more control to the key creatives . "
on the most recent pirates of the caribbean film director gore verbinski had a specific request .
" he asked us if we could invent a technique which allowed us to film bill nighy on the pirate 's ship , in the harbour , during a storm or in any conditions without any calibration equipment and a bunch of intrusions on set .
spectacular cg creations " we said ' sure .
it 's about time somebody asked for it because we wanted to build that kind of technology ' . "
nighy 's character davy jones is one of the most spectacular cg creations of recent years - dripping in barnacles and tentacles the character is one of the most memorable in the film .
" that 's where the technology is going - invisible tools to provide for the director so they do n't have to change their paradigm of shooting , whether it 's a virtual element or a live element .
it should n't matter with a low footprint and low impact on set .
" so we had to invent a technology where we could shoot the actors live in the set without any calibrated equipment ; basically extracting their performance from the film camera . "
' computer pyjamas ' the solution was to have nighy wear a set of head sensors on the film set - which the actor called his " funky computer pyjamas " - and which did not interfere with his performance nor the smooth filming of the production .
" as long as he is wearing this while performing , we can extract his 3d skeleton performance that matches his exact motion through the shot .
" we dump that into the digital character , add the claw simulator , tentacle simulator , facial animation , etc - this is where the animators and artists come into play .
" they are extracting bill 's performance and then embellishing .
but it 's bill nighy 's eyes , antics ; his performance . "
without this technology separate filming would have to be done on a motion capture stage with elements then " filled in " post-production .
image streams " the future for us to a extract a high-fidelity actor 's performance , from one or multiple image streams , plug it into the creature and put it right back in the shot for the director .
" so rather than composing for the actor in the set , they 'll be composing for the creature in the set in real time , under any lighting condition , under any shooting condition . "
" the real true nuance and performance comes from the impromptu talent of an actor - all we are doing is replicating it in cg " michael sanders sanders says his team is tasked with always thinking beyond the current needs of today 's directors .
" we tend to anticipate what the future technologies are three to five years out .
we sit on a concept until it 's asked for and then with short development cycle we can do pretty much anything . "
so far , says sanders , a director has not tasked them with an effect or technique that they have not been able to do .
at the letterman center the team has a dedicated sound stage , with 40 state-of-the-art vicon cameras which emit infrared light that bounces off markers on a performer 's suit .
' active space ' " in the computer we see the markers and they are associated to a skeleton and that 's how we derive a motion from a performance .
" we can shoot a dozen performers in here and they can go anywhere in the room .
it 's all active space .
" we can also do real-time motion capture ; virtual cinematography - you have a virtual space and virtual character in real-time .
" we use a camera with a tracking device as a digital virtual camera .
as you move the camera through the space you are actually observing on the monitor a 3d perspective as if you were playing a video game .
" if there 's an actor here you can also see your virtual creatures in real time in the 3d space . "
for the future sanders and his team are working on removing all barriers between live performance and digital creations - but actors will never be replaced , he says .
" the real true nuance and performance comes from the impromptu talent of an actor - all we are doing is replicating it in cg .
" we 're not going to be replacing actors .
they are the ones with the talent .
we are just capturing and / or embellishing their performance . "
on tuesday , we explore the data centre at industrial light and magic which powers the firm .

at the letterman center the team has a dedicated sound stage , with 40 state-of-the-art vicon cameras which emit infrared light that bounces off markers on a performer 's suit .
' active space ' " in the computer we see the markers and they are associated to a skeleton and that 's how we derive a motion from a performance .
" we can shoot a dozen performers in here and they can go anywhere in the room .
it 's all active space .
" we can also do real-time motion capture ; virtual cinematography - you have a virtual space and virtual character in real-time .
" we use a camera with a tracking device as a digital virtual camera .
as you move the camera through the space you are actually observing on the monitor a 3d perspective as if you were playing a video game .
" if there 's an actor here you can also see your virtual creatures in real time in the 3d space . "
for the future sanders and his team are working on removing all barriers between live performance and digital creations - but actors will never be replaced , he says .

the bbc news website has been given unprecedented access to the talented staff and ground-breaking technology at the firm .
over the next three days we will be looking at the work of the firm and of parent company lucasfilm itself .
the letterman digital arts center nestles on one of the hills of san francisco in the historic presidio district of the city .
it is home to ilm , parts of lucasfilm , video game developers lucasarts and other arms of the entertainment multimedia empire built by star wars creator george lucas .
artists , animators , technicians and staff are housed in a state of the art digital complex covering 850,000 sq ft on 23 acres of land , which overlooks the golden gate bridge .
" that 's actually a matte painting and we can change it , " says miles perkins , director of marketing and communications at lucasfilm , who leads my tour .
" sometimes it 's the eiffel tower , " he adds .
optical illusion he is , of course , joking , but it would not be beyond the powers of ilm to produce such an optical illusion , even on that scale .
we tend to anticipate what the future technologies are three to five years out .
michael sanders , digital supervisor ilm has worked on more than 250 films since it was set up by lucas to provide special effects for star wars , released 30 years ago next month .
" in each film you do n't have a director who comes back to you and says ' can you give me exactly what you gave someone else a year ago ? ' , " explains mr perkins .
" they are always asking for more , for something no-one has ever seen before .
if they wanted one wave a year ago , now they want two waves , or an entire ocean . "
oscar win after a long hiatus , the firm recently picked up its 15th oscar for visual effects , for the work done on pirates of the caribbean : dead man 's chest .
visual effects have come a long way since the days of clay models and stop frame animation and recently ilm has been blurring the lines between live performance and digital effects .
much of the ground-breaking work has been done by the motion capture team led by digital supervisor michael sanders .
deep inside the center at the motion capture sound stage he is helping the firm seamlessly meld live action and computer generated material .
creature integration michael sanders in the ilm motion capture studio " every year at ilm we are able to outdo ourselves with the technology of motion capture and creature integration , " he explains .
" a few years ago it was a post-production process ; shooting it on our stage and then integrating it into the film .
" over time we have realised that making it real time and making it integrated with live action gives more control to the key creatives . "
on the most recent pirates of the caribbean film director gore verbinski had a specific request .
" he asked us if we could invent a technique which allowed us to film bill nighy on the pirate 's ship , in the harbour , during a storm or in any conditions without any calibration equipment and a bunch of intrusions on set .
spectacular cg creations " we said ' sure .
it 's about time somebody asked for it because we wanted to build that kind of technology ' . "
matte painting or stunning view ?
ilm is based in san francisco nighy 's character davy jones is one of the most spectacular cg creations of recent years - dripping in barnacles and tentacles the character is one of the most memorable in the film .
" that 's where the technology is going - invisible tools to provide for the director so they do n't have to change their paradigm of shooting , whether it 's a virtual element or a live element .
it should n't matter with a low footprint and low impact on set .
" so we had to invent a technology where we could shoot the actors live in the set without any calibrated equipment ; basically extracting their performance from the film camera . "
' computer pyjamas ' the solution was to have nighy wear a set of head sensors on the film set - which the actor called his " funky computer pyjamas " - and which did not interfere with his performance nor the smooth filming of the production .
" as long as he is wearing this while performing , we can extract his 3d skeleton performance that matches his exact motion through the shot .
" we dump that into the digital character , add the claw simulator , tentacle simulator , facial animation , etc - this is where the animators and artists come into play .
" they are extracting bill 's performance and then embellishing .
but it 's bill nighy 's eyes , antics ; his performance . "
without this technology separate filming would have to be done on a motion capture stage with elements then " filled in " post-production .
image streams " the future for us to a extract a high-fidelity actor 's performance , from one or multiple image streams , plug it into the creature and put it right back in the shot for the director .
" so rather than composing for the actor in the set , they 'll be composing for the creature in the set in real time , under any lighting condition , under any shooting condition . "
the real true nuance and performance comes from the impromptu talent of an actor - all we are doing is replicating it in cg michael sanders sanders says his team is tasked with always thinking beyond the current needs of today 's directors .
" we tend to anticipate what the future technologies are three to five years out .
we sit on a concept until it 's asked for and then with short development cycle we can do pretty much anything . "

it is home to ilm , parts of lucasfilm , video game developers lucasarts and other arms of the entertainment multimedia empire built by star wars creator george lucas .
artists , animators , technicians and staff are housed in a state of the art digital complex covering 850,000 sq ft on 23 acres of land , which overlooks the golden gate bridge .
" that 's actually a matte painting and we can change it , " says miles perkins , director of marketing and communications at lucasfilm , who leads my tour .
" sometimes it 's the eiffel tower , " he adds .
optical illusion he is , of course , joking , but it would not be beyond the powers of ilm to produce such an optical illusion , even on that scale .
we tend to anticipate what the future technologies are three to five years out .
michael sanders , digital supervisor ilm has worked on more than 250 films since it was set up by lucas to provide special effects for star wars , released 30 years ago next month .
" in each film you do n't have a director who comes back to you and says ' can you give me exactly what you gave someone else a year ago ? ' , " explains mr perkins .
" they are always asking for more , for something no-one has ever seen before .
if they wanted one wave a year ago , now they want two waves , or an entire ocean . "
oscar win after a long hiatus , the firm recently picked up its 15th oscar for visual effects , for the work done on pirates of the caribbean : dead man 's chest .
visual effects have come a long way since the days of clay models and stop frame animation and recently ilm has been blurring the lines between live performance and digital effects .
much of the ground-breaking work has been done by the motion capture team led by digital supervisor michael sanders .
deep inside the center at the motion capture sound stage he is helping the firm seamlessly meld live action and computer generated material .
creature integration michael sanders in the ilm motion capture studio " every year at ilm we are able to outdo ourselves with the technology of motion capture and creature integration , " he explains .
" a few years ago it was a post-production process ; shooting it on our stage and then integrating it into the film .
" over time we have realised that making it real time and making it integrated with live action gives more control to the key creatives . "
on the most recent pirates of the caribbean film director gore verbinski had a specific request .
" he asked us if we could invent a technique which allowed us to film bill nighy on the pirate 's ship , in the harbour , during a storm or in any conditions without any calibration equipment and a bunch of intrusions on set .
spectacular cg creations " we said ' sure .
it 's about time somebody asked for it because we wanted to build that kind of technology ' . "
matte painting or stunning view ?
ilm is based in san francisco nighy 's character davy jones is one of the most spectacular cg creations of recent years - dripping in barnacles and tentacles the character is one of the most memorable in the film .
" that 's where the technology is going - invisible tools to provide for the director so they do n't have to change their paradigm of shooting , whether it 's a virtual element or a live element .
it should n't matter with a low footprint and low impact on set .
" so we had to invent a technology where we could shoot the actors live in the set without any calibrated equipment ; basically extracting their performance from the film camera . "
' computer pyjamas ' the solution was to have nighy wear a set of head sensors on the film set - which the actor called his " funky computer pyjamas " - and which did not interfere with his performance nor the smooth filming of the production .
" as long as he is wearing this while performing , we can extract his 3d skeleton performance that matches his exact motion through the shot .
" we dump that into the digital character , add the claw simulator , tentacle simulator , facial animation , etc - this is where the animators and artists come into play .
" they are extracting bill 's performance and then embellishing .
but it 's bill nighy 's eyes , antics ; his performance . "
without this technology separate filming would have to be done on a motion capture stage with elements then " filled in " post-production .
image streams " the future for us to a extract a high-fidelity actor 's performance , from one or multiple image streams , plug it into the creature and put it right back in the shot for the director .
" so rather than composing for the actor in the set , they 'll be composing for the creature in the set in real time , under any lighting condition , under any shooting condition . "
the real true nuance and performance comes from the impromptu talent of an actor - all we are doing is replicating it in cg michael sanders sanders says his team is tasked with always thinking beyond the current needs of today 's directors .
" we tend to anticipate what the future technologies are three to five years out .
we sit on a concept until it 's asked for and then with short development cycle we can do pretty much anything . "
so far , says sanders , a director has not tasked them with an effect or technique that they have not been able to do .
at the letterman center the team has a dedicated sound stage , with 40 state-of-the-art vicon cameras which emit infrared light that bounces off markers on a performer 's suit .
' active space ' " in the computer we see the markers and they are associated to a skeleton and that 's how we derive a motion from a performance .
" we can shoot a dozen performers in here and they can go anywhere in the room .
it 's all active space .
" we can also do real-time motion capture ; virtual cinematography - you have a virtual space and virtual character in real-time .
" we use a camera with a tracking device as a digital virtual camera .
as you move the camera through the space you are actually observing on the monitor a 3d perspective as if you were playing a video game .
" if there 's an actor here you can also see your virtual creatures in real time in the 3d space . "
for the future sanders and his team are working on removing all barriers between live performance and digital creations - but actors will never be replaced , he says .
" the real true nuance and performance comes from the impromptu talent of an actor - all we are doing is replicating it in cg .
" we 're not going to be replacing actors .
they are the ones with the talent .
we are just capturing and / or embellishing their performance . "
on tuesday , we explore the data centre at industrial light and magic which powers the firm .

at the letterman center the team has a dedicated sound stage , with 40 state-of-the-art vicon cameras which emit infrared light that bounces off markers on a performer 's suit .
' active space ' " in the computer we see the markers and they are associated to a skeleton and that 's how we derive a motion from a performance .
" we can shoot a dozen performers in here and they can go anywhere in the room .
it 's all active space .
" we can also do real-time motion capture ; virtual cinematography - you have a virtual space and virtual character in real-time .
" we use a camera with a tracking device as a digital virtual camera .
as you move the camera through the space you are actually observing on the monitor a 3d perspective as if you were playing a video game .
" if there 's an actor here you can also see your virtual creatures in real time in the 3d space . "
for the future sanders and his team are working on removing all barriers between live performance and digital creations - but actors will never be replaced , he says .
" the real true nuance and performance comes from the impromptu talent of an actor - all we are doing is replicating it in cg .
" we 're not going to be replacing actors .
they are the ones with the talent .
we are just capturing and / or embellishing their performance . "

the bbc news website has been given unprecedented access to the talented staff and ground-breaking technology at the firm .
over the next three days we will be looking at the work of the firm and of parent company lucasfilm itself .
the letterman digital arts center nestles on one of the hills of san francisco in the historic presidio district of the city .
it is home to ilm , parts of lucasfilm , video game developers lucasarts and other arms of the entertainment multimedia empire built by star wars creator george lucas .
artists , animators , technicians and staff are housed in a state of the art digital complex covering 850,000 sq ft on 23 acres of land , which overlooks the golden gate bridge .
" that 's actually a matte painting and we can change it , " says miles perkins , director of marketing and communications at lucasfilm , who leads my tour .
" sometimes it 's the eiffel tower , " he adds .
optical illusion he is , of course , joking , but it would not be beyond the powers of ilm to produce such an optical illusion , even on that scale .
we tend to anticipate what the future technologies are three to five years out .
michael sanders , digital supervisor ilm has worked on more than 250 films since it was set up by lucas to provide special effects for star wars , released 30 years ago next month .
" in each film you do n't have a director who comes back to you and says ' can you give me exactly what you gave someone else a year ago ? ' , " explains mr perkins .
" they are always asking for more , for something no-one has ever seen before .
if they wanted one wave a year ago , now they want two waves , or an entire ocean . "
oscar win after a long hiatus , the firm recently picked up its 15th oscar for visual effects , for the work done on pirates of the caribbean : dead man 's chest .
visual effects have come a long way since the days of clay models and stop frame animation and recently ilm has been blurring the lines between live performance and digital effects .
much of the ground-breaking work has been done by the motion capture team led by digital supervisor michael sanders .
deep inside the center at the motion capture sound stage he is helping the firm seamlessly meld live action and computer generated material .
creature integration michael sanders in the ilm motion capture studio " every year at ilm we are able to outdo ourselves with the technology of motion capture and creature integration , " he explains .
" a few years ago it was a post-production process ; shooting it on our stage and then integrating it into the film .
" over time we have realised that making it real time and making it integrated with live action gives more control to the key creatives . "
on the most recent pirates of the caribbean film director gore verbinski had a specific request .
" he asked us if we could invent a technique which allowed us to film bill nighy on the pirate 's ship , in the harbour , during a storm or in any conditions without any calibration equipment and a bunch of intrusions on set .
spectacular cg creations " we said ' sure .
it 's about time somebody asked for it because we wanted to build that kind of technology ' . "
matte painting or stunning view ?
ilm is based in san francisco nighy 's character davy jones is one of the most spectacular cg creations of recent years - dripping in barnacles and tentacles the character is one of the most memorable in the film .
" that 's where the technology is going - invisible tools to provide for the director so they do n't have to change their paradigm of shooting , whether it 's a virtual element or a live element .
it should n't matter with a low footprint and low impact on set .
" so we had to invent a technology where we could shoot the actors live in the set without any calibrated equipment ; basically extracting their performance from the film camera . "
' computer pyjamas ' the solution was to have nighy wear a set of head sensors on the film set - which the actor called his " funky computer pyjamas " - and which did not interfere with his performance nor the smooth filming of the production .
" as long as he is wearing this while performing , we can extract his 3d skeleton performance that matches his exact motion through the shot .
" we dump that into the digital character , add the claw simulator , tentacle simulator , facial animation , etc - this is where the animators and artists come into play .
" they are extracting bill 's performance and then embellishing .
but it 's bill nighy 's eyes , antics ; his performance . "
without this technology separate filming would have to be done on a motion capture stage with elements then " filled in " post-production .
image streams " the future for us to a extract a high-fidelity actor 's performance , from one or multiple image streams , plug it into the creature and put it right back in the shot for the director .
" so rather than composing for the actor in the set , they 'll be composing for the creature in the set in real time , under any lighting condition , under any shooting condition . "
the real true nuance and performance comes from the impromptu talent of an actor - all we are doing is replicating it in cg michael sanders sanders says his team is tasked with always thinking beyond the current needs of today 's directors .
" we tend to anticipate what the future technologies are three to five years out .
we sit on a concept until it 's asked for and then with short development cycle we can do pretty much anything . "

the area in london is not just europe 's leading financial centre - it is said to be the continent 's most advanced wireless network too .
that is the claim made by the network 's creator the cloud and by the city of london corporation which has backed it .
there are 127 nodes on lamp posts giving access to 350,000 people .
the city of london corporation believes it will be invaluable to traders , bankers and brokers who want access to their data when they are on the move - or out at lunch .
" every second counts when you are doing deals , " explains simon mcginn from the corporation .
but unlike some examples of municipal wi-fi , this network will not be free .
it is available to a variety of providers who will charge customers a range of fees to log on .
the network covers 95 % of the city 's streets , though it is does not reach right across private land like the broadgate development and the inns of court .
q & a : wi-fi explained the cloud - which operates wi-fi zones across europe - says advanced mesh technology means users will be able to move from one node to another without losing internet access .
i climbed into one of the cycle rickshaws which now crisscross the city and tried the network out .
i picked up the signal pretty easily and , despite a few hiccups , stayed logged on from finsbury circus to smithfield .
but is there really that much demand for open-air surfing ?
after all , staring at a laptop screen in the sunshine is not a great experience - especially in an area where so many cafes have wi-fi access .
the network 's backers think one of the big attractions will be the ability to use wi-fi enabled phones to make cheap calls using skype or other internet telephony services .
it 's hard to see why well-paid city workers would bother with the extra effort needed to make a wi-fi call - but the city of london corporation believes it will prove attractive to migrant workers on construction sites .
public wi-fi networks , free and paid-for , are spreading quickly , but there are mixed reports on just how much they are being used .
some believe the more advanced wimax technology is the real answer to open-air internet access .
so the city of london 's network will provide a major test of whether the public really wants to surf on the move - and whether there is any money to be made from it .

the area in london is not just europe 's leading financial centre - it is said to be the continent 's most advanced wireless network too .
that is the claim made by the network 's creator the cloud and by the city of london corporation which has backed it .
there are 127 nodes on lamp posts giving access to 350,000 people .
the city of london corporation believes it will be invaluable to traders , bankers and brokers who want access to their data when they are on the move - or out at lunch .
" every second counts when you are doing deals , " explains simon mcginn from the corporation .
but unlike some examples of municipal wi-fi , this network will not be free .
it is available to a variety of providers who will charge customers a range of fees to log on .
the network covers 95 % of the city 's streets , though it is does not reach right across private land like the broadgate development and the inns of court .
q & a : wi-fi explained the cloud - which operates wi-fi zones across europe - says advanced mesh technology means users will be able to move from one node to another without losing internet access .
i climbed into one of the cycle rickshaws which now crisscross the city and tried the network out .
i picked up the signal pretty easily and , despite a few hiccups , stayed logged on from finsbury circus to smithfield .
but is there really that much demand for open-air surfing ?
after all , staring at a laptop screen in the sunshine is not a great experience - especially in an area where so many cafes have wi-fi access .
the network 's backers think one of the big attractions will be the ability to use wi-fi enabled phones to make cheap calls using skype or other internet telephony services .
it 's hard to see why well-paid city workers would bother with the extra effort needed to make a wi-fi call - but the city of london corporation believes it will prove attractive to migrant workers on construction sites .
public wi-fi networks , free and paid-for , are spreading quickly , but there are mixed reports on just how much they are being used .
some believe the more advanced wimax technology is the real answer to open-air internet access .
so the city of london 's network will provide a major test of whether the public really wants to surf on the move - and whether there is any money to be made from it .

the area in london is not just europe 's leading financial centre - it is said to be the continent 's most advanced wireless network too .
that is the claim made by the network 's creator the cloud and by the city of london corporation which has backed it .
there are 127 nodes on lamp posts giving access to 350,000 people .
the city of london corporation believes it will be invaluable to traders , bankers and brokers who want access to their data when they are on the move - or out at lunch .
" every second counts when you are doing deals , " explains simon mcginn from the corporation .
but unlike some examples of municipal wi-fi , this network will not be free .
it is available to a variety of providers who will charge customers a range of fees to log on .
the network covers 95 % of the city 's streets , though it is does not reach right across private land like the broadgate development and the inns of court .

but is there really that much demand for open-air surfing ?
after all , staring at a laptop screen in the sunshine is not a great experience - especially in an area where so many cafes have wi-fi access .
the network 's backers think one of the big attractions will be the ability to use wi-fi enabled phones to make cheap calls using skype or other internet telephony services .
it 's hard to see why well-paid city workers would bother with the extra effort needed to make a wi-fi call - but the city of london corporation believes it will prove attractive to migrant workers on construction sites .

farmer moses urio hopes he will no longer have to buy diesel a bio-gas converter , the first of its type in east africa , is being tested by the 120 members of the local coffee farmers ' group .
the gas can be used instead of diesel to power machines used by the farmers to process the raw coffee they grow .
this bio-gas project is a part of a larger project funded by the swiss government 's state secretariat for economic affairs -lrb- seco -rrb- to boost the incomes of tanzanian coffee farmers .
it is a simple idea .
waste water from the processing of the raw coffee beans is high in acid and it is this acid that micro-organisms like to feed on .
the by-product of the feeding process is methane gas , which can be used to drive engines .
' amazed ' the savings could be considerable .
it costs around $ 1 an hour to power the pulper machine , so the farmers group could save around $ 4 a day or $ 28 a week .
the waste water is produced when the beans are pulped " we 're amazed that we can make power from water which we have always considered as useless and just thrown away , " said farmer moses charles urio .
the waste water comes from the group 's pulper machine , which washes and prepares the green beans picked off the coffee bushes .
the water is collected and its ph tested .
then ash from cooking stoves in the village is added to ensure the optimal ph level of 6.5-8.5 is maintained .
virtuous circle " the process is straight-forward , " explains cyril chimila from technoserve , the organisation which has installed the bio-gas converter .
the bio-gas converter will help farmers to make more money from their coffee emmanuel maliti , seco " waste water which would otherwise be thrown away is being used to create energy which costs the farmer nothing . "
once the gas is harvested it can be used to power the very pulper machine which provided the waste water in the first place , creating something approaching a virtuous power supply circle .
the bio-gas scheme may also benefit the environment as it helps prevent waste water from pulperies draining away into the surrounding area .
the coffee farmers previously had conflict with communities downstream of leguruti village who have complained of foul odours in their drinking water .
its high acidic content can also cause severe environmental damage , stunting crop growth and ruining the soil 's fertility .
expensive there are around 55 pulperies run by farmers groups in the northern and southern coffee growing areas of tanzania , all of which could benefit from bio-gas .
but with set-up costs of around $ 4,000 , few will be able to afford it .
the arabica coffee grown in kilimanjaro region is amongst the best in the world " we are happy to test this technology , " said mr urio , " but if we had to pay to set it up it would be very difficult for us , even though we understand that it would take only a few years to repay the initial investment from the money we save from not buying fuel . "
" rising fuel prices and the unstable nature of world coffee prices threaten to reduce farmers ' profits , " says seco 's emmanuel maliti .
" the bio-gas converter will help farmers to make more money from their coffee . "
the coffee farmers of leguruti are eagerly anticipating the beginning of the coffee harvesting season later in the year .
they are hoping that waste water may really prove to be a valuable commodity .

the star opened a centre funded by the charity she co-founded , which aims to feed and educate 32,000 orphans .
she also visited the orphanage where toddler david banda had lived , but her spokeswoman denied reports that she planned to adopt a second local child .
she has interim custody of the boy , with officials due to decide if she should be granted full adoption rights .
david joined her on the trip , which was madonna 's second in six months .
she and her film director husband guy ritchie first travelled there to sign official papers to take david into their care .
there were conflicting reports as to whether the 20-month-old met his biological father during the visit to the home of hope orphanage .
reuters quoted witnesses as saying that david had seen peasant farmer yohane banda , but the associated press said it was unclear whether such a meeting had taken place .
last year critics of madonna alleged that she had used her celebrity status to " fast-track " the adoption and get around malawian laws .
however , the singer strenuously denied that this was the case .

children under three should not watch any tv , psychologist dr aric sigman will argue at a westminster conference .

broadcasters say television is an easy scapegoat for society 's problems .
dr sigman wants parents to be given recommended daily tv amount guidelines by the government , as they are for salt , and said " screen media " was a major issue for public health .
he recommends that children under 12 watch no more than one hour a day and those between 12 and 15 watch a maximum of one-and-a-half hours .
dr sigman 's recommendations children under three : no screen exposure ages three to seven : 30 minutes to one hour per day ages seven to 12 : one hour per day ages 12 to 15 : one and-a-half hours a day ages 16 and over : two hours send us your comments he will voice his concerns at a children and the media conference , at the house of commons , later .

' nanny state ' studies have suggested excessive tv watching is linked to difficulty in sleeping , behavioural problems and increased obesity in children .
tam fry , from the national obesity forum , said : " in theory , the principle of a ban is terrific , but in practice we think it 's unworkable .
tv is a fact of life , but you can limit it and you should .
" there 's no doubt that children who watch tv do not exercise and they snack , mostly on foods that are high in fat , salt and sugar . "
dr sigman , who is an associate fellow of the british psychological society and member of the institute of biology , rejected claims setting down guidelines constituted creating a " nanny state " .
he said : " providing general guidance on whether infants should be watching television and how much time children should spend in front of the screen is hardly radical . "
there are plenty of studies that indicate the educational value of programmes for children " greg childs save kids ' tv campaign " screen media must now be considered a major public health issue and reducing television viewing must become the new priority for child health . "
he said most of the damage linked to television screen viewing seemed to occur beyond watching one to one-and-a-half hours per day , irrespective of the quality of the programme , while the average child watched three to five times this amount .
" parents need an ideal reference point , even if they choose to ignore it or can not adhere to it , " dr sigman added .
but greg childs , from the save kids ' tv campaign , insisted it was " unrealistic and unnecessary " to ban television for under threes , and instead efforts should focus on improving the quality of programmes .

the amount of time children spend watching television should be rationed to prevent health and learning problems , an expert is to tell mps .
children under three should not watch any tv , psychologist dr aric sigman will argue at a westminster conference .
he also believes there should not be any tv sets in children 's bedrooms and that new mothers should be warned of the dangers of excessive viewing .
broadcasters say television is an easy scapegoat for society 's problems .
dr sigman wants parents to be given recommended daily tv amount guidelines by the government , as they are for salt , and said " screen media " was a major issue for public health .
he recommends that children under 12 watch no more than one hour a day and those between 12 and 15 watch a maximum of one-and-a-half hours .
dr sigman 's recommendations children under three : no screen exposure ages three to seven : 30 minutes to one hour per day ages seven to 12 : one hour per day ages 12 to 15 : one and-a-half hours a day ages 16 and over : two hours send us your comments he will voice his concerns at a children and the media conference , at the house of commons , later .
the conference has been organised by mediawatch-uk and will be attended by health representatives and mps .
' nanny state ' studies have suggested excessive tv watching is linked to difficulty in sleeping , behavioural problems and increased obesity in children .
tam fry , from the national obesity forum , said : " in theory , the principle of a ban is terrific , but in practice we think it 's unworkable .
tv is a fact of life , but you can limit it and you should .
" there 's no doubt that children who watch tv do not exercise and they snack , mostly on foods that are high in fat , salt and sugar . "
dr sigman , who is an associate fellow of the british psychological society and member of the institute of biology , rejected claims setting down guidelines constituted creating a " nanny state " .
he said : " providing general guidance on whether infants should be watching television and how much time children should spend in front of the screen is hardly radical .
there are plenty of studies that indicate the educational value of programmes for children greg childs save kids ' tv campaign " screen media must now be considered a major public health issue and reducing television viewing must become the new priority for child health . "
he said most of the damage linked to television screen viewing seemed to occur beyond watching one to one-and-a-half hours per day , irrespective of the quality of the programme , while the average child watched three to five times this amount .
" parents need an ideal reference point , even if they choose to ignore it or can not adhere to it , " dr sigman added .
