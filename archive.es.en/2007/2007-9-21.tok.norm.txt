program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 21.09.2007 recalling the world 's first steps toward climate protection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the montreal protocol woke up the world to the threats of greenhouse gases the passage of the montreal ozone protocol 20 years ago was a milestone in international climate protection .
dw-world.de spoke to thomas bunge , a member of the german delegation , who was part of the historic event . thomas bunge represented germany 's federal environment agency in drawing up the " montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer " in september 1987 .
the lawyer is currently responsible for environment and spatial planning at the agency .
dw-world.de : why was the 1987 montreal protocol so significant ?
thomas bunge : that was the beginning of international regulations to protect the earth 's atmosphere .
until then , there was only regulation of long-range , transnational air pollution .
people tried for the first time to resolve a worldwide problem through international law , although in retrospect , the regulations then were certainly inadequate .
can you briefly explain why they were inadequate ?
the regulations agreed in 1987 were supposed to reduce the production and use of substances that damaged the ozone layer by a maximum of only up to 50 percent .
but people very quickly noticed that that was n't enough to effectively protect the ozone layer .
in 1990 , that is , a year after the regulations came into effect , the stipulations had already been tightened .
the decision was made to entirely discontinue production and use by the year 2000 .
in 1994 , the deadlines were again shortened .
thus people wanted , and still want , to relatively quickly achieve a full discontinuation of production , and also of use , of the substances .
it 's true that developing countries currently the still have the right to produce and use the substances in small amounts .
but relatively soon the use and the production will be discontinued worldwide .
can you describe how things came about ?
how is such a compromise reached ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bunge as is normally the case in the realm of international law , there are specific working groups for the individual application areas one aims to regulate .
the building blocks for such an international treaty are worked out in the groups .
the individual building blocks must then be voted on and approved in the plenum .
that is , as in all cases , a compromise between the interests that the individual states represent at these conferences , of course .
the whole thing was fleshed out with science and the scientific results available up until the signing in 1987 were included .
the interests of the individual states and the scientific results were then put in relation .
that led to a compromise with which one was at the time not particularly happy .
can you provide an example of a practical problem that had to be overcome ?
did particular countries block movement ?
it was several blocks of states .
the eu comprised its own negotiation block .
of course , that was significantly fewer states than today .
there was a so-called " toronto group " of states .
they represented the scandinavian states , canada , australia and switzerland .
this group with australia and new zealand , which would have been affected the soonest by the consequences of the hole in the ozone layer - and then was affected - wanted to pass very wide-reaching regulations .
on the other side , there was an array of industrial countries that produced these substances .
they were naturally interested in continuing production or being able to produce appropriate substitutes .
how was the atmosphere among the conference participants on sept .
16 , 1987 , when the protocol was passed ?
people were pleased that a compromise had been reached .
but we had already seen that the rules were n't sufficient for the next 20 , 30 , 40 years .
we recognized that the progressive states also had had to swallow some bitter pills .
but in retrospect , it was a success , of course , to very quickly bring very many countries on board on trade regulations that envisaged limitations on trade with countries that were n't party to the treaty .
in this way , one had a model for the negotiations on climate regulations that started relatively soon thereafter . interview : martin hoffmann -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 21.09.2007 recalling the world 's first steps toward climate protection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the montreal protocol woke up the world to the threats of greenhouse gases the passage of the montreal ozone protocol 20 years ago was a milestone in international climate protection .
dw-world.de spoke to thomas bunge , a member of the german delegation , who was part of the historic event . thomas bunge represented germany 's federal environment agency in drawing up the " montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer " in september 1987 .
the lawyer is currently responsible for environment and spatial planning at the agency .
dw-world.de : why was the 1987 montreal protocol so significant ?
thomas bunge : that was the beginning of international regulations to protect the earth 's atmosphere .
until then , there was only regulation of long-range , transnational air pollution .
people tried for the first time to resolve a worldwide problem through international law , although in retrospect , the regulations then were certainly inadequate .
can you briefly explain why they were inadequate ?
the regulations agreed in 1987 were supposed to reduce the production and use of substances that damaged the ozone layer by a maximum of only up to 50 percent .
but people very quickly noticed that that was n't enough to effectively protect the ozone layer .
in 1990 , that is , a year after the regulations came into effect , the stipulations had already been tightened .
the decision was made to entirely discontinue production and use by the year 2000 .
in 1994 , the deadlines were again shortened .
thus people wanted , and still want , to relatively quickly achieve a full discontinuation of production , and also of use , of the substances .
it 's true that developing countries currently the still have the right to produce and use the substances in small amounts .
but relatively soon the use and the production will be discontinued worldwide .
can you describe how things came about ?
how is such a compromise reached ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bunge as is normally the case in the realm of international law , there are specific working groups for the individual application areas one aims to regulate .
the building blocks for such an international treaty are worked out in the groups .
the individual building blocks must then be voted on and approved in the plenum .
that is , as in all cases , a compromise between the interests that the individual states represent at these conferences , of course .
the whole thing was fleshed out with science and the scientific results available up until the signing in 1987 were included .
the interests of the individual states and the scientific results were then put in relation .
that led to a compromise with which one was at the time not particularly happy .
can you provide an example of a practical problem that had to be overcome ?
did particular countries block movement ?
it was several blocks of states .
the eu comprised its own negotiation block .
of course , that was significantly fewer states than today .
there was a so-called " toronto group " of states .
they represented the scandinavian states , canada , australia and switzerland .
this group with australia and new zealand , which would have been affected the soonest by the consequences of the hole in the ozone layer - and then was affected - wanted to pass very wide-reaching regulations .

" iran is trying to obtain an atomic bomb , " sarkozy said in a prime-time television interview late thursday , sept .

" that is unacceptable and i tell the french people it is unacceptable . "
the five un security council permanent members and germany are meeting in washington , dc , on friday to discuss iran .
us president george w. bush has escalated rhetoric over iran in recent weeks .
ahead of the meeting , bush insisted that " the objective , of course , is to solve this peacefully . "
french foreign minister bernard kouchner will go to the white house to discuss the issue on friday .
kouchner recently warned that a war with iran was possible , but has since insisted the statement was misunderstood .
stronger sanctions necessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says it wants nuclear technology to provide energy while sarkozy distanced himself from the threat of going to war with iran , he emphasized the need for diplomatic sanctions .
the iranian nuclear question " is an extremely difficult affair , but france does not want a war , " sarkozy said .
at their friday meeting , britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states plan to discuss a third package of tighter un sanctions against iran if it does not suspend its uranium enrichment .
" how do we convince -lsb- iran -rsb- to renounce this project ? "
sarkozy asked .
" just as the international community convinced north korea and libya to renounce theirs : through discussion , through dialogue , through sanctions .
" if sanctions are not enough , i want stronger sanctions , " sarkozy added .

bush said he 's hopeful that iran can be convinced to peacefully give up its ambitions to develop a weapons program .
" it 's imperative that we continue to work in a multilateral fashion to send that message , " bush said .
" and one place to do so is at the united nations . "
the un security council has adopted sanctions against iran which include calling on countries to stop supplying iran with nuclear-related technology and freezing assets of many people and groups related to the nuclear program .
iranian arms exports have also been banned .
the iranian regime insists it is developing the technology to provide electricity and since sanctions started has increased its enrichment activities .
sarkozy wants european sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he wo n't be visiting ground zero a senior us official told the associated press news agency that the proposed new sanctions would require countries to inspect all cargo en route to or from iran as well as freeze assets of a number of iranian banks .
the official was interviewed this summer on condition of anonymity because the negotiations were still underway .
france wants the european union to also adopt sanctions against iran if the un security council does not pass new measures .
russia and china have been unwilling to take strong action .
french presidential spokesman david martinon suggested that the measures could include " recommendations " to european companies asking them " at the very least not to bid for new markets in iran , and for financial institutions to scale back their operations , to lower their investments . "
" we would like to obtain that from all eu countries , and we are not alone in wanting to do so , " martinon said .

" iran is trying to obtain an atomic bomb , " sarkozy said in a prime-time television interview late thursday , sept .
20 .
" that is unacceptable and i tell the french people it is unacceptable . "
the five un security council permanent members and germany are meeting in washington , dc , on friday to discuss iran .
us president george w. bush has escalated rhetoric over iran in recent weeks .
ahead of the meeting , bush insisted that " the objective , of course , is to solve this peacefully . "
french foreign minister bernard kouchner will go to the white house to discuss the issue on friday .
kouchner recently warned that a war with iran was possible , but has since insisted the statement was misunderstood .
stronger sanctions necessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says it wants nuclear technology to provide energy while sarkozy distanced himself from the threat of going to war with iran , he emphasized the need for diplomatic sanctions .
the iranian nuclear question " is an extremely difficult affair , but france does not want a war , " sarkozy said .
at their friday meeting , britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states plan to discuss a third package of tighter un sanctions against iran if it does not suspend its uranium enrichment .
" how do we convince -lsb- iran -rsb- to renounce this project ? "
sarkozy asked .
" just as the international community convinced north korea and libya to renounce theirs : through discussion , through dialogue , through sanctions .
" if sanctions are not enough , i want stronger sanctions , " sarkozy added .
leaders hope for a peaceful solution bildunterschrift : france is worried the un security council wo n't do enough since sarkozy 's election in may , france has taken an increasingly strong stand in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program , which many countries fear is an effort to build an atomic bomb .
sarkozy said he believes iran has a right to civilian nuclear technology .
bush said he 's hopeful that iran can be convinced to peacefully give up its ambitions to develop a weapons program .
" it 's imperative that we continue to work in a multilateral fashion to send that message , " bush said .
" and one place to do so is at the united nations . "
the un security council has adopted sanctions against iran which include calling on countries to stop supplying iran with nuclear-related technology and freezing assets of many people and groups related to the nuclear program .
iranian arms exports have also been banned .
the iranian regime insists it is developing the technology to provide electricity and since sanctions started has increased its enrichment activities .
sarkozy wants european sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he wo n't be visiting ground zero a senior us official told the associated press news agency that the proposed new sanctions would require countries to inspect all cargo en route to or from iran as well as freeze assets of a number of iranian banks .
the official was interviewed this summer on condition of anonymity because the negotiations were still underway .
france wants the european union to also adopt sanctions against iran if the un security council does not pass new measures .
russia and china have been unwilling to take strong action .
french presidential spokesman david martinon suggested that the measures could include " recommendations " to european companies asking them " at the very least not to bid for new markets in iran , and for financial institutions to scale back their operations , to lower their investments . "
" we would like to obtain that from all eu countries , and we are not alone in wanting to do so , " martinon said .
next week , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad will travel to new york to address the un general assembly .
the visit has sparked controversy in the us as the iranian leader is considered by washington to be an ally to islamic militants and iraqi insurgents .
ahmadinejad had asked to tour ground zero , the site of the sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 21.09.2007 combating child porn conference focuses on new technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : training police officers will be a focus of the conference the use of new technologies and better cross border co-operation is the focus of a conference aimed at combating the sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
dw-world.de spoke to the conference organizer . tim del vecchio is the organizer of the conference on improving law enforcement 's response to combat sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
he is a police affairs officer with the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- strategic police matters unit . dw world.de : what will be discussed at the conference ? tim del vecchio : we are going to address several technical issues - what kind of technology is out there so we can conduct our investigations more effectively , what type of police training is available at no cost and is also available to states that can not afford their own police training .
most of all we want to make partnerships with the private sector .
for example , microsoft , and visa europe are participating .
visa is talking about how they can work with the credit card companies more effectively .
internet service providers from various osce member states are going to talk about how the police can work better with internet service providers . our focus is going to on the offenders more than the victims .
we have an anti-trafficking unit at the osce that focuses on the victim issues , about the after-care , what kind of therapies are available and shelters that might be available for victims if we ca n't send them home .
our role is going to be to address the police and the prosecutors . what are the measures available to fight child pornography ? one of the first places we have to start looking at is domestic legislation .
last year , we were very much involved in helping the international center for missing and exploited children , through various focus groups throughout europe , where we were looking at what the legislation consisted of .
for example : was it illegal to possess child pornography ?
was it illegal in your country to distribute child pornography ?
once police officers and prosecutors have the laws in place , then we have the tools to do our job . there are several organs fighting this type of crime , like the child exploitation and online protection center in great britain .
what kind of co-operation do you have with other organizations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim del vecchio said everybody shares the blame for child porn the osce is not an operational police unit - we do n't conduct investigations .
we are primarily a political organization that facilitates co-operation .
we are going to have police officers from austria and belgium attending and even police officers from russia .
each one of them is going to present a case study that took place recently in their country and we are going to use these three case studies as an example . what kind of difficulties did you run into , how did you solve the problems .
what kind of difficulties do we have in common ?
it is kind of a " lessons learned " identification and we also hope to have examples of good practices out of this as well .
interpol and ceop are doing a fantastic job in fighting this crime .
the problem is that it is so pervasive , and we definitely want to increase cross-border co-operation .
we do n't want an investigation to stop just because it goes across the border . why were the case studies of belgium , austria and russia chosen ? they volunteered their services .
they took time out of their investigation .
austria had a high profile case last year and we thought it would be an example of best practice .
belgium also had some high profile cases . which new technologies are being presented at the conference ? microsoft is going to talk about the child exploitation tracking software .
they have developed this because the canadian police were having difficulties with investigations in this area .
one police officer in toronto wrote to microsoft and they responded by spending $ 2 million developing a special software that police can track down pedophiles that are using the internet .
we want to make our member states aware that this is free . what about facial recognition technology ? organizations like interpol are looking at child images like a photographic fingerprint .
even if you get older or change your appearance , this technology is still going to be able to tell if it is you or not .
for example , if a man grows a beard or puts on glasses , the software is so powerful that it is still going to recognize that it is you .
this is a very useful tool in child pornography investigations .
you can tell if you are looking at the same victim in different videos , or it might be the same victim , but older than in the other videos .
it is a very good way of identifying victims and rescuing them in some circumstances . who are the perpetrators of these crimes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the eu expands cross border co-operation becomes a major issue usually , it is men .
depending on what study you look at , you get different profiles .
but one of the things that we are very concerned about is that , when we do arrest people , we 're finding that the images in their possession are of very young children .
nineteen percent of the images of offenders were found to be of children less than five years old .
so this is not a case of people looking at pornographic pictures of people that are 16 or 17 years old , we are talking about very young children . how do you view the overall situation of child pornography on the internet in the world today ? everybody shares the blame .
in the usa , there was a husband-and-wife team that was distributing child pornography through the internet in texas but all of the images were coming from various countries in eastern europe .
these people were making over a million dollars a month .
this is a case where the investigation started in america , but there are several european countries involved .
the internet is so fast , it operates at the speed of light - it is very easy to work with people and other countries instantly . i think osce has recognized that organized crime in general is a very serious threat to all 56 member states .
the distribution of child pornography is only one way that organized crime makes money .
it is very lucrative , just like drugs and stolen automobiles and the traditional organized crime activities .
but this one , of course , has a very tragic human element that the other ones do n't . why have france , spain and the united states decided to fund the conference ? these delegations came to us after the ministerial decision -lrb- in december 2006 -rrb- .
the osce recognized this as a serious threat and they were very concerned about our member states having the capacity to combat it .
they thought that it is necessary to take action very fast so they gave us donations right away because otherwise we would have to wait for budgets or bureaucratic matters to get this thing off the ground .
the ministerial decision was in december 2006 and in february we were holding meetings with these delegations to discuss a way to combat this problem .

we do n't want an investigation to stop just because it goes across the border . why were the case studies of belgium , austria and russia chosen ? they volunteered their services .
they took time out of their investigation .
austria had a high profile case last year and we thought it would be an example of best practice .
belgium also had some high profile cases . which new technologies are being presented at the conference ? microsoft is going to talk about the child exploitation tracking software .
they have developed this because the canadian police were having difficulties with investigations in this area .
one police officer in toronto wrote to microsoft and they responded by spending $ 2 million developing a special software that police can track down pedophiles that are using the internet .
we want to make our member states aware that this is free . what about facial recognition technology ? organizations like interpol are looking at child images like a photographic fingerprint .
even if you get older or change your appearance , this technology is still going to be able to tell if it is you or not .
for example , if a man grows a beard or puts on glasses , the software is so powerful that it is still going to recognize that it is you .
this is a very useful tool in child pornography investigations .
you can tell if you are looking at the same victim in different videos , or it might be the same victim , but older than in the other videos .
it is a very good way of identifying victims and rescuing them in some circumstances . who are the perpetrators of these crimes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the eu expands cross border co-operation becomes a major issue usually , it is men .
depending on what study you look at , you get different profiles .
but one of the things that we are very concerned about is that , when we do arrest people , we 're finding that the images in their possession are of very young children .
nineteen percent of the images of offenders were found to be of children less than five years old .
so this is not a case of people looking at pornographic pictures of people that are 16 or 17 years old , we are talking about very young children . how do you view the overall situation of child pornography on the internet in the world today ? everybody shares the blame .
in the usa , there was a husband-and-wife team that was distributing child pornography through the internet in texas but all of the images were coming from various countries in eastern europe .
these people were making over a million dollars a month .
this is a case where the investigation started in america , but there are several european countries involved .
the internet is so fast , it operates at the speed of light - it is very easy to work with people and other countries instantly . i think osce has recognized that organized crime in general is a very serious threat to all 56 member states .
the distribution of child pornography is only one way that organized crime makes money .
it is very lucrative , just like drugs and stolen automobiles and the traditional organized crime activities .
but this one , of course , has a very tragic human element that the other ones do n't . why have france , spain and the united states decided to fund the conference ? these delegations came to us after the ministerial decision -lrb- in december 2006 -rrb- .
the osce recognized this as a serious threat and they were very concerned about our member states having the capacity to combat it .
they thought that it is necessary to take action very fast so they gave us donations right away because otherwise we would have to wait for budgets or bureaucratic matters to get this thing off the ground .
the ministerial decision was in december 2006 and in february we were holding meetings with these delegations to discuss a way to combat this problem .
we are very grateful for the donations . interview : renate krieger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" terrorism " is commonly - and especially since sept .
11 , 2001 , - defined and understood as an attempt by radical groups and individuals to achieve certain political aims by killing or hurting as many people as possible .
in view of the attacks in new york , madrid and london , this interpretation tends to be accepted without argument and the identity of the perpetrators is taken for granted - not only by george w. bush , but by western politicians everywhere .
osama bin laden , al qaeda , islamic jihad and similar names have long since become the embodiment of terror and terrorists .
at the same time , " terror " also means putting fear into an innocent civilian population and thus making it more receptive for the political demands that one is unable to implement any other way .

in this case , the " perpetrators " do n't come from the caves of afghanistan or the mountains along the pakistani border , but from near the black forest , rheingau or franconia .
and these " perpetrators " do n't operate from the underground , but rather as german political officials .
top politicians intimidate and frighten the germans with new visions of terror almost every day : with the danger of nuclear terror attacks , the danger that - like in manhattan - hijacked passenger airplanes could be piloted into big german cities .
or the danger that terrorists could come by boat and carry out attacks .
not to mention the danger that a seemingly incalculable mass of converts to islam has become a sort of terrorist fifth column .
the question is not if but when these grim visions will be realized claim -lsb- christian union -rsb- politicians such as interior minister wolfgang schäuble , his bavarian counterpart günther beckstein , or defense minister franz josef jung when they spread their prophecies of doom .
and thus recklessly spread fear and terror .

it appears to have more to do with the office than the individual to issue such warnings and to demand tightening existing laws and more power to the police as tried and tested antidotes .
it is , of course , politicians ' duty to contemplate ways to deal with possible dangers or how they could be avoided in the first place .
just as the security services - there are 38 such federal institutions in germany - naturally must contemplate those things and run through their eerie case scenarios .
the main difference is that the security services engage in these deliberations internally and not in the media .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 21.09.2007 germany paves way for first census in 20 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : statisticians think there may be over a million fewer people in germany germany 's parliament has cleared the way for the first census in decades .
the tally is n't expected to provoke storms of protest as it did in the past .
but it could show that there are fewer people in the country . the census will begin in 2011 , the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , decided on thursday , sept .
21 .
this time , though , officials wo n't be knocking on the doors of each and every one of the estimated 82 million german residents .
instead , they will focus their queries on around 6 million people as well as the country 's 17.5 million property owners .
they will be asked their place of birth , age , gender , nationality and marital status as well as questions about their household , working life and education .
germany 's current population statistics are extrapolations based on the last censuses .
the country 's statisticians think there may actually be 1.3 million fewer people living in germany in total and around half a million fewer foreigners than official calculations say .
the preparatory legislation on the census passed with the votes of the two government parties , the christian democrats and social democrats , in the bundestag , while the green party and the free-market liberal fdp abstained .
data protection czar unconcerned fdp politician sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former federal justice minister , said she and her colleagues thought the details of the census had not yet been adequately clarified .
" we do n't want to issue a carte blanche as long as these questions are still open , " the süddeutsche zeitung daily quoted her as saying .
the left party opposed the bill .
its domestic expert , jan korte , said the data collected would not be secure and that it was unclear how it would be used , according to the paper .
however , germany 's data protection czar , peter schaar , said the census plans were in line with the constitution and would not unnecessarily intrude on citizens ' privacy rights .
internet opens doors to census bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowadays people are less concerned about leaving a trace the last census took place in 1987 in west germany and in 1981 in east germany .
the west german census was accompanied by calls for boycott from people who were concerned the tally would lead the way to a surveillance state .
census takers were tasked with collected data from all german residents .
little resistance is expected this time around : with the widespread use of credit cards and the internet , germans generally find it acceptable to allow freer access to their personal data .
germany 's highest court has also ruled that informants ' family names must be deleted from the data as soon as possible .
all census information that could make residents recognizable must be erased when it is no longer needed by the statisticians .
berlin 's plans for a new census will ensure it complies with european union requirements .
both the eu and germany use population levels to determine the amount of subsidies regions receive as well as numbers of political representatives .
the census is expected to cost around 450 million euros -lrb- $ 630 million -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 21.09.2007 combating child porn conference focuses on new technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : training police officers will be a focus of the conference the use of new technologies and better cross border co-operation is the focus of a conference aimed at combating the sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
dw-world.de spoke to the conference organizer . tim del vecchio is the organizer of the conference on improving law enforcement 's response to combat sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
he is a police affairs officer with the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- strategic police matters unit . dw world.de : what will be discussed at the conference ? tim del vecchio : we are going to address several technical issues - what kind of technology is out there so we can conduct our investigations more effectively , what type of police training is available at no cost and is also available to states that can not afford their own police training .
most of all we want to make partnerships with the private sector .
for example , microsoft , and visa europe are participating .
visa is talking about how they can work with the credit card companies more effectively .
internet service providers from various osce member states are going to talk about how the police can work better with internet service providers . our focus is going to on the offenders more than the victims .
we have an anti-trafficking unit at the osce that focuses on the victim issues , about the after-care , what kind of therapies are available and shelters that might be available for victims if we ca n't send them home .
our role is going to be to address the police and the prosecutors . what are the measures available to fight child pornography ? one of the first places we have to start looking at is domestic legislation .
last year , we were very much involved in helping the international center for missing and exploited children , through various focus groups throughout europe , where we were looking at what the legislation consisted of .
for example : was it illegal to possess child pornography ?
was it illegal in your country to distribute child pornography ?
once police officers and prosecutors have the laws in place , then we have the tools to do our job . there are several organs fighting this type of crime , like the child exploitation and online protection center in great britain .
what kind of co-operation do you have with other organizations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim del vecchio said everybody shares the blame for child porn the osce is not an operational police unit - we do n't conduct investigations .
we are primarily a political organization that facilitates co-operation .
we are going to have police officers from austria and belgium attending and even police officers from russia .
each one of them is going to present a case study that took place recently in their country and we are going to use these three case studies as an example . what kind of difficulties did you run into , how did you solve the problems .
what kind of difficulties do we have in common ?
it is kind of a " lessons learned " identification and we also hope to have examples of good practices out of this as well .
interpol and ceop are doing a fantastic job in fighting this crime .
the problem is that it is so pervasive , and we definitely want to increase cross-border co-operation .
we do n't want an investigation to stop just because it goes across the border . why were the case studies of belgium , austria and russia chosen ? they volunteered their services .
they took time out of their investigation .
austria had a high profile case last year and we thought it would be an example of best practice .
belgium also had some high profile cases . which new technologies are being presented at the conference ? microsoft is going to talk about the child exploitation tracking software .
they have developed this because the canadian police were having difficulties with investigations in this area .
one police officer in toronto wrote to microsoft and they responded by spending $ 2 million developing a special software that police can track down pedophiles that are using the internet .
we want to make our member states aware that this is free . what about facial recognition technology ? organizations like interpol are looking at child images like a photographic fingerprint .
even if you get older or change your appearance , this technology is still going to be able to tell if it is you or not .
for example , if a man grows a beard or puts on glasses , the software is so powerful that it is still going to recognize that it is you .
this is a very useful tool in child pornography investigations .
you can tell if you are looking at the same victim in different videos , or it might be the same victim , but older than in the other videos .
it is a very good way of identifying victims and rescuing them in some circumstances . who are the perpetrators of these crimes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the eu expands cross border co-operation becomes a major issue usually , it is men .
depending on what study you look at , you get different profiles .
but one of the things that we are very concerned about is that , when we do arrest people , we 're finding that the images in their possession are of very young children .
nineteen percent of the images of offenders were found to be of children less than five years old .
so this is not a case of people looking at pornographic pictures of people that are 16 or 17 years old , we are talking about very young children . how do you view the overall situation of child pornography on the internet in the world today ? everybody shares the blame .
in the usa , there was a husband-and-wife team that was distributing child pornography through the internet in texas but all of the images were coming from various countries in eastern europe .
these people were making over a million dollars a month .
this is a case where the investigation started in america , but there are several european countries involved .
the internet is so fast , it operates at the speed of light - it is very easy to work with people and other countries instantly . i think osce has recognized that organized crime in general is a very serious threat to all 56 member states .
the distribution of child pornography is only one way that organized crime makes money .
it is very lucrative , just like drugs and stolen automobiles and the traditional organized crime activities .
but this one , of course , has a very tragic human element that the other ones do n't . why have france , spain and the united states decided to fund the conference ? these delegations came to us after the ministerial decision -lrb- in december 2006 -rrb- .
the osce recognized this as a serious threat and they were very concerned about our member states having the capacity to combat it .
they thought that it is necessary to take action very fast so they gave us donations right away because otherwise we would have to wait for budgets or bureaucratic matters to get this thing off the ground .
the ministerial decision was in december 2006 and in february we were holding meetings with these delegations to discuss a way to combat this problem .
we are very grateful for the donations . interview : renate krieger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to the conference organizer . tim del vecchio is the organizer of the conference on improving law enforcement 's response to combat sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
he is a police affairs officer with the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- strategic police matters unit . dw world.de : what will be discussed at the conference ? tim del vecchio : we are going to address several technical issues - what kind of technology is out there so we can conduct our investigations more effectively , what type of police training is available at no cost and is also available to states that can not afford their own police training .
most of all we want to make partnerships with the private sector .
for example , microsoft , and visa europe are participating .
visa is talking about how they can work with the credit card companies more effectively .
internet service providers from various osce member states are going to talk about how the police can work better with internet service providers . our focus is going to on the offenders more than the victims .
we have an anti-trafficking unit at the osce that focuses on the victim issues , about the after-care , what kind of therapies are available and shelters that might be available for victims if we ca n't send them home .
our role is going to be to address the police and the prosecutors . what are the measures available to fight child pornography ? one of the first places we have to start looking at is domestic legislation .
last year , we were very much involved in helping the international center for missing and exploited children , through various focus groups throughout europe , where we were looking at what the legislation consisted of .
for example : was it illegal to possess child pornography ?
was it illegal in your country to distribute child pornography ?
once police officers and prosecutors have the laws in place , then we have the tools to do our job . there are several organs fighting this type of crime , like the child exploitation and online protection center in great britain .
what kind of co-operation do you have with other organizations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim del vecchio said everybody shares the blame for child porn the osce is not an operational police unit - we do n't conduct investigations .
we are primarily a political organization that facilitates co-operation .
we are going to have police officers from austria and belgium attending and even police officers from russia .
each one of them is going to present a case study that took place recently in their country and we are going to use these three case studies as an example . what kind of difficulties did you run into , how did you solve the problems .
what kind of difficulties do we have in common ?
it is kind of a " lessons learned " identification and we also hope to have examples of good practices out of this as well .
interpol and ceop are doing a fantastic job in fighting this crime .
the problem is that it is so pervasive , and we definitely want to increase cross-border co-operation .
we do n't want an investigation to stop just because it goes across the border . why were the case studies of belgium , austria and russia chosen ? they volunteered their services .
they took time out of their investigation .
austria had a high profile case last year and we thought it would be an example of best practice .
belgium also had some high profile cases . which new technologies are being presented at the conference ? microsoft is going to talk about the child exploitation tracking software .
they have developed this because the canadian police were having difficulties with investigations in this area .
one police officer in toronto wrote to microsoft and they responded by spending $ 2 million developing a special software that police can track down pedophiles that are using the internet .
we want to make our member states aware that this is free . what about facial recognition technology ? organizations like interpol are looking at child images like a photographic fingerprint .
even if you get older or change your appearance , this technology is still going to be able to tell if it is you or not .
for example , if a man grows a beard or puts on glasses , the software is so powerful that it is still going to recognize that it is you .
this is a very useful tool in child pornography investigations .
you can tell if you are looking at the same victim in different videos , or it might be the same victim , but older than in the other videos .
it is a very good way of identifying victims and rescuing them in some circumstances . who are the perpetrators of these crimes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the eu expands cross border co-operation becomes a major issue usually , it is men .
depending on what study you look at , you get different profiles .
but one of the things that we are very concerned about is that , when we do arrest people , we 're finding that the images in their possession are of very young children .
nineteen percent of the images of offenders were found to be of children less than five years old .
so this is not a case of people looking at pornographic pictures of people that are 16 or 17 years old , we are talking about very young children . how do you view the overall situation of child pornography on the internet in the world today ? everybody shares the blame .
in the usa , there was a husband-and-wife team that was distributing child pornography through the internet in texas but all of the images were coming from various countries in eastern europe .
these people were making over a million dollars a month .
this is a case where the investigation started in america , but there are several european countries involved .
the internet is so fast , it operates at the speed of light - it is very easy to work with people and other countries instantly . i think osce has recognized that organized crime in general is a very serious threat to all 56 member states .
the distribution of child pornography is only one way that organized crime makes money .
it is very lucrative , just like drugs and stolen automobiles and the traditional organized crime activities .
but this one , of course , has a very tragic human element that the other ones do n't . why have france , spain and the united states decided to fund the conference ? these delegations came to us after the ministerial decision -lrb- in december 2006 -rrb- .
the osce recognized this as a serious threat and they were very concerned about our member states having the capacity to combat it .
they thought that it is necessary to take action very fast so they gave us donations right away because otherwise we would have to wait for budgets or bureaucratic matters to get this thing off the ground .
the ministerial decision was in december 2006 and in february we were holding meetings with these delegations to discuss a way to combat this problem .
we are very grateful for the donations . interview : renate krieger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

austria had a high profile case last year and we thought it would be an example of best practice .
belgium also had some high profile cases . which new technologies are being presented at the conference ? microsoft is going to talk about the child exploitation tracking software .
they have developed this because the canadian police were having difficulties with investigations in this area .
one police officer in toronto wrote to microsoft and they responded by spending $ 2 million developing a special software that police can track down pedophiles that are using the internet .
we want to make our member states aware that this is free . what about facial recognition technology ? organizations like interpol are looking at child images like a photographic fingerprint .
even if you get older or change your appearance , this technology is still going to be able to tell if it is you or not .
for example , if a man grows a beard or puts on glasses , the software is so powerful that it is still going to recognize that it is you .
this is a very useful tool in child pornography investigations .
you can tell if you are looking at the same victim in different videos , or it might be the same victim , but older than in the other videos .
it is a very good way of identifying victims and rescuing them in some circumstances . who are the perpetrators of these crimes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the eu expands cross border co-operation becomes a major issue usually , it is men .
depending on what study you look at , you get different profiles .
but one of the things that we are very concerned about is that , when we do arrest people , we 're finding that the images in their possession are of very young children .
nineteen percent of the images of offenders were found to be of children less than five years old .
so this is not a case of people looking at pornographic pictures of people that are 16 or 17 years old , we are talking about very young children . how do you view the overall situation of child pornography on the internet in the world today ? everybody shares the blame .
in the usa , there was a husband-and-wife team that was distributing child pornography through the internet in texas but all of the images were coming from various countries in eastern europe .
these people were making over a million dollars a month .
this is a case where the investigation started in america , but there are several european countries involved .
the internet is so fast , it operates at the speed of light - it is very easy to work with people and other countries instantly . i think osce has recognized that organized crime in general is a very serious threat to all 56 member states .
the distribution of child pornography is only one way that organized crime makes money .
it is very lucrative , just like drugs and stolen automobiles and the traditional organized crime activities .
but this one , of course , has a very tragic human element that the other ones do n't . why have france , spain and the united states decided to fund the conference ? these delegations came to us after the ministerial decision -lrb- in december 2006 -rrb- .
the osce recognized this as a serious threat and they were very concerned about our member states having the capacity to combat it .

dw-world.de spoke to the conference organizer . tim del vecchio is the organizer of the conference on improving law enforcement 's response to combat sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
he is a police affairs officer with the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- strategic police matters unit . dw world.de : what will be discussed at the conference ? tim del vecchio : we are going to address several technical issues - what kind of technology is out there so we can conduct our investigations more effectively , what type of police training is available at no cost and is also available to states that can not afford their own police training .
most of all we want to make partnerships with the private sector .
for example , microsoft , and visa europe are participating .
visa is talking about how they can work with the credit card companies more effectively .
internet service providers from various osce member states are going to talk about how the police can work better with internet service providers . our focus is going to on the offenders more than the victims .
we have an anti-trafficking unit at the osce that focuses on the victim issues , about the after-care , what kind of therapies are available and shelters that might be available for victims if we ca n't send them home .
our role is going to be to address the police and the prosecutors . what are the measures available to fight child pornography ? one of the first places we have to start looking at is domestic legislation .
last year , we were very much involved in helping the international center for missing and exploited children , through various focus groups throughout europe , where we were looking at what the legislation consisted of .
for example : was it illegal to possess child pornography ?
was it illegal in your country to distribute child pornography ?
once police officers and prosecutors have the laws in place , then we have the tools to do our job . there are several organs fighting this type of crime , like the child exploitation and online protection center in great britain .
what kind of co-operation do you have with other organizations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim del vecchio said everybody shares the blame for child porn the osce is not an operational police unit - we do n't conduct investigations .
we are primarily a political organization that facilitates co-operation .
we are going to have police officers from austria and belgium attending and even police officers from russia .
each one of them is going to present a case study that took place recently in their country and we are going to use these three case studies as an example . what kind of difficulties did you run into , how did you solve the problems .
what kind of difficulties do we have in common ?
it is kind of a " lessons learned " identification and we also hope to have examples of good practices out of this as well .
interpol and ceop are doing a fantastic job in fighting this crime .
the problem is that it is so pervasive , and we definitely want to increase cross-border co-operation .
we do n't want an investigation to stop just because it goes across the border . why were the case studies of belgium , austria and russia chosen ? they volunteered their services .
they took time out of their investigation .
austria had a high profile case last year and we thought it would be an example of best practice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 21.09.2007 opinion : german politicians create terror as they warn of it großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with their alarmist comments to the media about impending terror attacks , interior minister schäuble and other german politicians are spreading fear and terror , says peter philipp . " terrorism " is commonly - and especially since sept .
11 , 2001 , - defined and understood as an attempt by radical groups and individuals to achieve certain political aims by killing or hurting as many people as possible .
in view of the attacks in new york , madrid and london , this interpretation tends to be accepted without argument and the identity of the perpetrators is taken for granted - not only by george w. bush , but by western politicians everywhere .
osama bin laden , al qaeda , islamic jihad and similar names have long since become the embodiment of terror and terrorists .
at the same time , " terror " also means putting fear into an innocent civilian population and thus making it more receptive for the political demands that one is unable to implement any other way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp and that is exactly what we have been experiencing in germany nearly every day .
in this case , the " perpetrators " do n't come from the caves of afghanistan or the mountains along the pakistani border , but from near the black forest , rheingau or franconia .
and these " perpetrators " do n't operate from the underground , but rather as german political officials .
top politicians intimidate and frighten the germans with new visions of terror almost every day : with the danger of nuclear terror attacks , the danger that - like in manhattan - hijacked passenger airplanes could be piloted into big german cities .
or the danger that terrorists could come by boat and carry out attacks .
not to mention the danger that a seemingly incalculable mass of converts to islam has become a sort of terrorist fifth column .
the question is not if but when these grim visions will be realized claim -lsb- christian union -rsb- politicians such as interior minister wolfgang schäuble , his bavarian counterpart günther beckstein , or defense minister franz josef jung when they spread their prophecies of doom .
and thus recklessly spread fear and terror .
by now , even the union 's social democratic coalition partners in berlin take exception to it , although in the previous government it was one of them who , as federal interior minister , demanded " law and order . "
it appears to have more to do with the office than the individual to issue such warnings and to demand tightening existing laws and more power to the police as tried and tested antidotes .
it is , of course , politicians ' duty to contemplate ways to deal with possible dangers or how they could be avoided in the first place .
just as the security services - there are 38 such federal institutions in germany - naturally must contemplate those things and run through their eerie case scenarios .
the main difference is that the security services engage in these deliberations internally and not in the media .
such discussions do n't belong in public .
if they continue to be carried on there , " al qaeda " becomes superfluous .

dw-world.de political wrangling at heart of german terror debate , critics say the german defense minister 's comments about shooting down hijacked planes set off a burst of political squabbling .
but the debate raises important issues , even if it 's motivated by political maneuvering , observers say .
-lrb- 17.09.2007 -rrb- terror case throws spotlight on german converts to islam two of the men held in connection with a plot to bomb us military installations and other targets in germany are converts to islam .
it has raised the question of whether converts are more likely to become radicalized .
-lrb- 11.09.2007 -rrb- debate on terror in germany highlights political divisions just days after german security forces thwarted a " massive " terror attack , the country 's state interior ministers met to discuss the current terrorist threat .
however , divisions remained on a number of issues .

the tally is n't expected to provoke storms of protest as it did in the past .
but it could show that there are fewer people in the country . the census will begin in 2011 , the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , decided on thursday , sept .
21 .
this time , though , officials wo n't be knocking on the doors of each and every one of the estimated 82 million german residents .
instead , they will focus their queries on around 6 million people as well as the country 's 17.5 million property owners .
they will be asked their place of birth , age , gender , nationality and marital status as well as questions about their household , working life and education .
germany 's current population statistics are extrapolations based on the last censuses .
the country 's statisticians think there may actually be 1.3 million fewer people living in germany in total and around half a million fewer foreigners than official calculations say .
the preparatory legislation on the census passed with the votes of the two government parties , the christian democrats and social democrats , in the bundestag , while the green party and the free-market liberal fdp abstained .
data protection czar unconcerned fdp politician sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former federal justice minister , said she and her colleagues thought the details of the census had not yet been adequately clarified .
" we do n't want to issue a carte blanche as long as these questions are still open , " the süddeutsche zeitung daily quoted her as saying .
the left party opposed the bill .
its domestic expert , jan korte , said the data collected would not be secure and that it was unclear how it would be used , according to the paper .
however , germany 's data protection czar , peter schaar , said the census plans were in line with the constitution and would not unnecessarily intrude on citizens ' privacy rights .
internet opens doors to census bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowadays people are less concerned about leaving a trace the last census took place in 1987 in west germany and in 1981 in east germany .
the west german census was accompanied by calls for boycott from people who were concerned the tally would lead the way to a surveillance state .
census takers were tasked with collected data from all german residents .
little resistance is expected this time around : with the widespread use of credit cards and the internet , germans generally find it acceptable to allow freer access to their personal data .
germany 's highest court has also ruled that informants ' family names must be deleted from the data as soon as possible .
all census information that could make residents recognizable must be erased when it is no longer needed by the statisticians .
berlin 's plans for a new census will ensure it complies with european union requirements .
both the eu and germany use population levels to determine the amount of subsidies regions receive as well as numbers of political representatives .
the census is expected to cost around 450 million euros -lrb- $ 630 million -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 21.09.2007 recalling the world 's first steps toward climate protection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the montreal protocol woke up the world to the threats of greenhouse gases the passage of the montreal ozone protocol 20 years ago was a milestone in international climate protection .
dw-world.de spoke to thomas bunge , a member of the german delegation , who was part of the historic event . thomas bunge represented germany 's federal environment agency in drawing up the " montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer " in september 1987 .
the lawyer is currently responsible for environment and spatial planning at the agency .
dw-world.de : why was the 1987 montreal protocol so significant ?
thomas bunge : that was the beginning of international regulations to protect the earth 's atmosphere .
until then , there was only regulation of long-range , transnational air pollution .
people tried for the first time to resolve a worldwide problem through international law , although in retrospect , the regulations then were certainly inadequate .
can you briefly explain why they were inadequate ?
the regulations agreed in 1987 were supposed to reduce the production and use of substances that damaged the ozone layer by a maximum of only up to 50 percent .
but people very quickly noticed that that was n't enough to effectively protect the ozone layer .
in 1990 , that is , a year after the regulations came into effect , the stipulations had already been tightened .
the decision was made to entirely discontinue production and use by the year 2000 .
in 1994 , the deadlines were again shortened .
thus people wanted , and still want , to relatively quickly achieve a full discontinuation of production , and also of use , of the substances .
it 's true that developing countries currently the still have the right to produce and use the substances in small amounts .
but relatively soon the use and the production will be discontinued worldwide .
can you describe how things came about ?
how is such a compromise reached ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bunge as is normally the case in the realm of international law , there are specific working groups for the individual application areas one aims to regulate .
the building blocks for such an international treaty are worked out in the groups .
the individual building blocks must then be voted on and approved in the plenum .
that is , as in all cases , a compromise between the interests that the individual states represent at these conferences , of course .
the whole thing was fleshed out with science and the scientific results available up until the signing in 1987 were included .
the interests of the individual states and the scientific results were then put in relation .
that led to a compromise with which one was at the time not particularly happy .
can you provide an example of a practical problem that had to be overcome ?
did particular countries block movement ?
it was several blocks of states .
the eu comprised its own negotiation block .
of course , that was significantly fewer states than today .
there was a so-called " toronto group " of states .
they represented the scandinavian states , canada , australia and switzerland .
this group with australia and new zealand , which would have been affected the soonest by the consequences of the hole in the ozone layer - and then was affected - wanted to pass very wide-reaching regulations .
on the other side , there was an array of industrial countries that produced these substances .
they were naturally interested in continuing production or being able to produce appropriate substitutes .
how was the atmosphere among the conference participants on sept .
16 , 1987 , when the protocol was passed ?
people were pleased that a compromise had been reached .
but we had already seen that the rules were n't sufficient for the next 20 , 30 , 40 years .
we recognized that the progressive states also had had to swallow some bitter pills .
but in retrospect , it was a success , of course , to very quickly bring very many countries on board on trade regulations that envisaged limitations on trade with countries that were n't party to the treaty .
in this way , one had a model for the negotiations on climate regulations that started relatively soon thereafter . interview : martin hoffmann -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 21.09.2007 recalling the world 's first steps toward climate protection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the montreal protocol woke up the world to the threats of greenhouse gases the passage of the montreal ozone protocol 20 years ago was a milestone in international climate protection .
dw-world.de spoke to thomas bunge , a member of the german delegation , who was part of the historic event . thomas bunge represented germany 's federal environment agency in drawing up the " montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer " in september 1987 .
the lawyer is currently responsible for environment and spatial planning at the agency .
dw-world.de : why was the 1987 montreal protocol so significant ?
thomas bunge : that was the beginning of international regulations to protect the earth 's atmosphere .
until then , there was only regulation of long-range , transnational air pollution .
people tried for the first time to resolve a worldwide problem through international law , although in retrospect , the regulations then were certainly inadequate .
can you briefly explain why they were inadequate ?
the regulations agreed in 1987 were supposed to reduce the production and use of substances that damaged the ozone layer by a maximum of only up to 50 percent .
but people very quickly noticed that that was n't enough to effectively protect the ozone layer .
in 1990 , that is , a year after the regulations came into effect , the stipulations had already been tightened .
the decision was made to entirely discontinue production and use by the year 2000 .
in 1994 , the deadlines were again shortened .
thus people wanted , and still want , to relatively quickly achieve a full discontinuation of production , and also of use , of the substances .
it 's true that developing countries currently the still have the right to produce and use the substances in small amounts .
but relatively soon the use and the production will be discontinued worldwide .
can you describe how things came about ?
how is such a compromise reached ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bunge as is normally the case in the realm of international law , there are specific working groups for the individual application areas one aims to regulate .
the building blocks for such an international treaty are worked out in the groups .
the individual building blocks must then be voted on and approved in the plenum .
that is , as in all cases , a compromise between the interests that the individual states represent at these conferences , of course .
the whole thing was fleshed out with science and the scientific results available up until the signing in 1987 were included .
the interests of the individual states and the scientific results were then put in relation .
that led to a compromise with which one was at the time not particularly happy .
can you provide an example of a practical problem that had to be overcome ?
did particular countries block movement ?
it was several blocks of states .
the eu comprised its own negotiation block .
of course , that was significantly fewer states than today .
there was a so-called " toronto group " of states .
they represented the scandinavian states , canada , australia and switzerland .
this group with australia and new zealand , which would have been affected the soonest by the consequences of the hole in the ozone layer - and then was affected - wanted to pass very wide-reaching regulations .
on the other side , there was an array of industrial countries that produced these substances .
they were naturally interested in continuing production or being able to produce appropriate substitutes .
how was the atmosphere among the conference participants on sept .
16 , 1987 , when the protocol was passed ?
people were pleased that a compromise had been reached .
but we had already seen that the rules were n't sufficient for the next 20 , 30 , 40 years .
we recognized that the progressive states also had had to swallow some bitter pills .
but in retrospect , it was a success , of course , to very quickly bring very many countries on board on trade regulations that envisaged limitations on trade with countries that were n't party to the treaty .
in this way , one had a model for the negotiations on climate regulations that started relatively soon thereafter . interview : martin hoffmann -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" iran is trying to obtain an atomic bomb , " sarkozy said in a prime-time television interview late thursday , sept .
20 .
" that is unacceptable and i tell the french people it is unacceptable . "
the five un security council permanent members and germany are meeting in washington , dc , on friday to discuss iran .
us president george w. bush has escalated rhetoric over iran in recent weeks .
ahead of the meeting , bush insisted that " the objective , of course , is to solve this peacefully . "
french foreign minister bernard kouchner will go to the white house to discuss the issue on friday .
kouchner recently warned that a war with iran was possible , but has since insisted the statement was misunderstood .
stronger sanctions necessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says it wants nuclear technology to provide energy while sarkozy distanced himself from the threat of going to war with iran , he emphasized the need for diplomatic sanctions .
the iranian nuclear question " is an extremely difficult affair , but france does not want a war , " sarkozy said .
at their friday meeting , britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states plan to discuss a third package of tighter un sanctions against iran if it does not suspend its uranium enrichment .
" how do we convince -lsb- iran -rsb- to renounce this project ? "
sarkozy asked .
" just as the international community convinced north korea and libya to renounce theirs : through discussion , through dialogue , through sanctions .
" if sanctions are not enough , i want stronger sanctions , " sarkozy added .
leaders hope for a peaceful solution bildunterschrift : france is worried the un security council wo n't do enough since sarkozy 's election in may , france has taken an increasingly strong stand in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program , which many countries fear is an effort to build an atomic bomb .
sarkozy said he believes iran has a right to civilian nuclear technology .
bush said he 's hopeful that iran can be convinced to peacefully give up its ambitions to develop a weapons program .
" it 's imperative that we continue to work in a multilateral fashion to send that message , " bush said .
" and one place to do so is at the united nations . "
the un security council has adopted sanctions against iran which include calling on countries to stop supplying iran with nuclear-related technology and freezing assets of many people and groups related to the nuclear program .
iranian arms exports have also been banned .
the iranian regime insists it is developing the technology to provide electricity and since sanctions started has increased its enrichment activities .
sarkozy wants european sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he wo n't be visiting ground zero a senior us official told the associated press news agency that the proposed new sanctions would require countries to inspect all cargo en route to or from iran as well as freeze assets of a number of iranian banks .
the official was interviewed this summer on condition of anonymity because the negotiations were still underway .
france wants the european union to also adopt sanctions against iran if the un security council does not pass new measures .
russia and china have been unwilling to take strong action .
french presidential spokesman david martinon suggested that the measures could include " recommendations " to european companies asking them " at the very least not to bid for new markets in iran , and for financial institutions to scale back their operations , to lower their investments . "
" we would like to obtain that from all eu countries , and we are not alone in wanting to do so , " martinon said .
next week , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad will travel to new york to address the un general assembly .
the visit has sparked controversy in the us as the iranian leader is considered by washington to be an ally to islamic militants and iraqi insurgents .
ahmadinejad had asked to tour ground zero , the site of the sept .

dw-world.de spoke to thomas bunge , a member of the german delegation , who was part of the historic event . thomas bunge represented germany 's federal environment agency in drawing up the " montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer " in september 1987 .
the lawyer is currently responsible for environment and spatial planning at the agency .
dw-world.de : why was the 1987 montreal protocol so significant ?
thomas bunge : that was the beginning of international regulations to protect the earth 's atmosphere .
until then , there was only regulation of long-range , transnational air pollution .
people tried for the first time to resolve a worldwide problem through international law , although in retrospect , the regulations then were certainly inadequate .
can you briefly explain why they were inadequate ?
the regulations agreed in 1987 were supposed to reduce the production and use of substances that damaged the ozone layer by a maximum of only up to 50 percent .
but people very quickly noticed that that was n't enough to effectively protect the ozone layer .
in 1990 , that is , a year after the regulations came into effect , the stipulations had already been tightened .
the decision was made to entirely discontinue production and use by the year 2000 .
in 1994 , the deadlines were again shortened .
thus people wanted , and still want , to relatively quickly achieve a full discontinuation of production , and also of use , of the substances .
it 's true that developing countries currently the still have the right to produce and use the substances in small amounts .
but relatively soon the use and the production will be discontinued worldwide .
can you describe how things came about ?
how is such a compromise reached ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bunge as is normally the case in the realm of international law , there are specific working groups for the individual application areas one aims to regulate .
the building blocks for such an international treaty are worked out in the groups .
the individual building blocks must then be voted on and approved in the plenum .
that is , as in all cases , a compromise between the interests that the individual states represent at these conferences , of course .
the whole thing was fleshed out with science and the scientific results available up until the signing in 1987 were included .
the interests of the individual states and the scientific results were then put in relation .
that led to a compromise with which one was at the time not particularly happy .
can you provide an example of a practical problem that had to be overcome ?
did particular countries block movement ?
it was several blocks of states .
the eu comprised its own negotiation block .
of course , that was significantly fewer states than today .
there was a so-called " toronto group " of states .
they represented the scandinavian states , canada , australia and switzerland .
this group with australia and new zealand , which would have been affected the soonest by the consequences of the hole in the ozone layer - and then was affected - wanted to pass very wide-reaching regulations .
on the other side , there was an array of industrial countries that produced these substances .
they were naturally interested in continuing production or being able to produce appropriate substitutes .
how was the atmosphere among the conference participants on sept .
16 , 1987 , when the protocol was passed ?
people were pleased that a compromise had been reached .
but we had already seen that the rules were n't sufficient for the next 20 , 30 , 40 years .
we recognized that the progressive states also had had to swallow some bitter pills .
but in retrospect , it was a success , of course , to very quickly bring very many countries on board on trade regulations that envisaged limitations on trade with countries that were n't party to the treaty .
in this way , one had a model for the negotiations on climate regulations that started relatively soon thereafter . interview : martin hoffmann -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the lawyer is currently responsible for environment and spatial planning at the agency .
dw-world.de : why was the 1987 montreal protocol so significant ?
thomas bunge : that was the beginning of international regulations to protect the earth 's atmosphere .
until then , there was only regulation of long-range , transnational air pollution .
people tried for the first time to resolve a worldwide problem through international law , although in retrospect , the regulations then were certainly inadequate .
can you briefly explain why they were inadequate ?
the regulations agreed in 1987 were supposed to reduce the production and use of substances that damaged the ozone layer by a maximum of only up to 50 percent .
but people very quickly noticed that that was n't enough to effectively protect the ozone layer .
in 1990 , that is , a year after the regulations came into effect , the stipulations had already been tightened .
the decision was made to entirely discontinue production and use by the year 2000 .
in 1994 , the deadlines were again shortened .
thus people wanted , and still want , to relatively quickly achieve a full discontinuation of production , and also of use , of the substances .
it 's true that developing countries currently the still have the right to produce and use the substances in small amounts .
but relatively soon the use and the production will be discontinued worldwide .
can you describe how things came about ?
how is such a compromise reached ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bunge as is normally the case in the realm of international law , there are specific working groups for the individual application areas one aims to regulate .
the building blocks for such an international treaty are worked out in the groups .
the individual building blocks must then be voted on and approved in the plenum .
that is , as in all cases , a compromise between the interests that the individual states represent at these conferences , of course .
the whole thing was fleshed out with science and the scientific results available up until the signing in 1987 were included .
the interests of the individual states and the scientific results were then put in relation .
that led to a compromise with which one was at the time not particularly happy .
can you provide an example of a practical problem that had to be overcome ?
did particular countries block movement ?
it was several blocks of states .
the eu comprised its own negotiation block .
of course , that was significantly fewer states than today .
there was a so-called " toronto group " of states .
they represented the scandinavian states , canada , australia and switzerland .
this group with australia and new zealand , which would have been affected the soonest by the consequences of the hole in the ozone layer - and then was affected - wanted to pass very wide-reaching regulations .
on the other side , there was an array of industrial countries that produced these substances .
they were naturally interested in continuing production or being able to produce appropriate substitutes .
how was the atmosphere among the conference participants on sept .
16 , 1987 , when the protocol was passed ?
people were pleased that a compromise had been reached .
but we had already seen that the rules were n't sufficient for the next 20 , 30 , 40 years .
we recognized that the progressive states also had had to swallow some bitter pills .
but in retrospect , it was a success , of course , to very quickly bring very many countries on board on trade regulations that envisaged limitations on trade with countries that were n't party to the treaty .
in this way , one had a model for the negotiations on climate regulations that started relatively soon thereafter . interview : martin hoffmann -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 21.09.2007 combating child porn conference focuses on new technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : training police officers will be a focus of the conference the use of new technologies and better cross border co-operation is the focus of a conference aimed at combating the sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
dw-world.de spoke to the conference organizer . tim del vecchio is the organizer of the conference on improving law enforcement 's response to combat sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
he is a police affairs officer with the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- strategic police matters unit . dw world.de : what will be discussed at the conference ? tim del vecchio : we are going to address several technical issues - what kind of technology is out there so we can conduct our investigations more effectively , what type of police training is available at no cost and is also available to states that can not afford their own police training .
most of all we want to make partnerships with the private sector .
for example , microsoft , and visa europe are participating .
visa is talking about how they can work with the credit card companies more effectively .
internet service providers from various osce member states are going to talk about how the police can work better with internet service providers . our focus is going to on the offenders more than the victims .
we have an anti-trafficking unit at the osce that focuses on the victim issues , about the after-care , what kind of therapies are available and shelters that might be available for victims if we ca n't send them home .
our role is going to be to address the police and the prosecutors . what are the measures available to fight child pornography ? one of the first places we have to start looking at is domestic legislation .
last year , we were very much involved in helping the international center for missing and exploited children , through various focus groups throughout europe , where we were looking at what the legislation consisted of .
for example : was it illegal to possess child pornography ?
was it illegal in your country to distribute child pornography ?
once police officers and prosecutors have the laws in place , then we have the tools to do our job . there are several organs fighting this type of crime , like the child exploitation and online protection center in great britain .
what kind of co-operation do you have with other organizations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim del vecchio said everybody shares the blame for child porn the osce is not an operational police unit - we do n't conduct investigations .
we are primarily a political organization that facilitates co-operation .
we are going to have police officers from austria and belgium attending and even police officers from russia .
each one of them is going to present a case study that took place recently in their country and we are going to use these three case studies as an example . what kind of difficulties did you run into , how did you solve the problems .
what kind of difficulties do we have in common ?
it is kind of a " lessons learned " identification and we also hope to have examples of good practices out of this as well .
interpol and ceop are doing a fantastic job in fighting this crime .
the problem is that it is so pervasive , and we definitely want to increase cross-border co-operation .
we do n't want an investigation to stop just because it goes across the border . why were the case studies of belgium , austria and russia chosen ? they volunteered their services .
they took time out of their investigation .
austria had a high profile case last year and we thought it would be an example of best practice .
belgium also had some high profile cases . which new technologies are being presented at the conference ? microsoft is going to talk about the child exploitation tracking software .
they have developed this because the canadian police were having difficulties with investigations in this area .
one police officer in toronto wrote to microsoft and they responded by spending $ 2 million developing a special software that police can track down pedophiles that are using the internet .
we want to make our member states aware that this is free . what about facial recognition technology ? organizations like interpol are looking at child images like a photographic fingerprint .
even if you get older or change your appearance , this technology is still going to be able to tell if it is you or not .
for example , if a man grows a beard or puts on glasses , the software is so powerful that it is still going to recognize that it is you .
this is a very useful tool in child pornography investigations .
you can tell if you are looking at the same victim in different videos , or it might be the same victim , but older than in the other videos .
it is a very good way of identifying victims and rescuing them in some circumstances . who are the perpetrators of these crimes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the eu expands cross border co-operation becomes a major issue usually , it is men .
depending on what study you look at , you get different profiles .
but one of the things that we are very concerned about is that , when we do arrest people , we 're finding that the images in their possession are of very young children .
nineteen percent of the images of offenders were found to be of children less than five years old .
so this is not a case of people looking at pornographic pictures of people that are 16 or 17 years old , we are talking about very young children . how do you view the overall situation of child pornography on the internet in the world today ? everybody shares the blame .
in the usa , there was a husband-and-wife team that was distributing child pornography through the internet in texas but all of the images were coming from various countries in eastern europe .
these people were making over a million dollars a month .
this is a case where the investigation started in america , but there are several european countries involved .
the internet is so fast , it operates at the speed of light - it is very easy to work with people and other countries instantly . i think osce has recognized that organized crime in general is a very serious threat to all 56 member states .
the distribution of child pornography is only one way that organized crime makes money .
it is very lucrative , just like drugs and stolen automobiles and the traditional organized crime activities .
but this one , of course , has a very tragic human element that the other ones do n't . why have france , spain and the united states decided to fund the conference ? these delegations came to us after the ministerial decision -lrb- in december 2006 -rrb- .
the osce recognized this as a serious threat and they were very concerned about our member states having the capacity to combat it .
they thought that it is necessary to take action very fast so they gave us donations right away because otherwise we would have to wait for budgets or bureaucratic matters to get this thing off the ground .
the ministerial decision was in december 2006 and in february we were holding meetings with these delegations to discuss a way to combat this problem .

the un security council has adopted sanctions against iran which include calling on countries to stop supplying iran with nuclear-related technology and freezing assets of many people and groups related to the nuclear program .

the official was interviewed this summer on condition of anonymity because the negotiations were still underway .
france wants the european union to also adopt sanctions against iran if the un security council does not pass new measures .
russia and china have been unwilling to take strong action .
french presidential spokesman david martinon suggested that the measures could include " recommendations " to european companies asking them " at the very least not to bid for new markets in iran , and for financial institutions to scale back their operations , to lower their investments . "
" we would like to obtain that from all eu countries , and we are not alone in wanting to do so , " martinon said .

the tally is n't expected to provoke storms of protest as it did in the past .
but it could show that there are fewer people in the country . the census will begin in 2011 , the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , decided on thursday , sept .
21 .
this time , though , officials wo n't be knocking on the doors of each and every one of the estimated 82 million german residents .
instead , they will focus their queries on around 6 million people as well as the country 's 17.5 million property owners .
they will be asked their place of birth , age , gender , nationality and marital status as well as questions about their household , working life and education .
germany 's current population statistics are extrapolations based on the last censuses .
the country 's statisticians think there may actually be 1.3 million fewer people living in germany in total and around half a million fewer foreigners than official calculations say .
the preparatory legislation on the census passed with the votes of the two government parties , the christian democrats and social democrats , in the bundestag , while the green party and the free-market liberal fdp abstained .
data protection czar unconcerned fdp politician sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former federal justice minister , said she and her colleagues thought the details of the census had not yet been adequately clarified .
" we do n't want to issue a carte blanche as long as these questions are still open , " the süddeutsche zeitung daily quoted her as saying .
the left party opposed the bill .
its domestic expert , jan korte , said the data collected would not be secure and that it was unclear how it would be used , according to the paper .
however , germany 's data protection czar , peter schaar , said the census plans were in line with the constitution and would not unnecessarily intrude on citizens ' privacy rights .
internet opens doors to census bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowadays people are less concerned about leaving a trace the last census took place in 1987 in west germany and in 1981 in east germany .
the west german census was accompanied by calls for boycott from people who were concerned the tally would lead the way to a surveillance state .
census takers were tasked with collected data from all german residents .
little resistance is expected this time around : with the widespread use of credit cards and the internet , germans generally find it acceptable to allow freer access to their personal data .
germany 's highest court has also ruled that informants ' family names must be deleted from the data as soon as possible .
all census information that could make residents recognizable must be erased when it is no longer needed by the statisticians .
berlin 's plans for a new census will ensure it complies with european union requirements .
both the eu and germany use population levels to determine the amount of subsidies regions receive as well as numbers of political representatives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 21.09.2007 opinion : german politicians create terror as they warn of it großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with their alarmist comments to the media about impending terror attacks , interior minister schäuble and other german politicians are spreading fear and terror , says peter philipp . " terrorism " is commonly - and especially since sept .
11 , 2001 , - defined and understood as an attempt by radical groups and individuals to achieve certain political aims by killing or hurting as many people as possible .
in view of the attacks in new york , madrid and london , this interpretation tends to be accepted without argument and the identity of the perpetrators is taken for granted - not only by george w. bush , but by western politicians everywhere .
osama bin laden , al qaeda , islamic jihad and similar names have long since become the embodiment of terror and terrorists .
at the same time , " terror " also means putting fear into an innocent civilian population and thus making it more receptive for the political demands that one is unable to implement any other way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp and that is exactly what we have been experiencing in germany nearly every day .
in this case , the " perpetrators " do n't come from the caves of afghanistan or the mountains along the pakistani border , but from near the black forest , rheingau or franconia .
and these " perpetrators " do n't operate from the underground , but rather as german political officials .
top politicians intimidate and frighten the germans with new visions of terror almost every day : with the danger of nuclear terror attacks , the danger that - like in manhattan - hijacked passenger airplanes could be piloted into big german cities .
or the danger that terrorists could come by boat and carry out attacks .
not to mention the danger that a seemingly incalculable mass of converts to islam has become a sort of terrorist fifth column .
the question is not if but when these grim visions will be realized claim -lsb- christian union -rsb- politicians such as interior minister wolfgang schäuble , his bavarian counterpart günther beckstein , or defense minister franz josef jung when they spread their prophecies of doom .
and thus recklessly spread fear and terror .
by now , even the union 's social democratic coalition partners in berlin take exception to it , although in the previous government it was one of them who , as federal interior minister , demanded " law and order . "
it appears to have more to do with the office than the individual to issue such warnings and to demand tightening existing laws and more power to the police as tried and tested antidotes .
it is , of course , politicians ' duty to contemplate ways to deal with possible dangers or how they could be avoided in the first place .
just as the security services - there are 38 such federal institutions in germany - naturally must contemplate those things and run through their eerie case scenarios .
the main difference is that the security services engage in these deliberations internally and not in the media .
such discussions do n't belong in public .
if they continue to be carried on there , " al qaeda " becomes superfluous .

dw-world.de political wrangling at heart of german terror debate , critics say the german defense minister 's comments about shooting down hijacked planes set off a burst of political squabbling .
but the debate raises important issues , even if it 's motivated by political maneuvering , observers say .
-lrb- 17.09.2007 -rrb- terror case throws spotlight on german converts to islam two of the men held in connection with a plot to bomb us military installations and other targets in germany are converts to islam .
it has raised the question of whether converts are more likely to become radicalized .
-lrb- 11.09.2007 -rrb- debate on terror in germany highlights political divisions just days after german security forces thwarted a " massive " terror attack , the country 's state interior ministers met to discuss the current terrorist threat .
however , divisions remained on a number of issues .

" terrorism " is commonly - and especially since sept .
11 , 2001 , - defined and understood as an attempt by radical groups and individuals to achieve certain political aims by killing or hurting as many people as possible .
in view of the attacks in new york , madrid and london , this interpretation tends to be accepted without argument and the identity of the perpetrators is taken for granted - not only by george w. bush , but by western politicians everywhere .
osama bin laden , al qaeda , islamic jihad and similar names have long since become the embodiment of terror and terrorists .
at the same time , " terror " also means putting fear into an innocent civilian population and thus making it more receptive for the political demands that one is unable to implement any other way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp and that is exactly what we have been experiencing in germany nearly every day .
in this case , the " perpetrators " do n't come from the caves of afghanistan or the mountains along the pakistani border , but from near the black forest , rheingau or franconia .
and these " perpetrators " do n't operate from the underground , but rather as german political officials .
top politicians intimidate and frighten the germans with new visions of terror almost every day : with the danger of nuclear terror attacks , the danger that - like in manhattan - hijacked passenger airplanes could be piloted into big german cities .
or the danger that terrorists could come by boat and carry out attacks .
not to mention the danger that a seemingly incalculable mass of converts to islam has become a sort of terrorist fifth column .
the question is not if but when these grim visions will be realized claim -lsb- christian union -rsb- politicians such as interior minister wolfgang schäuble , his bavarian counterpart günther beckstein , or defense minister franz josef jung when they spread their prophecies of doom .
and thus recklessly spread fear and terror .
by now , even the union 's social democratic coalition partners in berlin take exception to it , although in the previous government it was one of them who , as federal interior minister , demanded " law and order . "
it appears to have more to do with the office than the individual to issue such warnings and to demand tightening existing laws and more power to the police as tried and tested antidotes .
it is , of course , politicians ' duty to contemplate ways to deal with possible dangers or how they could be avoided in the first place .
just as the security services - there are 38 such federal institutions in germany - naturally must contemplate those things and run through their eerie case scenarios .
the main difference is that the security services engage in these deliberations internally and not in the media .
such discussions do n't belong in public .
if they continue to be carried on there , " al qaeda " becomes superfluous .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 21.09.2007 recalling the world 's first steps toward climate protection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the montreal protocol woke up the world to the threats of greenhouse gases the passage of the montreal ozone protocol 20 years ago was a milestone in international climate protection .
dw-world.de spoke to thomas bunge , a member of the german delegation , who was part of the historic event . thomas bunge represented germany 's federal environment agency in drawing up the " montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer " in september 1987 .
the lawyer is currently responsible for environment and spatial planning at the agency .
dw-world.de : why was the 1987 montreal protocol so significant ?
thomas bunge : that was the beginning of international regulations to protect the earth 's atmosphere .
until then , there was only regulation of long-range , transnational air pollution .
people tried for the first time to resolve a worldwide problem through international law , although in retrospect , the regulations then were certainly inadequate .
can you briefly explain why they were inadequate ?
the regulations agreed in 1987 were supposed to reduce the production and use of substances that damaged the ozone layer by a maximum of only up to 50 percent .
but people very quickly noticed that that was n't enough to effectively protect the ozone layer .
in 1990 , that is , a year after the regulations came into effect , the stipulations had already been tightened .
the decision was made to entirely discontinue production and use by the year 2000 .
in 1994 , the deadlines were again shortened .
thus people wanted , and still want , to relatively quickly achieve a full discontinuation of production , and also of use , of the substances .
it 's true that developing countries currently the still have the right to produce and use the substances in small amounts .
but relatively soon the use and the production will be discontinued worldwide .
can you describe how things came about ?
how is such a compromise reached ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bunge as is normally the case in the realm of international law , there are specific working groups for the individual application areas one aims to regulate .
the building blocks for such an international treaty are worked out in the groups .
the individual building blocks must then be voted on and approved in the plenum .
that is , as in all cases , a compromise between the interests that the individual states represent at these conferences , of course .
the whole thing was fleshed out with science and the scientific results available up until the signing in 1987 were included .
the interests of the individual states and the scientific results were then put in relation .
that led to a compromise with which one was at the time not particularly happy .
can you provide an example of a practical problem that had to be overcome ?
did particular countries block movement ?
it was several blocks of states .
the eu comprised its own negotiation block .
of course , that was significantly fewer states than today .
there was a so-called " toronto group " of states .
they represented the scandinavian states , canada , australia and switzerland .
this group with australia and new zealand , which would have been affected the soonest by the consequences of the hole in the ozone layer - and then was affected - wanted to pass very wide-reaching regulations .
on the other side , there was an array of industrial countries that produced these substances .
they were naturally interested in continuing production or being able to produce appropriate substitutes .
how was the atmosphere among the conference participants on sept .
16 , 1987 , when the protocol was passed ?
people were pleased that a compromise had been reached .
but we had already seen that the rules were n't sufficient for the next 20 , 30 , 40 years .
we recognized that the progressive states also had had to swallow some bitter pills .
but in retrospect , it was a success , of course , to very quickly bring very many countries on board on trade regulations that envisaged limitations on trade with countries that were n't party to the treaty .
in this way , one had a model for the negotiations on climate regulations that started relatively soon thereafter . interview : martin hoffmann -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 21.09.2007 recalling the world 's first steps toward climate protection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the montreal protocol woke up the world to the threats of greenhouse gases the passage of the montreal ozone protocol 20 years ago was a milestone in international climate protection .
dw-world.de spoke to thomas bunge , a member of the german delegation , who was part of the historic event . thomas bunge represented germany 's federal environment agency in drawing up the " montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer " in september 1987 .
the lawyer is currently responsible for environment and spatial planning at the agency .
dw-world.de : why was the 1987 montreal protocol so significant ?
thomas bunge : that was the beginning of international regulations to protect the earth 's atmosphere .
until then , there was only regulation of long-range , transnational air pollution .
people tried for the first time to resolve a worldwide problem through international law , although in retrospect , the regulations then were certainly inadequate .
can you briefly explain why they were inadequate ?
the regulations agreed in 1987 were supposed to reduce the production and use of substances that damaged the ozone layer by a maximum of only up to 50 percent .
but people very quickly noticed that that was n't enough to effectively protect the ozone layer .
in 1990 , that is , a year after the regulations came into effect , the stipulations had already been tightened .
the decision was made to entirely discontinue production and use by the year 2000 .
in 1994 , the deadlines were again shortened .
thus people wanted , and still want , to relatively quickly achieve a full discontinuation of production , and also of use , of the substances .
it 's true that developing countries currently the still have the right to produce and use the substances in small amounts .
but relatively soon the use and the production will be discontinued worldwide .
can you describe how things came about ?
how is such a compromise reached ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bunge as is normally the case in the realm of international law , there are specific working groups for the individual application areas one aims to regulate .
the building blocks for such an international treaty are worked out in the groups .
the individual building blocks must then be voted on and approved in the plenum .
that is , as in all cases , a compromise between the interests that the individual states represent at these conferences , of course .
the whole thing was fleshed out with science and the scientific results available up until the signing in 1987 were included .
the interests of the individual states and the scientific results were then put in relation .
that led to a compromise with which one was at the time not particularly happy .
can you provide an example of a practical problem that had to be overcome ?
did particular countries block movement ?
it was several blocks of states .
the eu comprised its own negotiation block .
of course , that was significantly fewer states than today .
there was a so-called " toronto group " of states .
they represented the scandinavian states , canada , australia and switzerland .
this group with australia and new zealand , which would have been affected the soonest by the consequences of the hole in the ozone layer - and then was affected - wanted to pass very wide-reaching regulations .
on the other side , there was an array of industrial countries that produced these substances .
they were naturally interested in continuing production or being able to produce appropriate substitutes .
how was the atmosphere among the conference participants on sept .
16 , 1987 , when the protocol was passed ?
people were pleased that a compromise had been reached .
but we had already seen that the rules were n't sufficient for the next 20 , 30 , 40 years .
we recognized that the progressive states also had had to swallow some bitter pills .
but in retrospect , it was a success , of course , to very quickly bring very many countries on board on trade regulations that envisaged limitations on trade with countries that were n't party to the treaty .
in this way , one had a model for the negotiations on climate regulations that started relatively soon thereafter . interview : martin hoffmann -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the five un security council permanent members and germany are meeting in washington , dc , on friday to discuss iran .
us president george w. bush has escalated rhetoric over iran in recent weeks .
ahead of the meeting , bush insisted that " the objective , of course , is to solve this peacefully . "
french foreign minister bernard kouchner will go to the white house to discuss the issue on friday .
kouchner recently warned that a war with iran was possible , but has since insisted the statement was misunderstood .
stronger sanctions necessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says it wants nuclear technology to provide energy while sarkozy distanced himself from the threat of going to war with iran , he emphasized the need for diplomatic sanctions .
the iranian nuclear question " is an extremely difficult affair , but france does not want a war , " sarkozy said .
at their friday meeting , britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states plan to discuss a third package of tighter un sanctions against iran if it does not suspend its uranium enrichment .
" how do we convince -lsb- iran -rsb- to renounce this project ? "
sarkozy asked .
" just as the international community convinced north korea and libya to renounce theirs : through discussion , through dialogue , through sanctions .
" if sanctions are not enough , i want stronger sanctions , " sarkozy added .
leaders hope for a peaceful solution bildunterschrift : france is worried the un security council wo n't do enough since sarkozy 's election in may , france has taken an increasingly strong stand in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program , which many countries fear is an effort to build an atomic bomb .
sarkozy said he believes iran has a right to civilian nuclear technology .
bush said he 's hopeful that iran can be convinced to peacefully give up its ambitions to develop a weapons program .
" it 's imperative that we continue to work in a multilateral fashion to send that message , " bush said .
" and one place to do so is at the united nations . "
the un security council has adopted sanctions against iran which include calling on countries to stop supplying iran with nuclear-related technology and freezing assets of many people and groups related to the nuclear program .
iranian arms exports have also been banned .
the iranian regime insists it is developing the technology to provide electricity and since sanctions started has increased its enrichment activities .
sarkozy wants european sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he wo n't be visiting ground zero a senior us official told the associated press news agency that the proposed new sanctions would require countries to inspect all cargo en route to or from iran as well as freeze assets of a number of iranian banks .
the official was interviewed this summer on condition of anonymity because the negotiations were still underway .
france wants the european union to also adopt sanctions against iran if the un security council does not pass new measures .
russia and china have been unwilling to take strong action .
french presidential spokesman david martinon suggested that the measures could include " recommendations " to european companies asking them " at the very least not to bid for new markets in iran , and for financial institutions to scale back their operations , to lower their investments . "
" we would like to obtain that from all eu countries , and we are not alone in wanting to do so , " martinon said .
next week , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad will travel to new york to address the un general assembly .
the visit has sparked controversy in the us as the iranian leader is considered by washington to be an ally to islamic militants and iraqi insurgents .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 21.09.2007 combating child porn conference focuses on new technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : training police officers will be a focus of the conference the use of new technologies and better cross border co-operation is the focus of a conference aimed at combating the sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
dw-world.de spoke to the conference organizer . tim del vecchio is the organizer of the conference on improving law enforcement 's response to combat sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
he is a police affairs officer with the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- strategic police matters unit . dw world.de : what will be discussed at the conference ? tim del vecchio : we are going to address several technical issues - what kind of technology is out there so we can conduct our investigations more effectively , what type of police training is available at no cost and is also available to states that can not afford their own police training .
most of all we want to make partnerships with the private sector .
for example , microsoft , and visa europe are participating .
visa is talking about how they can work with the credit card companies more effectively .
internet service providers from various osce member states are going to talk about how the police can work better with internet service providers . our focus is going to on the offenders more than the victims .
we have an anti-trafficking unit at the osce that focuses on the victim issues , about the after-care , what kind of therapies are available and shelters that might be available for victims if we ca n't send them home .
our role is going to be to address the police and the prosecutors . what are the measures available to fight child pornography ? one of the first places we have to start looking at is domestic legislation .
last year , we were very much involved in helping the international center for missing and exploited children , through various focus groups throughout europe , where we were looking at what the legislation consisted of .
for example : was it illegal to possess child pornography ?
was it illegal in your country to distribute child pornography ?
once police officers and prosecutors have the laws in place , then we have the tools to do our job . there are several organs fighting this type of crime , like the child exploitation and online protection center in great britain .
what kind of co-operation do you have with other organizations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim del vecchio said everybody shares the blame for child porn the osce is not an operational police unit - we do n't conduct investigations .
we are primarily a political organization that facilitates co-operation .
we are going to have police officers from austria and belgium attending and even police officers from russia .
each one of them is going to present a case study that took place recently in their country and we are going to use these three case studies as an example . what kind of difficulties did you run into , how did you solve the problems .
what kind of difficulties do we have in common ?
it is kind of a " lessons learned " identification and we also hope to have examples of good practices out of this as well .
interpol and ceop are doing a fantastic job in fighting this crime .
the problem is that it is so pervasive , and we definitely want to increase cross-border co-operation .
we do n't want an investigation to stop just because it goes across the border . why were the case studies of belgium , austria and russia chosen ? they volunteered their services .
they took time out of their investigation .
austria had a high profile case last year and we thought it would be an example of best practice .
belgium also had some high profile cases . which new technologies are being presented at the conference ? microsoft is going to talk about the child exploitation tracking software .
they have developed this because the canadian police were having difficulties with investigations in this area .
one police officer in toronto wrote to microsoft and they responded by spending $ 2 million developing a special software that police can track down pedophiles that are using the internet .
we want to make our member states aware that this is free . what about facial recognition technology ? organizations like interpol are looking at child images like a photographic fingerprint .
even if you get older or change your appearance , this technology is still going to be able to tell if it is you or not .
for example , if a man grows a beard or puts on glasses , the software is so powerful that it is still going to recognize that it is you .
this is a very useful tool in child pornography investigations .
you can tell if you are looking at the same victim in different videos , or it might be the same victim , but older than in the other videos .
it is a very good way of identifying victims and rescuing them in some circumstances . who are the perpetrators of these crimes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the eu expands cross border co-operation becomes a major issue usually , it is men .
depending on what study you look at , you get different profiles .
but one of the things that we are very concerned about is that , when we do arrest people , we 're finding that the images in their possession are of very young children .
nineteen percent of the images of offenders were found to be of children less than five years old .
so this is not a case of people looking at pornographic pictures of people that are 16 or 17 years old , we are talking about very young children . how do you view the overall situation of child pornography on the internet in the world today ? everybody shares the blame .
in the usa , there was a husband-and-wife team that was distributing child pornography through the internet in texas but all of the images were coming from various countries in eastern europe .
these people were making over a million dollars a month .
this is a case where the investigation started in america , but there are several european countries involved .
the internet is so fast , it operates at the speed of light - it is very easy to work with people and other countries instantly . i think osce has recognized that organized crime in general is a very serious threat to all 56 member states .
the distribution of child pornography is only one way that organized crime makes money .
it is very lucrative , just like drugs and stolen automobiles and the traditional organized crime activities .
but this one , of course , has a very tragic human element that the other ones do n't . why have france , spain and the united states decided to fund the conference ? these delegations came to us after the ministerial decision -lrb- in december 2006 -rrb- .
the osce recognized this as a serious threat and they were very concerned about our member states having the capacity to combat it .
they thought that it is necessary to take action very fast so they gave us donations right away because otherwise we would have to wait for budgets or bureaucratic matters to get this thing off the ground .

dw-world.de spoke to the conference organizer . tim del vecchio is the organizer of the conference on improving law enforcement 's response to combat sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
he is a police affairs officer with the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- strategic police matters unit . dw world.de : what will be discussed at the conference ? tim del vecchio : we are going to address several technical issues - what kind of technology is out there so we can conduct our investigations more effectively , what type of police training is available at no cost and is also available to states that can not afford their own police training .
most of all we want to make partnerships with the private sector .
for example , microsoft , and visa europe are participating .
visa is talking about how they can work with the credit card companies more effectively .
internet service providers from various osce member states are going to talk about how the police can work better with internet service providers . our focus is going to on the offenders more than the victims .
we have an anti-trafficking unit at the osce that focuses on the victim issues , about the after-care , what kind of therapies are available and shelters that might be available for victims if we ca n't send them home .
our role is going to be to address the police and the prosecutors . what are the measures available to fight child pornography ? one of the first places we have to start looking at is domestic legislation .
last year , we were very much involved in helping the international center for missing and exploited children , through various focus groups throughout europe , where we were looking at what the legislation consisted of .
for example : was it illegal to possess child pornography ?
was it illegal in your country to distribute child pornography ?
once police officers and prosecutors have the laws in place , then we have the tools to do our job . there are several organs fighting this type of crime , like the child exploitation and online protection center in great britain .
what kind of co-operation do you have with other organizations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim del vecchio said everybody shares the blame for child porn the osce is not an operational police unit - we do n't conduct investigations .
we are primarily a political organization that facilitates co-operation .
we are going to have police officers from austria and belgium attending and even police officers from russia .
each one of them is going to present a case study that took place recently in their country and we are going to use these three case studies as an example . what kind of difficulties did you run into , how did you solve the problems .
what kind of difficulties do we have in common ?
it is kind of a " lessons learned " identification and we also hope to have examples of good practices out of this as well .
interpol and ceop are doing a fantastic job in fighting this crime .
the problem is that it is so pervasive , and we definitely want to increase cross-border co-operation .
we do n't want an investigation to stop just because it goes across the border . why were the case studies of belgium , austria and russia chosen ? they volunteered their services .
they took time out of their investigation .
austria had a high profile case last year and we thought it would be an example of best practice .
belgium also had some high profile cases . which new technologies are being presented at the conference ? microsoft is going to talk about the child exploitation tracking software .
they have developed this because the canadian police were having difficulties with investigations in this area .
one police officer in toronto wrote to microsoft and they responded by spending $ 2 million developing a special software that police can track down pedophiles that are using the internet .
we want to make our member states aware that this is free . what about facial recognition technology ? organizations like interpol are looking at child images like a photographic fingerprint .
even if you get older or change your appearance , this technology is still going to be able to tell if it is you or not .
for example , if a man grows a beard or puts on glasses , the software is so powerful that it is still going to recognize that it is you .
this is a very useful tool in child pornography investigations .
you can tell if you are looking at the same victim in different videos , or it might be the same victim , but older than in the other videos .
it is a very good way of identifying victims and rescuing them in some circumstances . who are the perpetrators of these crimes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the eu expands cross border co-operation becomes a major issue usually , it is men .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 21.09.2007 combating child porn conference focuses on new technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : training police officers will be a focus of the conference the use of new technologies and better cross border co-operation is the focus of a conference aimed at combating the sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
dw-world.de spoke to the conference organizer . tim del vecchio is the organizer of the conference on improving law enforcement 's response to combat sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
he is a police affairs officer with the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- strategic police matters unit . dw world.de : what will be discussed at the conference ? tim del vecchio : we are going to address several technical issues - what kind of technology is out there so we can conduct our investigations more effectively , what type of police training is available at no cost and is also available to states that can not afford their own police training .
most of all we want to make partnerships with the private sector .
for example , microsoft , and visa europe are participating .
visa is talking about how they can work with the credit card companies more effectively .
internet service providers from various osce member states are going to talk about how the police can work better with internet service providers . our focus is going to on the offenders more than the victims .
we have an anti-trafficking unit at the osce that focuses on the victim issues , about the after-care , what kind of therapies are available and shelters that might be available for victims if we ca n't send them home .
our role is going to be to address the police and the prosecutors . what are the measures available to fight child pornography ? one of the first places we have to start looking at is domestic legislation .
last year , we were very much involved in helping the international center for missing and exploited children , through various focus groups throughout europe , where we were looking at what the legislation consisted of .
for example : was it illegal to possess child pornography ?
was it illegal in your country to distribute child pornography ?
once police officers and prosecutors have the laws in place , then we have the tools to do our job . there are several organs fighting this type of crime , like the child exploitation and online protection center in great britain .
what kind of co-operation do you have with other organizations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim del vecchio said everybody shares the blame for child porn the osce is not an operational police unit - we do n't conduct investigations .
we are primarily a political organization that facilitates co-operation .
we are going to have police officers from austria and belgium attending and even police officers from russia .
each one of them is going to present a case study that took place recently in their country and we are going to use these three case studies as an example . what kind of difficulties did you run into , how did you solve the problems .
what kind of difficulties do we have in common ?
it is kind of a " lessons learned " identification and we also hope to have examples of good practices out of this as well .
interpol and ceop are doing a fantastic job in fighting this crime .
the problem is that it is so pervasive , and we definitely want to increase cross-border co-operation .
we do n't want an investigation to stop just because it goes across the border . why were the case studies of belgium , austria and russia chosen ? they volunteered their services .
they took time out of their investigation .
austria had a high profile case last year and we thought it would be an example of best practice .
belgium also had some high profile cases . which new technologies are being presented at the conference ? microsoft is going to talk about the child exploitation tracking software .
they have developed this because the canadian police were having difficulties with investigations in this area .
one police officer in toronto wrote to microsoft and they responded by spending $ 2 million developing a special software that police can track down pedophiles that are using the internet .
we want to make our member states aware that this is free . what about facial recognition technology ? organizations like interpol are looking at child images like a photographic fingerprint .
even if you get older or change your appearance , this technology is still going to be able to tell if it is you or not .
for example , if a man grows a beard or puts on glasses , the software is so powerful that it is still going to recognize that it is you .
this is a very useful tool in child pornography investigations .
you can tell if you are looking at the same victim in different videos , or it might be the same victim , but older than in the other videos .
it is a very good way of identifying victims and rescuing them in some circumstances . who are the perpetrators of these crimes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the eu expands cross border co-operation becomes a major issue usually , it is men .
depending on what study you look at , you get different profiles .
but one of the things that we are very concerned about is that , when we do arrest people , we 're finding that the images in their possession are of very young children .
nineteen percent of the images of offenders were found to be of children less than five years old .
so this is not a case of people looking at pornographic pictures of people that are 16 or 17 years old , we are talking about very young children . how do you view the overall situation of child pornography on the internet in the world today ? everybody shares the blame .
in the usa , there was a husband-and-wife team that was distributing child pornography through the internet in texas but all of the images were coming from various countries in eastern europe .
these people were making over a million dollars a month .
this is a case where the investigation started in america , but there are several european countries involved .
the internet is so fast , it operates at the speed of light - it is very easy to work with people and other countries instantly . i think osce has recognized that organized crime in general is a very serious threat to all 56 member states .
the distribution of child pornography is only one way that organized crime makes money .
it is very lucrative , just like drugs and stolen automobiles and the traditional organized crime activities .
but this one , of course , has a very tragic human element that the other ones do n't . why have france , spain and the united states decided to fund the conference ? these delegations came to us after the ministerial decision -lrb- in december 2006 -rrb- .
the osce recognized this as a serious threat and they were very concerned about our member states having the capacity to combat it .
they thought that it is necessary to take action very fast so they gave us donations right away because otherwise we would have to wait for budgets or bureaucratic matters to get this thing off the ground .
the ministerial decision was in december 2006 and in february we were holding meetings with these delegations to discuss a way to combat this problem .
we are very grateful for the donations . interview : renate krieger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they will be asked their place of birth , age , gender , nationality and marital status as well as questions about their household , working life and education .
germany 's current population statistics are extrapolations based on the last censuses .
the country 's statisticians think there may actually be 1.3 million fewer people living in germany in total and around half a million fewer foreigners than official calculations say .
the preparatory legislation on the census passed with the votes of the two government parties , the christian democrats and social democrats , in the bundestag , while the green party and the free-market liberal fdp abstained .

the tally is n't expected to provoke storms of protest as it did in the past .
but it could show that there are fewer people in the country . the census will begin in 2011 , the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , decided on thursday , sept .
21 .
this time , though , officials wo n't be knocking on the doors of each and every one of the estimated 82 million german residents .
instead , they will focus their queries on around 6 million people as well as the country 's 17.5 million property owners .
they will be asked their place of birth , age , gender , nationality and marital status as well as questions about their household , working life and education .
germany 's current population statistics are extrapolations based on the last censuses .
the country 's statisticians think there may actually be 1.3 million fewer people living in germany in total and around half a million fewer foreigners than official calculations say .
the preparatory legislation on the census passed with the votes of the two government parties , the christian democrats and social democrats , in the bundestag , while the green party and the free-market liberal fdp abstained .
data protection czar unconcerned fdp politician sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former federal justice minister , said she and her colleagues thought the details of the census had not yet been adequately clarified .
" we do n't want to issue a carte blanche as long as these questions are still open , " the süddeutsche zeitung daily quoted her as saying .
the left party opposed the bill .
its domestic expert , jan korte , said the data collected would not be secure and that it was unclear how it would be used , according to the paper .
however , germany 's data protection czar , peter schaar , said the census plans were in line with the constitution and would not unnecessarily intrude on citizens ' privacy rights .
internet opens doors to census bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowadays people are less concerned about leaving a trace the last census took place in 1987 in west germany and in 1981 in east germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 21.09.2007 combating child porn conference focuses on new technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : training police officers will be a focus of the conference the use of new technologies and better cross border co-operation is the focus of a conference aimed at combating the sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
dw-world.de spoke to the conference organizer . tim del vecchio is the organizer of the conference on improving law enforcement 's response to combat sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
he is a police affairs officer with the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- strategic police matters unit . dw world.de : what will be discussed at the conference ? tim del vecchio : we are going to address several technical issues - what kind of technology is out there so we can conduct our investigations more effectively , what type of police training is available at no cost and is also available to states that can not afford their own police training .
most of all we want to make partnerships with the private sector .
for example , microsoft , and visa europe are participating .
visa is talking about how they can work with the credit card companies more effectively .
internet service providers from various osce member states are going to talk about how the police can work better with internet service providers . our focus is going to on the offenders more than the victims .
we have an anti-trafficking unit at the osce that focuses on the victim issues , about the after-care , what kind of therapies are available and shelters that might be available for victims if we ca n't send them home .
our role is going to be to address the police and the prosecutors . what are the measures available to fight child pornography ? one of the first places we have to start looking at is domestic legislation .
last year , we were very much involved in helping the international center for missing and exploited children , through various focus groups throughout europe , where we were looking at what the legislation consisted of .
for example : was it illegal to possess child pornography ?
was it illegal in your country to distribute child pornography ?
once police officers and prosecutors have the laws in place , then we have the tools to do our job . there are several organs fighting this type of crime , like the child exploitation and online protection center in great britain .
what kind of co-operation do you have with other organizations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim del vecchio said everybody shares the blame for child porn the osce is not an operational police unit - we do n't conduct investigations .
we are primarily a political organization that facilitates co-operation .
we are going to have police officers from austria and belgium attending and even police officers from russia .
each one of them is going to present a case study that took place recently in their country and we are going to use these three case studies as an example . what kind of difficulties did you run into , how did you solve the problems .
what kind of difficulties do we have in common ?
it is kind of a " lessons learned " identification and we also hope to have examples of good practices out of this as well .
interpol and ceop are doing a fantastic job in fighting this crime .
the problem is that it is so pervasive , and we definitely want to increase cross-border co-operation .
we do n't want an investigation to stop just because it goes across the border . why were the case studies of belgium , austria and russia chosen ? they volunteered their services .
they took time out of their investigation .
austria had a high profile case last year and we thought it would be an example of best practice .
belgium also had some high profile cases . which new technologies are being presented at the conference ? microsoft is going to talk about the child exploitation tracking software .
they have developed this because the canadian police were having difficulties with investigations in this area .
one police officer in toronto wrote to microsoft and they responded by spending $ 2 million developing a special software that police can track down pedophiles that are using the internet .
we want to make our member states aware that this is free . what about facial recognition technology ? organizations like interpol are looking at child images like a photographic fingerprint .
even if you get older or change your appearance , this technology is still going to be able to tell if it is you or not .
for example , if a man grows a beard or puts on glasses , the software is so powerful that it is still going to recognize that it is you .
this is a very useful tool in child pornography investigations .
you can tell if you are looking at the same victim in different videos , or it might be the same victim , but older than in the other videos .
it is a very good way of identifying victims and rescuing them in some circumstances . who are the perpetrators of these crimes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the eu expands cross border co-operation becomes a major issue usually , it is men .
depending on what study you look at , you get different profiles .
but one of the things that we are very concerned about is that , when we do arrest people , we 're finding that the images in their possession are of very young children .
nineteen percent of the images of offenders were found to be of children less than five years old .
so this is not a case of people looking at pornographic pictures of people that are 16 or 17 years old , we are talking about very young children . how do you view the overall situation of child pornography on the internet in the world today ? everybody shares the blame .
in the usa , there was a husband-and-wife team that was distributing child pornography through the internet in texas but all of the images were coming from various countries in eastern europe .
these people were making over a million dollars a month .
this is a case where the investigation started in america , but there are several european countries involved .
the internet is so fast , it operates at the speed of light - it is very easy to work with people and other countries instantly . i think osce has recognized that organized crime in general is a very serious threat to all 56 member states .
the distribution of child pornography is only one way that organized crime makes money .
it is very lucrative , just like drugs and stolen automobiles and the traditional organized crime activities .
but this one , of course , has a very tragic human element that the other ones do n't . why have france , spain and the united states decided to fund the conference ? these delegations came to us after the ministerial decision -lrb- in december 2006 -rrb- .
the osce recognized this as a serious threat and they were very concerned about our member states having the capacity to combat it .
they thought that it is necessary to take action very fast so they gave us donations right away because otherwise we would have to wait for budgets or bureaucratic matters to get this thing off the ground .
the ministerial decision was in december 2006 and in february we were holding meetings with these delegations to discuss a way to combat this problem .

dw-world.de spoke to the conference organizer . tim del vecchio is the organizer of the conference on improving law enforcement 's response to combat sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
he is a police affairs officer with the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- strategic police matters unit . dw world.de : what will be discussed at the conference ? tim del vecchio : we are going to address several technical issues - what kind of technology is out there so we can conduct our investigations more effectively , what type of police training is available at no cost and is also available to states that can not afford their own police training .
most of all we want to make partnerships with the private sector .
for example , microsoft , and visa europe are participating .
visa is talking about how they can work with the credit card companies more effectively .
internet service providers from various osce member states are going to talk about how the police can work better with internet service providers . our focus is going to on the offenders more than the victims .
we have an anti-trafficking unit at the osce that focuses on the victim issues , about the after-care , what kind of therapies are available and shelters that might be available for victims if we ca n't send them home .
our role is going to be to address the police and the prosecutors . what are the measures available to fight child pornography ? one of the first places we have to start looking at is domestic legislation .
last year , we were very much involved in helping the international center for missing and exploited children , through various focus groups throughout europe , where we were looking at what the legislation consisted of .
for example : was it illegal to possess child pornography ?
was it illegal in your country to distribute child pornography ?
once police officers and prosecutors have the laws in place , then we have the tools to do our job . there are several organs fighting this type of crime , like the child exploitation and online protection center in great britain .
what kind of co-operation do you have with other organizations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim del vecchio said everybody shares the blame for child porn the osce is not an operational police unit - we do n't conduct investigations .
we are primarily a political organization that facilitates co-operation .
we are going to have police officers from austria and belgium attending and even police officers from russia .
each one of them is going to present a case study that took place recently in their country and we are going to use these three case studies as an example . what kind of difficulties did you run into , how did you solve the problems .
what kind of difficulties do we have in common ?
it is kind of a " lessons learned " identification and we also hope to have examples of good practices out of this as well .
interpol and ceop are doing a fantastic job in fighting this crime .
the problem is that it is so pervasive , and we definitely want to increase cross-border co-operation .
we do n't want an investigation to stop just because it goes across the border . why were the case studies of belgium , austria and russia chosen ? they volunteered their services .
they took time out of their investigation .
austria had a high profile case last year and we thought it would be an example of best practice .
belgium also had some high profile cases . which new technologies are being presented at the conference ? microsoft is going to talk about the child exploitation tracking software .

but it could show that there are fewer people in the country . the census will begin in 2011 , the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , decided on thursday , sept .
21 .
this time , though , officials wo n't be knocking on the doors of each and every one of the estimated 82 million german residents .
instead , they will focus their queries on around 6 million people as well as the country 's 17.5 million property owners .
they will be asked their place of birth , age , gender , nationality and marital status as well as questions about their household , working life and education .
germany 's current population statistics are extrapolations based on the last censuses .
the country 's statisticians think there may actually be 1.3 million fewer people living in germany in total and around half a million fewer foreigners than official calculations say .
the preparatory legislation on the census passed with the votes of the two government parties , the christian democrats and social democrats , in the bundestag , while the green party and the free-market liberal fdp abstained .
data protection czar unconcerned fdp politician sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former federal justice minister , said she and her colleagues thought the details of the census had not yet been adequately clarified .
" we do n't want to issue a carte blanche as long as these questions are still open , " the süddeutsche zeitung daily quoted her as saying .

the tally is n't expected to provoke storms of protest as it did in the past .
but it could show that there are fewer people in the country . the census will begin in 2011 , the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , decided on thursday , sept .
21 .
this time , though , officials wo n't be knocking on the doors of each and every one of the estimated 82 million german residents .
instead , they will focus their queries on around 6 million people as well as the country 's 17.5 million property owners .
they will be asked their place of birth , age , gender , nationality and marital status as well as questions about their household , working life and education .
germany 's current population statistics are extrapolations based on the last censuses .
the country 's statisticians think there may actually be 1.3 million fewer people living in germany in total and around half a million fewer foreigners than official calculations say .
the preparatory legislation on the census passed with the votes of the two government parties , the christian democrats and social democrats , in the bundestag , while the green party and the free-market liberal fdp abstained .
data protection czar unconcerned fdp politician sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former federal justice minister , said she and her colleagues thought the details of the census had not yet been adequately clarified .
" we do n't want to issue a carte blanche as long as these questions are still open , " the süddeutsche zeitung daily quoted her as saying .
the left party opposed the bill .
its domestic expert , jan korte , said the data collected would not be secure and that it was unclear how it would be used , according to the paper .
however , germany 's data protection czar , peter schaar , said the census plans were in line with the constitution and would not unnecessarily intrude on citizens ' privacy rights .
internet opens doors to census bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowadays people are less concerned about leaving a trace the last census took place in 1987 in west germany and in 1981 in east germany .
the west german census was accompanied by calls for boycott from people who were concerned the tally would lead the way to a surveillance state .
census takers were tasked with collected data from all german residents .
little resistance is expected this time around : with the widespread use of credit cards and the internet , germans generally find it acceptable to allow freer access to their personal data .
germany 's highest court has also ruled that informants ' family names must be deleted from the data as soon as possible .
all census information that could make residents recognizable must be erased when it is no longer needed by the statisticians .
berlin 's plans for a new census will ensure it complies with european union requirements .
both the eu and germany use population levels to determine the amount of subsidies regions receive as well as numbers of political representatives .
the census is expected to cost around 450 million euros -lrb- $ 630 million -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" iran is trying to obtain an atomic bomb , " sarkozy said in a prime-time television interview late thursday , sept .
20 .
" that is unacceptable and i tell the french people it is unacceptable . "
the five un security council permanent members and germany are meeting in washington , dc , on friday to discuss iran .
us president george w. bush has escalated rhetoric over iran in recent weeks .
ahead of the meeting , bush insisted that " the objective , of course , is to solve this peacefully . "
french foreign minister bernard kouchner will go to the white house to discuss the issue on friday .
kouchner recently warned that a war with iran was possible , but has since insisted the statement was misunderstood .
stronger sanctions necessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says it wants nuclear technology to provide energy while sarkozy distanced himself from the threat of going to war with iran , he emphasized the need for diplomatic sanctions .
the iranian nuclear question " is an extremely difficult affair , but france does not want a war , " sarkozy said .
at their friday meeting , britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states plan to discuss a third package of tighter un sanctions against iran if it does not suspend its uranium enrichment .
" how do we convince -lsb- iran -rsb- to renounce this project ? "
sarkozy asked .
" just as the international community convinced north korea and libya to renounce theirs : through discussion , through dialogue , through sanctions .
" if sanctions are not enough , i want stronger sanctions , " sarkozy added .
leaders hope for a peaceful solution bildunterschrift : france is worried the un security council wo n't do enough since sarkozy 's election in may , france has taken an increasingly strong stand in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program , which many countries fear is an effort to build an atomic bomb .
sarkozy said he believes iran has a right to civilian nuclear technology .
bush said he 's hopeful that iran can be convinced to peacefully give up its ambitions to develop a weapons program .
" it 's imperative that we continue to work in a multilateral fashion to send that message , " bush said .
" and one place to do so is at the united nations . "
the un security council has adopted sanctions against iran which include calling on countries to stop supplying iran with nuclear-related technology and freezing assets of many people and groups related to the nuclear program .
iranian arms exports have also been banned .
the iranian regime insists it is developing the technology to provide electricity and since sanctions started has increased its enrichment activities .

dw-world.de spoke to thomas bunge , a member of the german delegation , who was part of the historic event . thomas bunge represented germany 's federal environment agency in drawing up the " montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer " in september 1987 .
the lawyer is currently responsible for environment and spatial planning at the agency .
dw-world.de : why was the 1987 montreal protocol so significant ?
thomas bunge : that was the beginning of international regulations to protect the earth 's atmosphere .
until then , there was only regulation of long-range , transnational air pollution .
people tried for the first time to resolve a worldwide problem through international law , although in retrospect , the regulations then were certainly inadequate .
can you briefly explain why they were inadequate ?
the regulations agreed in 1987 were supposed to reduce the production and use of substances that damaged the ozone layer by a maximum of only up to 50 percent .
but people very quickly noticed that that was n't enough to effectively protect the ozone layer .
in 1990 , that is , a year after the regulations came into effect , the stipulations had already been tightened .
the decision was made to entirely discontinue production and use by the year 2000 .
in 1994 , the deadlines were again shortened .
thus people wanted , and still want , to relatively quickly achieve a full discontinuation of production , and also of use , of the substances .
it 's true that developing countries currently the still have the right to produce and use the substances in small amounts .
but relatively soon the use and the production will be discontinued worldwide .
can you describe how things came about ?
how is such a compromise reached ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bunge as is normally the case in the realm of international law , there are specific working groups for the individual application areas one aims to regulate .
the building blocks for such an international treaty are worked out in the groups .
the individual building blocks must then be voted on and approved in the plenum .
that is , as in all cases , a compromise between the interests that the individual states represent at these conferences , of course .
the whole thing was fleshed out with science and the scientific results available up until the signing in 1987 were included .
the interests of the individual states and the scientific results were then put in relation .
that led to a compromise with which one was at the time not particularly happy .
can you provide an example of a practical problem that had to be overcome ?
did particular countries block movement ?
it was several blocks of states .
the eu comprised its own negotiation block .
of course , that was significantly fewer states than today .
there was a so-called " toronto group " of states .
they represented the scandinavian states , canada , australia and switzerland .
this group with australia and new zealand , which would have been affected the soonest by the consequences of the hole in the ozone layer - and then was affected - wanted to pass very wide-reaching regulations .
on the other side , there was an array of industrial countries that produced these substances .
they were naturally interested in continuing production or being able to produce appropriate substitutes .
how was the atmosphere among the conference participants on sept .
16 , 1987 , when the protocol was passed ?
people were pleased that a compromise had been reached .
but we had already seen that the rules were n't sufficient for the next 20 , 30 , 40 years .
we recognized that the progressive states also had had to swallow some bitter pills .
but in retrospect , it was a success , of course , to very quickly bring very many countries on board on trade regulations that envisaged limitations on trade with countries that were n't party to the treaty .
in this way , one had a model for the negotiations on climate regulations that started relatively soon thereafter . interview : martin hoffmann -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 21.09.2007 recalling the world 's first steps toward climate protection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the montreal protocol woke up the world to the threats of greenhouse gases the passage of the montreal ozone protocol 20 years ago was a milestone in international climate protection .
dw-world.de spoke to thomas bunge , a member of the german delegation , who was part of the historic event . thomas bunge represented germany 's federal environment agency in drawing up the " montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer " in september 1987 .
the lawyer is currently responsible for environment and spatial planning at the agency .
dw-world.de : why was the 1987 montreal protocol so significant ?
thomas bunge : that was the beginning of international regulations to protect the earth 's atmosphere .
until then , there was only regulation of long-range , transnational air pollution .
people tried for the first time to resolve a worldwide problem through international law , although in retrospect , the regulations then were certainly inadequate .
can you briefly explain why they were inadequate ?
the regulations agreed in 1987 were supposed to reduce the production and use of substances that damaged the ozone layer by a maximum of only up to 50 percent .
but people very quickly noticed that that was n't enough to effectively protect the ozone layer .
in 1990 , that is , a year after the regulations came into effect , the stipulations had already been tightened .
the decision was made to entirely discontinue production and use by the year 2000 .
in 1994 , the deadlines were again shortened .
thus people wanted , and still want , to relatively quickly achieve a full discontinuation of production , and also of use , of the substances .
it 's true that developing countries currently the still have the right to produce and use the substances in small amounts .
but relatively soon the use and the production will be discontinued worldwide .
can you describe how things came about ?
how is such a compromise reached ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bunge as is normally the case in the realm of international law , there are specific working groups for the individual application areas one aims to regulate .
the building blocks for such an international treaty are worked out in the groups .
the individual building blocks must then be voted on and approved in the plenum .
that is , as in all cases , a compromise between the interests that the individual states represent at these conferences , of course .
the whole thing was fleshed out with science and the scientific results available up until the signing in 1987 were included .
the interests of the individual states and the scientific results were then put in relation .
that led to a compromise with which one was at the time not particularly happy .
can you provide an example of a practical problem that had to be overcome ?
did particular countries block movement ?
it was several blocks of states .
the eu comprised its own negotiation block .
of course , that was significantly fewer states than today .
there was a so-called " toronto group " of states .
they represented the scandinavian states , canada , australia and switzerland .
this group with australia and new zealand , which would have been affected the soonest by the consequences of the hole in the ozone layer - and then was affected - wanted to pass very wide-reaching regulations .
on the other side , there was an array of industrial countries that produced these substances .
they were naturally interested in continuing production or being able to produce appropriate substitutes .
how was the atmosphere among the conference participants on sept .
16 , 1987 , when the protocol was passed ?
people were pleased that a compromise had been reached .
but we had already seen that the rules were n't sufficient for the next 20 , 30 , 40 years .
we recognized that the progressive states also had had to swallow some bitter pills .
but in retrospect , it was a success , of course , to very quickly bring very many countries on board on trade regulations that envisaged limitations on trade with countries that were n't party to the treaty .
in this way , one had a model for the negotiations on climate regulations that started relatively soon thereafter . interview : martin hoffmann -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" terrorism " is commonly - and especially since sept .
11 , 2001 , - defined and understood as an attempt by radical groups and individuals to achieve certain political aims by killing or hurting as many people as possible .
in view of the attacks in new york , madrid and london , this interpretation tends to be accepted without argument and the identity of the perpetrators is taken for granted - not only by george w. bush , but by western politicians everywhere .
osama bin laden , al qaeda , islamic jihad and similar names have long since become the embodiment of terror and terrorists .
at the same time , " terror " also means putting fear into an innocent civilian population and thus making it more receptive for the political demands that one is unable to implement any other way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp and that is exactly what we have been experiencing in germany nearly every day .
in this case , the " perpetrators " do n't come from the caves of afghanistan or the mountains along the pakistani border , but from near the black forest , rheingau or franconia .
and these " perpetrators " do n't operate from the underground , but rather as german political officials .
top politicians intimidate and frighten the germans with new visions of terror almost every day : with the danger of nuclear terror attacks , the danger that - like in manhattan - hijacked passenger airplanes could be piloted into big german cities .
or the danger that terrorists could come by boat and carry out attacks .
not to mention the danger that a seemingly incalculable mass of converts to islam has become a sort of terrorist fifth column .
the question is not if but when these grim visions will be realized claim -lsb- christian union -rsb- politicians such as interior minister wolfgang schäuble , his bavarian counterpart günther beckstein , or defense minister franz josef jung when they spread their prophecies of doom .
and thus recklessly spread fear and terror .
by now , even the union 's social democratic coalition partners in berlin take exception to it , although in the previous government it was one of them who , as federal interior minister , demanded " law and order . "
it appears to have more to do with the office than the individual to issue such warnings and to demand tightening existing laws and more power to the police as tried and tested antidotes .
it is , of course , politicians ' duty to contemplate ways to deal with possible dangers or how they could be avoided in the first place .
just as the security services - there are 38 such federal institutions in germany - naturally must contemplate those things and run through their eerie case scenarios .
the main difference is that the security services engage in these deliberations internally and not in the media .
such discussions do n't belong in public .
if they continue to be carried on there , " al qaeda " becomes superfluous .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 21.09.2007 combating child porn conference focuses on new technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : training police officers will be a focus of the conference the use of new technologies and better cross border co-operation is the focus of a conference aimed at combating the sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
dw-world.de spoke to the conference organizer . tim del vecchio is the organizer of the conference on improving law enforcement 's response to combat sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
he is a police affairs officer with the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- strategic police matters unit . dw world.de : what will be discussed at the conference ? tim del vecchio : we are going to address several technical issues - what kind of technology is out there so we can conduct our investigations more effectively , what type of police training is available at no cost and is also available to states that can not afford their own police training .
most of all we want to make partnerships with the private sector .
for example , microsoft , and visa europe are participating .
visa is talking about how they can work with the credit card companies more effectively .
internet service providers from various osce member states are going to talk about how the police can work better with internet service providers . our focus is going to on the offenders more than the victims .
we have an anti-trafficking unit at the osce that focuses on the victim issues , about the after-care , what kind of therapies are available and shelters that might be available for victims if we ca n't send them home .
our role is going to be to address the police and the prosecutors . what are the measures available to fight child pornography ? one of the first places we have to start looking at is domestic legislation .
last year , we were very much involved in helping the international center for missing and exploited children , through various focus groups throughout europe , where we were looking at what the legislation consisted of .
for example : was it illegal to possess child pornography ?
was it illegal in your country to distribute child pornography ?
once police officers and prosecutors have the laws in place , then we have the tools to do our job . there are several organs fighting this type of crime , like the child exploitation and online protection center in great britain .
what kind of co-operation do you have with other organizations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim del vecchio said everybody shares the blame for child porn the osce is not an operational police unit - we do n't conduct investigations .
we are primarily a political organization that facilitates co-operation .
we are going to have police officers from austria and belgium attending and even police officers from russia .
each one of them is going to present a case study that took place recently in their country and we are going to use these three case studies as an example . what kind of difficulties did you run into , how did you solve the problems .
what kind of difficulties do we have in common ?
it is kind of a " lessons learned " identification and we also hope to have examples of good practices out of this as well .
interpol and ceop are doing a fantastic job in fighting this crime .
the problem is that it is so pervasive , and we definitely want to increase cross-border co-operation .
we do n't want an investigation to stop just because it goes across the border . why were the case studies of belgium , austria and russia chosen ? they volunteered their services .
they took time out of their investigation .
austria had a high profile case last year and we thought it would be an example of best practice .
belgium also had some high profile cases . which new technologies are being presented at the conference ? microsoft is going to talk about the child exploitation tracking software .
they have developed this because the canadian police were having difficulties with investigations in this area .
one police officer in toronto wrote to microsoft and they responded by spending $ 2 million developing a special software that police can track down pedophiles that are using the internet .
we want to make our member states aware that this is free . what about facial recognition technology ? organizations like interpol are looking at child images like a photographic fingerprint .
even if you get older or change your appearance , this technology is still going to be able to tell if it is you or not .
for example , if a man grows a beard or puts on glasses , the software is so powerful that it is still going to recognize that it is you .
this is a very useful tool in child pornography investigations .
you can tell if you are looking at the same victim in different videos , or it might be the same victim , but older than in the other videos .
it is a very good way of identifying victims and rescuing them in some circumstances . who are the perpetrators of these crimes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the eu expands cross border co-operation becomes a major issue usually , it is men .
depending on what study you look at , you get different profiles .
but one of the things that we are very concerned about is that , when we do arrest people , we 're finding that the images in their possession are of very young children .
nineteen percent of the images of offenders were found to be of children less than five years old .
so this is not a case of people looking at pornographic pictures of people that are 16 or 17 years old , we are talking about very young children . how do you view the overall situation of child pornography on the internet in the world today ? everybody shares the blame .
in the usa , there was a husband-and-wife team that was distributing child pornography through the internet in texas but all of the images were coming from various countries in eastern europe .
these people were making over a million dollars a month .
this is a case where the investigation started in america , but there are several european countries involved .
the internet is so fast , it operates at the speed of light - it is very easy to work with people and other countries instantly . i think osce has recognized that organized crime in general is a very serious threat to all 56 member states .
the distribution of child pornography is only one way that organized crime makes money .
it is very lucrative , just like drugs and stolen automobiles and the traditional organized crime activities .
but this one , of course , has a very tragic human element that the other ones do n't . why have france , spain and the united states decided to fund the conference ? these delegations came to us after the ministerial decision -lrb- in december 2006 -rrb- .
the osce recognized this as a serious threat and they were very concerned about our member states having the capacity to combat it .
they thought that it is necessary to take action very fast so they gave us donations right away because otherwise we would have to wait for budgets or bureaucratic matters to get this thing off the ground .
the ministerial decision was in december 2006 and in february we were holding meetings with these delegations to discuss a way to combat this problem .
we are very grateful for the donations . interview : renate krieger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" terrorism " is commonly - and especially since sept .
11 , 2001 , - defined and understood as an attempt by radical groups and individuals to achieve certain political aims by killing or hurting as many people as possible .
in view of the attacks in new york , madrid and london , this interpretation tends to be accepted without argument and the identity of the perpetrators is taken for granted - not only by george w. bush , but by western politicians everywhere .
osama bin laden , al qaeda , islamic jihad and similar names have long since become the embodiment of terror and terrorists .
at the same time , " terror " also means putting fear into an innocent civilian population and thus making it more receptive for the political demands that one is unable to implement any other way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp and that is exactly what we have been experiencing in germany nearly every day .
in this case , the " perpetrators " do n't come from the caves of afghanistan or the mountains along the pakistani border , but from near the black forest , rheingau or franconia .
and these " perpetrators " do n't operate from the underground , but rather as german political officials .
top politicians intimidate and frighten the germans with new visions of terror almost every day : with the danger of nuclear terror attacks , the danger that - like in manhattan - hijacked passenger airplanes could be piloted into big german cities .
or the danger that terrorists could come by boat and carry out attacks .
not to mention the danger that a seemingly incalculable mass of converts to islam has become a sort of terrorist fifth column .
the question is not if but when these grim visions will be realized claim -lsb- christian union -rsb- politicians such as interior minister wolfgang schäuble , his bavarian counterpart günther beckstein , or defense minister franz josef jung when they spread their prophecies of doom .
and thus recklessly spread fear and terror .
by now , even the union 's social democratic coalition partners in berlin take exception to it , although in the previous government it was one of them who , as federal interior minister , demanded " law and order . "
it appears to have more to do with the office than the individual to issue such warnings and to demand tightening existing laws and more power to the police as tried and tested antidotes .
it is , of course , politicians ' duty to contemplate ways to deal with possible dangers or how they could be avoided in the first place .
just as the security services - there are 38 such federal institutions in germany - naturally must contemplate those things and run through their eerie case scenarios .
the main difference is that the security services engage in these deliberations internally and not in the media .
such discussions do n't belong in public .
if they continue to be carried on there , " al qaeda " becomes superfluous .

dw-world.de political wrangling at heart of german terror debate , critics say the german defense minister 's comments about shooting down hijacked planes set off a burst of political squabbling .

" iran is trying to obtain an atomic bomb , " sarkozy said in a prime-time television interview late thursday , sept .
20 .
" that is unacceptable and i tell the french people it is unacceptable . "
the five un security council permanent members and germany are meeting in washington , dc , on friday to discuss iran .
us president george w. bush has escalated rhetoric over iran in recent weeks .
ahead of the meeting , bush insisted that " the objective , of course , is to solve this peacefully . "
french foreign minister bernard kouchner will go to the white house to discuss the issue on friday .
kouchner recently warned that a war with iran was possible , but has since insisted the statement was misunderstood .
stronger sanctions necessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says it wants nuclear technology to provide energy while sarkozy distanced himself from the threat of going to war with iran , he emphasized the need for diplomatic sanctions .
the iranian nuclear question " is an extremely difficult affair , but france does not want a war , " sarkozy said .
at their friday meeting , britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states plan to discuss a third package of tighter un sanctions against iran if it does not suspend its uranium enrichment .
" how do we convince -lsb- iran -rsb- to renounce this project ? "
sarkozy asked .
" just as the international community convinced north korea and libya to renounce theirs : through discussion , through dialogue , through sanctions .
" if sanctions are not enough , i want stronger sanctions , " sarkozy added .
leaders hope for a peaceful solution bildunterschrift : france is worried the un security council wo n't do enough since sarkozy 's election in may , france has taken an increasingly strong stand in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program , which many countries fear is an effort to build an atomic bomb .
sarkozy said he believes iran has a right to civilian nuclear technology .
bush said he 's hopeful that iran can be convinced to peacefully give up its ambitions to develop a weapons program .
" it 's imperative that we continue to work in a multilateral fashion to send that message , " bush said .
" and one place to do so is at the united nations . "
the un security council has adopted sanctions against iran which include calling on countries to stop supplying iran with nuclear-related technology and freezing assets of many people and groups related to the nuclear program .
iranian arms exports have also been banned .
the iranian regime insists it is developing the technology to provide electricity and since sanctions started has increased its enrichment activities .
sarkozy wants european sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he wo n't be visiting ground zero a senior us official told the associated press news agency that the proposed new sanctions would require countries to inspect all cargo en route to or from iran as well as freeze assets of a number of iranian banks .
the official was interviewed this summer on condition of anonymity because the negotiations were still underway .
france wants the european union to also adopt sanctions against iran if the un security council does not pass new measures .
russia and china have been unwilling to take strong action .
french presidential spokesman david martinon suggested that the measures could include " recommendations " to european companies asking them " at the very least not to bid for new markets in iran , and for financial institutions to scale back their operations , to lower their investments . "
" we would like to obtain that from all eu countries , and we are not alone in wanting to do so , " martinon said .
next week , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad will travel to new york to address the un general assembly .
the visit has sparked controversy in the us as the iranian leader is considered by washington to be an ally to islamic militants and iraqi insurgents .

dw-world.de spoke to the conference organizer . tim del vecchio is the organizer of the conference on improving law enforcement 's response to combat sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
he is a police affairs officer with the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- strategic police matters unit . dw world.de : what will be discussed at the conference ? tim del vecchio : we are going to address several technical issues - what kind of technology is out there so we can conduct our investigations more effectively , what type of police training is available at no cost and is also available to states that can not afford their own police training .
most of all we want to make partnerships with the private sector .
for example , microsoft , and visa europe are participating .
visa is talking about how they can work with the credit card companies more effectively .
internet service providers from various osce member states are going to talk about how the police can work better with internet service providers . our focus is going to on the offenders more than the victims .
we have an anti-trafficking unit at the osce that focuses on the victim issues , about the after-care , what kind of therapies are available and shelters that might be available for victims if we ca n't send them home .
our role is going to be to address the police and the prosecutors . what are the measures available to fight child pornography ? one of the first places we have to start looking at is domestic legislation .
last year , we were very much involved in helping the international center for missing and exploited children , through various focus groups throughout europe , where we were looking at what the legislation consisted of .
for example : was it illegal to possess child pornography ?
was it illegal in your country to distribute child pornography ?
once police officers and prosecutors have the laws in place , then we have the tools to do our job . there are several organs fighting this type of crime , like the child exploitation and online protection center in great britain .
what kind of co-operation do you have with other organizations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim del vecchio said everybody shares the blame for child porn the osce is not an operational police unit - we do n't conduct investigations .
we are primarily a political organization that facilitates co-operation .
we are going to have police officers from austria and belgium attending and even police officers from russia .
each one of them is going to present a case study that took place recently in their country and we are going to use these three case studies as an example . what kind of difficulties did you run into , how did you solve the problems .
what kind of difficulties do we have in common ?
it is kind of a " lessons learned " identification and we also hope to have examples of good practices out of this as well .
interpol and ceop are doing a fantastic job in fighting this crime .
the problem is that it is so pervasive , and we definitely want to increase cross-border co-operation .
we do n't want an investigation to stop just because it goes across the border . why were the case studies of belgium , austria and russia chosen ? they volunteered their services .
they took time out of their investigation .
austria had a high profile case last year and we thought it would be an example of best practice .
belgium also had some high profile cases . which new technologies are being presented at the conference ? microsoft is going to talk about the child exploitation tracking software .
they have developed this because the canadian police were having difficulties with investigations in this area .
one police officer in toronto wrote to microsoft and they responded by spending $ 2 million developing a special software that police can track down pedophiles that are using the internet .
we want to make our member states aware that this is free . what about facial recognition technology ? organizations like interpol are looking at child images like a photographic fingerprint .
even if you get older or change your appearance , this technology is still going to be able to tell if it is you or not .
for example , if a man grows a beard or puts on glasses , the software is so powerful that it is still going to recognize that it is you .
this is a very useful tool in child pornography investigations .
you can tell if you are looking at the same victim in different videos , or it might be the same victim , but older than in the other videos .
it is a very good way of identifying victims and rescuing them in some circumstances . who are the perpetrators of these crimes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the eu expands cross border co-operation becomes a major issue usually , it is men .
depending on what study you look at , you get different profiles .
but one of the things that we are very concerned about is that , when we do arrest people , we 're finding that the images in their possession are of very young children .
nineteen percent of the images of offenders were found to be of children less than five years old .
so this is not a case of people looking at pornographic pictures of people that are 16 or 17 years old , we are talking about very young children . how do you view the overall situation of child pornography on the internet in the world today ? everybody shares the blame .
in the usa , there was a husband-and-wife team that was distributing child pornography through the internet in texas but all of the images were coming from various countries in eastern europe .
these people were making over a million dollars a month .
this is a case where the investigation started in america , but there are several european countries involved .
the internet is so fast , it operates at the speed of light - it is very easy to work with people and other countries instantly . i think osce has recognized that organized crime in general is a very serious threat to all 56 member states .
the distribution of child pornography is only one way that organized crime makes money .
it is very lucrative , just like drugs and stolen automobiles and the traditional organized crime activities .
but this one , of course , has a very tragic human element that the other ones do n't . why have france , spain and the united states decided to fund the conference ? these delegations came to us after the ministerial decision -lrb- in december 2006 -rrb- .
the osce recognized this as a serious threat and they were very concerned about our member states having the capacity to combat it .
they thought that it is necessary to take action very fast so they gave us donations right away because otherwise we would have to wait for budgets or bureaucratic matters to get this thing off the ground .
the ministerial decision was in december 2006 and in february we were holding meetings with these delegations to discuss a way to combat this problem .
we are very grateful for the donations . interview : renate krieger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is a police affairs officer with the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- strategic police matters unit . dw world.de : what will be discussed at the conference ? tim del vecchio : we are going to address several technical issues - what kind of technology is out there so we can conduct our investigations more effectively , what type of police training is available at no cost and is also available to states that can not afford their own police training .
most of all we want to make partnerships with the private sector .
for example , microsoft , and visa europe are participating .
visa is talking about how they can work with the credit card companies more effectively .
internet service providers from various osce member states are going to talk about how the police can work better with internet service providers . our focus is going to on the offenders more than the victims .
we have an anti-trafficking unit at the osce that focuses on the victim issues , about the after-care , what kind of therapies are available and shelters that might be available for victims if we ca n't send them home .
our role is going to be to address the police and the prosecutors . what are the measures available to fight child pornography ? one of the first places we have to start looking at is domestic legislation .
last year , we were very much involved in helping the international center for missing and exploited children , through various focus groups throughout europe , where we were looking at what the legislation consisted of .
for example : was it illegal to possess child pornography ?
was it illegal in your country to distribute child pornography ?
once police officers and prosecutors have the laws in place , then we have the tools to do our job . there are several organs fighting this type of crime , like the child exploitation and online protection center in great britain .
what kind of co-operation do you have with other organizations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim del vecchio said everybody shares the blame for child porn the osce is not an operational police unit - we do n't conduct investigations .
we are primarily a political organization that facilitates co-operation .
we are going to have police officers from austria and belgium attending and even police officers from russia .
each one of them is going to present a case study that took place recently in their country and we are going to use these three case studies as an example . what kind of difficulties did you run into , how did you solve the problems .
what kind of difficulties do we have in common ?
it is kind of a " lessons learned " identification and we also hope to have examples of good practices out of this as well .
interpol and ceop are doing a fantastic job in fighting this crime .
the problem is that it is so pervasive , and we definitely want to increase cross-border co-operation .
we do n't want an investigation to stop just because it goes across the border . why were the case studies of belgium , austria and russia chosen ? they volunteered their services .
they took time out of their investigation .
austria had a high profile case last year and we thought it would be an example of best practice .
belgium also had some high profile cases . which new technologies are being presented at the conference ? microsoft is going to talk about the child exploitation tracking software .
they have developed this because the canadian police were having difficulties with investigations in this area .
one police officer in toronto wrote to microsoft and they responded by spending $ 2 million developing a special software that police can track down pedophiles that are using the internet .
we want to make our member states aware that this is free . what about facial recognition technology ? organizations like interpol are looking at child images like a photographic fingerprint .
even if you get older or change your appearance , this technology is still going to be able to tell if it is you or not .
for example , if a man grows a beard or puts on glasses , the software is so powerful that it is still going to recognize that it is you .
this is a very useful tool in child pornography investigations .
you can tell if you are looking at the same victim in different videos , or it might be the same victim , but older than in the other videos .
it is a very good way of identifying victims and rescuing them in some circumstances . who are the perpetrators of these crimes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the eu expands cross border co-operation becomes a major issue usually , it is men .
depending on what study you look at , you get different profiles .
but one of the things that we are very concerned about is that , when we do arrest people , we 're finding that the images in their possession are of very young children .
nineteen percent of the images of offenders were found to be of children less than five years old .
so this is not a case of people looking at pornographic pictures of people that are 16 or 17 years old , we are talking about very young children . how do you view the overall situation of child pornography on the internet in the world today ? everybody shares the blame .
in the usa , there was a husband-and-wife team that was distributing child pornography through the internet in texas but all of the images were coming from various countries in eastern europe .
these people were making over a million dollars a month .
this is a case where the investigation started in america , but there are several european countries involved .
the internet is so fast , it operates at the speed of light - it is very easy to work with people and other countries instantly . i think osce has recognized that organized crime in general is a very serious threat to all 56 member states .
the distribution of child pornography is only one way that organized crime makes money .
it is very lucrative , just like drugs and stolen automobiles and the traditional organized crime activities .
but this one , of course , has a very tragic human element that the other ones do n't . why have france , spain and the united states decided to fund the conference ? these delegations came to us after the ministerial decision -lrb- in december 2006 -rrb- .
the osce recognized this as a serious threat and they were very concerned about our member states having the capacity to combat it .
they thought that it is necessary to take action very fast so they gave us donations right away because otherwise we would have to wait for budgets or bureaucratic matters to get this thing off the ground .
the ministerial decision was in december 2006 and in february we were holding meetings with these delegations to discuss a way to combat this problem .
we are very grateful for the donations . interview : renate krieger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 21.09.2007 opinion : german politicians create terror as they warn of it großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with their alarmist comments to the media about impending terror attacks , interior minister schäuble and other german politicians are spreading fear and terror , says peter philipp . " terrorism " is commonly - and especially since sept .
11 , 2001 , - defined and understood as an attempt by radical groups and individuals to achieve certain political aims by killing or hurting as many people as possible .
in view of the attacks in new york , madrid and london , this interpretation tends to be accepted without argument and the identity of the perpetrators is taken for granted - not only by george w. bush , but by western politicians everywhere .
osama bin laden , al qaeda , islamic jihad and similar names have long since become the embodiment of terror and terrorists .
at the same time , " terror " also means putting fear into an innocent civilian population and thus making it more receptive for the political demands that one is unable to implement any other way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp and that is exactly what we have been experiencing in germany nearly every day .
in this case , the " perpetrators " do n't come from the caves of afghanistan or the mountains along the pakistani border , but from near the black forest , rheingau or franconia .
and these " perpetrators " do n't operate from the underground , but rather as german political officials .
top politicians intimidate and frighten the germans with new visions of terror almost every day : with the danger of nuclear terror attacks , the danger that - like in manhattan - hijacked passenger airplanes could be piloted into big german cities .
or the danger that terrorists could come by boat and carry out attacks .
not to mention the danger that a seemingly incalculable mass of converts to islam has become a sort of terrorist fifth column .
the question is not if but when these grim visions will be realized claim -lsb- christian union -rsb- politicians such as interior minister wolfgang schäuble , his bavarian counterpart günther beckstein , or defense minister franz josef jung when they spread their prophecies of doom .
and thus recklessly spread fear and terror .
by now , even the union 's social democratic coalition partners in berlin take exception to it , although in the previous government it was one of them who , as federal interior minister , demanded " law and order . "
it appears to have more to do with the office than the individual to issue such warnings and to demand tightening existing laws and more power to the police as tried and tested antidotes .
it is , of course , politicians ' duty to contemplate ways to deal with possible dangers or how they could be avoided in the first place .
just as the security services - there are 38 such federal institutions in germany - naturally must contemplate those things and run through their eerie case scenarios .
the main difference is that the security services engage in these deliberations internally and not in the media .
such discussions do n't belong in public .
if they continue to be carried on there , " al qaeda " becomes superfluous .

dw-world.de political wrangling at heart of german terror debate , critics say the german defense minister 's comments about shooting down hijacked planes set off a burst of political squabbling .
but the debate raises important issues , even if it 's motivated by political maneuvering , observers say .
-lrb- 17.09.2007 -rrb- terror case throws spotlight on german converts to islam two of the men held in connection with a plot to bomb us military installations and other targets in germany are converts to islam .
it has raised the question of whether converts are more likely to become radicalized .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 21.09.2007 germany paves way for first census in 20 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : statisticians think there may be over a million fewer people in germany germany 's parliament has cleared the way for the first census in decades .
the tally is n't expected to provoke storms of protest as it did in the past .
but it could show that there are fewer people in the country . the census will begin in 2011 , the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , decided on thursday , sept .
21 .
this time , though , officials wo n't be knocking on the doors of each and every one of the estimated 82 million german residents .
instead , they will focus their queries on around 6 million people as well as the country 's 17.5 million property owners .
they will be asked their place of birth , age , gender , nationality and marital status as well as questions about their household , working life and education .
germany 's current population statistics are extrapolations based on the last censuses .
the country 's statisticians think there may actually be 1.3 million fewer people living in germany in total and around half a million fewer foreigners than official calculations say .
the preparatory legislation on the census passed with the votes of the two government parties , the christian democrats and social democrats , in the bundestag , while the green party and the free-market liberal fdp abstained .
data protection czar unconcerned fdp politician sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former federal justice minister , said she and her colleagues thought the details of the census had not yet been adequately clarified .
" we do n't want to issue a carte blanche as long as these questions are still open , " the süddeutsche zeitung daily quoted her as saying .
the left party opposed the bill .

dw-world.de spoke to thomas bunge , a member of the german delegation , who was part of the historic event . thomas bunge represented germany 's federal environment agency in drawing up the " montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer " in september 1987 .
the lawyer is currently responsible for environment and spatial planning at the agency .
dw-world.de : why was the 1987 montreal protocol so significant ?
thomas bunge : that was the beginning of international regulations to protect the earth 's atmosphere .
until then , there was only regulation of long-range , transnational air pollution .
people tried for the first time to resolve a worldwide problem through international law , although in retrospect , the regulations then were certainly inadequate .
can you briefly explain why they were inadequate ?
the regulations agreed in 1987 were supposed to reduce the production and use of substances that damaged the ozone layer by a maximum of only up to 50 percent .
but people very quickly noticed that that was n't enough to effectively protect the ozone layer .
in 1990 , that is , a year after the regulations came into effect , the stipulations had already been tightened .
the decision was made to entirely discontinue production and use by the year 2000 .
in 1994 , the deadlines were again shortened .
thus people wanted , and still want , to relatively quickly achieve a full discontinuation of production , and also of use , of the substances .
it 's true that developing countries currently the still have the right to produce and use the substances in small amounts .
but relatively soon the use and the production will be discontinued worldwide .
can you describe how things came about ?
how is such a compromise reached ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bunge as is normally the case in the realm of international law , there are specific working groups for the individual application areas one aims to regulate .
the building blocks for such an international treaty are worked out in the groups .
the individual building blocks must then be voted on and approved in the plenum .
that is , as in all cases , a compromise between the interests that the individual states represent at these conferences , of course .
the whole thing was fleshed out with science and the scientific results available up until the signing in 1987 were included .
the interests of the individual states and the scientific results were then put in relation .
that led to a compromise with which one was at the time not particularly happy .
can you provide an example of a practical problem that had to be overcome ?
did particular countries block movement ?
it was several blocks of states .
the eu comprised its own negotiation block .
of course , that was significantly fewer states than today .
there was a so-called " toronto group " of states .
they represented the scandinavian states , canada , australia and switzerland .
this group with australia and new zealand , which would have been affected the soonest by the consequences of the hole in the ozone layer - and then was affected - wanted to pass very wide-reaching regulations .
on the other side , there was an array of industrial countries that produced these substances .
they were naturally interested in continuing production or being able to produce appropriate substitutes .
how was the atmosphere among the conference participants on sept .
16 , 1987 , when the protocol was passed ?
people were pleased that a compromise had been reached .
but we had already seen that the rules were n't sufficient for the next 20 , 30 , 40 years .
we recognized that the progressive states also had had to swallow some bitter pills .
but in retrospect , it was a success , of course , to very quickly bring very many countries on board on trade regulations that envisaged limitations on trade with countries that were n't party to the treaty .
in this way , one had a model for the negotiations on climate regulations that started relatively soon thereafter . interview : martin hoffmann -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to thomas bunge , a member of the german delegation , who was part of the historic event . thomas bunge represented germany 's federal environment agency in drawing up the " montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer " in september 1987 .
the lawyer is currently responsible for environment and spatial planning at the agency .
dw-world.de : why was the 1987 montreal protocol so significant ?
thomas bunge : that was the beginning of international regulations to protect the earth 's atmosphere .
until then , there was only regulation of long-range , transnational air pollution .
people tried for the first time to resolve a worldwide problem through international law , although in retrospect , the regulations then were certainly inadequate .
can you briefly explain why they were inadequate ?
the regulations agreed in 1987 were supposed to reduce the production and use of substances that damaged the ozone layer by a maximum of only up to 50 percent .
but people very quickly noticed that that was n't enough to effectively protect the ozone layer .
in 1990 , that is , a year after the regulations came into effect , the stipulations had already been tightened .
the decision was made to entirely discontinue production and use by the year 2000 .
in 1994 , the deadlines were again shortened .
thus people wanted , and still want , to relatively quickly achieve a full discontinuation of production , and also of use , of the substances .
it 's true that developing countries currently the still have the right to produce and use the substances in small amounts .
but relatively soon the use and the production will be discontinued worldwide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 21.09.2007 opinion : german politicians create terror as they warn of it großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with their alarmist comments to the media about impending terror attacks , interior minister schäuble and other german politicians are spreading fear and terror , says peter philipp . " terrorism " is commonly - and especially since sept .
11 , 2001 , - defined and understood as an attempt by radical groups and individuals to achieve certain political aims by killing or hurting as many people as possible .
in view of the attacks in new york , madrid and london , this interpretation tends to be accepted without argument and the identity of the perpetrators is taken for granted - not only by george w. bush , but by western politicians everywhere .
osama bin laden , al qaeda , islamic jihad and similar names have long since become the embodiment of terror and terrorists .
at the same time , " terror " also means putting fear into an innocent civilian population and thus making it more receptive for the political demands that one is unable to implement any other way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp and that is exactly what we have been experiencing in germany nearly every day .
in this case , the " perpetrators " do n't come from the caves of afghanistan or the mountains along the pakistani border , but from near the black forest , rheingau or franconia .
and these " perpetrators " do n't operate from the underground , but rather as german political officials .
top politicians intimidate and frighten the germans with new visions of terror almost every day : with the danger of nuclear terror attacks , the danger that - like in manhattan - hijacked passenger airplanes could be piloted into big german cities .
or the danger that terrorists could come by boat and carry out attacks .
not to mention the danger that a seemingly incalculable mass of converts to islam has become a sort of terrorist fifth column .
the question is not if but when these grim visions will be realized claim -lsb- christian union -rsb- politicians such as interior minister wolfgang schäuble , his bavarian counterpart günther beckstein , or defense minister franz josef jung when they spread their prophecies of doom .
and thus recklessly spread fear and terror .
by now , even the union 's social democratic coalition partners in berlin take exception to it , although in the previous government it was one of them who , as federal interior minister , demanded " law and order . "
it appears to have more to do with the office than the individual to issue such warnings and to demand tightening existing laws and more power to the police as tried and tested antidotes .
it is , of course , politicians ' duty to contemplate ways to deal with possible dangers or how they could be avoided in the first place .
just as the security services - there are 38 such federal institutions in germany - naturally must contemplate those things and run through their eerie case scenarios .
the main difference is that the security services engage in these deliberations internally and not in the media .
such discussions do n't belong in public .
if they continue to be carried on there , " al qaeda " becomes superfluous .

dw-world.de political wrangling at heart of german terror debate , critics say the german defense minister 's comments about shooting down hijacked planes set off a burst of political squabbling .
but the debate raises important issues , even if it 's motivated by political maneuvering , observers say .
-lrb- 17.09.2007 -rrb- terror case throws spotlight on german converts to islam two of the men held in connection with a plot to bomb us military installations and other targets in germany are converts to islam .
it has raised the question of whether converts are more likely to become radicalized .
-lrb- 11.09.2007 -rrb- debate on terror in germany highlights political divisions just days after german security forces thwarted a " massive " terror attack , the country 's state interior ministers met to discuss the current terrorist threat .
however , divisions remained on a number of issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 21.09.2007 opinion : german politicians create terror as they warn of it großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with their alarmist comments to the media about impending terror attacks , interior minister schäuble and other german politicians are spreading fear and terror , says peter philipp . " terrorism " is commonly - and especially since sept .
11 , 2001 , - defined and understood as an attempt by radical groups and individuals to achieve certain political aims by killing or hurting as many people as possible .
in view of the attacks in new york , madrid and london , this interpretation tends to be accepted without argument and the identity of the perpetrators is taken for granted - not only by george w. bush , but by western politicians everywhere .
osama bin laden , al qaeda , islamic jihad and similar names have long since become the embodiment of terror and terrorists .
at the same time , " terror " also means putting fear into an innocent civilian population and thus making it more receptive for the political demands that one is unable to implement any other way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp and that is exactly what we have been experiencing in germany nearly every day .
in this case , the " perpetrators " do n't come from the caves of afghanistan or the mountains along the pakistani border , but from near the black forest , rheingau or franconia .
and these " perpetrators " do n't operate from the underground , but rather as german political officials .
top politicians intimidate and frighten the germans with new visions of terror almost every day : with the danger of nuclear terror attacks , the danger that - like in manhattan - hijacked passenger airplanes could be piloted into big german cities .
or the danger that terrorists could come by boat and carry out attacks .
not to mention the danger that a seemingly incalculable mass of converts to islam has become a sort of terrorist fifth column .
the question is not if but when these grim visions will be realized claim -lsb- christian union -rsb- politicians such as interior minister wolfgang schäuble , his bavarian counterpart günther beckstein , or defense minister franz josef jung when they spread their prophecies of doom .
and thus recklessly spread fear and terror .
by now , even the union 's social democratic coalition partners in berlin take exception to it , although in the previous government it was one of them who , as federal interior minister , demanded " law and order . "
it appears to have more to do with the office than the individual to issue such warnings and to demand tightening existing laws and more power to the police as tried and tested antidotes .
it is , of course , politicians ' duty to contemplate ways to deal with possible dangers or how they could be avoided in the first place .
just as the security services - there are 38 such federal institutions in germany - naturally must contemplate those things and run through their eerie case scenarios .
the main difference is that the security services engage in these deliberations internally and not in the media .
such discussions do n't belong in public .
if they continue to be carried on there , " al qaeda " becomes superfluous .

the tally is n't expected to provoke storms of protest as it did in the past .
but it could show that there are fewer people in the country . the census will begin in 2011 , the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , decided on thursday , sept .
21 .
this time , though , officials wo n't be knocking on the doors of each and every one of the estimated 82 million german residents .
instead , they will focus their queries on around 6 million people as well as the country 's 17.5 million property owners .
they will be asked their place of birth , age , gender , nationality and marital status as well as questions about their household , working life and education .
germany 's current population statistics are extrapolations based on the last censuses .
the country 's statisticians think there may actually be 1.3 million fewer people living in germany in total and around half a million fewer foreigners than official calculations say .
the preparatory legislation on the census passed with the votes of the two government parties , the christian democrats and social democrats , in the bundestag , while the green party and the free-market liberal fdp abstained .
data protection czar unconcerned fdp politician sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former federal justice minister , said she and her colleagues thought the details of the census had not yet been adequately clarified .
" we do n't want to issue a carte blanche as long as these questions are still open , " the süddeutsche zeitung daily quoted her as saying .
the left party opposed the bill .
its domestic expert , jan korte , said the data collected would not be secure and that it was unclear how it would be used , according to the paper .
however , germany 's data protection czar , peter schaar , said the census plans were in line with the constitution and would not unnecessarily intrude on citizens ' privacy rights .
internet opens doors to census bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowadays people are less concerned about leaving a trace the last census took place in 1987 in west germany and in 1981 in east germany .
the west german census was accompanied by calls for boycott from people who were concerned the tally would lead the way to a surveillance state .
census takers were tasked with collected data from all german residents .
little resistance is expected this time around : with the widespread use of credit cards and the internet , germans generally find it acceptable to allow freer access to their personal data .
germany 's highest court has also ruled that informants ' family names must be deleted from the data as soon as possible .
all census information that could make residents recognizable must be erased when it is no longer needed by the statisticians .
berlin 's plans for a new census will ensure it complies with european union requirements .
both the eu and germany use population levels to determine the amount of subsidies regions receive as well as numbers of political representatives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 21.09.2007 opinion : german politicians create terror as they warn of it großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with their alarmist comments to the media about impending terror attacks , interior minister schäuble and other german politicians are spreading fear and terror , says peter philipp . " terrorism " is commonly - and especially since sept .
11 , 2001 , - defined and understood as an attempt by radical groups and individuals to achieve certain political aims by killing or hurting as many people as possible .
in view of the attacks in new york , madrid and london , this interpretation tends to be accepted without argument and the identity of the perpetrators is taken for granted - not only by george w. bush , but by western politicians everywhere .
osama bin laden , al qaeda , islamic jihad and similar names have long since become the embodiment of terror and terrorists .
at the same time , " terror " also means putting fear into an innocent civilian population and thus making it more receptive for the political demands that one is unable to implement any other way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp and that is exactly what we have been experiencing in germany nearly every day .
in this case , the " perpetrators " do n't come from the caves of afghanistan or the mountains along the pakistani border , but from near the black forest , rheingau or franconia .
and these " perpetrators " do n't operate from the underground , but rather as german political officials .
top politicians intimidate and frighten the germans with new visions of terror almost every day : with the danger of nuclear terror attacks , the danger that - like in manhattan - hijacked passenger airplanes could be piloted into big german cities .
or the danger that terrorists could come by boat and carry out attacks .
not to mention the danger that a seemingly incalculable mass of converts to islam has become a sort of terrorist fifth column .
the question is not if but when these grim visions will be realized claim -lsb- christian union -rsb- politicians such as interior minister wolfgang schäuble , his bavarian counterpart günther beckstein , or defense minister franz josef jung when they spread their prophecies of doom .
and thus recklessly spread fear and terror .
by now , even the union 's social democratic coalition partners in berlin take exception to it , although in the previous government it was one of them who , as federal interior minister , demanded " law and order . "
it appears to have more to do with the office than the individual to issue such warnings and to demand tightening existing laws and more power to the police as tried and tested antidotes .
it is , of course , politicians ' duty to contemplate ways to deal with possible dangers or how they could be avoided in the first place .
just as the security services - there are 38 such federal institutions in germany - naturally must contemplate those things and run through their eerie case scenarios .
the main difference is that the security services engage in these deliberations internally and not in the media .
such discussions do n't belong in public .
if they continue to be carried on there , " al qaeda " becomes superfluous .

dw-world.de political wrangling at heart of german terror debate , critics say the german defense minister 's comments about shooting down hijacked planes set off a burst of political squabbling .
but the debate raises important issues , even if it 's motivated by political maneuvering , observers say .
-lrb- 17.09.2007 -rrb- terror case throws spotlight on german converts to islam two of the men held in connection with a plot to bomb us military installations and other targets in germany are converts to islam .
it has raised the question of whether converts are more likely to become radicalized .
-lrb- 11.09.2007 -rrb- debate on terror in germany highlights political divisions just days after german security forces thwarted a " massive " terror attack , the country 's state interior ministers met to discuss the current terrorist threat .
however , divisions remained on a number of issues .

dw-world.de spoke to the conference organizer . tim del vecchio is the organizer of the conference on improving law enforcement 's response to combat sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
he is a police affairs officer with the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- strategic police matters unit . dw world.de : what will be discussed at the conference ? tim del vecchio : we are going to address several technical issues - what kind of technology is out there so we can conduct our investigations more effectively , what type of police training is available at no cost and is also available to states that can not afford their own police training .
most of all we want to make partnerships with the private sector .
for example , microsoft , and visa europe are participating .
visa is talking about how they can work with the credit card companies more effectively .
internet service providers from various osce member states are going to talk about how the police can work better with internet service providers . our focus is going to on the offenders more than the victims .
we have an anti-trafficking unit at the osce that focuses on the victim issues , about the after-care , what kind of therapies are available and shelters that might be available for victims if we ca n't send them home .
our role is going to be to address the police and the prosecutors . what are the measures available to fight child pornography ? one of the first places we have to start looking at is domestic legislation .
last year , we were very much involved in helping the international center for missing and exploited children , through various focus groups throughout europe , where we were looking at what the legislation consisted of .
for example : was it illegal to possess child pornography ?
was it illegal in your country to distribute child pornography ?
once police officers and prosecutors have the laws in place , then we have the tools to do our job . there are several organs fighting this type of crime , like the child exploitation and online protection center in great britain .
what kind of co-operation do you have with other organizations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim del vecchio said everybody shares the blame for child porn the osce is not an operational police unit - we do n't conduct investigations .
we are primarily a political organization that facilitates co-operation .
we are going to have police officers from austria and belgium attending and even police officers from russia .
each one of them is going to present a case study that took place recently in their country and we are going to use these three case studies as an example . what kind of difficulties did you run into , how did you solve the problems .
what kind of difficulties do we have in common ?
it is kind of a " lessons learned " identification and we also hope to have examples of good practices out of this as well .
interpol and ceop are doing a fantastic job in fighting this crime .
the problem is that it is so pervasive , and we definitely want to increase cross-border co-operation .
we do n't want an investigation to stop just because it goes across the border . why were the case studies of belgium , austria and russia chosen ? they volunteered their services .
they took time out of their investigation .
austria had a high profile case last year and we thought it would be an example of best practice .
belgium also had some high profile cases . which new technologies are being presented at the conference ? microsoft is going to talk about the child exploitation tracking software .
they have developed this because the canadian police were having difficulties with investigations in this area .
one police officer in toronto wrote to microsoft and they responded by spending $ 2 million developing a special software that police can track down pedophiles that are using the internet .
we want to make our member states aware that this is free . what about facial recognition technology ? organizations like interpol are looking at child images like a photographic fingerprint .
even if you get older or change your appearance , this technology is still going to be able to tell if it is you or not .
for example , if a man grows a beard or puts on glasses , the software is so powerful that it is still going to recognize that it is you .
this is a very useful tool in child pornography investigations .
you can tell if you are looking at the same victim in different videos , or it might be the same victim , but older than in the other videos .
it is a very good way of identifying victims and rescuing them in some circumstances . who are the perpetrators of these crimes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the eu expands cross border co-operation becomes a major issue usually , it is men .
depending on what study you look at , you get different profiles .
but one of the things that we are very concerned about is that , when we do arrest people , we 're finding that the images in their possession are of very young children .
nineteen percent of the images of offenders were found to be of children less than five years old .
so this is not a case of people looking at pornographic pictures of people that are 16 or 17 years old , we are talking about very young children . how do you view the overall situation of child pornography on the internet in the world today ? everybody shares the blame .
in the usa , there was a husband-and-wife team that was distributing child pornography through the internet in texas but all of the images were coming from various countries in eastern europe .
these people were making over a million dollars a month .
this is a case where the investigation started in america , but there are several european countries involved .
the internet is so fast , it operates at the speed of light - it is very easy to work with people and other countries instantly . i think osce has recognized that organized crime in general is a very serious threat to all 56 member states .
the distribution of child pornography is only one way that organized crime makes money .
it is very lucrative , just like drugs and stolen automobiles and the traditional organized crime activities .
but this one , of course , has a very tragic human element that the other ones do n't . why have france , spain and the united states decided to fund the conference ? these delegations came to us after the ministerial decision -lrb- in december 2006 -rrb- .
the osce recognized this as a serious threat and they were very concerned about our member states having the capacity to combat it .
they thought that it is necessary to take action very fast so they gave us donations right away because otherwise we would have to wait for budgets or bureaucratic matters to get this thing off the ground .
the ministerial decision was in december 2006 and in february we were holding meetings with these delegations to discuss a way to combat this problem .

dw-world.de spoke to the conference organizer . tim del vecchio is the organizer of the conference on improving law enforcement 's response to combat sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
he is a police affairs officer with the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- strategic police matters unit . dw world.de : what will be discussed at the conference ? tim del vecchio : we are going to address several technical issues - what kind of technology is out there so we can conduct our investigations more effectively , what type of police training is available at no cost and is also available to states that can not afford their own police training .
most of all we want to make partnerships with the private sector .
for example , microsoft , and visa europe are participating .
visa is talking about how they can work with the credit card companies more effectively .
internet service providers from various osce member states are going to talk about how the police can work better with internet service providers . our focus is going to on the offenders more than the victims .
we have an anti-trafficking unit at the osce that focuses on the victim issues , about the after-care , what kind of therapies are available and shelters that might be available for victims if we ca n't send them home .
our role is going to be to address the police and the prosecutors . what are the measures available to fight child pornography ? one of the first places we have to start looking at is domestic legislation .
last year , we were very much involved in helping the international center for missing and exploited children , through various focus groups throughout europe , where we were looking at what the legislation consisted of .
for example : was it illegal to possess child pornography ?
was it illegal in your country to distribute child pornography ?
once police officers and prosecutors have the laws in place , then we have the tools to do our job . there are several organs fighting this type of crime , like the child exploitation and online protection center in great britain .
what kind of co-operation do you have with other organizations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim del vecchio said everybody shares the blame for child porn the osce is not an operational police unit - we do n't conduct investigations .
we are primarily a political organization that facilitates co-operation .

" iran is trying to obtain an atomic bomb , " sarkozy said in a prime-time television interview late thursday , sept .
20 .
" that is unacceptable and i tell the french people it is unacceptable . "
the five un security council permanent members and germany are meeting in washington , dc , on friday to discuss iran .
us president george w. bush has escalated rhetoric over iran in recent weeks .
ahead of the meeting , bush insisted that " the objective , of course , is to solve this peacefully . "
french foreign minister bernard kouchner will go to the white house to discuss the issue on friday .
kouchner recently warned that a war with iran was possible , but has since insisted the statement was misunderstood .
stronger sanctions necessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says it wants nuclear technology to provide energy while sarkozy distanced himself from the threat of going to war with iran , he emphasized the need for diplomatic sanctions .
the iranian nuclear question " is an extremely difficult affair , but france does not want a war , " sarkozy said .
at their friday meeting , britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states plan to discuss a third package of tighter un sanctions against iran if it does not suspend its uranium enrichment .
" how do we convince -lsb- iran -rsb- to renounce this project ? "
sarkozy asked .
" just as the international community convinced north korea and libya to renounce theirs : through discussion , through dialogue , through sanctions .
" if sanctions are not enough , i want stronger sanctions , " sarkozy added .
leaders hope for a peaceful solution bildunterschrift : france is worried the un security council wo n't do enough since sarkozy 's election in may , france has taken an increasingly strong stand in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program , which many countries fear is an effort to build an atomic bomb .
sarkozy said he believes iran has a right to civilian nuclear technology .
bush said he 's hopeful that iran can be convinced to peacefully give up its ambitions to develop a weapons program .
" it 's imperative that we continue to work in a multilateral fashion to send that message , " bush said .
" and one place to do so is at the united nations . "
the un security council has adopted sanctions against iran which include calling on countries to stop supplying iran with nuclear-related technology and freezing assets of many people and groups related to the nuclear program .
iranian arms exports have also been banned .
the iranian regime insists it is developing the technology to provide electricity and since sanctions started has increased its enrichment activities .
sarkozy wants european sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he wo n't be visiting ground zero a senior us official told the associated press news agency that the proposed new sanctions would require countries to inspect all cargo en route to or from iran as well as freeze assets of a number of iranian banks .
the official was interviewed this summer on condition of anonymity because the negotiations were still underway .
france wants the european union to also adopt sanctions against iran if the un security council does not pass new measures .
russia and china have been unwilling to take strong action .
french presidential spokesman david martinon suggested that the measures could include " recommendations " to european companies asking them " at the very least not to bid for new markets in iran , and for financial institutions to scale back their operations , to lower their investments . "
" we would like to obtain that from all eu countries , and we are not alone in wanting to do so , " martinon said .
next week , iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad will travel to new york to address the un general assembly .
the visit has sparked controversy in the us as the iranian leader is considered by washington to be an ally to islamic militants and iraqi insurgents .
ahmadinejad had asked to tour ground zero , the site of the sept .

" that is unacceptable and i tell the french people it is unacceptable . "
the five un security council permanent members and germany are meeting in washington , dc , on friday to discuss iran .
us president george w. bush has escalated rhetoric over iran in recent weeks .
ahead of the meeting , bush insisted that " the objective , of course , is to solve this peacefully . "
french foreign minister bernard kouchner will go to the white house to discuss the issue on friday .
kouchner recently warned that a war with iran was possible , but has since insisted the statement was misunderstood .
stronger sanctions necessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says it wants nuclear technology to provide energy while sarkozy distanced himself from the threat of going to war with iran , he emphasized the need for diplomatic sanctions .
the iranian nuclear question " is an extremely difficult affair , but france does not want a war , " sarkozy said .
at their friday meeting , britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states plan to discuss a third package of tighter un sanctions against iran if it does not suspend its uranium enrichment .
" how do we convince -lsb- iran -rsb- to renounce this project ? "
sarkozy asked .

the un security council has adopted sanctions against iran which include calling on countries to stop supplying iran with nuclear-related technology and freezing assets of many people and groups related to the nuclear program .

the official was interviewed this summer on condition of anonymity because the negotiations were still underway .
france wants the european union to also adopt sanctions against iran if the un security council does not pass new measures .
russia and china have been unwilling to take strong action .
french presidential spokesman david martinon suggested that the measures could include " recommendations " to european companies asking them " at the very least not to bid for new markets in iran , and for financial institutions to scale back their operations , to lower their investments . "
" we would like to obtain that from all eu countries , and we are not alone in wanting to do so , " martinon said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 21.09.2007 combating child porn conference focuses on new technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : training police officers will be a focus of the conference the use of new technologies and better cross border co-operation is the focus of a conference aimed at combating the sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
dw-world.de spoke to the conference organizer . tim del vecchio is the organizer of the conference on improving law enforcement 's response to combat sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
he is a police affairs officer with the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- strategic police matters unit . dw world.de : what will be discussed at the conference ? tim del vecchio : we are going to address several technical issues - what kind of technology is out there so we can conduct our investigations more effectively , what type of police training is available at no cost and is also available to states that can not afford their own police training .
most of all we want to make partnerships with the private sector .
for example , microsoft , and visa europe are participating .
visa is talking about how they can work with the credit card companies more effectively .
internet service providers from various osce member states are going to talk about how the police can work better with internet service providers . our focus is going to on the offenders more than the victims .
we have an anti-trafficking unit at the osce that focuses on the victim issues , about the after-care , what kind of therapies are available and shelters that might be available for victims if we ca n't send them home .
our role is going to be to address the police and the prosecutors . what are the measures available to fight child pornography ? one of the first places we have to start looking at is domestic legislation .
last year , we were very much involved in helping the international center for missing and exploited children , through various focus groups throughout europe , where we were looking at what the legislation consisted of .
for example : was it illegal to possess child pornography ?
was it illegal in your country to distribute child pornography ?
once police officers and prosecutors have the laws in place , then we have the tools to do our job . there are several organs fighting this type of crime , like the child exploitation and online protection center in great britain .
what kind of co-operation do you have with other organizations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim del vecchio said everybody shares the blame for child porn the osce is not an operational police unit - we do n't conduct investigations .
we are primarily a political organization that facilitates co-operation .
we are going to have police officers from austria and belgium attending and even police officers from russia .
each one of them is going to present a case study that took place recently in their country and we are going to use these three case studies as an example . what kind of difficulties did you run into , how did you solve the problems .
what kind of difficulties do we have in common ?
it is kind of a " lessons learned " identification and we also hope to have examples of good practices out of this as well .
interpol and ceop are doing a fantastic job in fighting this crime .
the problem is that it is so pervasive , and we definitely want to increase cross-border co-operation .
we do n't want an investigation to stop just because it goes across the border . why were the case studies of belgium , austria and russia chosen ? they volunteered their services .
they took time out of their investigation .
austria had a high profile case last year and we thought it would be an example of best practice .
belgium also had some high profile cases . which new technologies are being presented at the conference ? microsoft is going to talk about the child exploitation tracking software .
they have developed this because the canadian police were having difficulties with investigations in this area .
one police officer in toronto wrote to microsoft and they responded by spending $ 2 million developing a special software that police can track down pedophiles that are using the internet .
we want to make our member states aware that this is free . what about facial recognition technology ? organizations like interpol are looking at child images like a photographic fingerprint .
even if you get older or change your appearance , this technology is still going to be able to tell if it is you or not .
for example , if a man grows a beard or puts on glasses , the software is so powerful that it is still going to recognize that it is you .
this is a very useful tool in child pornography investigations .
you can tell if you are looking at the same victim in different videos , or it might be the same victim , but older than in the other videos .
it is a very good way of identifying victims and rescuing them in some circumstances . who are the perpetrators of these crimes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the eu expands cross border co-operation becomes a major issue usually , it is men .
depending on what study you look at , you get different profiles .
but one of the things that we are very concerned about is that , when we do arrest people , we 're finding that the images in their possession are of very young children .
nineteen percent of the images of offenders were found to be of children less than five years old .
so this is not a case of people looking at pornographic pictures of people that are 16 or 17 years old , we are talking about very young children . how do you view the overall situation of child pornography on the internet in the world today ? everybody shares the blame .
in the usa , there was a husband-and-wife team that was distributing child pornography through the internet in texas but all of the images were coming from various countries in eastern europe .
these people were making over a million dollars a month .
this is a case where the investigation started in america , but there are several european countries involved .
the internet is so fast , it operates at the speed of light - it is very easy to work with people and other countries instantly . i think osce has recognized that organized crime in general is a very serious threat to all 56 member states .
the distribution of child pornography is only one way that organized crime makes money .
it is very lucrative , just like drugs and stolen automobiles and the traditional organized crime activities .
but this one , of course , has a very tragic human element that the other ones do n't . why have france , spain and the united states decided to fund the conference ? these delegations came to us after the ministerial decision -lrb- in december 2006 -rrb- .
the osce recognized this as a serious threat and they were very concerned about our member states having the capacity to combat it .
they thought that it is necessary to take action very fast so they gave us donations right away because otherwise we would have to wait for budgets or bureaucratic matters to get this thing off the ground .
the ministerial decision was in december 2006 and in february we were holding meetings with these delegations to discuss a way to combat this problem .
we are very grateful for the donations . interview : renate krieger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de internet home to most child sex crimes , expert says ahead of a conference aimed at combating the sexual exploitation of children on the internet , dw-world.de spoke to a german police investigator who used creative methods to crack a child pornography ring .

the tally is n't expected to provoke storms of protest as it did in the past .
but it could show that there are fewer people in the country . the census will begin in 2011 , the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , decided on thursday , sept .
21 .
this time , though , officials wo n't be knocking on the doors of each and every one of the estimated 82 million german residents .
instead , they will focus their queries on around 6 million people as well as the country 's 17.5 million property owners .
they will be asked their place of birth , age , gender , nationality and marital status as well as questions about their household , working life and education .
germany 's current population statistics are extrapolations based on the last censuses .
the country 's statisticians think there may actually be 1.3 million fewer people living in germany in total and around half a million fewer foreigners than official calculations say .
the preparatory legislation on the census passed with the votes of the two government parties , the christian democrats and social democrats , in the bundestag , while the green party and the free-market liberal fdp abstained .
data protection czar unconcerned fdp politician sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former federal justice minister , said she and her colleagues thought the details of the census had not yet been adequately clarified .
" we do n't want to issue a carte blanche as long as these questions are still open , " the süddeutsche zeitung daily quoted her as saying .
the left party opposed the bill .
its domestic expert , jan korte , said the data collected would not be secure and that it was unclear how it would be used , according to the paper .
however , germany 's data protection czar , peter schaar , said the census plans were in line with the constitution and would not unnecessarily intrude on citizens ' privacy rights .
internet opens doors to census bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowadays people are less concerned about leaving a trace the last census took place in 1987 in west germany and in 1981 in east germany .
the west german census was accompanied by calls for boycott from people who were concerned the tally would lead the way to a surveillance state .
census takers were tasked with collected data from all german residents .
little resistance is expected this time around : with the widespread use of credit cards and the internet , germans generally find it acceptable to allow freer access to their personal data .
germany 's highest court has also ruled that informants ' family names must be deleted from the data as soon as possible .
all census information that could make residents recognizable must be erased when it is no longer needed by the statisticians .
berlin 's plans for a new census will ensure it complies with european union requirements .
both the eu and germany use population levels to determine the amount of subsidies regions receive as well as numbers of political representatives .
the census is expected to cost around 450 million euros -lrb- $ 630 million -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 21.09.2007 combating child porn conference focuses on new technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : training police officers will be a focus of the conference the use of new technologies and better cross border co-operation is the focus of a conference aimed at combating the sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
dw-world.de spoke to the conference organizer . tim del vecchio is the organizer of the conference on improving law enforcement 's response to combat sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
he is a police affairs officer with the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- strategic police matters unit . dw world.de : what will be discussed at the conference ? tim del vecchio : we are going to address several technical issues - what kind of technology is out there so we can conduct our investigations more effectively , what type of police training is available at no cost and is also available to states that can not afford their own police training .
most of all we want to make partnerships with the private sector .
for example , microsoft , and visa europe are participating .
visa is talking about how they can work with the credit card companies more effectively .
internet service providers from various osce member states are going to talk about how the police can work better with internet service providers . our focus is going to on the offenders more than the victims .
we have an anti-trafficking unit at the osce that focuses on the victim issues , about the after-care , what kind of therapies are available and shelters that might be available for victims if we ca n't send them home .
our role is going to be to address the police and the prosecutors . what are the measures available to fight child pornography ? one of the first places we have to start looking at is domestic legislation .
last year , we were very much involved in helping the international center for missing and exploited children , through various focus groups throughout europe , where we were looking at what the legislation consisted of .
for example : was it illegal to possess child pornography ?
was it illegal in your country to distribute child pornography ?
once police officers and prosecutors have the laws in place , then we have the tools to do our job . there are several organs fighting this type of crime , like the child exploitation and online protection center in great britain .
what kind of co-operation do you have with other organizations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim del vecchio said everybody shares the blame for child porn the osce is not an operational police unit - we do n't conduct investigations .
we are primarily a political organization that facilitates co-operation .
we are going to have police officers from austria and belgium attending and even police officers from russia .
each one of them is going to present a case study that took place recently in their country and we are going to use these three case studies as an example . what kind of difficulties did you run into , how did you solve the problems .
what kind of difficulties do we have in common ?
it is kind of a " lessons learned " identification and we also hope to have examples of good practices out of this as well .
interpol and ceop are doing a fantastic job in fighting this crime .
the problem is that it is so pervasive , and we definitely want to increase cross-border co-operation .
we do n't want an investigation to stop just because it goes across the border . why were the case studies of belgium , austria and russia chosen ? they volunteered their services .
they took time out of their investigation .
austria had a high profile case last year and we thought it would be an example of best practice .
belgium also had some high profile cases . which new technologies are being presented at the conference ? microsoft is going to talk about the child exploitation tracking software .
they have developed this because the canadian police were having difficulties with investigations in this area .
one police officer in toronto wrote to microsoft and they responded by spending $ 2 million developing a special software that police can track down pedophiles that are using the internet .
we want to make our member states aware that this is free . what about facial recognition technology ? organizations like interpol are looking at child images like a photographic fingerprint .
even if you get older or change your appearance , this technology is still going to be able to tell if it is you or not .
for example , if a man grows a beard or puts on glasses , the software is so powerful that it is still going to recognize that it is you .
this is a very useful tool in child pornography investigations .
you can tell if you are looking at the same victim in different videos , or it might be the same victim , but older than in the other videos .
it is a very good way of identifying victims and rescuing them in some circumstances . who are the perpetrators of these crimes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the eu expands cross border co-operation becomes a major issue usually , it is men .
depending on what study you look at , you get different profiles .
but one of the things that we are very concerned about is that , when we do arrest people , we 're finding that the images in their possession are of very young children .
nineteen percent of the images of offenders were found to be of children less than five years old .
so this is not a case of people looking at pornographic pictures of people that are 16 or 17 years old , we are talking about very young children . how do you view the overall situation of child pornography on the internet in the world today ? everybody shares the blame .
in the usa , there was a husband-and-wife team that was distributing child pornography through the internet in texas but all of the images were coming from various countries in eastern europe .
these people were making over a million dollars a month .
this is a case where the investigation started in america , but there are several european countries involved .
the internet is so fast , it operates at the speed of light - it is very easy to work with people and other countries instantly . i think osce has recognized that organized crime in general is a very serious threat to all 56 member states .
the distribution of child pornography is only one way that organized crime makes money .
it is very lucrative , just like drugs and stolen automobiles and the traditional organized crime activities .
but this one , of course , has a very tragic human element that the other ones do n't . why have france , spain and the united states decided to fund the conference ? these delegations came to us after the ministerial decision -lrb- in december 2006 -rrb- .
the osce recognized this as a serious threat and they were very concerned about our member states having the capacity to combat it .
they thought that it is necessary to take action very fast so they gave us donations right away because otherwise we would have to wait for budgets or bureaucratic matters to get this thing off the ground .
the ministerial decision was in december 2006 and in february we were holding meetings with these delegations to discuss a way to combat this problem .
we are very grateful for the donations . interview : renate krieger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the usa , there was a husband-and-wife team that was distributing child pornography through the internet in texas but all of the images were coming from various countries in eastern europe .
these people were making over a million dollars a month .
this is a case where the investigation started in america , but there are several european countries involved .
the internet is so fast , it operates at the speed of light - it is very easy to work with people and other countries instantly . i think osce has recognized that organized crime in general is a very serious threat to all 56 member states .
the distribution of child pornography is only one way that organized crime makes money .
it is very lucrative , just like drugs and stolen automobiles and the traditional organized crime activities .
but this one , of course , has a very tragic human element that the other ones do n't . why have france , spain and the united states decided to fund the conference ? these delegations came to us after the ministerial decision -lrb- in december 2006 -rrb- .
the osce recognized this as a serious threat and they were very concerned about our member states having the capacity to combat it .
they thought that it is necessary to take action very fast so they gave us donations right away because otherwise we would have to wait for budgets or bureaucratic matters to get this thing off the ground .
the ministerial decision was in december 2006 and in february we were holding meetings with these delegations to discuss a way to combat this problem .

dw-world.de spoke to the conference organizer . tim del vecchio is the organizer of the conference on improving law enforcement 's response to combat sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
he is a police affairs officer with the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- strategic police matters unit . dw world.de : what will be discussed at the conference ? tim del vecchio : we are going to address several technical issues - what kind of technology is out there so we can conduct our investigations more effectively , what type of police training is available at no cost and is also available to states that can not afford their own police training .
most of all we want to make partnerships with the private sector .
for example , microsoft , and visa europe are participating .
visa is talking about how they can work with the credit card companies more effectively .
internet service providers from various osce member states are going to talk about how the police can work better with internet service providers . our focus is going to on the offenders more than the victims .
we have an anti-trafficking unit at the osce that focuses on the victim issues , about the after-care , what kind of therapies are available and shelters that might be available for victims if we ca n't send them home .
our role is going to be to address the police and the prosecutors . what are the measures available to fight child pornography ? one of the first places we have to start looking at is domestic legislation .
last year , we were very much involved in helping the international center for missing and exploited children , through various focus groups throughout europe , where we were looking at what the legislation consisted of .
for example : was it illegal to possess child pornography ?
was it illegal in your country to distribute child pornography ?
once police officers and prosecutors have the laws in place , then we have the tools to do our job . there are several organs fighting this type of crime , like the child exploitation and online protection center in great britain .
what kind of co-operation do you have with other organizations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim del vecchio said everybody shares the blame for child porn the osce is not an operational police unit - we do n't conduct investigations .
we are primarily a political organization that facilitates co-operation .
we are going to have police officers from austria and belgium attending and even police officers from russia .
each one of them is going to present a case study that took place recently in their country and we are going to use these three case studies as an example . what kind of difficulties did you run into , how did you solve the problems .
what kind of difficulties do we have in common ?
it is kind of a " lessons learned " identification and we also hope to have examples of good practices out of this as well .
interpol and ceop are doing a fantastic job in fighting this crime .
the problem is that it is so pervasive , and we definitely want to increase cross-border co-operation .
we do n't want an investigation to stop just because it goes across the border . why were the case studies of belgium , austria and russia chosen ? they volunteered their services .
they took time out of their investigation .
austria had a high profile case last year and we thought it would be an example of best practice .
belgium also had some high profile cases . which new technologies are being presented at the conference ? microsoft is going to talk about the child exploitation tracking software .
they have developed this because the canadian police were having difficulties with investigations in this area .
one police officer in toronto wrote to microsoft and they responded by spending $ 2 million developing a special software that police can track down pedophiles that are using the internet .
we want to make our member states aware that this is free . what about facial recognition technology ? organizations like interpol are looking at child images like a photographic fingerprint .
even if you get older or change your appearance , this technology is still going to be able to tell if it is you or not .
for example , if a man grows a beard or puts on glasses , the software is so powerful that it is still going to recognize that it is you .
this is a very useful tool in child pornography investigations .
you can tell if you are looking at the same victim in different videos , or it might be the same victim , but older than in the other videos .
it is a very good way of identifying victims and rescuing them in some circumstances . who are the perpetrators of these crimes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the eu expands cross border co-operation becomes a major issue usually , it is men .
depending on what study you look at , you get different profiles .
but one of the things that we are very concerned about is that , when we do arrest people , we 're finding that the images in their possession are of very young children .
nineteen percent of the images of offenders were found to be of children less than five years old .
so this is not a case of people looking at pornographic pictures of people that are 16 or 17 years old , we are talking about very young children . how do you view the overall situation of child pornography on the internet in the world today ? everybody shares the blame .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 21.09.2007 combating child porn conference focuses on new technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : training police officers will be a focus of the conference the use of new technologies and better cross border co-operation is the focus of a conference aimed at combating the sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
dw-world.de spoke to the conference organizer . tim del vecchio is the organizer of the conference on improving law enforcement 's response to combat sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
he is a police affairs officer with the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- strategic police matters unit . dw world.de : what will be discussed at the conference ? tim del vecchio : we are going to address several technical issues - what kind of technology is out there so we can conduct our investigations more effectively , what type of police training is available at no cost and is also available to states that can not afford their own police training .
most of all we want to make partnerships with the private sector .
for example , microsoft , and visa europe are participating .
visa is talking about how they can work with the credit card companies more effectively .
internet service providers from various osce member states are going to talk about how the police can work better with internet service providers . our focus is going to on the offenders more than the victims .
we have an anti-trafficking unit at the osce that focuses on the victim issues , about the after-care , what kind of therapies are available and shelters that might be available for victims if we ca n't send them home .
our role is going to be to address the police and the prosecutors . what are the measures available to fight child pornography ? one of the first places we have to start looking at is domestic legislation .
last year , we were very much involved in helping the international center for missing and exploited children , through various focus groups throughout europe , where we were looking at what the legislation consisted of .
for example : was it illegal to possess child pornography ?
was it illegal in your country to distribute child pornography ?
once police officers and prosecutors have the laws in place , then we have the tools to do our job . there are several organs fighting this type of crime , like the child exploitation and online protection center in great britain .
what kind of co-operation do you have with other organizations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim del vecchio said everybody shares the blame for child porn the osce is not an operational police unit - we do n't conduct investigations .
we are primarily a political organization that facilitates co-operation .
we are going to have police officers from austria and belgium attending and even police officers from russia .
each one of them is going to present a case study that took place recently in their country and we are going to use these three case studies as an example . what kind of difficulties did you run into , how did you solve the problems .
what kind of difficulties do we have in common ?
it is kind of a " lessons learned " identification and we also hope to have examples of good practices out of this as well .
interpol and ceop are doing a fantastic job in fighting this crime .
the problem is that it is so pervasive , and we definitely want to increase cross-border co-operation .
we do n't want an investigation to stop just because it goes across the border . why were the case studies of belgium , austria and russia chosen ? they volunteered their services .
they took time out of their investigation .
austria had a high profile case last year and we thought it would be an example of best practice .
belgium also had some high profile cases . which new technologies are being presented at the conference ? microsoft is going to talk about the child exploitation tracking software .
they have developed this because the canadian police were having difficulties with investigations in this area .
one police officer in toronto wrote to microsoft and they responded by spending $ 2 million developing a special software that police can track down pedophiles that are using the internet .
we want to make our member states aware that this is free . what about facial recognition technology ? organizations like interpol are looking at child images like a photographic fingerprint .
even if you get older or change your appearance , this technology is still going to be able to tell if it is you or not .
for example , if a man grows a beard or puts on glasses , the software is so powerful that it is still going to recognize that it is you .
this is a very useful tool in child pornography investigations .
you can tell if you are looking at the same victim in different videos , or it might be the same victim , but older than in the other videos .
it is a very good way of identifying victims and rescuing them in some circumstances . who are the perpetrators of these crimes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the eu expands cross border co-operation becomes a major issue usually , it is men .
depending on what study you look at , you get different profiles .
but one of the things that we are very concerned about is that , when we do arrest people , we 're finding that the images in their possession are of very young children .
nineteen percent of the images of offenders were found to be of children less than five years old .
so this is not a case of people looking at pornographic pictures of people that are 16 or 17 years old , we are talking about very young children . how do you view the overall situation of child pornography on the internet in the world today ? everybody shares the blame .
in the usa , there was a husband-and-wife team that was distributing child pornography through the internet in texas but all of the images were coming from various countries in eastern europe .
these people were making over a million dollars a month .
this is a case where the investigation started in america , but there are several european countries involved .
the internet is so fast , it operates at the speed of light - it is very easy to work with people and other countries instantly . i think osce has recognized that organized crime in general is a very serious threat to all 56 member states .
the distribution of child pornography is only one way that organized crime makes money .
it is very lucrative , just like drugs and stolen automobiles and the traditional organized crime activities .
but this one , of course , has a very tragic human element that the other ones do n't . why have france , spain and the united states decided to fund the conference ? these delegations came to us after the ministerial decision -lrb- in december 2006 -rrb- .
the osce recognized this as a serious threat and they were very concerned about our member states having the capacity to combat it .
they thought that it is necessary to take action very fast so they gave us donations right away because otherwise we would have to wait for budgets or bureaucratic matters to get this thing off the ground .
the ministerial decision was in december 2006 and in february we were holding meetings with these delegations to discuss a way to combat this problem .
we are very grateful for the donations . interview : renate krieger send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" terrorism " is commonly - and especially since sept .
11 , 2001 , - defined and understood as an attempt by radical groups and individuals to achieve certain political aims by killing or hurting as many people as possible .
in view of the attacks in new york , madrid and london , this interpretation tends to be accepted without argument and the identity of the perpetrators is taken for granted - not only by george w. bush , but by western politicians everywhere .
osama bin laden , al qaeda , islamic jihad and similar names have long since become the embodiment of terror and terrorists .
at the same time , " terror " also means putting fear into an innocent civilian population and thus making it more receptive for the political demands that one is unable to implement any other way .

in this case , the " perpetrators " do n't come from the caves of afghanistan or the mountains along the pakistani border , but from near the black forest , rheingau or franconia .
and these " perpetrators " do n't operate from the underground , but rather as german political officials .
top politicians intimidate and frighten the germans with new visions of terror almost every day : with the danger of nuclear terror attacks , the danger that - like in manhattan - hijacked passenger airplanes could be piloted into big german cities .
or the danger that terrorists could come by boat and carry out attacks .
not to mention the danger that a seemingly incalculable mass of converts to islam has become a sort of terrorist fifth column .
the question is not if but when these grim visions will be realized claim -lsb- christian union -rsb- politicians such as interior minister wolfgang schäuble , his bavarian counterpart günther beckstein , or defense minister franz josef jung when they spread their prophecies of doom .
and thus recklessly spread fear and terror .
by now , even the union 's social democratic coalition partners in berlin take exception to it , although in the previous government it was one of them who , as federal interior minister , demanded " law and order . "
it appears to have more to do with the office than the individual to issue such warnings and to demand tightening existing laws and more power to the police as tried and tested antidotes .
it is , of course , politicians ' duty to contemplate ways to deal with possible dangers or how they could be avoided in the first place .
just as the security services - there are 38 such federal institutions in germany - naturally must contemplate those things and run through their eerie case scenarios .
the main difference is that the security services engage in these deliberations internally and not in the media .
such discussions do n't belong in public .

" terrorism " is commonly - and especially since sept .
11 , 2001 , - defined and understood as an attempt by radical groups and individuals to achieve certain political aims by killing or hurting as many people as possible .
in view of the attacks in new york , madrid and london , this interpretation tends to be accepted without argument and the identity of the perpetrators is taken for granted - not only by george w. bush , but by western politicians everywhere .
osama bin laden , al qaeda , islamic jihad and similar names have long since become the embodiment of terror and terrorists .

and these " perpetrators " do n't operate from the underground , but rather as german political officials .
top politicians intimidate and frighten the germans with new visions of terror almost every day : with the danger of nuclear terror attacks , the danger that - like in manhattan - hijacked passenger airplanes could be piloted into big german cities .
or the danger that terrorists could come by boat and carry out attacks .
not to mention the danger that a seemingly incalculable mass of converts to islam has become a sort of terrorist fifth column .
the question is not if but when these grim visions will be realized claim -lsb- christian union -rsb- politicians such as interior minister wolfgang schäuble , his bavarian counterpart günther beckstein , or defense minister franz josef jung when they spread their prophecies of doom .

dw-world.de spoke to thomas bunge , a member of the german delegation , who was part of the historic event . thomas bunge represented germany 's federal environment agency in drawing up the " montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer " in september 1987 .
the lawyer is currently responsible for environment and spatial planning at the agency .
dw-world.de : why was the 1987 montreal protocol so significant ?
thomas bunge : that was the beginning of international regulations to protect the earth 's atmosphere .
until then , there was only regulation of long-range , transnational air pollution .
people tried for the first time to resolve a worldwide problem through international law , although in retrospect , the regulations then were certainly inadequate .
can you briefly explain why they were inadequate ?
the regulations agreed in 1987 were supposed to reduce the production and use of substances that damaged the ozone layer by a maximum of only up to 50 percent .
but people very quickly noticed that that was n't enough to effectively protect the ozone layer .
in 1990 , that is , a year after the regulations came into effect , the stipulations had already been tightened .
the decision was made to entirely discontinue production and use by the year 2000 .
in 1994 , the deadlines were again shortened .
thus people wanted , and still want , to relatively quickly achieve a full discontinuation of production , and also of use , of the substances .
it 's true that developing countries currently the still have the right to produce and use the substances in small amounts .
but relatively soon the use and the production will be discontinued worldwide .
can you describe how things came about ?
how is such a compromise reached ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bunge as is normally the case in the realm of international law , there are specific working groups for the individual application areas one aims to regulate .
the building blocks for such an international treaty are worked out in the groups .
the individual building blocks must then be voted on and approved in the plenum .
that is , as in all cases , a compromise between the interests that the individual states represent at these conferences , of course .
the whole thing was fleshed out with science and the scientific results available up until the signing in 1987 were included .
the interests of the individual states and the scientific results were then put in relation .
that led to a compromise with which one was at the time not particularly happy .
can you provide an example of a practical problem that had to be overcome ?
did particular countries block movement ?
it was several blocks of states .
the eu comprised its own negotiation block .
of course , that was significantly fewer states than today .
there was a so-called " toronto group " of states .
they represented the scandinavian states , canada , australia and switzerland .
this group with australia and new zealand , which would have been affected the soonest by the consequences of the hole in the ozone layer - and then was affected - wanted to pass very wide-reaching regulations .
on the other side , there was an array of industrial countries that produced these substances .
they were naturally interested in continuing production or being able to produce appropriate substitutes .
how was the atmosphere among the conference participants on sept .
16 , 1987 , when the protocol was passed ?
people were pleased that a compromise had been reached .
but we had already seen that the rules were n't sufficient for the next 20 , 30 , 40 years .
we recognized that the progressive states also had had to swallow some bitter pills .
but in retrospect , it was a success , of course , to very quickly bring very many countries on board on trade regulations that envisaged limitations on trade with countries that were n't party to the treaty .
in this way , one had a model for the negotiations on climate regulations that started relatively soon thereafter . interview : martin hoffmann -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to thomas bunge , a member of the german delegation , who was part of the historic event . thomas bunge represented germany 's federal environment agency in drawing up the " montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer " in september 1987 .
the lawyer is currently responsible for environment and spatial planning at the agency .
dw-world.de : why was the 1987 montreal protocol so significant ?
thomas bunge : that was the beginning of international regulations to protect the earth 's atmosphere .
until then , there was only regulation of long-range , transnational air pollution .
people tried for the first time to resolve a worldwide problem through international law , although in retrospect , the regulations then were certainly inadequate .
can you briefly explain why they were inadequate ?
the regulations agreed in 1987 were supposed to reduce the production and use of substances that damaged the ozone layer by a maximum of only up to 50 percent .
but people very quickly noticed that that was n't enough to effectively protect the ozone layer .
in 1990 , that is , a year after the regulations came into effect , the stipulations had already been tightened .
the decision was made to entirely discontinue production and use by the year 2000 .
in 1994 , the deadlines were again shortened .

french foreign minister bernard kouchner will go to the white house to discuss the issue on friday .
kouchner recently warned that a war with iran was possible , but has since insisted the statement was misunderstood .
stronger sanctions necessary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran says it wants nuclear technology to provide energy while sarkozy distanced himself from the threat of going to war with iran , he emphasized the need for diplomatic sanctions .
the iranian nuclear question " is an extremely difficult affair , but france does not want a war , " sarkozy said .
at their friday meeting , britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states plan to discuss a third package of tighter un sanctions against iran if it does not suspend its uranium enrichment .
" how do we convince -lsb- iran -rsb- to renounce this project ? "
sarkozy asked .
" just as the international community convinced north korea and libya to renounce theirs : through discussion , through dialogue , through sanctions .
" if sanctions are not enough , i want stronger sanctions , " sarkozy added .
leaders hope for a peaceful solution bildunterschrift : france is worried the un security council wo n't do enough since sarkozy 's election in may , france has taken an increasingly strong stand in the dispute over iran 's nuclear program , which many countries fear is an effort to build an atomic bomb .

the un security council has adopted sanctions against iran which include calling on countries to stop supplying iran with nuclear-related technology and freezing assets of many people and groups related to the nuclear program .

france wants the european union to also adopt sanctions against iran if the un security council does not pass new measures .
russia and china have been unwilling to take strong action .
french presidential spokesman david martinon suggested that the measures could include " recommendations " to european companies asking them " at the very least not to bid for new markets in iran , and for financial institutions to scale back their operations , to lower their investments . "
" we would like to obtain that from all eu countries , and we are not alone in wanting to do so , " martinon said .

they will be asked their place of birth , age , gender , nationality and marital status as well as questions about their household , working life and education .
germany 's current population statistics are extrapolations based on the last censuses .
the country 's statisticians think there may actually be 1.3 million fewer people living in germany in total and around half a million fewer foreigners than official calculations say .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 21.09.2007 opinion : german politicians create terror as they warn of it großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with their alarmist comments to the media about impending terror attacks , interior minister schäuble and other german politicians are spreading fear and terror , says peter philipp . " terrorism " is commonly - and especially since sept .
11 , 2001 , - defined and understood as an attempt by radical groups and individuals to achieve certain political aims by killing or hurting as many people as possible .
in view of the attacks in new york , madrid and london , this interpretation tends to be accepted without argument and the identity of the perpetrators is taken for granted - not only by george w. bush , but by western politicians everywhere .
osama bin laden , al qaeda , islamic jihad and similar names have long since become the embodiment of terror and terrorists .
at the same time , " terror " also means putting fear into an innocent civilian population and thus making it more receptive for the political demands that one is unable to implement any other way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp and that is exactly what we have been experiencing in germany nearly every day .
in this case , the " perpetrators " do n't come from the caves of afghanistan or the mountains along the pakistani border , but from near the black forest , rheingau or franconia .
and these " perpetrators " do n't operate from the underground , but rather as german political officials .
top politicians intimidate and frighten the germans with new visions of terror almost every day : with the danger of nuclear terror attacks , the danger that - like in manhattan - hijacked passenger airplanes could be piloted into big german cities .
or the danger that terrorists could come by boat and carry out attacks .
not to mention the danger that a seemingly incalculable mass of converts to islam has become a sort of terrorist fifth column .
the question is not if but when these grim visions will be realized claim -lsb- christian union -rsb- politicians such as interior minister wolfgang schäuble , his bavarian counterpart günther beckstein , or defense minister franz josef jung when they spread their prophecies of doom .
and thus recklessly spread fear and terror .
by now , even the union 's social democratic coalition partners in berlin take exception to it , although in the previous government it was one of them who , as federal interior minister , demanded " law and order . "
it appears to have more to do with the office than the individual to issue such warnings and to demand tightening existing laws and more power to the police as tried and tested antidotes .
it is , of course , politicians ' duty to contemplate ways to deal with possible dangers or how they could be avoided in the first place .
just as the security services - there are 38 such federal institutions in germany - naturally must contemplate those things and run through their eerie case scenarios .
the main difference is that the security services engage in these deliberations internally and not in the media .
such discussions do n't belong in public .
if they continue to be carried on there , " al qaeda " becomes superfluous .

dw-world.de political wrangling at heart of german terror debate , critics say the german defense minister 's comments about shooting down hijacked planes set off a burst of political squabbling .
but the debate raises important issues , even if it 's motivated by political maneuvering , observers say .
-lrb- 17.09.2007 -rrb- terror case throws spotlight on german converts to islam two of the men held in connection with a plot to bomb us military installations and other targets in germany are converts to islam .
it has raised the question of whether converts are more likely to become radicalized .
-lrb- 11.09.2007 -rrb- debate on terror in germany highlights political divisions just days after german security forces thwarted a " massive " terror attack , the country 's state interior ministers met to discuss the current terrorist threat .
however , divisions remained on a number of issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 21.09.2007 combating child porn conference focuses on new technology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : training police officers will be a focus of the conference the use of new technologies and better cross border co-operation is the focus of a conference aimed at combating the sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
dw-world.de spoke to the conference organizer . tim del vecchio is the organizer of the conference on improving law enforcement 's response to combat sexual exploitation of children on the internet .
he is a police affairs officer with the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- strategic police matters unit . dw world.de : what will be discussed at the conference ? tim del vecchio : we are going to address several technical issues - what kind of technology is out there so we can conduct our investigations more effectively , what type of police training is available at no cost and is also available to states that can not afford their own police training .
most of all we want to make partnerships with the private sector .
for example , microsoft , and visa europe are participating .
visa is talking about how they can work with the credit card companies more effectively .
internet service providers from various osce member states are going to talk about how the police can work better with internet service providers . our focus is going to on the offenders more than the victims .
we have an anti-trafficking unit at the osce that focuses on the victim issues , about the after-care , what kind of therapies are available and shelters that might be available for victims if we ca n't send them home .
our role is going to be to address the police and the prosecutors . what are the measures available to fight child pornography ? one of the first places we have to start looking at is domestic legislation .
last year , we were very much involved in helping the international center for missing and exploited children , through various focus groups throughout europe , where we were looking at what the legislation consisted of .
for example : was it illegal to possess child pornography ?
was it illegal in your country to distribute child pornography ?
once police officers and prosecutors have the laws in place , then we have the tools to do our job . there are several organs fighting this type of crime , like the child exploitation and online protection center in great britain .
what kind of co-operation do you have with other organizations ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim del vecchio said everybody shares the blame for child porn the osce is not an operational police unit - we do n't conduct investigations .
we are primarily a political organization that facilitates co-operation .
we are going to have police officers from austria and belgium attending and even police officers from russia .
each one of them is going to present a case study that took place recently in their country and we are going to use these three case studies as an example . what kind of difficulties did you run into , how did you solve the problems .
what kind of difficulties do we have in common ?
it is kind of a " lessons learned " identification and we also hope to have examples of good practices out of this as well .
interpol and ceop are doing a fantastic job in fighting this crime .
the problem is that it is so pervasive , and we definitely want to increase cross-border co-operation .
we do n't want an investigation to stop just because it goes across the border . why were the case studies of belgium , austria and russia chosen ? they volunteered their services .
they took time out of their investigation .
austria had a high profile case last year and we thought it would be an example of best practice .
belgium also had some high profile cases . which new technologies are being presented at the conference ? microsoft is going to talk about the child exploitation tracking software .
they have developed this because the canadian police were having difficulties with investigations in this area .
one police officer in toronto wrote to microsoft and they responded by spending $ 2 million developing a special software that police can track down pedophiles that are using the internet .
we want to make our member states aware that this is free . what about facial recognition technology ? organizations like interpol are looking at child images like a photographic fingerprint .
even if you get older or change your appearance , this technology is still going to be able to tell if it is you or not .
for example , if a man grows a beard or puts on glasses , the software is so powerful that it is still going to recognize that it is you .
this is a very useful tool in child pornography investigations .
you can tell if you are looking at the same victim in different videos , or it might be the same victim , but older than in the other videos .
it is a very good way of identifying victims and rescuing them in some circumstances . who are the perpetrators of these crimes ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the eu expands cross border co-operation becomes a major issue usually , it is men .
depending on what study you look at , you get different profiles .
but one of the things that we are very concerned about is that , when we do arrest people , we 're finding that the images in their possession are of very young children .
nineteen percent of the images of offenders were found to be of children less than five years old .
so this is not a case of people looking at pornographic pictures of people that are 16 or 17 years old , we are talking about very young children . how do you view the overall situation of child pornography on the internet in the world today ? everybody shares the blame .
in the usa , there was a husband-and-wife team that was distributing child pornography through the internet in texas but all of the images were coming from various countries in eastern europe .
these people were making over a million dollars a month .
this is a case where the investigation started in america , but there are several european countries involved .
the internet is so fast , it operates at the speed of light - it is very easy to work with people and other countries instantly . i think osce has recognized that organized crime in general is a very serious threat to all 56 member states .
the distribution of child pornography is only one way that organized crime makes money .
it is very lucrative , just like drugs and stolen automobiles and the traditional organized crime activities .
but this one , of course , has a very tragic human element that the other ones do n't . why have france , spain and the united states decided to fund the conference ? these delegations came to us after the ministerial decision -lrb- in december 2006 -rrb- .
the osce recognized this as a serious threat and they were very concerned about our member states having the capacity to combat it .
they thought that it is necessary to take action very fast so they gave us donations right away because otherwise we would have to wait for budgets or bureaucratic matters to get this thing off the ground .
the ministerial decision was in december 2006 and in february we were holding meetings with these delegations to discuss a way to combat this problem .

the tally is n't expected to provoke storms of protest as it did in the past .
but it could show that there are fewer people in the country . the census will begin in 2011 , the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , decided on thursday , sept .
21 .
this time , though , officials wo n't be knocking on the doors of each and every one of the estimated 82 million german residents .
instead , they will focus their queries on around 6 million people as well as the country 's 17.5 million property owners .
they will be asked their place of birth , age , gender , nationality and marital status as well as questions about their household , working life and education .
germany 's current population statistics are extrapolations based on the last censuses .
the country 's statisticians think there may actually be 1.3 million fewer people living in germany in total and around half a million fewer foreigners than official calculations say .
the preparatory legislation on the census passed with the votes of the two government parties , the christian democrats and social democrats , in the bundestag , while the green party and the free-market liberal fdp abstained .
data protection czar unconcerned fdp politician sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , a former federal justice minister , said she and her colleagues thought the details of the census had not yet been adequately clarified .
" we do n't want to issue a carte blanche as long as these questions are still open , " the süddeutsche zeitung daily quoted her as saying .
the left party opposed the bill .
its domestic expert , jan korte , said the data collected would not be secure and that it was unclear how it would be used , according to the paper .
however , germany 's data protection czar , peter schaar , said the census plans were in line with the constitution and would not unnecessarily intrude on citizens ' privacy rights .
internet opens doors to census bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowadays people are less concerned about leaving a trace the last census took place in 1987 in west germany and in 1981 in east germany .
the west german census was accompanied by calls for boycott from people who were concerned the tally would lead the way to a surveillance state .
census takers were tasked with collected data from all german residents .
little resistance is expected this time around : with the widespread use of credit cards and the internet , germans generally find it acceptable to allow freer access to their personal data .

all census information that could make residents recognizable must be erased when it is no longer needed by the statisticians .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- broadband speeds under scrutiny home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : friday , 21 september 2007 , 07:29 gmt 08:29 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version broadband speeds under scrutiny what broadband speed are you clocking up ?
broadband speeds in the uk are much slower than advertised by internet service providers , a study by computeractive magazine has found .
some 3,000 readers took part in speed tests and 62 % found they routinely got less than half of the top speed advertised by their provider .
it is the latest in a series of questions over the way net firms advertise broadband services .
regulator ofcom said it was aware of the issue and was " investigating " .
testing times the figures were gathered from more than 100,000 speed tests that the 3,000 respondents carried out to build up a picture of their average net-browsing speed on adsl lines .
statistics about net users in the uk show that half of current broadband users receive adsl services that should run at speeds between one and four megabits per second -lrb- mbps -rrb- .
the other 50 % are on deals offering up to eight mbps but the tests revealed that , in reality , very few achieve the top speeds .
" this problem has been building for a while with a growing gulf between what is advertised and what is delivered , " said paul allen , editor of computeractive .
" the adverts often have super-fast broadband in huge lettering with the " up to " clause in very small print , " he said .
broadband is often not as fast as advertised " users who have taken the test were surprised at the size of the gulf , " he added .
some 28 % of the 3,000 respondents who took the adsl speed test found that they received less than a quarter of their maximum advertised bandwidth .
while consumers may currently not notice their sluggish connections , this could change thinks mr allen .
" previously it has not been a massive issue but in the coming year we are entering the net tv age and video content is bandwidth-hungry , " he said .
mr allen called on regulator ofcom to provide an independent speed test to anyone who has signed up to receive broadband .
speaking for the telecommunications watchdog , a spokesman said : " we are looking at this issue .
it is not a huge driver of complaints but it has come on to our radar screen . "
" it 's about the difference between the headline rate and the rate received , " he said .
the spokesman said ofcom was working with the net industry and other organisations such as which to investigate the extent of the problem and what can be done about it .
" once we have carried out this work we will assess what options might be available to tackle it , " he said .
the results of the investigation would be made available in the " near future " , said the spokesman .
fast chance research by market analysts point topic sugggests that , in many areas of the uk , few people will be able to get the fastest broadband speeds .
only 5 % of the population will be able to enjoy speeds of 18mbps .
more than half will only be able to get 8mbps .
people are using more bandwidth-hungry applications ofcom was also working with the advertising standards authority to keep an eye on how net service firms word their marketing materials .
" we make sure broadband advertising does not advertise speeds that can not be guaranteed , " he said .
" they have to make it clear that there is a best possible speed rather than an average speed . "
the asa has investigated several cases of misleading promotions , most recently asking bulldog to make it clear in its adverts that speed was dependent on how far away from the exchange people lived .
it ruled that broadband providers could use the words " up to " 8mbps when describing services as long as customers were likely to get close to those speeds .
a survey last month by consumer group which found that consumers with services promising speeds of up to 8mbps were actually getting an average speed of 2.7mbps.
there are many variables that determine the speed of a connection , including how far away from the telephone exchange the line is , how many others are using the line at the same time and the quality of the wiring within a home .
the tool used in the study is available for download from the computeractive website .
it was developed by advice service broadband choice .

broadband speeds in the uk are much slower than advertised by internet service providers , a study by computeractive magazine has found .
some 3,000 readers took part in speed tests and 62 % found they routinely got less than half of the top speed advertised by their provider .
it is the latest in a series of questions over the way net firms advertise broadband services .
regulator ofcom said it was aware of the issue and was " investigating " .
testing times the figures were gathered from more than 100,000 speed tests that the 3,000 respondents carried out to build up a picture of their average net-browsing speed on adsl lines .
statistics about net users in the uk show that half of current broadband users receive adsl services that should run at speeds between one and four megabits per second -lrb- mbps -rrb- .
the other 50 % are on deals offering up to eight mbps but the tests revealed that , in reality , very few achieve the top speeds .
" this problem has been building for a while with a growing gulf between what is advertised and what is delivered , " said paul allen , editor of computeractive .
" the adverts often have super-fast broadband in huge lettering with the " up to " clause in very small print , " he said .
broadband is often not as fast as advertised " users who have taken the test were surprised at the size of the gulf , " he added .
some 28 % of the 3,000 respondents who took the adsl speed test found that they received less than a quarter of their maximum advertised bandwidth .
while consumers may currently not notice their sluggish connections , this could change thinks mr allen .
" previously it has not been a massive issue but in the coming year we are entering the net tv age and video content is bandwidth-hungry , " he said .
mr allen called on regulator ofcom to provide an independent speed test to anyone who has signed up to receive broadband .
speaking for the telecommunications watchdog , a spokesman said : " we are looking at this issue .
it is not a huge driver of complaints but it has come on to our radar screen . "
" it 's about the difference between the headline rate and the rate received , " he said .
the spokesman said ofcom was working with the net industry and other organisations such as which to investigate the extent of the problem and what can be done about it .
" once we have carried out this work we will assess what options might be available to tackle it , " he said .
the results of the investigation would be made available in the " near future " , said the spokesman .
fast chance research by market analysts point topic sugggests that , in many areas of the uk , few people will be able to get the fastest broadband speeds .
only 5 % of the population will be able to enjoy speeds of 18mbps .
more than half will only be able to get 8mbps .
people are using more bandwidth-hungry applications ofcom was also working with the advertising standards authority to keep an eye on how net service firms word their marketing materials .
" we make sure broadband advertising does not advertise speeds that can not be guaranteed , " he said .
" they have to make it clear that there is a best possible speed rather than an average speed . "
the asa has investigated several cases of misleading promotions , most recently asking bulldog to make it clear in its adverts that speed was dependent on how far away from the exchange people lived .
it ruled that broadband providers could use the words " up to " 8mbps when describing services as long as customers were likely to get close to those speeds .
a survey last month by consumer group which found that consumers with services promising speeds of up to 8mbps were actually getting an average speed of 2.7mbps.
there are many variables that determine the speed of a connection , including how far away from the telephone exchange the line is , how many others are using the line at the same time and the quality of the wiring within a home .
the tool used in the study is available for download from the computeractive website .
it was developed by advice service broadband choice .
computeractive has also launched an e-petition on the downing street website , asking the government to force net service firms to provide clear information about the typical speed users will receive alongside the maximum speed .

broadband speeds in the uk are much slower than advertised by internet service providers , a study by computeractive magazine has found .
some 3,000 readers took part in speed tests and 62 % found they routinely got less than half of the top speed advertised by their provider .
it is the latest in a series of questions over the way net firms advertise broadband services .
regulator ofcom said it was aware of the issue and was " investigating " .
testing times the figures were gathered from more than 100,000 speed tests that the 3,000 respondents carried out to build up a picture of their average net-browsing speed on adsl lines .
statistics about net users in the uk show that half of current broadband users receive adsl services that should run at speeds between one and four megabits per second -lrb- mbps -rrb- .
the other 50 % are on deals offering up to eight mbps but the tests revealed that , in reality , very few achieve the top speeds .
" this problem has been building for a while with a growing gulf between what is advertised and what is delivered , " said paul allen , editor of computeractive .
" the adverts often have super-fast broadband in huge lettering with the " up to " clause in very small print , " he said .
broadband is often not as fast as advertised " users who have taken the test were surprised at the size of the gulf , " he added .
some 28 % of the 3,000 respondents who took the adsl speed test found that they received less than a quarter of their maximum advertised bandwidth .
while consumers may currently not notice their sluggish connections , this could change thinks mr allen .
" previously it has not been a massive issue but in the coming year we are entering the net tv age and video content is bandwidth-hungry , " he said .
mr allen called on regulator ofcom to provide an independent speed test to anyone who has signed up to receive broadband .
speaking for the telecommunications watchdog , a spokesman said : " we are looking at this issue .
it is not a huge driver of complaints but it has come on to our radar screen . "
" it 's about the difference between the headline rate and the rate received , " he said .
the spokesman said ofcom was working with the net industry and other organisations such as which to investigate the extent of the problem and what can be done about it .
" once we have carried out this work we will assess what options might be available to tackle it , " he said .
the results of the investigation would be made available in the " near future " , said the spokesman .
fast chance research by market analysts point topic sugggests that , in many areas of the uk , few people will be able to get the fastest broadband speeds .
only 5 % of the population will be able to enjoy speeds of 18mbps .
more than half will only be able to get 8mbps .
people are using more bandwidth-hungry applications ofcom was also working with the advertising standards authority to keep an eye on how net service firms word their marketing materials .
" we make sure broadband advertising does not advertise speeds that can not be guaranteed , " he said .
" they have to make it clear that there is a best possible speed rather than an average speed . "
the asa has investigated several cases of misleading promotions , most recently asking bulldog to make it clear in its adverts that speed was dependent on how far away from the exchange people lived .
it ruled that broadband providers could use the words " up to " 8mbps when describing services as long as customers were likely to get close to those speeds .
a survey last month by consumer group which found that consumers with services promising speeds of up to 8mbps were actually getting an average speed of 2.7mbps.
there are many variables that determine the speed of a connection , including how far away from the telephone exchange the line is , how many others are using the line at the same time and the quality of the wiring within a home .
the tool used in the study is available for download from the computeractive website .
it was developed by advice service broadband choice .
computeractive has also launched an e-petition on the downing street website , asking the government to force net service firms to provide clear information about the typical speed users will receive alongside the maximum speed .

" this problem has been building for a while with a growing gulf between what is advertised and what is delivered , " said paul allen , editor of computeractive .
" the adverts often have super-fast broadband in huge lettering with the " up to " clause in very small print , " he said .
" users who have taken the test were surprised at the size of the gulf , " he added .
some 28 % of the 3,000 respondents who took the adsl speed test found that they received less than a quarter of their maximum advertised bandwidth .
while consumers may currently not notice their sluggish connections , this could change thinks mr allen .
" previously it has not been a massive issue but in the coming year we are entering the net tv age and video content is bandwidth-hungry , " he said .
mr allen called on regulator ofcom to provide an independent speed test to anyone who has signed up to receive broadband .
speaking for the telecommunications watchdog , a spokesman said : " we are looking at this issue .
it is not a huge driver of complaints but it has come on to our radar screen . "
" it 's about the difference between the headline rate and the rate received , " he said .
the spokesman said ofcom was working with the net industry and other organisations such as which to investigate the extent of the problem and what can be done about it .
" once we have carried out this work we will assess what options might be available to tackle it , " he said .
the results of the investigation would be made available in the " near future " , said the spokesman .
fast chance research by market analysts point topic sugggests that , in many areas of the uk , few people will be able to get the fastest broadband speeds .
only 5 % of the population will be able to enjoy speeds of 18mbps .
more than half will only be able to get 8mbps .
ofcom was also working with the advertising standards authority to keep an eye on how net service firms word their marketing materials .
" we make sure broadband advertising does not advertise speeds that can not be guaranteed , " he said .
" they have to make it clear that there is a best possible speed rather than an average speed . "
the asa has investigated several cases of misleading promotions , most recently asking bulldog to make it clear in its adverts that speed was dependent on how far away from the exchange people lived .
it ruled that broadband providers could use the words " up to " 8mbps when describing services as long as customers were likely to get close to those speeds .
a survey last month by consumer group which found that consumers with services promising speeds of up to 8mbps were actually getting an average speed of 2.7mbps.
there are many variables that determine the speed of a connection , including how far away from the telephone exchange the line is , how many others are using the line at the same time and the quality of the wiring within a home .
the tool used in the study is available for download from the computeractive website .
it was developed by advice service broadband choice .
computeractive has also launched an e-petition on the downing street website , asking the government to force net service firms to provide clear information about the typical speed users will receive alongside the maximum speed .

protesters converged on the small louisiana town of jena to demonstrate against what they said was a double standard of prosecution for blacks and whites .
they came in their thousands , protesters from across the united states carrying banners and signs that declared " free the jena six " and " enough is enough " .
there were nowhere near the 60,000 people that some had predicted .
nonetheless , this small town was swamped by people eager to show their support and have their voices heard .
monica pearson made the relatively short journey from baton rouge , louisiana .
" this is a worthy cause and , like my sign says , justice for justice , " she said , holding a placard .
" it 's a very peaceful march and it 's about justice , " she added .
that was a word on many of the protesters ' lips in jena .
hangman 's noose they came , primarily , to show their support for mychal bell , who has been locked in a louisiana prison since december . "
we live a simple life and i 'm not racist , this is just blown completely out of proportion " local resident he , along with five other black teenage boys , was initially charged with attempted murder after they allegedly attacked a white pupil at their school in jena .
racial tensions had been running high at the school after three nooses were found hanging from a tree in the school yard , the day after a black pupil had sat in its shade .
the three white pupils responsible for that act were not disciplined , and that was at the heart of what the protest in jena was all about .
" what do you call hangman 's nooses but racism ? " said the reverend al sharpton , a prominent civil rights activist and one of the organisers of the rally .
he , along with many other high profile speakers and politicians , has been backing the six boys since the incident last september .
the charges against mychal bell were dropped from attempted murder to attempted battery .
while some of the speakers in jena thought the six boys should face some kind of disciplinary action , this case for many is an example of a justice system skewed against african-americans .
' out of proportion ' but some of the members of jena 's white community saw the day very differently .
one woman , who did not give her name , was typical of many .
" i do n't agree with all this , it 's just a mess , it 's ruining our town , " she said .
" we live a simple life and i 'm not racist .
this is just blown completely out of proportion . "
the case of the jena six , as they have now become known , has now received worldwide attention .
many of the protesters said that it was just one case among many that demonstrate a racist judicial system .
" all of these families are suffering , " said mr sharpton , shortly after visiting mychal bell in jail .
" the people in jena underestimated the kind of support they would get .
we brought in these thousands of people .
it 's about these six kids walking out of this unfair situation together . "
other prominent speakers , including martin luther king iii , also came to show their support .

more than a third of 12 to 15-year-olds have faced some kind of cyberbullying , according to a government study .
ministers also want action to stamp out anti-gay bullying , saying homophobic insults are as serious as racism .
schools have been told they may confiscate mobile phones and advised on getting hurtful material off websites .
' happy slapping ' schools secretary ed balls said cyber bullying was " insidious " and had grown with technology and changes in society .
schools needed to get to grips with newer forms of bullying , he said .
examples cited include threats , intimidation , harassment or " cyber-stalking " , unauthorised publication of private information or images , impersonation and so-called " happy slapping " .
mr balls also called on schools to promote a " culture of respect " for homosexuality .
he said : " the vast majority of schools are safe environments to learn in .
however , we know that behaviour , particularly bullying , is a key concern for parents and bullying of any kind is unacceptable .
" cyberbullying is a particularly insidious type of bullying as it can follow young people wherever they go and the anonymity that it seemingly affords to the perpetrator can make it even more stressful for the victim .
" one message that i want to get across to young people is that bystanders can inadvertently become perpetrators - simply by passing on videos or images , they are playing a part in bullying .

e-mails are used to abuse , harass and insult .
" misuse of internet sites can destroy teachers ' confidence and professional reputation and provide yet another vehicle for false allegations against staff . "
the union is calling for pupils ' mobile phones to be classed as potentially offensive weapons and for them to be banned during school sessions .

" we would encourage all partners in the world of education to play a part in stamping out wanton actions that negatively affect the lives of others .
" many schools harness the student voice , through student councils and other means , to counter bullying in the most effective way , because students are closer to the lives of their peers . "
the atl teachers ' union also backed the need for action against homophobic bullying - saying that it remained a " pervasive " problem in schools .
a survey for the union found that 70 % of teachers had heard children in their schools using homophobic language .

it could make the diagnosis of the disease more accurate and reduce unnecessary biopsies in some men .
the current test , which measures raised levels of a specific protein in the blood , is notoriously unreliable and can cause a lot of anxiety .
at £ 200 the genetic test is unlikely to be used routinely in the nhs and may be reserved for high-risk patients .
diagnosis of prostate cancer can be difficult . "
if the test indicates it is unlikely that the man has prostate cancer this reassures both the man and his doctor , and these repeat tests can be avoided " dr chris hiley , the prostate cancer charity doctors use the prostate specific antigen -lrb- psa -rrb- test , which looks for raised levels of a protein in the blood that leaks out of the prostate gland .
a high psa score indicates cancer may be present but to know more doctors have to take tissue samples from the prostate using a sharp needle through the anus .
but some men with cancer might have low psa levels and go undetected while others without cancer may have high levels and end up undergoing procedures they did not need .
and men with raised psa but who appear to be cancer-free often have to undergo repeated biopsies , to check that all is well .
specific the progensa test , developed by gen-probe , measures the activity of a gene closely linked to prostate cancer - pca3 .
prostate cancer in the uk , about 73 men out of every 1,000 get prostate cancer at some point in their lives 63 % of cases are in men aged 70 and over if you have a relative diagnosed with prostate cancer you are at double the risk of getting the disease it is elevated only in cancerous prostate tissue , making it a more specific indicator of cancer than psa .
about 35,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year in the uk and 10,000 die from the disease .
the test is unlikely to be used routinely as it costs £ 200 compared with just £ 10 for a psa test but one potential use is for those with a strong family history of the disease .
professor roger kirby , from the london prostate cancer treatment centre , said the biggest worry in prostate cancer diagnosis is the uncertainty that surrounds a raised psa level and any test which could reduce unnecessary biopsies was good news .
he added : " what we really would like to know is which of these cancers we 're diagnosing really need to be treated .
" there 's some data to suggest that pca3 gives us a better handle on that . "
dr chris hiley , head of policy and research management at the prostate cancer charity , said for some men the test would help doctors decide whether or not to proceed with more biopsies , which can be painful and can have unwanted side effects .

the march was in support of six black teenagers charged with attempted murder after the beating of a white classmate .
the alleged attack followed incidents between school pupils in the summer .
last year , three white students hung a noose in a tree where white students congregated after a black student asked if he too could enjoy its shade .
that incident , with echoes of lynching , resulted in the three white students being suspended from school , but not prosecuted .
all but one of the six students accused over the beating have since had their charges reduced to assault .
on the day of the march a court ordered a hearing into the sixth man 's detention . "
you ca n't have two standards of justice - we did n't bring race in it , those that hung the nooses brought the race into it " rev al sharpton cries for justice thousands of activists dressed in black converged on jena , gathering at the local courthouse and marching along the main streets .
protesters arrived in buses and cars from cities as far away as new york , atlanta and los angeles .
" i came because enough is enough .
i am tired of the way the courts have been treating african-americans historically " , doug martin , a computer analyst from new orleans , told reuters news agency .
speaking ahead of the march , civil rights campaigner rev al sharpton said : " this is the most blatant example of disparity in the justice system that we 've seen .
" you ca n't have two standards of justice .
we did n't bring race in it , those that hung the nooses brought the race into it . "
district attorney reed walters said on wednesday : " it is not and never has been about race .
it is about finding justice for an innocent victim and holding people accountable for their actions . "
dangling nooses the white teenage victim was beaten unconscious and had a badly swollen face , but was able to attend a school event the same evening .
one of the accused , mychal bell , was found guilty of second degree battery in june by an all-white jury before the case was overturned by an appeal court .
the court said mr bell , 16 at the time of the alleged incident in december 2006 , should not have been tried as an adult .
five others who face reduced charges of assault have yet to be tried .
a string of incidents between pupils had began the previous summer .
at that time , a black student had asked the school 's principal whether he was permitted to sit under the shade of the school courtyard tree , where white students traditionally congregated .
he was told he could sit where he liked .
the following morning , when the students arrived at school , they found three nooses dangling from the tree .
the school 's head recommended the noose-hangers be expelled , but the governing board overruled him and the three white student perpetrators were briefly banned from school .
mr walters said the white students were not prosecuted because he could find no state law under which to charge them .

it is about finding justice for an innocent victim and holding people accountable for their actions . "
dangling nooses the white teenage victim was beaten unconscious and had a badly swollen face , but was able to attend a school event the same evening .
rev al sharpton was involved in organising the jena rally one of the accused , mychal bell , was found guilty of second degree battery in june by an all-white jury before the case was overturned by an appeal court .
the court said mr bell , 16 at the time of the alleged incident in december 2006 , should not have been tried as an adult .
five others who face reduced charges of assault have yet to be tried .
a string of incidents between pupils had began the previous summer .
at that time , a black student had asked the school 's principal whether he was permitted to sit under the shade of the school courtyard tree , where white students traditionally congregated .
he was told he could sit where he liked .
the following morning , when the students arrived at school , they found three nooses dangling from the tree .
the school 's head recommended the noose-hangers be expelled , but the governing board overruled him and the three white student perpetrators were briefly banned from school .
mr walters said the white students were not prosecuted because he could find no state law under which to charge them .

" how can you leave out the soul award ?
i think you need to shut it down , " said gabrielle , britain 's best-selling black female singer of the last 20 years .
the mobos have said they do recognise soul artists , but in other categories .
award host jamelia said : " i find it sad and remarkable that people are looking for negatives for negative 's sake . "
this year 's ceremony , which saw stars including amy winehouse , kanye west and rihanna win awards , had categories for hip-hop , reggae , r & b , gospel and jazz - but not soul .
" i 'm really shocked , " gabrielle told the bbc news website .
" it just shows how behind the british music scene is because that would n't happen in america . "
just because there is n't a special category does not mean that soul artists are not being recognised jamelia -lrb- left -rrb- mobos co-host mobo organisers were " knuckleheads " who should know soul went " hand-in-hand " with music of black origin , she said .
and they should not be in charge of such a prestigious event if they did not , she remarked .
" music of black origin is soul and jazz and anything else that is inspired by black music , " said the singer , whose hits include dreams , rise and out of reach .
" i think we should all turn off .
and anyway , it 's all the time dominated by the americans .
" we 're still licking their bootys because it pays homage to the fact that they 're still kicking our arses , the americans .
they 're still more knowledgeable than us . "
gabrielle has won two mobo awards in the past - best album in 2000 and best single in 1996 .
she has added her voice to a campaign that saw four soul musicians protest on the red carpet outside the ceremony on wednesday , carrying placards reading : " mobos where 's your soul ? "
amy winehouse - should she be nominated for best r & b or soul ?
they included singer omar , who had a hit with there 's nothing like this , and incognito frontman bluey maunick .
and singer mica paris has joined in , saying : " the mobos is a poor representation of british soul talent . "
but this year 's ceremony co-host jamelia said the mobos had soul .
" just because there is n't a special category does not mean that soul artists are not being recognised .
" to the contrary , artists like corinne bailey rae , beverley knight , amy winehouse , lemar and gabrielle are being , and have been , honoured , " she continued .
the mobos had " just pulled off one of their best shows ever " , she added .
" the brits dropped their urban category and nobody made any comment . "
a mobo spokesperson said soul was derivative of gospel plus rhythm and blues , which were both represented .
i want the mobos to work , but every year that goes by they make mistakes chris wells echoes magazine editor " just because there is not a specific category entitled ' soul ' it does not mean soulful artists are not being recognised . "
she added : " we were especially pleased with all the british artists because they clearly showed that they can compete at the highest level with any international acts . "
echoes magazine has also been running a campaign to get a soul category installed .
editor chris wells said amy winehouse and lemar , who were nominated for best r & b , were actually soul artists , adding that he did not know why the organisers " get it so wrong " .
" i want the mobos to work , but every year that goes by they make mistakes , " he said the organisers came under fire last year for scrapping their jazz category - but relented and re-installed the jazz prize this year , which was won by soweto kinch .

" how can you leave out the soul award ?
i think you need to shut it down , " said gabrielle , britain 's best-selling black female singer of the last 20 years .
the mobos have said they do recognise soul artists , but in other categories .
award host jamelia said : " i find it sad and remarkable that people are looking for negatives for negative 's sake . "
this year 's ceremony , which saw stars including amy winehouse , kanye west and rihanna win awards , had categories for hip-hop , reggae , r & b , gospel and jazz - but not soul .
" i 'm really shocked , " gabrielle told the bbc news website .
" it just shows how behind the british music scene is because that would n't happen in america . "
just because there is n't a special category does not mean that soul artists are not being recognised jamelia -lrb- left -rrb- mobos co-host mobo organisers were " knuckleheads " who should know soul went " hand-in-hand " with music of black origin , she said .
and they should not be in charge of such a prestigious event if they did not , she remarked .
" music of black origin is soul and jazz and anything else that is inspired by black music , " said the singer , whose hits include dreams , rise and out of reach .
" i think we should all turn off .
and anyway , it 's all the time dominated by the americans .
" we 're still licking their bootys because it pays homage to the fact that they 're still kicking our arses , the americans .
they 're still more knowledgeable than us . "
gabrielle has won two mobo awards in the past - best album in 2000 and best single in 1996 .
she has added her voice to a campaign that saw four soul musicians protest on the red carpet outside the ceremony on wednesday , carrying placards reading : " mobos where 's your soul ? "
