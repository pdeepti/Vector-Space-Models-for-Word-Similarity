in germany , fair trade flowers are an increasingly popular way to change that . child labor , skin disease and miscarriage are three things that german consumers most certainly do n't associate with flowers .
but these are part of the daily life at greenhouse operations in equatorial areas .
many flowers , especially roses and carnations , are imported from lands like colombia , kenya and zimbabwe .
during winter , when flower production in central europe is nonexistent , foreign exports kick into high gear .
booming sector bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florists are offering fair trade options the cut flower business is booming and developing markets have seen the sector grow by 70 percent in the past decade .
europeans and north americans buy flowers from the developing world for valentine 's day , mother 's day or birthdays .
low wages , toxic pesticides , skin problems , miscarriages and child labor are part of many nursery operations .
this reality has made fair trade a popular option for german consumers .
fair trade promotes standards like minimum wage , age restrictions , pregnancy leave and protective clothing .
it provides vacation and overtime .
wolfram schmuck , spokesman fort the german retail giant rewe group , said fair trade is a way to improve social standards .
" a company like rewe group also has societal responsibilities and with such products we can send a political signal , " he said .
buying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers are now a fair trade item since 1993 , rewe has offered fair trade products such as coffee , tea and chocolate and tried to make the consumer aware that he or she also had the power to do something .
peter klas , a customer , said he tries to buy fair trade flowers .
" i often buy fair trade and right now for flowers i find it somehow very important because the majority come from africa and the people there must work under very bad conditions " klas said . " i hope that with fair trade will ensure that these people are paid regularly and also can work under decent conditions . "
independent inspectors regularly test to make sure fair trade conditions are being met .
importers pay a fair trade premium that is at least 12 percent of the purchase price .
a committee made up of representatives of workers and managers decides together on how the premium money can best be used for the good of the worker .
the quality of fair trade flowers becomes obvious from their popularity .
since starting to carry fair trade flowers in march , rewe has sold two million roses .
other companies have also opted for fair trade flowers .
people can also buy fair trade flowers from florists involved in the program or from grocery stores with the fair trade approval seal .
consumers get peace of mind .
" i think that i can contribute something very concrete for fair trade and worldwide trade and that 's my little contribution . "
klas said .
" yes , every person should do a little something to make the world better . " homeira heidary -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

admired abroad but often reviled at home , he died 25 years ago at the age of 37 . after a chequered career as a film-maker , actor , producer , theater manager , composer , editor and cameraman , the enfant terrible of new german cinema died suddenly in 1982 . the 25th anniversary of his death has been overshadowed by a bitter battle over the fassbinder foundation .
this was set up by his mother , liselotte eder , and taken over by his wife , juliane lorenz , after she died .
although many agree that the fassbinder estate would be in chaos without her efforts , others resent her exclusive control over his body of work . last week , around 25 of fassbinder 's former colleagues - including actors , directors and producers - demanded lorenz resign and the fassbinder oeuvre be donated to the deutsche kinemathek in berlin . rebel the love and loathing evident in the current debate also characterized fassbinder 's life . with his trademark leather jacket and rugged appearance , he was a rebellious and contradictory figure .
openly homosexual , he married twice ; his first wife ingrid caven acted in his films , while juliane lorenz worked as his editor . accused by his detractors of being anti-communist , male chauvinist , anti-semitic and even homophobic , he completed 44 films between 1966 and 1982 .
fassbinder might have tirelessly cruised the bar scene by night , looking for sex and drugs , but he always maintained a flawless work ethic by day . ordinary feelings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juliane lorenz -lrb- l -rrb- with fasbinder 's favourite actress hanna schuygulla actors and actresses recount disturbing stories of his brutality toward them , yet his films demonstrate a deep sensitivity to social misfits and a hatred of institutionalized violence .
in this respect , he had much in common with his personal hero , german-born hollywood legend douglas sirk . " the important thing to learn from douglas sirk 's movies " , fassbinder once remarked , " is that on the screen you are allowed to , or better still , supposed to , enlarge people 's ordinary feelings - as small as they may be - as much as possible .

fassbinder 's first feature length film , a gangster movie called " love is colder than death " -lrb- 1969 -rrb- , was greeted by catcalls at the berlin film festival .

admired abroad but often reviled at home , he died 25 years ago at the age of 37 . after a chequered career as a film-maker , actor , producer , theater manager , composer , editor and cameraman , the enfant terrible of new german cinema died suddenly in 1982 . the 25th anniversary of his death has been overshadowed by a bitter battle over the fassbinder foundation .
this was set up by his mother , liselotte eder , and taken over by his wife , juliane lorenz , after she died .
although many agree that the fassbinder estate would be in chaos without her efforts , others resent her exclusive control over his body of work . last week , around 25 of fassbinder 's former colleagues - including actors , directors and producers - demanded lorenz resign and the fassbinder oeuvre be donated to the deutsche kinemathek in berlin . rebel the love and loathing evident in the current debate also characterized fassbinder 's life . with his trademark leather jacket and rugged appearance , he was a rebellious and contradictory figure .
openly homosexual , he married twice ; his first wife ingrid caven acted in his films , while juliane lorenz worked as his editor . accused by his detractors of being anti-communist , male chauvinist , anti-semitic and even homophobic , he completed 44 films between 1966 and 1982 .
fassbinder might have tirelessly cruised the bar scene by night , looking for sex and drugs , but he always maintained a flawless work ethic by day . ordinary feelings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juliane lorenz -lrb- l -rrb- with fasbinder 's favourite actress hanna schuygulla actors and actresses recount disturbing stories of his brutality toward them , yet his films demonstrate a deep sensitivity to social misfits and a hatred of institutionalized violence .
in this respect , he had much in common with his personal hero , german-born hollywood legend douglas sirk . " the important thing to learn from douglas sirk 's movies " , fassbinder once remarked , " is that on the screen you are allowed to , or better still , supposed to , enlarge people 's ordinary feelings - as small as they may be - as much as possible .

in his films , fassbinder often took on the role of composer , production designer , cinematographer , producer and editor . international recognition however , success was not immediate .
fassbinder 's first feature length film , a gangster movie called " love is colder than death " -lrb- 1969 -rrb- , was greeted by catcalls at the berlin film festival .
he scored his first domestic commercial success with " the merchant of four seasons " -lrb- 1971 -rrb- , a moving portrait of a street vendor crushed by betrayal and his own futility . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " lili marleen " it was big budget projects such as " lili marleen " -lrb- 1980 -rrb- -lrb- photo -rrb- and " lola " -lrb- 1981 -rrb- that finally brought the international success fassbinder yearned for .
but his greatest success was " the marriage of maria braun " -lrb- 1978 -rrb- about the rise and fall of a german woman in the wake of world war ii . a workaholic till the end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : west german film director rainer fassbinder -lrb- center -rrb- holds the " golden bear " he was awarded for his film " die sehnsucht der veronika voss " during the " berlinale " , feb 23 , 1982 .
the film made fassbinder a household name in much of europe , but especially in france , said francois numer , who together a fassbinder retrospective at the world-famous centre pompidou in 2006 . " in france , fassbinder was a shock for many people , " numer said .
" on the one hand , people took offense at the scandals surrounding him .
but then again , it was the first time for a german producer to command such a prominent role on the european film circuit . " on the night of june 10 , 1982 , fassbinder took an overdose of cocaine and sleeping pills .

admired abroad but often reviled at home , he died 25 years ago at the age of 37 . after a chequered career as a film-maker , actor , producer , theater manager , composer , editor and cameraman , the enfant terrible of new german cinema died suddenly in 1982 . the 25th anniversary of his death has been overshadowed by a bitter battle over the fassbinder foundation .
this was set up by his mother , liselotte eder , and taken over by his wife , juliane lorenz , after she died .
although many agree that the fassbinder estate would be in chaos without her efforts , others resent her exclusive control over his body of work . last week , around 25 of fassbinder 's former colleagues - including actors , directors and producers - demanded lorenz resign and the fassbinder oeuvre be donated to the deutsche kinemathek in berlin . rebel the love and loathing evident in the current debate also characterized fassbinder 's life . with his trademark leather jacket and rugged appearance , he was a rebellious and contradictory figure .
openly homosexual , he married twice ; his first wife ingrid caven acted in his films , while juliane lorenz worked as his editor . accused by his detractors of being anti-communist , male chauvinist , anti-semitic and even homophobic , he completed 44 films between 1966 and 1982 .

in this respect , he had much in common with his personal hero , german-born hollywood legend douglas sirk . " the important thing to learn from douglas sirk 's movies " , fassbinder once remarked , " is that on the screen you are allowed to , or better still , supposed to , enlarge people 's ordinary feelings - as small as they may be - as much as possible .

openly homosexual , he married twice ; his first wife ingrid caven acted in his films , while juliane lorenz worked as his editor . accused by his detractors of being anti-communist , male chauvinist , anti-semitic and even homophobic , he completed 44 films between 1966 and 1982 .

admired abroad but often reviled at home , he died 25 years ago at the age of 37 . after a chequered career as a film-maker , actor , producer , theater manager , composer , editor and cameraman , the enfant terrible of new german cinema died suddenly in 1982 . the 25th anniversary of his death has been overshadowed by a bitter battle over the fassbinder foundation .
this was set up by his mother , liselotte eder , and taken over by his wife , juliane lorenz , after she died .
although many agree that the fassbinder estate would be in chaos without her efforts , others resent her exclusive control over his body of work . last week , around 25 of fassbinder 's former colleagues - including actors , directors and producers - demanded lorenz resign and the fassbinder oeuvre be donated to the deutsche kinemathek in berlin . rebel the love and loathing evident in the current debate also characterized fassbinder 's life . with his trademark leather jacket and rugged appearance , he was a rebellious and contradictory figure .
openly homosexual , he married twice ; his first wife ingrid caven acted in his films , while juliane lorenz worked as his editor . accused by his detractors of being anti-communist , male chauvinist , anti-semitic and even homophobic , he completed 44 films between 1966 and 1982 .

in his films , fassbinder often took on the role of composer , production designer , cinematographer , producer and editor . international recognition however , success was not immediate .
fassbinder 's first feature length film , a gangster movie called " love is colder than death " -lrb- 1969 -rrb- , was greeted by catcalls at the berlin film festival .

although many agree that the fassbinder estate would be in chaos without her efforts , others resent her exclusive control over his body of work . last week , around 25 of fassbinder 's former colleagues - including actors , directors and producers - demanded lorenz resign and the fassbinder oeuvre be donated to the deutsche kinemathek in berlin . rebel the love and loathing evident in the current debate also characterized fassbinder 's life . with his trademark leather jacket and rugged appearance , he was a rebellious and contradictory figure .
openly homosexual , he married twice ; his first wife ingrid caven acted in his films , while juliane lorenz worked as his editor . accused by his detractors of being anti-communist , male chauvinist , anti-semitic and even homophobic , he completed 44 films between 1966 and 1982 .

in germany , fair trade flowers are an increasingly popular way to change that . child labor , skin disease and miscarriage are three things that german consumers most certainly do n't associate with flowers .
but these are part of the daily life at greenhouse operations in equatorial areas .
many flowers , especially roses and carnations , are imported from lands like colombia , kenya and zimbabwe .
during winter , when flower production in central europe is nonexistent , foreign exports kick into high gear .
booming sector bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florists are offering fair trade options the cut flower business is booming and developing markets have seen the sector grow by 70 percent in the past decade .
europeans and north americans buy flowers from the developing world for valentine 's day , mother 's day or birthdays .
low wages , toxic pesticides , skin problems , miscarriages and child labor are part of many nursery operations .
this reality has made fair trade a popular option for german consumers .
fair trade promotes standards like minimum wage , age restrictions , pregnancy leave and protective clothing .
it provides vacation and overtime .
wolfram schmuck , spokesman fort the german retail giant rewe group , said fair trade is a way to improve social standards .
" a company like rewe group also has societal responsibilities and with such products we can send a political signal , " he said .
buying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers are now a fair trade item since 1993 , rewe has offered fair trade products such as coffee , tea and chocolate and tried to make the consumer aware that he or she also had the power to do something .
peter klas , a customer , said he tries to buy fair trade flowers .
" i often buy fair trade and right now for flowers i find it somehow very important because the majority come from africa and the people there must work under very bad conditions " klas said . " i hope that with fair trade will ensure that these people are paid regularly and also can work under decent conditions . "
independent inspectors regularly test to make sure fair trade conditions are being met .
importers pay a fair trade premium that is at least 12 percent of the purchase price .
a committee made up of representatives of workers and managers decides together on how the premium money can best be used for the good of the worker .
the quality of fair trade flowers becomes obvious from their popularity .
since starting to carry fair trade flowers in march , rewe has sold two million roses .
other companies have also opted for fair trade flowers .
people can also buy fair trade flowers from florists involved in the program or from grocery stores with the fair trade approval seal .
consumers get peace of mind .
" i think that i can contribute something very concrete for fair trade and worldwide trade and that 's my little contribution . "
klas said .
" yes , every person should do a little something to make the world better . " homeira heidary -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

admired abroad but often reviled at home , he died 25 years ago at the age of 37 . after a chequered career as a film-maker , actor , producer , theater manager , composer , editor and cameraman , the enfant terrible of new german cinema died suddenly in 1982 . the 25th anniversary of his death has been overshadowed by a bitter battle over the fassbinder foundation .
this was set up by his mother , liselotte eder , and taken over by his wife , juliane lorenz , after she died .
although many agree that the fassbinder estate would be in chaos without her efforts , others resent her exclusive control over his body of work . last week , around 25 of fassbinder 's former colleagues - including actors , directors and producers - demanded lorenz resign and the fassbinder oeuvre be donated to the deutsche kinemathek in berlin . rebel the love and loathing evident in the current debate also characterized fassbinder 's life . with his trademark leather jacket and rugged appearance , he was a rebellious and contradictory figure .
openly homosexual , he married twice ; his first wife ingrid caven acted in his films , while juliane lorenz worked as his editor . accused by his detractors of being anti-communist , male chauvinist , anti-semitic and even homophobic , he completed 44 films between 1966 and 1982 .
fassbinder might have tirelessly cruised the bar scene by night , looking for sex and drugs , but he always maintained a flawless work ethic by day . ordinary feelings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juliane lorenz -lrb- l -rrb- with fasbinder 's favourite actress hanna schuygulla actors and actresses recount disturbing stories of his brutality toward them , yet his films demonstrate a deep sensitivity to social misfits and a hatred of institutionalized violence .
in this respect , he had much in common with his personal hero , german-born hollywood legend douglas sirk . " the important thing to learn from douglas sirk 's movies " , fassbinder once remarked , " is that on the screen you are allowed to , or better still , supposed to , enlarge people 's ordinary feelings - as small as they may be - as much as possible . " juliane lorenz can testify to the gentle side of fassbinder 's nature . " deep inside , he was a very soft , a very emotional man , " she said .
" at the same time , he could be very radical , and sometimes he overextended . " a film a day fassbinder was born into a bourgeois bavarian family in 1946 .
his father was a doctor and his mother a translator .
in order to have time for her work , his mother frequently sent him to the movies , a practice that gave birth to his obsession with the medium .
later in life , he would claim that he saw a film nearly every day and sometimes as many as three or four . at the age of 15 , fassbinder defiantly declared his homosexuality .
soon after , he left school and took a job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner herzog he studied theater in the mid-1960s , but unlike the other major directors of the new german cinema , including werner herzog -lrb- photo -rrb- and wim wenders , fassbinder acquired an extensive stage background that is evident throughout his work .
in his films , fassbinder often took on the role of composer , production designer , cinematographer , producer and editor . international recognition however , success was not immediate .

admired abroad but often reviled at home , he died 25 years ago at the age of 37 . after a chequered career as a film-maker , actor , producer , theater manager , composer , editor and cameraman , the enfant terrible of new german cinema died suddenly in 1982 . the 25th anniversary of his death has been overshadowed by a bitter battle over the fassbinder foundation .
this was set up by his mother , liselotte eder , and taken over by his wife , juliane lorenz , after she died .
although many agree that the fassbinder estate would be in chaos without her efforts , others resent her exclusive control over his body of work . last week , around 25 of fassbinder 's former colleagues - including actors , directors and producers - demanded lorenz resign and the fassbinder oeuvre be donated to the deutsche kinemathek in berlin . rebel the love and loathing evident in the current debate also characterized fassbinder 's life . with his trademark leather jacket and rugged appearance , he was a rebellious and contradictory figure .
openly homosexual , he married twice ; his first wife ingrid caven acted in his films , while juliane lorenz worked as his editor . accused by his detractors of being anti-communist , male chauvinist , anti-semitic and even homophobic , he completed 44 films between 1966 and 1982 .
fassbinder might have tirelessly cruised the bar scene by night , looking for sex and drugs , but he always maintained a flawless work ethic by day . ordinary feelings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juliane lorenz -lrb- l -rrb- with fasbinder 's favourite actress hanna schuygulla actors and actresses recount disturbing stories of his brutality toward them , yet his films demonstrate a deep sensitivity to social misfits and a hatred of institutionalized violence .
in this respect , he had much in common with his personal hero , german-born hollywood legend douglas sirk . " the important thing to learn from douglas sirk 's movies " , fassbinder once remarked , " is that on the screen you are allowed to , or better still , supposed to , enlarge people 's ordinary feelings - as small as they may be - as much as possible . " juliane lorenz can testify to the gentle side of fassbinder 's nature . " deep inside , he was a very soft , a very emotional man , " she said .
" at the same time , he could be very radical , and sometimes he overextended . " a film a day fassbinder was born into a bourgeois bavarian family in 1946 .
his father was a doctor and his mother a translator .
in order to have time for her work , his mother frequently sent him to the movies , a practice that gave birth to his obsession with the medium .
later in life , he would claim that he saw a film nearly every day and sometimes as many as three or four . at the age of 15 , fassbinder defiantly declared his homosexuality .
soon after , he left school and took a job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner herzog he studied theater in the mid-1960s , but unlike the other major directors of the new german cinema , including werner herzog -lrb- photo -rrb- and wim wenders , fassbinder acquired an extensive stage background that is evident throughout his work .
in his films , fassbinder often took on the role of composer , production designer , cinematographer , producer and editor . international recognition however , success was not immediate .
fassbinder 's first feature length film , a gangster movie called " love is colder than death " -lrb- 1969 -rrb- , was greeted by catcalls at the berlin film festival .
he scored his first domestic commercial success with " the merchant of four seasons " -lrb- 1971 -rrb- , a moving portrait of a street vendor crushed by betrayal and his own futility . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " lili marleen " it was big budget projects such as " lili marleen " -lrb- 1980 -rrb- -lrb- photo -rrb- and " lola " -lrb- 1981 -rrb- that finally brought the international success fassbinder yearned for .
but his greatest success was " the marriage of maria braun " -lrb- 1978 -rrb- about the rise and fall of a german woman in the wake of world war ii . a workaholic till the end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : west german film director rainer fassbinder -lrb- center -rrb- holds the " golden bear " he was awarded for his film " die sehnsucht der veronika voss " during the " berlinale " , feb 23 , 1982 .
the film made fassbinder a household name in much of europe , but especially in france , said francois numer , who together a fassbinder retrospective at the world-famous centre pompidou in 2006 . " in france , fassbinder was a shock for many people , " numer said .
" on the one hand , people took offense at the scandals surrounding him .
but then again , it was the first time for a german producer to command such a prominent role on the european film circuit . " on the night of june 10 , 1982 , fassbinder took an overdose of cocaine and sleeping pills .
when he was found , the unfinished script for a version of " rosa luxemburg " was lying next to him .
so boundless was his drive and creativity that , throughout his downward spiral and even in the moment of his death , fassbinder never ceased to be productive . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany , fair trade flowers are an increasingly popular way to change that . child labor , skin disease and miscarriage are three things that german consumers most certainly do n't associate with flowers .
but these are part of the daily life at greenhouse operations in equatorial areas .
many flowers , especially roses and carnations , are imported from lands like colombia , kenya and zimbabwe .
during winter , when flower production in central europe is nonexistent , foreign exports kick into high gear .
booming sector bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florists are offering fair trade options the cut flower business is booming and developing markets have seen the sector grow by 70 percent in the past decade .
europeans and north americans buy flowers from the developing world for valentine 's day , mother 's day or birthdays .
low wages , toxic pesticides , skin problems , miscarriages and child labor are part of many nursery operations .
this reality has made fair trade a popular option for german consumers .
fair trade promotes standards like minimum wage , age restrictions , pregnancy leave and protective clothing .
it provides vacation and overtime .
wolfram schmuck , spokesman fort the german retail giant rewe group , said fair trade is a way to improve social standards .
" a company like rewe group also has societal responsibilities and with such products we can send a political signal , " he said .
buying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers are now a fair trade item since 1993 , rewe has offered fair trade products such as coffee , tea and chocolate and tried to make the consumer aware that he or she also had the power to do something .
peter klas , a customer , said he tries to buy fair trade flowers .
" i often buy fair trade and right now for flowers i find it somehow very important because the majority come from africa and the people there must work under very bad conditions " klas said . " i hope that with fair trade will ensure that these people are paid regularly and also can work under decent conditions . "
independent inspectors regularly test to make sure fair trade conditions are being met .
importers pay a fair trade premium that is at least 12 percent of the purchase price .
a committee made up of representatives of workers and managers decides together on how the premium money can best be used for the good of the worker .
the quality of fair trade flowers becomes obvious from their popularity .
since starting to carry fair trade flowers in march , rewe has sold two million roses .
other companies have also opted for fair trade flowers .
people can also buy fair trade flowers from florists involved in the program or from grocery stores with the fair trade approval seal .

the country is looking for advice from germany , which hosted the 2006 world cup with great success . construction sites are the most visible sign that in a year 's time austria will be staging the biggest sports event in the country since the 1976 olympic winter games in innsbruck . the country has invested some136 million euros -lrb- $ 182 millions -rrb- in upgrading three existing stadiums in vienna , innsbruck and salzburg , and is building one from scratch in klagenfurt . an additional 133 million euros were invested in the event itself . the country expects a gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- increase from the event of 0.15 percent , creating 321 million euros in additional wealth .
austria 's tourism industry expects one million extra overnight stays . getting a face-lift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ernst happel stadium is getting in shape for 2008 vienna 's ernst-happel-stadium is almost ready to host the final . the 75-year-old stadium , equipped to hold 50,000 , will be reopened on sept.11 with a friendly against chile . the stadiums in salzburg and innsbruck , both being currently expanded to seat around 30,000 each , will also be ready by this autumn . the salzburg stadium , close to the baroque klessheim palace , was strongly opposed by local residents , fearing traffic chaos and the destruction of cultural heritage .
it remains unclear whether rebuilding it to a smaller size after the tournament , as promised to the residents , will go ahead . klagenfurt 's stadium was the biggest challenge .
the 32,000-seat stadium , the only one built completely from scratch , almost endangered austria 's host role as a result of planning problems .
now everything is on schedule , organizers say . german ex per tise security at the tournament will focus on international police cooperation .
talks are taking place with potential participant countries on how to deal best with the fan influx and to exchange information .
austria has already requested logistic support from germany , which can draw on the experience of last year 's world cup . austria 's parliament is also expected to approve an amendment to austria 's police laws , allowing pre-emptive arrests of known hooligans . austria 's host cities all had their concepts for fan zones and public viewing areas approved by uefa , while many other cities are preparing their own football zones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro08 mascots trix and flix in vienna , where a fan zone is planned along part of the ringstrasse , not everyone is happy .
residents fear that blocking one of the city 's major lifelines will lead to large-scale traffic chaos and interfere with performances in at least one major theater . organizers are still working on raising public enthusiasm for the event , initiating a road-show called ' euromania , ' an internet platform and from april to july 2008 the exhibition ' fascination football ' in vienna .
tournament-organized promotion tours will start in spring 2008 - and organizers say a top priority is to include residents and local business in the preparations . dpa / dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany , fair trade flowers are an increasingly popular way to change that . child labor , skin disease and miscarriage are three things that german consumers most certainly do n't associate with flowers .
but these are part of the daily life at greenhouse operations in equatorial areas .
many flowers , especially roses and carnations , are imported from lands like colombia , kenya and zimbabwe .
during winter , when flower production in central europe is nonexistent , foreign exports kick into high gear .
booming sector bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florists are offering fair trade options the cut flower business is booming and developing markets have seen the sector grow by 70 percent in the past decade .
europeans and north americans buy flowers from the developing world for valentine 's day , mother 's day or birthdays .
low wages , toxic pesticides , skin problems , miscarriages and child labor are part of many nursery operations .
this reality has made fair trade a popular option for german consumers .
fair trade promotes standards like minimum wage , age restrictions , pregnancy leave and protective clothing .
it provides vacation and overtime .
wolfram schmuck , spokesman fort the german retail giant rewe group , said fair trade is a way to improve social standards .
" a company like rewe group also has societal responsibilities and with such products we can send a political signal , " he said .
buying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers are now a fair trade item since 1993 , rewe has offered fair trade products such as coffee , tea and chocolate and tried to make the consumer aware that he or she also had the power to do something .
peter klas , a customer , said he tries to buy fair trade flowers .
" i often buy fair trade and right now for flowers i find it somehow very important because the majority come from africa and the people there must work under very bad conditions " klas said . " i hope that with fair trade will ensure that these people are paid regularly and also can work under decent conditions . "
independent inspectors regularly test to make sure fair trade conditions are being met .
importers pay a fair trade premium that is at least 12 percent of the purchase price .
a committee made up of representatives of workers and managers decides together on how the premium money can best be used for the good of the worker .
the quality of fair trade flowers becomes obvious from their popularity .
since starting to carry fair trade flowers in march , rewe has sold two million roses .
other companies have also opted for fair trade flowers .
people can also buy fair trade flowers from florists involved in the program or from grocery stores with the fair trade approval seal .
consumers get peace of mind .
" i think that i can contribute something very concrete for fair trade and worldwide trade and that 's my little contribution . "
klas said .
" yes , every person should do a little something to make the world better . " homeira heidary -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

low wages , toxic pesticides , skin problems , miscarriages and child labor are part of many nursery operations .
this reality has made fair trade a popular option for german consumers .
fair trade promotes standards like minimum wage , age restrictions , pregnancy leave and protective clothing .
it provides vacation and overtime .
wolfram schmuck , spokesman fort the german retail giant rewe group , said fair trade is a way to improve social standards .
" a company like rewe group also has societal responsibilities and with such products we can send a political signal , " he said .
buying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers are now a fair trade item since 1993 , rewe has offered fair trade products such as coffee , tea and chocolate and tried to make the consumer aware that he or she also had the power to do something .
peter klas , a customer , said he tries to buy fair trade flowers .
" i often buy fair trade and right now for flowers i find it somehow very important because the majority come from africa and the people there must work under very bad conditions " klas said . " i hope that with fair trade will ensure that these people are paid regularly and also can work under decent conditions . "
independent inspectors regularly test to make sure fair trade conditions are being met .
importers pay a fair trade premium that is at least 12 percent of the purchase price .
a committee made up of representatives of workers and managers decides together on how the premium money can best be used for the good of the worker .
the quality of fair trade flowers becomes obvious from their popularity .
since starting to carry fair trade flowers in march , rewe has sold two million roses .
other companies have also opted for fair trade flowers .
people can also buy fair trade flowers from florists involved in the program or from grocery stores with the fair trade approval seal .
consumers get peace of mind .
" i think that i can contribute something very concrete for fair trade and worldwide trade and that 's my little contribution . "
klas said .
" yes , every person should do a little something to make the world better . " homeira heidary -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 10.06.2007 fair trade blooms in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers are not always picked under ideal conditions producers of cut flowers in developing countries are notorious for providing low wages , toxic working conditions and using child labor .
in germany , fair trade flowers are an increasingly popular way to change that . child labor , skin disease and miscarriage are three things that german consumers most certainly do n't associate with flowers .
but these are part of the daily life at greenhouse operations in equatorial areas .
many flowers , especially roses and carnations , are imported from lands like colombia , kenya and zimbabwe .
during winter , when flower production in central europe is nonexistent , foreign exports kick into high gear .
booming sector bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florists are offering fair trade options the cut flower business is booming and developing markets have seen the sector grow by 70 percent in the past decade .
europeans and north americans buy flowers from the developing world for valentine 's day , mother 's day or birthdays .
low wages , toxic pesticides , skin problems , miscarriages and child labor are part of many nursery operations .
this reality has made fair trade a popular option for german consumers .
fair trade promotes standards like minimum wage , age restrictions , pregnancy leave and protective clothing .
it provides vacation and overtime .
wolfram schmuck , spokesman fort the german retail giant rewe group , said fair trade is a way to improve social standards .
" a company like rewe group also has societal responsibilities and with such products we can send a political signal , " he said .
buying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers are now a fair trade item since 1993 , rewe has offered fair trade products such as coffee , tea and chocolate and tried to make the consumer aware that he or she also had the power to do something .
peter klas , a customer , said he tries to buy fair trade flowers .
" i often buy fair trade and right now for flowers i find it somehow very important because the majority come from africa and the people there must work under very bad conditions " klas said . " i hope that with fair trade will ensure that these people are paid regularly and also can work under decent conditions . "
independent inspectors regularly test to make sure fair trade conditions are being met .
importers pay a fair trade premium that is at least 12 percent of the purchase price .
a committee made up of representatives of workers and managers decides together on how the premium money can best be used for the good of the worker .
the quality of fair trade flowers becomes obvious from their popularity .
since starting to carry fair trade flowers in march , rewe has sold two million roses .
other companies have also opted for fair trade flowers .
people can also buy fair trade flowers from florists involved in the program or from grocery stores with the fair trade approval seal .
consumers get peace of mind .
" i think that i can contribute something very concrete for fair trade and worldwide trade and that 's my little contribution . "
klas said .
" yes , every person should do a little something to make the world better . " homeira heidary -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first scheduled passenger train to whizz along the state-of-the-art new tracks was an inter-city express -lrb- ice -rrb- train , operated by germany 's deutsche bahn , that left paris at 6:43 a.m. headed to frankfurt .

the line cost four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- to build , mobilized some 10,000 workers over five years , and used up 78,000 tons of steel - enough to build eight eiffel towers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 10.06.2007 fair trade blooms in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers are not always picked under ideal conditions producers of cut flowers in developing countries are notorious for providing low wages , toxic working conditions and using child labor .
in germany , fair trade flowers are an increasingly popular way to change that . child labor , skin disease and miscarriage are three things that german consumers most certainly do n't associate with flowers .
but these are part of the daily life at greenhouse operations in equatorial areas .
many flowers , especially roses and carnations , are imported from lands like colombia , kenya and zimbabwe .
during winter , when flower production in central europe is nonexistent , foreign exports kick into high gear .
booming sector bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florists are offering fair trade options the cut flower business is booming and developing markets have seen the sector grow by 70 percent in the past decade .
europeans and north americans buy flowers from the developing world for valentine 's day , mother 's day or birthdays .
low wages , toxic pesticides , skin problems , miscarriages and child labor are part of many nursery operations .
this reality has made fair trade a popular option for german consumers .
fair trade promotes standards like minimum wage , age restrictions , pregnancy leave and protective clothing .
it provides vacation and overtime .
wolfram schmuck , spokesman fort the german retail giant rewe group , said fair trade is a way to improve social standards .
" a company like rewe group also has societal responsibilities and with such products we can send a political signal , " he said .
buying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers are now a fair trade item since 1993 , rewe has offered fair trade products such as coffee , tea and chocolate and tried to make the consumer aware that he or she also had the power to do something .
peter klas , a customer , said he tries to buy fair trade flowers .
" i often buy fair trade and right now for flowers i find it somehow very important because the majority come from africa and the people there must work under very bad conditions " klas said . " i hope that with fair trade will ensure that these people are paid regularly and also can work under decent conditions . "
independent inspectors regularly test to make sure fair trade conditions are being met .
importers pay a fair trade premium that is at least 12 percent of the purchase price .
a committee made up of representatives of workers and managers decides together on how the premium money can best be used for the good of the worker .
the quality of fair trade flowers becomes obvious from their popularity .
since starting to carry fair trade flowers in march , rewe has sold two million roses .
other companies have also opted for fair trade flowers .
people can also buy fair trade flowers from florists involved in the program or from grocery stores with the fair trade approval seal .
consumers get peace of mind .
" i think that i can contribute something very concrete for fair trade and worldwide trade and that 's my little contribution . "
klas said .
" yes , every person should do a little something to make the world better . " homeira heidary -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country is looking for advice from germany , which hosted the 2006 world cup with great success . construction sites are the most visible sign that in a year 's time austria will be staging the biggest sports event in the country since the 1976 olympic winter games in innsbruck . the country has invested some136 million euros -lrb- $ 182 millions -rrb- in upgrading three existing stadiums in vienna , innsbruck and salzburg , and is building one from scratch in klagenfurt . an additional 133 million euros were invested in the event itself . the country expects a gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- increase from the event of 0.15 percent , creating 321 million euros in additional wealth .
austria 's tourism industry expects one million extra overnight stays . getting a face-lift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ernst happel stadium is getting in shape for 2008 vienna 's ernst-happel-stadium is almost ready to host the final . the 75-year-old stadium , equipped to hold 50,000 , will be reopened on sept.11 with a friendly against chile . the stadiums in salzburg and innsbruck , both being currently expanded to seat around 30,000 each , will also be ready by this autumn . the salzburg stadium , close to the baroque klessheim palace , was strongly opposed by local residents , fearing traffic chaos and the destruction of cultural heritage .
it remains unclear whether rebuilding it to a smaller size after the tournament , as promised to the residents , will go ahead . klagenfurt 's stadium was the biggest challenge .
the 32,000-seat stadium , the only one built completely from scratch , almost endangered austria 's host role as a result of planning problems .
now everything is on schedule , organizers say . german ex per tise security at the tournament will focus on international police cooperation .
talks are taking place with potential participant countries on how to deal best with the fan influx and to exchange information .
austria has already requested logistic support from germany , which can draw on the experience of last year 's world cup . austria 's parliament is also expected to approve an amendment to austria 's police laws , allowing pre-emptive arrests of known hooligans . austria 's host cities all had their concepts for fan zones and public viewing areas approved by uefa , while many other cities are preparing their own football zones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro08 mascots trix and flix in vienna , where a fan zone is planned along part of the ringstrasse , not everyone is happy .
residents fear that blocking one of the city 's major lifelines will lead to large-scale traffic chaos and interfere with performances in at least one major theater . organizers are still working on raising public enthusiasm for the event , initiating a road-show called ' euromania , ' an internet platform and from april to july 2008 the exhibition ' fascination football ' in vienna .
tournament-organized promotion tours will start in spring 2008 - and organizers say a top priority is to include residents and local business in the preparations . dpa / dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany , fair trade flowers are an increasingly popular way to change that . child labor , skin disease and miscarriage are three things that german consumers most certainly do n't associate with flowers .
but these are part of the daily life at greenhouse operations in equatorial areas .
many flowers , especially roses and carnations , are imported from lands like colombia , kenya and zimbabwe .
during winter , when flower production in central europe is nonexistent , foreign exports kick into high gear .
booming sector bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florists are offering fair trade options the cut flower business is booming and developing markets have seen the sector grow by 70 percent in the past decade .
europeans and north americans buy flowers from the developing world for valentine 's day , mother 's day or birthdays .
low wages , toxic pesticides , skin problems , miscarriages and child labor are part of many nursery operations .
this reality has made fair trade a popular option for german consumers .
fair trade promotes standards like minimum wage , age restrictions , pregnancy leave and protective clothing .
it provides vacation and overtime .
wolfram schmuck , spokesman fort the german retail giant rewe group , said fair trade is a way to improve social standards .
" a company like rewe group also has societal responsibilities and with such products we can send a political signal , " he said .
buying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers are now a fair trade item since 1993 , rewe has offered fair trade products such as coffee , tea and chocolate and tried to make the consumer aware that he or she also had the power to do something .
peter klas , a customer , said he tries to buy fair trade flowers .
" i often buy fair trade and right now for flowers i find it somehow very important because the majority come from africa and the people there must work under very bad conditions " klas said . " i hope that with fair trade will ensure that these people are paid regularly and also can work under decent conditions . "
independent inspectors regularly test to make sure fair trade conditions are being met .
importers pay a fair trade premium that is at least 12 percent of the purchase price .
a committee made up of representatives of workers and managers decides together on how the premium money can best be used for the good of the worker .
the quality of fair trade flowers becomes obvious from their popularity .
since starting to carry fair trade flowers in march , rewe has sold two million roses .
other companies have also opted for fair trade flowers .
people can also buy fair trade flowers from florists involved in the program or from grocery stores with the fair trade approval seal .
consumers get peace of mind .
" i think that i can contribute something very concrete for fair trade and worldwide trade and that 's my little contribution . "
klas said .
" yes , every person should do a little something to make the world better . " homeira heidary -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 10.06.2007 fair trade blooms in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers are not always picked under ideal conditions producers of cut flowers in developing countries are notorious for providing low wages , toxic working conditions and using child labor .
in germany , fair trade flowers are an increasingly popular way to change that . child labor , skin disease and miscarriage are three things that german consumers most certainly do n't associate with flowers .
but these are part of the daily life at greenhouse operations in equatorial areas .
many flowers , especially roses and carnations , are imported from lands like colombia , kenya and zimbabwe .
during winter , when flower production in central europe is nonexistent , foreign exports kick into high gear .
booming sector bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florists are offering fair trade options the cut flower business is booming and developing markets have seen the sector grow by 70 percent in the past decade .
europeans and north americans buy flowers from the developing world for valentine 's day , mother 's day or birthdays .
low wages , toxic pesticides , skin problems , miscarriages and child labor are part of many nursery operations .
this reality has made fair trade a popular option for german consumers .
fair trade promotes standards like minimum wage , age restrictions , pregnancy leave and protective clothing .
it provides vacation and overtime .
wolfram schmuck , spokesman fort the german retail giant rewe group , said fair trade is a way to improve social standards .
" a company like rewe group also has societal responsibilities and with such products we can send a political signal , " he said .
buying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers are now a fair trade item since 1993 , rewe has offered fair trade products such as coffee , tea and chocolate and tried to make the consumer aware that he or she also had the power to do something .
peter klas , a customer , said he tries to buy fair trade flowers .
" i often buy fair trade and right now for flowers i find it somehow very important because the majority come from africa and the people there must work under very bad conditions " klas said . " i hope that with fair trade will ensure that these people are paid regularly and also can work under decent conditions . "
independent inspectors regularly test to make sure fair trade conditions are being met .
importers pay a fair trade premium that is at least 12 percent of the purchase price .
a committee made up of representatives of workers and managers decides together on how the premium money can best be used for the good of the worker .
the quality of fair trade flowers becomes obvious from their popularity .
since starting to carry fair trade flowers in march , rewe has sold two million roses .
other companies have also opted for fair trade flowers .
people can also buy fair trade flowers from florists involved in the program or from grocery stores with the fair trade approval seal .
consumers get peace of mind .
" i think that i can contribute something very concrete for fair trade and worldwide trade and that 's my little contribution . "
klas said .
" yes , every person should do a little something to make the world better . " homeira heidary -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany , fair trade flowers are an increasingly popular way to change that . child labor , skin disease and miscarriage are three things that german consumers most certainly do n't associate with flowers .
but these are part of the daily life at greenhouse operations in equatorial areas .
many flowers , especially roses and carnations , are imported from lands like colombia , kenya and zimbabwe .
during winter , when flower production in central europe is nonexistent , foreign exports kick into high gear .
booming sector bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florists are offering fair trade options the cut flower business is booming and developing markets have seen the sector grow by 70 percent in the past decade .
europeans and north americans buy flowers from the developing world for valentine 's day , mother 's day or birthdays .
low wages , toxic pesticides , skin problems , miscarriages and child labor are part of many nursery operations .
this reality has made fair trade a popular option for german consumers .
fair trade promotes standards like minimum wage , age restrictions , pregnancy leave and protective clothing .
it provides vacation and overtime .
wolfram schmuck , spokesman fort the german retail giant rewe group , said fair trade is a way to improve social standards .
" a company like rewe group also has societal responsibilities and with such products we can send a political signal , " he said .
buying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers are now a fair trade item since 1993 , rewe has offered fair trade products such as coffee , tea and chocolate and tried to make the consumer aware that he or she also had the power to do something .
peter klas , a customer , said he tries to buy fair trade flowers .
" i often buy fair trade and right now for flowers i find it somehow very important because the majority come from africa and the people there must work under very bad conditions " klas said . " i hope that with fair trade will ensure that these people are paid regularly and also can work under decent conditions . "
independent inspectors regularly test to make sure fair trade conditions are being met .
importers pay a fair trade premium that is at least 12 percent of the purchase price .
a committee made up of representatives of workers and managers decides together on how the premium money can best be used for the good of the worker .
the quality of fair trade flowers becomes obvious from their popularity .
since starting to carry fair trade flowers in march , rewe has sold two million roses .
other companies have also opted for fair trade flowers .
people can also buy fair trade flowers from florists involved in the program or from grocery stores with the fair trade approval seal .
consumers get peace of mind .
" i think that i can contribute something very concrete for fair trade and worldwide trade and that 's my little contribution . "
klas said .
" yes , every person should do a little something to make the world better . " homeira heidary -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 10.06.2007 fair trade blooms in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers are not always picked under ideal conditions producers of cut flowers in developing countries are notorious for providing low wages , toxic working conditions and using child labor .
in germany , fair trade flowers are an increasingly popular way to change that . child labor , skin disease and miscarriage are three things that german consumers most certainly do n't associate with flowers .
but these are part of the daily life at greenhouse operations in equatorial areas .
many flowers , especially roses and carnations , are imported from lands like colombia , kenya and zimbabwe .
during winter , when flower production in central europe is nonexistent , foreign exports kick into high gear .
booming sector bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florists are offering fair trade options the cut flower business is booming and developing markets have seen the sector grow by 70 percent in the past decade .
europeans and north americans buy flowers from the developing world for valentine 's day , mother 's day or birthdays .
low wages , toxic pesticides , skin problems , miscarriages and child labor are part of many nursery operations .
this reality has made fair trade a popular option for german consumers .
fair trade promotes standards like minimum wage , age restrictions , pregnancy leave and protective clothing .
it provides vacation and overtime .
wolfram schmuck , spokesman fort the german retail giant rewe group , said fair trade is a way to improve social standards .
" a company like rewe group also has societal responsibilities and with such products we can send a political signal , " he said .
buying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers are now a fair trade item since 1993 , rewe has offered fair trade products such as coffee , tea and chocolate and tried to make the consumer aware that he or she also had the power to do something .
peter klas , a customer , said he tries to buy fair trade flowers .
" i often buy fair trade and right now for flowers i find it somehow very important because the majority come from africa and the people there must work under very bad conditions " klas said . " i hope that with fair trade will ensure that these people are paid regularly and also can work under decent conditions . "
independent inspectors regularly test to make sure fair trade conditions are being met .
importers pay a fair trade premium that is at least 12 percent of the purchase price .
a committee made up of representatives of workers and managers decides together on how the premium money can best be used for the good of the worker .
the quality of fair trade flowers becomes obvious from their popularity .
since starting to carry fair trade flowers in march , rewe has sold two million roses .
other companies have also opted for fair trade flowers .
people can also buy fair trade flowers from florists involved in the program or from grocery stores with the fair trade approval seal .
consumers get peace of mind .
" i think that i can contribute something very concrete for fair trade and worldwide trade and that 's my little contribution . "
klas said .
" yes , every person should do a little something to make the world better . " homeira heidary -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country is looking for advice from germany , which hosted the 2006 world cup with great success . construction sites are the most visible sign that in a year 's time austria will be staging the biggest sports event in the country since the 1976 olympic winter games in innsbruck . the country has invested some136 million euros -lrb- $ 182 millions -rrb- in upgrading three existing stadiums in vienna , innsbruck and salzburg , and is building one from scratch in klagenfurt . an additional 133 million euros were invested in the event itself . the country expects a gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- increase from the event of 0.15 percent , creating 321 million euros in additional wealth .
austria 's tourism industry expects one million extra overnight stays . getting a face-lift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ernst happel stadium is getting in shape for 2008 vienna 's ernst-happel-stadium is almost ready to host the final . the 75-year-old stadium , equipped to hold 50,000 , will be reopened on sept.11 with a friendly against chile . the stadiums in salzburg and innsbruck , both being currently expanded to seat around 30,000 each , will also be ready by this autumn . the salzburg stadium , close to the baroque klessheim palace , was strongly opposed by local residents , fearing traffic chaos and the destruction of cultural heritage .
it remains unclear whether rebuilding it to a smaller size after the tournament , as promised to the residents , will go ahead . klagenfurt 's stadium was the biggest challenge .
the 32,000-seat stadium , the only one built completely from scratch , almost endangered austria 's host role as a result of planning problems .
now everything is on schedule , organizers say . german ex per tise security at the tournament will focus on international police cooperation .
talks are taking place with potential participant countries on how to deal best with the fan influx and to exchange information .
austria has already requested logistic support from germany , which can draw on the experience of last year 's world cup . austria 's parliament is also expected to approve an amendment to austria 's police laws , allowing pre-emptive arrests of known hooligans . austria 's host cities all had their concepts for fan zones and public viewing areas approved by uefa , while many other cities are preparing their own football zones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro08 mascots trix and flix in vienna , where a fan zone is planned along part of the ringstrasse , not everyone is happy .
residents fear that blocking one of the city 's major lifelines will lead to large-scale traffic chaos and interfere with performances in at least one major theater . organizers are still working on raising public enthusiasm for the event , initiating a road-show called ' euromania , ' an internet platform and from april to july 2008 the exhibition ' fascination football ' in vienna .
tournament-organized promotion tours will start in spring 2008 - and organizers say a top priority is to include residents and local business in the preparations . dpa / dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country is looking for advice from germany , which hosted the 2006 world cup with great success . construction sites are the most visible sign that in a year 's time austria will be staging the biggest sports event in the country since the 1976 olympic winter games in innsbruck . the country has invested some136 million euros -lrb- $ 182 millions -rrb- in upgrading three existing stadiums in vienna , innsbruck and salzburg , and is building one from scratch in klagenfurt . an additional 133 million euros were invested in the event itself . the country expects a gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- increase from the event of 0.15 percent , creating 321 million euros in additional wealth .
austria 's tourism industry expects one million extra overnight stays . getting a face-lift bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ernst happel stadium is getting in shape for 2008 vienna 's ernst-happel-stadium is almost ready to host the final . the 75-year-old stadium , equipped to hold 50,000 , will be reopened on sept.11 with a friendly against chile . the stadiums in salzburg and innsbruck , both being currently expanded to seat around 30,000 each , will also be ready by this autumn . the salzburg stadium , close to the baroque klessheim palace , was strongly opposed by local residents , fearing traffic chaos and the destruction of cultural heritage .
it remains unclear whether rebuilding it to a smaller size after the tournament , as promised to the residents , will go ahead . klagenfurt 's stadium was the biggest challenge .
the 32,000-seat stadium , the only one built completely from scratch , almost endangered austria 's host role as a result of planning problems .
now everything is on schedule , organizers say . german ex per tise security at the tournament will focus on international police cooperation .
talks are taking place with potential participant countries on how to deal best with the fan influx and to exchange information .
austria has already requested logistic support from germany , which can draw on the experience of last year 's world cup . austria 's parliament is also expected to approve an amendment to austria 's police laws , allowing pre-emptive arrests of known hooligans . austria 's host cities all had their concepts for fan zones and public viewing areas approved by uefa , while many other cities are preparing their own football zones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro08 mascots trix and flix in vienna , where a fan zone is planned along part of the ringstrasse , not everyone is happy .
residents fear that blocking one of the city 's major lifelines will lead to large-scale traffic chaos and interfere with performances in at least one major theater . organizers are still working on raising public enthusiasm for the event , initiating a road-show called ' euromania , ' an internet platform and from april to july 2008 the exhibition ' fascination football ' in vienna .
tournament-organized promotion tours will start in spring 2008 - and organizers say a top priority is to include residents and local business in the preparations . dpa / dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first scheduled passenger train to whizz along the state-of-the-art new tracks was an inter-city express -lrb- ice -rrb- train , operated by germany 's deutsche bahn , that left paris at 6:43 a.m. headed to frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tgvs will link paris to munich france 's superfast train a grande vitesse -lrb- tgv -rrb- will also provide services into germany from december , traveling over the border for the trip to munich via stuttgart .
the new services provide a real alternative to flying and one that is cleaner and more hassle-free , officials say .
going faster the new line , the tgv est , runs for 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- between paris and strasbourg , the home of the european parliament , cutting the journey time between the two cities from four hours to two hours and 20 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and french train conductors already welcomed the ice in frankfurt on may 25 passenger services on the track between paris and the border will run at 320 kilometers per hour - compared to 300 kph elsewhere on the tgv network - dropping to around 250 kph once inside germany .
the line links paris to one of france 's last regions to be hooked up to the national high-speed network , bringing the cities of strasbourg , nancy , metz and reims within commuting distance of the capital .
it was inaugurated on saturday with a tgv trip from paris to strasbourg and began commercial service on sunday .
it was on this stretch that the tgv broke its own world speed record in april , hurtling into the history books at 574.8 kilometers per hour .
costing billions the new line will also provide a showcase for rival trainmakers , alstom of france , maker of the tgv , and siemens of germany , which makes ice trains , to display their products .
the line cost four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- to build , mobilized some 10,000 workers over five years , and used up 78,000 tons of steel - enough to build eight eiffel towers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the link cost billions to build along the tgv-est 's path 17 rail stations have been spruced up and three built from scratch , while gleaming new business parks have sprung up in anticipation of the extra investment and tourism it is hoped the fast train will bring .
the french rail operator sncf has already sold more than 600,000 tickets for travel on the new paris-strasbourg line and hopes it will carry more than 11 million passengers annually by 2010 .
the cost of the project was shared among 22 financial partners including the french government , luxembourg , the european union and the sncf .
the pride of french engineering , the tgv - which turned 25 last year - is one of the world 's fastest rail services , along with japan 's shinkansen bullet train and germany 's ice .
outside france , tgvs provide high-speed links to london and brussels , and low-speed connections over the french border into switzerland and italy . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first scheduled passenger train to whizz along the state-of-the-art new tracks was an inter-city express -lrb- ice -rrb- train , operated by germany 's deutsche bahn , that left paris at 6:43 a.m. headed to frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tgvs will link paris to munich france 's superfast train a grande vitesse -lrb- tgv -rrb- will also provide services into germany from december , traveling over the border for the trip to munich via stuttgart .
the new services provide a real alternative to flying and one that is cleaner and more hassle-free , officials say .
going faster the new line , the tgv est , runs for 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- between paris and strasbourg , the home of the european parliament , cutting the journey time between the two cities from four hours to two hours and 20 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and french train conductors already welcomed the ice in frankfurt on may 25 passenger services on the track between paris and the border will run at 320 kilometers per hour - compared to 300 kph elsewhere on the tgv network - dropping to around 250 kph once inside germany .
the line links paris to one of france 's last regions to be hooked up to the national high-speed network , bringing the cities of strasbourg , nancy , metz and reims within commuting distance of the capital .
it was inaugurated on saturday with a tgv trip from paris to strasbourg and began commercial service on sunday .
it was on this stretch that the tgv broke its own world speed record in april , hurtling into the history books at 574.8 kilometers per hour .
costing billions the new line will also provide a showcase for rival trainmakers , alstom of france , maker of the tgv , and siemens of germany , which makes ice trains , to display their products .
the line cost four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- to build , mobilized some 10,000 workers over five years , and used up 78,000 tons of steel - enough to build eight eiffel towers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the link cost billions to build along the tgv-est 's path 17 rail stations have been spruced up and three built from scratch , while gleaming new business parks have sprung up in anticipation of the extra investment and tourism it is hoped the fast train will bring .
the french rail operator sncf has already sold more than 600,000 tickets for travel on the new paris-strasbourg line and hopes it will carry more than 11 million passengers annually by 2010 .
the cost of the project was shared among 22 financial partners including the french government , luxembourg , the european union and the sncf .
the pride of french engineering , the tgv - which turned 25 last year - is one of the world 's fastest rail services , along with japan 's shinkansen bullet train and germany 's ice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 10.06.2007 fair trade blooms in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers are not always picked under ideal conditions producers of cut flowers in developing countries are notorious for providing low wages , toxic working conditions and using child labor .
in germany , fair trade flowers are an increasingly popular way to change that . child labor , skin disease and miscarriage are three things that german consumers most certainly do n't associate with flowers .
but these are part of the daily life at greenhouse operations in equatorial areas .
many flowers , especially roses and carnations , are imported from lands like colombia , kenya and zimbabwe .
during winter , when flower production in central europe is nonexistent , foreign exports kick into high gear .
booming sector bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florists are offering fair trade options the cut flower business is booming and developing markets have seen the sector grow by 70 percent in the past decade .
europeans and north americans buy flowers from the developing world for valentine 's day , mother 's day or birthdays .
low wages , toxic pesticides , skin problems , miscarriages and child labor are part of many nursery operations .
this reality has made fair trade a popular option for german consumers .
fair trade promotes standards like minimum wage , age restrictions , pregnancy leave and protective clothing .
it provides vacation and overtime .
wolfram schmuck , spokesman fort the german retail giant rewe group , said fair trade is a way to improve social standards .
" a company like rewe group also has societal responsibilities and with such products we can send a political signal , " he said .
buying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers are now a fair trade item since 1993 , rewe has offered fair trade products such as coffee , tea and chocolate and tried to make the consumer aware that he or she also had the power to do something .
peter klas , a customer , said he tries to buy fair trade flowers .
" i often buy fair trade and right now for flowers i find it somehow very important because the majority come from africa and the people there must work under very bad conditions " klas said . " i hope that with fair trade will ensure that these people are paid regularly and also can work under decent conditions . "
independent inspectors regularly test to make sure fair trade conditions are being met .
importers pay a fair trade premium that is at least 12 percent of the purchase price .
a committee made up of representatives of workers and managers decides together on how the premium money can best be used for the good of the worker .
the quality of fair trade flowers becomes obvious from their popularity .
since starting to carry fair trade flowers in march , rewe has sold two million roses .
other companies have also opted for fair trade flowers .
people can also buy fair trade flowers from florists involved in the program or from grocery stores with the fair trade approval seal .
consumers get peace of mind .
" i think that i can contribute something very concrete for fair trade and worldwide trade and that 's my little contribution . "
klas said .

" i happen to believe that it 's important to move the process along , " bush told reporters in tirana , during the first ever visit to albania by a us president .

the plan is backed by kosovo albanian leaders , the united states and the european union , but adamantly opposed by serbia and its ally russia , which has threatened to block it before the un security council .
bush : no more delays during last week 's meeting in germany of leaders from the group of eight most industrialized countries , french president nicolas sarkozy had proposed a six-month pause for reflection on kosovo 's status before implementing any plan .
but bush made it clear in tirana that the time for reflection was over and warned of possible unrest if the aspirations of the kosovo albanians were not met .

the country is looking for advice from germany , which hosted the 2006 world cup with great success . construction sites are the most visible sign that in a year 's time austria will be staging the biggest sports event in the country since the 1976 olympic winter games in innsbruck . the country has invested some136 million euros -lrb- $ 182 millions -rrb- in upgrading three existing stadiums in vienna , innsbruck and salzburg , and is building one from scratch in klagenfurt . an additional 133 million euros were invested in the event itself . the country expects a gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- increase from the event of 0.15 percent , creating 321 million euros in additional wealth .

it remains unclear whether rebuilding it to a smaller size after the tournament , as promised to the residents , will go ahead . klagenfurt 's stadium was the biggest challenge .
the 32,000-seat stadium , the only one built completely from scratch , almost endangered austria 's host role as a result of planning problems .
now everything is on schedule , organizers say . german ex per tise security at the tournament will focus on international police cooperation .
talks are taking place with potential participant countries on how to deal best with the fan influx and to exchange information .
austria has already requested logistic support from germany , which can draw on the experience of last year 's world cup . austria 's parliament is also expected to approve an amendment to austria 's police laws , allowing pre-emptive arrests of known hooligans . austria 's host cities all had their concepts for fan zones and public viewing areas approved by uefa , while many other cities are preparing their own football zones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro08 mascots trix and flix in vienna , where a fan zone is planned along part of the ringstrasse , not everyone is happy .
residents fear that blocking one of the city 's major lifelines will lead to large-scale traffic chaos and interfere with performances in at least one major theater . organizers are still working on raising public enthusiasm for the event , initiating a road-show called ' euromania , ' an internet platform and from april to july 2008 the exhibition ' fascination football ' in vienna .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 10.06.2007 high-speed train links france and germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's tgv is coming to germany the first high-speed rail link between france and germany began scheduled services sunday , slashing travel times and marking a major step towards a truly pan-european rapid transit network . the service , offering fast connections to luxembourg and switzerland , cuts the paris-frankfurt journey by two and a half hours to three hours 50 minutes and brings munich within six hours of the french capital .
the first scheduled passenger train to whizz along the state-of-the-art new tracks was an inter-city express -lrb- ice -rrb- train , operated by germany 's deutsche bahn , that left paris at 6:43 a.m. headed to frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tgvs will link paris to munich france 's superfast train a grande vitesse -lrb- tgv -rrb- will also provide services into germany from december , traveling over the border for the trip to munich via stuttgart .
the new services provide a real alternative to flying and one that is cleaner and more hassle-free , officials say .
going faster the new line , the tgv est , runs for 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- between paris and strasbourg , the home of the european parliament , cutting the journey time between the two cities from four hours to two hours and 20 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and french train conductors already welcomed the ice in frankfurt on may 25 passenger services on the track between paris and the border will run at 320 kilometers per hour - compared to 300 kph elsewhere on the tgv network - dropping to around 250 kph once inside germany .
the line links paris to one of france 's last regions to be hooked up to the national high-speed network , bringing the cities of strasbourg , nancy , metz and reims within commuting distance of the capital .
it was inaugurated on saturday with a tgv trip from paris to strasbourg and began commercial service on sunday .
it was on this stretch that the tgv broke its own world speed record in april , hurtling into the history books at 574.8 kilometers per hour .
costing billions the new line will also provide a showcase for rival trainmakers , alstom of france , maker of the tgv , and siemens of germany , which makes ice trains , to display their products .
the line cost four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- to build , mobilized some 10,000 workers over five years , and used up 78,000 tons of steel - enough to build eight eiffel towers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the link cost billions to build along the tgv-est 's path 17 rail stations have been spruced up and three built from scratch , while gleaming new business parks have sprung up in anticipation of the extra investment and tourism it is hoped the fast train will bring .
the french rail operator sncf has already sold more than 600,000 tickets for travel on the new paris-strasbourg line and hopes it will carry more than 11 million passengers annually by 2010 .
the cost of the project was shared among 22 financial partners including the french government , luxembourg , the european union and the sncf .
the pride of french engineering , the tgv - which turned 25 last year - is one of the world 's fastest rail services , along with japan 's shinkansen bullet train and germany 's ice .
outside france , tgvs provide high-speed links to london and brussels , and low-speed connections over the french border into switzerland and italy . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 10.06.2007 fair trade blooms in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers are not always picked under ideal conditions producers of cut flowers in developing countries are notorious for providing low wages , toxic working conditions and using child labor .
in germany , fair trade flowers are an increasingly popular way to change that . child labor , skin disease and miscarriage are three things that german consumers most certainly do n't associate with flowers .
but these are part of the daily life at greenhouse operations in equatorial areas .
many flowers , especially roses and carnations , are imported from lands like colombia , kenya and zimbabwe .
during winter , when flower production in central europe is nonexistent , foreign exports kick into high gear .
booming sector bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florists are offering fair trade options the cut flower business is booming and developing markets have seen the sector grow by 70 percent in the past decade .
europeans and north americans buy flowers from the developing world for valentine 's day , mother 's day or birthdays .
low wages , toxic pesticides , skin problems , miscarriages and child labor are part of many nursery operations .
this reality has made fair trade a popular option for german consumers .
fair trade promotes standards like minimum wage , age restrictions , pregnancy leave and protective clothing .
it provides vacation and overtime .
wolfram schmuck , spokesman fort the german retail giant rewe group , said fair trade is a way to improve social standards .
" a company like rewe group also has societal responsibilities and with such products we can send a political signal , " he said .
buying power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers are now a fair trade item since 1993 , rewe has offered fair trade products such as coffee , tea and chocolate and tried to make the consumer aware that he or she also had the power to do something .
peter klas , a customer , said he tries to buy fair trade flowers .
" i often buy fair trade and right now for flowers i find it somehow very important because the majority come from africa and the people there must work under very bad conditions " klas said . " i hope that with fair trade will ensure that these people are paid regularly and also can work under decent conditions . "
independent inspectors regularly test to make sure fair trade conditions are being met .
importers pay a fair trade premium that is at least 12 percent of the purchase price .
a committee made up of representatives of workers and managers decides together on how the premium money can best be used for the good of the worker .
the quality of fair trade flowers becomes obvious from their popularity .
since starting to carry fair trade flowers in march , rewe has sold two million roses .
other companies have also opted for fair trade flowers .
people can also buy fair trade flowers from florists involved in the program or from grocery stores with the fair trade approval seal .
consumers get peace of mind .
" i think that i can contribute something very concrete for fair trade and worldwide trade and that 's my little contribution . "

in germany , fair trade flowers are an increasingly popular way to change that . child labor , skin disease and miscarriage are three things that german consumers most certainly do n't associate with flowers .
but these are part of the daily life at greenhouse operations in equatorial areas .
many flowers , especially roses and carnations , are imported from lands like colombia , kenya and zimbabwe .
during winter , when flower production in central europe is nonexistent , foreign exports kick into high gear .
booming sector bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florists are offering fair trade options the cut flower business is booming and developing markets have seen the sector grow by 70 percent in the past decade .
europeans and north americans buy flowers from the developing world for valentine 's day , mother 's day or birthdays .
low wages , toxic pesticides , skin problems , miscarriages and child labor are part of many nursery operations .
this reality has made fair trade a popular option for german consumers .
fair trade promotes standards like minimum wage , age restrictions , pregnancy leave and protective clothing .
it provides vacation and overtime .
wolfram schmuck , spokesman fort the german retail giant rewe group , said fair trade is a way to improve social standards .
" a company like rewe group also has societal responsibilities and with such products we can send a political signal , " he said .

peter klas , a customer , said he tries to buy fair trade flowers .
" i often buy fair trade and right now for flowers i find it somehow very important because the majority come from africa and the people there must work under very bad conditions " klas said . " i hope that with fair trade will ensure that these people are paid regularly and also can work under decent conditions . "
independent inspectors regularly test to make sure fair trade conditions are being met .
importers pay a fair trade premium that is at least 12 percent of the purchase price .
a committee made up of representatives of workers and managers decides together on how the premium money can best be used for the good of the worker .
the quality of fair trade flowers becomes obvious from their popularity .
since starting to carry fair trade flowers in march , rewe has sold two million roses .
other companies have also opted for fair trade flowers .

in germany , fair trade flowers are an increasingly popular way to change that . child labor , skin disease and miscarriage are three things that german consumers most certainly do n't associate with flowers .
but these are part of the daily life at greenhouse operations in equatorial areas .
many flowers , especially roses and carnations , are imported from lands like colombia , kenya and zimbabwe .

it stars alice patten - daughter of chris patten , the uk 's last governor of hong kong - and is about a film-maker who wants to make a movie about indian nationalists who rose up against british rule .
hrithik roshan was awarded the best actor prize for his portrayal of a superhero in krrish , hindi for there 's no one like you .
green carpet collecting the award , he said : " may our children never be afraid to dream the impossible because if someone like me can get this far , nothing is impossible . "

research by bbc wales reveals that over £ 6m of communities first funds was returned over the last two years .
plaid cymru is calling for an urgent review .
the assembly government said some money which is not used or reallocated in any year does remain unspent but said these were normally relatively small amounts .
" reallocating the money is difficult " over the last five years since it was set up the communities first programme has received £ 136m helping deprived areas .
information released to bbc wales ' the politics show under the freedom of information act shows that while cash is getting to the communities , some 13 % of it has not been able to be used .
big bang project co-coordinators said the reason was that many staff members leave their jobs and while trying to replace them , the funding was left unused .
one of the original architects of the communities first programme , professor dave adamson , said he believed a shortage of trained workers and relatively high turnover was to blame .
" the programme was launched in effectively 142 partnerships across wales in one big bang if you like to use that term - and inevitably there were n't the trained and qualified workers on the ground , " he said .
" many people moved into it from kind of related areas in local government and health et cetera and i think quickly realised the jobs were n't for them and left very very soon after , " said prof adamson .
" so the initial high turnover was very much a product of the shortage of trained and skilled development workers .
unfortunately that shortage still prevails . "
wales has some of the most deprived areas in western europe leanne wood , plaid 's social justice spokeswoman , is calling for an urgent review .
a welsh assembly government spokesperson said : " the communities first budget is allocated to all the 142 eligible areas in wales .
" each area receives an offer letter that includes funding towards core staff who facilitate the programme in each area the spokesperson said under spends may result from a wide variety of circumstances such as staff being on sick , maternity and special leave , or normal short term vacancies which occur when staff leave posts before new appointments can be made .
" in such circumstances there can also be slippage in the training budgets allocated to the staff .
the spokesperson added : " the under spends from one year can not be rolled forward to following years but the partnerships in the respective areas are given the opportunity to spend these monies on other eligible activities within the year wherever possible and considerable additional work has been funded in this way since the start of the programme .

research by bbc wales reveals that over £ 6m of communities first funds was returned over the last two years .
plaid cymru is calling for an urgent review .
the assembly government said some money which is not used or reallocated in any year does remain unspent but said these were normally relatively small amounts .
over the last five years since it was set up the communities first programme has received £ 136m helping deprived areas .
information released to bbc wales ' the politics show under the freedom of information act shows that while cash is getting to the communities , some 13 % of it has not been able to be used .
big bang project co-coordinators said the reason was that many staff members leave their jobs and while trying to replace them , the funding was left unused .
one of the original architects of the communities first programme , professor dave adamson , said he believed a shortage of trained workers and relatively high turnover was to blame .
" the programme was launched in effectively 142 partnerships across wales in one big bang if you like to use that term - and inevitably there were n't the trained and qualified workers on the ground , " he said .
" many people moved into it from kind of related areas in local government and health et cetera and i think quickly realised the jobs were n't for them and left very very soon after , " said prof adamson .
" so the initial high turnover was very much a product of the shortage of trained and skilled development workers .
unfortunately that shortage still prevails . "
leanne wood , plaid 's social justice spokeswoman , is calling for an urgent review .
a welsh assembly government spokesperson said : " the communities first budget is allocated to all the 142 eligible areas in wales .
" each area receives an offer letter that includes funding towards core staff who facilitate the programme in each area the spokesperson said under spends may result from a wide variety of circumstances such as staff being on sick , maternity and special leave , or normal short term vacancies which occur when staff leave posts before new appointments can be made .
" in such circumstances there can also be slippage in the training budgets allocated to the staff .
the spokesperson added : " the under spends from one year can not be rolled forward to following years but the partnerships in the respective areas are given the opportunity to spend these monies on other eligible activities within the year wherever possible and considerable additional work has been funded in this way since the start of the programme .

the nfu says the cap , which limits the number of non-eu citizens entering the country , is causing a shortage of fruit-pickers .
farmers are calling for the government to raise the cap from its current limit of just over 16,000 .
the home office says farms should recruit from closer to home .
farmers say they have found it increasingly difficult to recruit seasonal workers since the expansion of the eu in 2004 , which gave membership to countries including poland .
' absolute travesty ' elaine clarke runs a soft fruit farm in tamworth , west midlands , which has been short of staff for the last two years .
she told the bbc : " with the advent of the new countries joining the eu now they can go to any job within the uk and there 's less interest on their part to come picking strawberries . "
she added : " at the end of the day when you spend a lot of time and money and effort preparing and growing crops , if you ca n't get them picked it 's an absolute travesty .
" we lost a lot of fruit last year and look certain to continue in the same vein this year unless we can get some students in . "
under the seasonal agricultural workers scheme -lrb- saws -rrb- farms are allowed to recruit people from outside the eu . "
immigration is a hot political topic and it may be they do n't want to change this policy because it is a political topic " phillip hudson , nfu in 2005 the government cut the numbers allowed to enter under the scheme from 25,000 to 16,250 .
while romania and bulgaria joined the eu at the start of this year work restrictions were imposed .
low skilled seasonal workers from the two countries can only enter under the saws .
the government is to restrict the saws to citizens of the two countries from 2008 .
farmers fear this will further reduce the number of people they can recruit as pickers .
' urgent action needed ' an ongoing problem has been the difficulty of recruiting local people to work in the fields , which is seen has hard , low paid labour .
christine lumb , director of concordia , a company that arranges for foreign seasonal workers to come and work on farms , said unemployed people in the uk were reluctant to take on seasonal work .
she said : " the current benefits system means that if you come off benefits it is very difficult then to go back on again , the work is very seasonal , the weather plays a huge part in whether or not you work on a particular day or not and it is extraordinarily hard work . "
earlier this year the nfu said some 13 uk growers of soft fruit and salad vegetables were facing a shortfall of 2,400 workers on the 4,400 needed this summer .

the nfu says the cap , which limits the number of non-eu citizens entering the country , is causing a shortage of fruit-pickers .
farmers are calling for the government to raise the cap from its current limit of just over 16,000 .
the home office says farms should recruit from closer to home .
farmers say they have found it increasingly difficult to recruit seasonal workers since the expansion of the eu in 2004 , which gave membership to countries including poland .
' absolute travesty ' elaine clarke runs a soft fruit farm in tamworth , west midlands , which has been short of staff for the last two years .
she told the bbc : " with the advent of the new countries joining the eu now they can go to any job within the uk and there 's less interest on their part to come picking strawberries . "
she added : " at the end of the day when you spend a lot of time and money and effort preparing and growing crops , if you ca n't get them picked it 's an absolute travesty .
" we lost a lot of fruit last year and look certain to continue in the same vein this year unless we can get some students in . "
under the seasonal agricultural workers scheme -lrb- saws -rrb- farms are allowed to recruit people from outside the eu .
immigration is a hot political topic and it may be they do n't want to change this policy because it is a political topic phillip hudson , nfu in 2005 the government cut the numbers allowed to enter under the scheme from 25,000 to 16,250 .
while romania and bulgaria joined the eu at the start of this year work restrictions were imposed .
low skilled seasonal workers from the two countries can only enter under the saws .
the government is to restrict the saws to citizens of the two countries from 2008 .
farmers fear this will further reduce the number of people they can recruit as pickers .
' urgent action needed ' an ongoing problem has been the difficulty of recruiting local people to work in the fields , which is seen has hard , low paid labour .
christine lumb , director of concordia , a company that arranges for foreign seasonal workers to come and work on farms , said unemployed people in the uk were reluctant to take on seasonal work .
she said : " the current benefits system means that if you come off benefits it is very difficult then to go back on again , the work is very seasonal , the weather plays a huge part in whether or not you work on a particular day or not and it is extraordinarily hard work . "
earlier this year the nfu said some 13 uk growers of soft fruit and salad vegetables were facing a shortfall of 2,400 workers on the 4,400 needed this summer .

will the corporate giant be forced into a grovelling apology for using manchester cathedral as the setting for the computerised gun game ?
will the church end up with a multi-million pound windfall in compensation ?
or will clergy at the cathedral be forced into an embarrassing climbdown ?
the answer should become clearer after the two sides talk for the first time later this week .
to work out the likely winner of this unusual duel , the competing arguments need to be explored in detail .
' sick ' game the church says to base the sony playstation 3 game resistance : fall of man in a virtual cathedral - identical to manchester cathedral - is grossly insensitive .
it is not just the use of holy ground for the bloodthirsty game which has upset the clergy ; it is the fact that manchester has been so scarred by gun violence in recent years .
in fact , the cathedral has hosted memorial services for some of the victims .
this is why the computer game has been branded " sick " by the church .
sony are insisting they have done nothing wrong , and in a statement said : " we have sought and received all permissions necessary for the creation of the game . "
the church says using the cathedral is " irresponsible " church officials claim no permission was sought from them , never mind granted .
the obvious conclusion , therefore , is that sony did not believe it needed any specific approval to re-create a similar computerised cathedral .
so how did it manage to produce such a close replica ?
one theory is that the company simply accessed the " virtual tour " of manchester cathedral which is freely available to anyone on the internet .
at this stage , sony have yet to explain how the striking similarities between their game and the manchester place of worship came about .
what they have said is that the gun-toting game is not based on reality , and in any case , the targets are alien invaders not humans .
emotive issue within the church of england there is public anger - and private disappointment .
in some quarters , there is a feeling that more people in authority should have rallied to their support by now , rather than leaving them to fight a lone battle against the might of one of the world 's commercial giants .
one church source told me : " if this computer game had been set in a mosque , you can be sure there would have been more of a public outcry .
" somehow the christian church is seen as a ' soft touch ' .
almost as if we 're fair game .
but we are determined to stand our ground on this . "
in the end , this row could end up being settled by lawyers .
however , given that the guns issue is such an emotive one , it may be in the best interests of both sides to find a quick and honourable solution .
indeed , it could be argued that this messy confrontation will result in a " win-win " for both sides .
whatever happens , sony has just gained nationwide publicity for its playstation 3 , at a time when it is trying to boost sales .
as for the church , it has defied the critics who say it is spineless and irrelevant .
at the same time , it has managed to highlight concerns over violent computer imagery .
this episode has not just confirmed the theory that truth is stranger than fiction ; it may also prove that all the best dramas need a happy ending .

sony are insisting they have done nothing wrong , and in a statement said : " we have sought and received all permissions necessary for the creation of the game . "
the church says using the cathedral is " irresponsible " church officials claim no permission was sought from them , never mind granted .
the obvious conclusion , therefore , is that sony did not believe it needed any specific approval to re-create a similar computerised cathedral .
so how did it manage to produce such a close replica ?
one theory is that the company simply accessed the " virtual tour " of manchester cathedral which is freely available to anyone on the internet .
at this stage , sony have yet to explain how the striking similarities between their game and the manchester place of worship came about .
what they have said is that the gun-toting game is not based on reality , and in any case , the targets are alien invaders not humans .
emotive issue within the church of england there is public anger - and private disappointment .
in some quarters , there is a feeling that more people in authority should have rallied to their support by now , rather than leaving them to fight a lone battle against the might of one of the world 's commercial giants .
one church source told me : " if this computer game had been set in a mosque , you can be sure there would have been more of a public outcry .
the game shows a virtual shoot-out inside the cathedral " somehow the christian church is seen as a ' soft touch ' .
almost as if we 're fair game .
but we are determined to stand our ground on this . "
in the end , this row could end up being settled by lawyers .
however , given that the guns issue is such an emotive one , it may be in the best interests of both sides to find a quick and honourable solution .
indeed , it could be argued that this messy confrontation will result in a " win-win " for both sides .
whatever happens , sony has just gained nationwide publicity for its playstation 3 , at a time when it is trying to boost sales .
as for the church , it has defied the critics who say it is spineless and irrelevant .
at the same time , it has managed to highlight concerns over violent computer imagery .
this episode has not just confirmed the theory that truth is stranger than fiction ; it may also prove that all the best dramas need a happy ending .

will the corporate giant be forced into a grovelling apology for using manchester cathedral as the setting for the computerised gun game ?
will the church end up with a multi-million pound windfall in compensation ?
or will clergy at the cathedral be forced into an embarrassing climbdown ?
the answer should become clearer after the two sides talk for the first time later this week .
to work out the likely winner of this unusual duel , the competing arguments need to be explored in detail .
' sick ' game the church says to base the sony playstation 3 game resistance : fall of man in a virtual cathedral - identical to manchester cathedral - is grossly insensitive .
it is not just the use of holy ground for the bloodthirsty game which has upset the clergy ; it is the fact that manchester has been so scarred by gun violence in recent years .
in fact , the cathedral has hosted memorial services for some of the victims .
this is why the computer game has been branded " sick " by the church .
sony are insisting they have done nothing wrong , and in a statement said : " we have sought and received all permissions necessary for the creation of the game . "
the church says using the cathedral is " irresponsible " church officials claim no permission was sought from them , never mind granted .
the obvious conclusion , therefore , is that sony did not believe it needed any specific approval to re-create a similar computerised cathedral .
so how did it manage to produce such a close replica ?
one theory is that the company simply accessed the " virtual tour " of manchester cathedral which is freely available to anyone on the internet .
at this stage , sony have yet to explain how the striking similarities between their game and the manchester place of worship came about .
what they have said is that the gun-toting game is not based on reality , and in any case , the targets are alien invaders not humans .
emotive issue within the church of england there is public anger - and private disappointment .
in some quarters , there is a feeling that more people in authority should have rallied to their support by now , rather than leaving them to fight a lone battle against the might of one of the world 's commercial giants .
one church source told me : " if this computer game had been set in a mosque , you can be sure there would have been more of a public outcry .
the game shows a virtual shoot-out inside the cathedral " somehow the christian church is seen as a ' soft touch ' .
almost as if we 're fair game .
but we are determined to stand our ground on this . "
in the end , this row could end up being settled by lawyers .
however , given that the guns issue is such an emotive one , it may be in the best interests of both sides to find a quick and honourable solution .
indeed , it could be argued that this messy confrontation will result in a " win-win " for both sides .
