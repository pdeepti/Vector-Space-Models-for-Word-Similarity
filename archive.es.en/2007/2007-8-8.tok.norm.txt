program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 08.08.2007 despite booming economy , germans not in celebratory mood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forget the economy , it was last year 's world cup that put germans in a sunnier mood business surveys and consumer confidence levels suggest that the german economic motor has roared back to life and is racing towards a bright future .
but that sunny outlook is n't reflected in the mood of the nation . after such a long stint in the economic doldrums , much has been made of the recent upturn in consumer spending in germany , improving growth rates and falling joblessness -lrb- 3.7 million in july compared to almost 4.4 million at the same time last year -rrb- . so much so in fact , that some are talking of a second " economic miracle . " reports about a better balanced budget and a new-found joie de spending among the notoriously cautious germans abound .
all of a sudden , the headlines are filled with a refreshingly convincing optimism , which seems to both reflect and spread a growing positive mood .
or is it just wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping is becoming fashionable birgit gebhardt , the managing director of the trendbüro agency for social change , said germany is not out of the woods yet . " after years of national depression , all of a sudden the tide has made a massive turn , and the media claims we 're in the throes of a consumer party , " she said .
" in actual fact , we really are n't at that point yet . " gebhardt added that although germany has managed to vastly improve its competitiveness over recent years and although a booming economy can contribute to reshaping the mood of a nation , germany still has a long way to go . what constitutes happiness ? the allensbach institute for public opinion has been conducting surveys about the happiness of germans since 1945 , when , with so many men killed in the war , women were asked whether they thought they could be happy alone . the question of happiness was raised over and again in subsequent polls until the point at which it became a research subject in its own right .
the most recent survey in the institute 's extensive archive was carried out last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxury holidays are n't what matters to most a cross-section of 1,800 germans from all over the country were interviewed face to face to try and establish what constitutes contemporary happiness .
wilhelm haumann , a project leader at the institute , said a blossoming economy is not the key to human joy . " if we look at how income and how the perception of happiness have changed since 1945 , we see a massive increase in income and absolutely zero change in the number of people who say they feel happy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty remains an unhappy reality on the other hand , however , living below the bread line is a fast track to misery , he added . " while there is no definitive correlation between a strong economy and happiness , there is certainly a relationship between a weak economy and unhappiness , " haumann said .
" sixty percent of interviewees who said they were really unhappy , had financial problems . " money is not the answer so if being able to throw money around is not what makes people smile , what does ? " people like to be able to have the feeling that they are in charge of their own lives , that they can be influential and do n't have to bow to external powers , " haumann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluence does n't equal joy in germany he added that germans have been bound up in a very hierarchical society for so long that they do n't have the freedom of personal autonomy .
being able to organize one 's own life and make decisions at work rather than simply being bossed around contributes greatly to creating a strength of personality , which in turn is a pre-requisite for happiness . " it 's no coincidence that those with the greatest sense of initiative are the happiest , " haumann concludes . all that being the case , the way in which the german labor market is developing must be a good thing .
although there is less security than in bygone days , there is far greater flexibility for both employers and staff , which should promote initiative , thus leading to happiness . happiness through flexibility tanja siegmund , a spokeswoman for the international recruitment agency adecco , said she recently witnessed a shift in the approach to finding work . " the german labor market has traditionally been quite conservative , once people had a job they stayed in it even if they were unhapp , " she said , adding that this is changing . " people are becoming more daring , they are giving up their full-time , secure jobs because they are beginning to understand that they have other possibilities , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employment is the answer siegmund said she believes germany has a lot to learn from countries like holland and the united kingdom where there is a far greater tradition of temporary and part-time work . " it used to have a negative connotation attached to it in germany , but people are beginning to see things differently , " she said . and it seems to be changing right across the employment board . jürgen weber , a freelance television director , agreed that there is a new willingness for people to take chances with their jobs . " there seems to be a new feeling that anything is possible , that if you lose one job , you can find another , " he said , adding that people are prepared to work for less money than in the past and that they seem to have more fun with what they are doing . " the industry is much more dynamic now , the mood is simply better , " he said . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 08.08.2007 the strange , but true tale of a communist cowboy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after starring in spaghetti westerns , reed went on to star in eastern westerns a new german documentary , " the red elvis " , tells the extraordinary tale of dean reed from denver , colorado who became a star behind the iron curtain . it 's common knowledge that thousands of people fled communist east germany for the west .
the fact that a few hardy souls traveled in the opposite direction is far less well-known .
the american musician , actor and film director , dean reed was one of them . filmmaker leopold grün , who grew up in east germany , had forgotten about reed until a friend from the west jogged his memory six years ago . " i did n't like his music , so he 'd never really concerned me very much , " grün said .
" it was only when i started looking into his story that i became fascinated because it had so many twists and turns .
i discovered a completely crazy world that i had no idea about . "
the bizarre tale of dean reed has recently reawakened a flurry of interest .
as well as grün 's film - five years in the making and just opening in germany - a biography was published late last year .
us actor tom hanks is currently working on a feature film with steven spielberg about reed 's life with himself in the lead role . new angle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dean reed was an outspoken critic of the us 's war on vietnam leopold grün sees this interest as signs of a need for a change of perspective about the cold war era . " we all know that people fled east germany , " he said .
" but what could someone 's motives have been for going in the opposite direction ? "
called " the red elvis , " grün 's film does not set out to provide a comprehensive or conclusive account of reed 's colorful and chequered life .
the filmmaker is clear : " this is not a biography . "
instead , like a puzzle the documentary pieces together film clips , concert footage and a host of interviews , leaving it to the audience to make up their own mind . not exactly country-western by the time the photogenic reed settled in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , he had already strayed far from his roots .
following a couple of very minor hits in the united states , the singer embarked on a tour of latin america in the early 1960s that was to prove decisive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans have set up a web site dedicated to his memory not only did reed end up at number one on the chilean charts , he witnessed grinding poverty during his travels and forged contacts with the latin american leftist movement , eventually counting salvador allende among his friends .
in " the red elvis , " isabel allende bussi remembers with gratitude reed 's support for her father 's presidential campaign .
" in his performances in chile you can see he is genuine , " grün said .
" the posing began later . "
increasingly critical of us foreign policy , reed moved to latin america .
it was the start of his career as a political activist-cum-entertainer .
he also continued to perform further afield , becoming the first us singer to tour the soviet union where his repertoire of country-western and protest songs together with his screen idol looks took audiences by storm .
in the film , a russian fan , now living in reed 's home town , reverentially recalls how his appearances in russia " were like a holiday for us . "
her memories have a tragic irony .
the singing advocate of socialist policies functioned as a distraction from soviet realities . " we forgot that we were oppressed , " she tells the camera . propaganda coup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his films , the actor cum musician also supported the underdog the us performer 's tours were clearly a coup for soviet authorities .
this did not go unnoticed back home .
in 1972 , in an article dripping with sarcasm , the us magazine newsweek commented : " reed 's success is heavily subsidized by kremlin authorities .
how often do they get an american who looks like apple pie and treads the party line like a trained bear ? " significantly , reed never relinquished his us passport , retaining the right to roam .
one of the most memorable - and disturbing - images in " the red elvis " shows reed in lebanon in the late 1960s , posing with both a gun and a guitar .
in argentina , reed was given his own tv show to host , but was finally deported after his pro-communist stance got too much for the authorities who were wary of upsetting washington .
after building an acting career in spaghetti westerns in italy , he moved to east berlin in 1972 , meeting his second wife-to-be at a film festival in leipzig .
in east germany , reed continued to sing and act , most notably in the blockbuster , east-german western " blutsbrüder " -lrb- blood brothers -rrb- .
here , the showman created a role tailored to his own character - a us soldier who goes over to the other side , joining forces with the underdogs after witnessing a massacre of cheyenne indians . a rising star behind the iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even as a middle aged man , reed continued to play the cowboy at first , the gdr authorities had not been so keen on his staying , according to grün . " they were afraid that he would have an unsettling effect because he was such a showman , but then they realized what a fantastic opportunity he presented , " he said .
" he stood for the right cause and there was no need to manipulate him . " egon krenz , who was later to briefly succeed erich honecker at the top of the east german leadership , has described the relationship between reed and the authorities as a " productive " one , based on " give and take . " but while this closeness to the regime may have secured him a celebrity status that he would never have enjoyed in the united states , it was also to prove his downfall .
his popularity began to ebb , partly because of his failure to take any kind of critical stance in public .
disillusioned cowboy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the popularity of his early years waning , depression set in over the years , reed had also become increasingly disillusioned with the less than heroic nature of everyday life in east germany .
and by the mid 1980s , his third marriage to a leading east german actress was also on the rocks . grün 's film gives little credence to the conspiracy stories that have surrounded his death by drowning , which was reported as a " tragic accident " on east german television .
reed 's long-term mistress and soulmate talks about the suicide pact that they had discussed at their clandestine apartment , still visibly grieving at the fact that he decided to cross this final frontier without her . more than a product of the cold war ?
the 90-minute film creates a subtle , multi-layered image of someone whose public and private personas were riven with contradictions .
while dean reed was , in one sense , very much a product of the cold war , grün said he believes his life story still has relevance today .
" one important goal of mine was to make a film that people could identify with in some way .
the themes that are dealt with are still topical : the palestinian issue , latin america , " he said .
" in addition to that , it deals with human problems that are not specific to east germany . " julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 08.08.2007 despite booming economy , germans not in celebratory mood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forget the economy , it was last year 's world cup that put germans in a sunnier mood business surveys and consumer confidence levels suggest that the german economic motor has roared back to life and is racing towards a bright future .
but that sunny outlook is n't reflected in the mood of the nation . after such a long stint in the economic doldrums , much has been made of the recent upturn in consumer spending in germany , improving growth rates and falling joblessness -lrb- 3.7 million in july compared to almost 4.4 million at the same time last year -rrb- . so much so in fact , that some are talking of a second " economic miracle . " reports about a better balanced budget and a new-found joie de spending among the notoriously cautious germans abound .
all of a sudden , the headlines are filled with a refreshingly convincing optimism , which seems to both reflect and spread a growing positive mood .
or is it just wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping is becoming fashionable birgit gebhardt , the managing director of the trendbüro agency for social change , said germany is not out of the woods yet . " after years of national depression , all of a sudden the tide has made a massive turn , and the media claims we 're in the throes of a consumer party , " she said .
" in actual fact , we really are n't at that point yet . " gebhardt added that although germany has managed to vastly improve its competitiveness over recent years and although a booming economy can contribute to reshaping the mood of a nation , germany still has a long way to go . what constitutes happiness ? the allensbach institute for public opinion has been conducting surveys about the happiness of germans since 1945 , when , with so many men killed in the war , women were asked whether they thought they could be happy alone . the question of happiness was raised over and again in subsequent polls until the point at which it became a research subject in its own right .
the most recent survey in the institute 's extensive archive was carried out last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxury holidays are n't what matters to most a cross-section of 1,800 germans from all over the country were interviewed face to face to try and establish what constitutes contemporary happiness .
wilhelm haumann , a project leader at the institute , said a blossoming economy is not the key to human joy . " if we look at how income and how the perception of happiness have changed since 1945 , we see a massive increase in income and absolutely zero change in the number of people who say they feel happy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty remains an unhappy reality on the other hand , however , living below the bread line is a fast track to misery , he added . " while there is no definitive correlation between a strong economy and happiness , there is certainly a relationship between a weak economy and unhappiness , " haumann said .
" sixty percent of interviewees who said they were really unhappy , had financial problems . " money is not the answer so if being able to throw money around is not what makes people smile , what does ? " people like to be able to have the feeling that they are in charge of their own lives , that they can be influential and do n't have to bow to external powers , " haumann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluence does n't equal joy in germany he added that germans have been bound up in a very hierarchical society for so long that they do n't have the freedom of personal autonomy .
being able to organize one 's own life and make decisions at work rather than simply being bossed around contributes greatly to creating a strength of personality , which in turn is a pre-requisite for happiness . " it 's no coincidence that those with the greatest sense of initiative are the happiest , " haumann concludes . all that being the case , the way in which the german labor market is developing must be a good thing .
although there is less security than in bygone days , there is far greater flexibility for both employers and staff , which should promote initiative , thus leading to happiness . happiness through flexibility tanja siegmund , a spokeswoman for the international recruitment agency adecco , said she recently witnessed a shift in the approach to finding work . " the german labor market has traditionally been quite conservative , once people had a job they stayed in it even if they were unhapp , " she said , adding that this is changing . " people are becoming more daring , they are giving up their full-time , secure jobs because they are beginning to understand that they have other possibilities , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employment is the answer siegmund said she believes germany has a lot to learn from countries like holland and the united kingdom where there is a far greater tradition of temporary and part-time work . " it used to have a negative connotation attached to it in germany , but people are beginning to see things differently , " she said . and it seems to be changing right across the employment board . jürgen weber , a freelance television director , agreed that there is a new willingness for people to take chances with their jobs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 08.08.2007 the strange , but true tale of a communist cowboy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after starring in spaghetti westerns , reed went on to star in eastern westerns a new german documentary , " the red elvis " , tells the extraordinary tale of dean reed from denver , colorado who became a star behind the iron curtain . it 's common knowledge that thousands of people fled communist east germany for the west .
the fact that a few hardy souls traveled in the opposite direction is far less well-known .
the american musician , actor and film director , dean reed was one of them . filmmaker leopold grün , who grew up in east germany , had forgotten about reed until a friend from the west jogged his memory six years ago . " i did n't like his music , so he 'd never really concerned me very much , " grün said .
" it was only when i started looking into his story that i became fascinated because it had so many twists and turns .
i discovered a completely crazy world that i had no idea about . "
the bizarre tale of dean reed has recently reawakened a flurry of interest .
as well as grün 's film - five years in the making and just opening in germany - a biography was published late last year .
us actor tom hanks is currently working on a feature film with steven spielberg about reed 's life with himself in the lead role . new angle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dean reed was an outspoken critic of the us 's war on vietnam leopold grün sees this interest as signs of a need for a change of perspective about the cold war era . " we all know that people fled east germany , " he said .
" but what could someone 's motives have been for going in the opposite direction ? "
called " the red elvis , " grün 's film does not set out to provide a comprehensive or conclusive account of reed 's colorful and chequered life .
the filmmaker is clear : " this is not a biography . "
instead , like a puzzle the documentary pieces together film clips , concert footage and a host of interviews , leaving it to the audience to make up their own mind . not exactly country-western by the time the photogenic reed settled in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , he had already strayed far from his roots .
following a couple of very minor hits in the united states , the singer embarked on a tour of latin america in the early 1960s that was to prove decisive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans have set up a web site dedicated to his memory not only did reed end up at number one on the chilean charts , he witnessed grinding poverty during his travels and forged contacts with the latin american leftist movement , eventually counting salvador allende among his friends .
in " the red elvis , " isabel allende bussi remembers with gratitude reed 's support for her father 's presidential campaign .
" in his performances in chile you can see he is genuine , " grün said .
" the posing began later . "
increasingly critical of us foreign policy , reed moved to latin america .
it was the start of his career as a political activist-cum-entertainer .
he also continued to perform further afield , becoming the first us singer to tour the soviet union where his repertoire of country-western and protest songs together with his screen idol looks took audiences by storm .
in the film , a russian fan , now living in reed 's home town , reverentially recalls how his appearances in russia " were like a holiday for us . "
her memories have a tragic irony .
the singing advocate of socialist policies functioned as a distraction from soviet realities . " we forgot that we were oppressed , " she tells the camera . propaganda coup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his films , the actor cum musician also supported the underdog the us performer 's tours were clearly a coup for soviet authorities .
this did not go unnoticed back home .
in 1972 , in an article dripping with sarcasm , the us magazine newsweek commented : " reed 's success is heavily subsidized by kremlin authorities .
how often do they get an american who looks like apple pie and treads the party line like a trained bear ? " significantly , reed never relinquished his us passport , retaining the right to roam .
one of the most memorable - and disturbing - images in " the red elvis " shows reed in lebanon in the late 1960s , posing with both a gun and a guitar .
in argentina , reed was given his own tv show to host , but was finally deported after his pro-communist stance got too much for the authorities who were wary of upsetting washington .
after building an acting career in spaghetti westerns in italy , he moved to east berlin in 1972 , meeting his second wife-to-be at a film festival in leipzig .
in east germany , reed continued to sing and act , most notably in the blockbuster , east-german western " blutsbrüder " -lrb- blood brothers -rrb- .
here , the showman created a role tailored to his own character - a us soldier who goes over to the other side , joining forces with the underdogs after witnessing a massacre of cheyenne indians . a rising star behind the iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even as a middle aged man , reed continued to play the cowboy at first , the gdr authorities had not been so keen on his staying , according to grün . " they were afraid that he would have an unsettling effect because he was such a showman , but then they realized what a fantastic opportunity he presented , " he said .
" he stood for the right cause and there was no need to manipulate him . " egon krenz , who was later to briefly succeed erich honecker at the top of the east german leadership , has described the relationship between reed and the authorities as a " productive " one , based on " give and take . " but while this closeness to the regime may have secured him a celebrity status that he would never have enjoyed in the united states , it was also to prove his downfall .
his popularity began to ebb , partly because of his failure to take any kind of critical stance in public .
disillusioned cowboy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the popularity of his early years waning , depression set in over the years , reed had also become increasingly disillusioned with the less than heroic nature of everyday life in east germany .
and by the mid 1980s , his third marriage to a leading east german actress was also on the rocks . grün 's film gives little credence to the conspiracy stories that have surrounded his death by drowning , which was reported as a " tragic accident " on east german television .
reed 's long-term mistress and soulmate talks about the suicide pact that they had discussed at their clandestine apartment , still visibly grieving at the fact that he decided to cross this final frontier without her . more than a product of the cold war ?
the 90-minute film creates a subtle , multi-layered image of someone whose public and private personas were riven with contradictions .
while dean reed was , in one sense , very much a product of the cold war , grün said he believes his life story still has relevance today .
" one important goal of mine was to make a film that people could identify with in some way .

the fact that a few hardy souls traveled in the opposite direction is far less well-known .
the american musician , actor and film director , dean reed was one of them . filmmaker leopold grün , who grew up in east germany , had forgotten about reed until a friend from the west jogged his memory six years ago . " i did n't like his music , so he 'd never really concerned me very much , " grün said .
" it was only when i started looking into his story that i became fascinated because it had so many twists and turns .
i discovered a completely crazy world that i had no idea about . "
the bizarre tale of dean reed has recently reawakened a flurry of interest .
as well as grün 's film - five years in the making and just opening in germany - a biography was published late last year .
us actor tom hanks is currently working on a feature film with steven spielberg about reed 's life with himself in the lead role . new angle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dean reed was an outspoken critic of the us 's war on vietnam leopold grün sees this interest as signs of a need for a change of perspective about the cold war era . " we all know that people fled east germany , " he said .
" but what could someone 's motives have been for going in the opposite direction ? "
called " the red elvis , " grün 's film does not set out to provide a comprehensive or conclusive account of reed 's colorful and chequered life .
the filmmaker is clear : " this is not a biography . "
instead , like a puzzle the documentary pieces together film clips , concert footage and a host of interviews , leaving it to the audience to make up their own mind . not exactly country-western by the time the photogenic reed settled in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , he had already strayed far from his roots .
following a couple of very minor hits in the united states , the singer embarked on a tour of latin america in the early 1960s that was to prove decisive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans have set up a web site dedicated to his memory not only did reed end up at number one on the chilean charts , he witnessed grinding poverty during his travels and forged contacts with the latin american leftist movement , eventually counting salvador allende among his friends .
in " the red elvis , " isabel allende bussi remembers with gratitude reed 's support for her father 's presidential campaign .
" in his performances in chile you can see he is genuine , " grün said .
" the posing began later . "
increasingly critical of us foreign policy , reed moved to latin america .
it was the start of his career as a political activist-cum-entertainer .
he also continued to perform further afield , becoming the first us singer to tour the soviet union where his repertoire of country-western and protest songs together with his screen idol looks took audiences by storm .
in the film , a russian fan , now living in reed 's home town , reverentially recalls how his appearances in russia " were like a holiday for us . "
her memories have a tragic irony .
the singing advocate of socialist policies functioned as a distraction from soviet realities . " we forgot that we were oppressed , " she tells the camera . propaganda coup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his films , the actor cum musician also supported the underdog the us performer 's tours were clearly a coup for soviet authorities .
this did not go unnoticed back home .
in 1972 , in an article dripping with sarcasm , the us magazine newsweek commented : " reed 's success is heavily subsidized by kremlin authorities .
how often do they get an american who looks like apple pie and treads the party line like a trained bear ? " significantly , reed never relinquished his us passport , retaining the right to roam .
one of the most memorable - and disturbing - images in " the red elvis " shows reed in lebanon in the late 1960s , posing with both a gun and a guitar .
in argentina , reed was given his own tv show to host , but was finally deported after his pro-communist stance got too much for the authorities who were wary of upsetting washington .
after building an acting career in spaghetti westerns in italy , he moved to east berlin in 1972 , meeting his second wife-to-be at a film festival in leipzig .
in east germany , reed continued to sing and act , most notably in the blockbuster , east-german western " blutsbrüder " -lrb- blood brothers -rrb- .
here , the showman created a role tailored to his own character - a us soldier who goes over to the other side , joining forces with the underdogs after witnessing a massacre of cheyenne indians . a rising star behind the iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even as a middle aged man , reed continued to play the cowboy at first , the gdr authorities had not been so keen on his staying , according to grün . " they were afraid that he would have an unsettling effect because he was such a showman , but then they realized what a fantastic opportunity he presented , " he said .
" he stood for the right cause and there was no need to manipulate him . " egon krenz , who was later to briefly succeed erich honecker at the top of the east german leadership , has described the relationship between reed and the authorities as a " productive " one , based on " give and take . " but while this closeness to the regime may have secured him a celebrity status that he would never have enjoyed in the united states , it was also to prove his downfall .
his popularity began to ebb , partly because of his failure to take any kind of critical stance in public .
disillusioned cowboy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the popularity of his early years waning , depression set in over the years , reed had also become increasingly disillusioned with the less than heroic nature of everyday life in east germany .
and by the mid 1980s , his third marriage to a leading east german actress was also on the rocks . grün 's film gives little credence to the conspiracy stories that have surrounded his death by drowning , which was reported as a " tragic accident " on east german television .
reed 's long-term mistress and soulmate talks about the suicide pact that they had discussed at their clandestine apartment , still visibly grieving at the fact that he decided to cross this final frontier without her . more than a product of the cold war ?
the 90-minute film creates a subtle , multi-layered image of someone whose public and private personas were riven with contradictions .
while dean reed was , in one sense , very much a product of the cold war , grün said he believes his life story still has relevance today .
" one important goal of mine was to make a film that people could identify with in some way .
the themes that are dealt with are still topical : the palestinian issue , latin america , " he said .

the fact that a few hardy souls traveled in the opposite direction is far less well-known .
the american musician , actor and film director , dean reed was one of them . filmmaker leopold grün , who grew up in east germany , had forgotten about reed until a friend from the west jogged his memory six years ago . " i did n't like his music , so he 'd never really concerned me very much , " grün said .
" it was only when i started looking into his story that i became fascinated because it had so many twists and turns .
i discovered a completely crazy world that i had no idea about . "
the bizarre tale of dean reed has recently reawakened a flurry of interest .
as well as grün 's film - five years in the making and just opening in germany - a biography was published late last year .
us actor tom hanks is currently working on a feature film with steven spielberg about reed 's life with himself in the lead role . new angle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dean reed was an outspoken critic of the us 's war on vietnam leopold grün sees this interest as signs of a need for a change of perspective about the cold war era . " we all know that people fled east germany , " he said .
" but what could someone 's motives have been for going in the opposite direction ? "
called " the red elvis , " grün 's film does not set out to provide a comprehensive or conclusive account of reed 's colorful and chequered life .
the filmmaker is clear : " this is not a biography . "
instead , like a puzzle the documentary pieces together film clips , concert footage and a host of interviews , leaving it to the audience to make up their own mind . not exactly country-western by the time the photogenic reed settled in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , he had already strayed far from his roots .
following a couple of very minor hits in the united states , the singer embarked on a tour of latin america in the early 1960s that was to prove decisive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans have set up a web site dedicated to his memory not only did reed end up at number one on the chilean charts , he witnessed grinding poverty during his travels and forged contacts with the latin american leftist movement , eventually counting salvador allende among his friends .
in " the red elvis , " isabel allende bussi remembers with gratitude reed 's support for her father 's presidential campaign .
" in his performances in chile you can see he is genuine , " grün said .
" the posing began later . "
increasingly critical of us foreign policy , reed moved to latin america .
it was the start of his career as a political activist-cum-entertainer .
he also continued to perform further afield , becoming the first us singer to tour the soviet union where his repertoire of country-western and protest songs together with his screen idol looks took audiences by storm .
in the film , a russian fan , now living in reed 's home town , reverentially recalls how his appearances in russia " were like a holiday for us . "
her memories have a tragic irony .
the singing advocate of socialist policies functioned as a distraction from soviet realities . " we forgot that we were oppressed , " she tells the camera . propaganda coup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his films , the actor cum musician also supported the underdog the us performer 's tours were clearly a coup for soviet authorities .
this did not go unnoticed back home .
in 1972 , in an article dripping with sarcasm , the us magazine newsweek commented : " reed 's success is heavily subsidized by kremlin authorities .
how often do they get an american who looks like apple pie and treads the party line like a trained bear ? " significantly , reed never relinquished his us passport , retaining the right to roam .
one of the most memorable - and disturbing - images in " the red elvis " shows reed in lebanon in the late 1960s , posing with both a gun and a guitar .
in argentina , reed was given his own tv show to host , but was finally deported after his pro-communist stance got too much for the authorities who were wary of upsetting washington .
after building an acting career in spaghetti westerns in italy , he moved to east berlin in 1972 , meeting his second wife-to-be at a film festival in leipzig .
in east germany , reed continued to sing and act , most notably in the blockbuster , east-german western " blutsbrüder " -lrb- blood brothers -rrb- .
here , the showman created a role tailored to his own character - a us soldier who goes over to the other side , joining forces with the underdogs after witnessing a massacre of cheyenne indians . a rising star behind the iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even as a middle aged man , reed continued to play the cowboy at first , the gdr authorities had not been so keen on his staying , according to grün . " they were afraid that he would have an unsettling effect because he was such a showman , but then they realized what a fantastic opportunity he presented , " he said .
" he stood for the right cause and there was no need to manipulate him . " egon krenz , who was later to briefly succeed erich honecker at the top of the east german leadership , has described the relationship between reed and the authorities as a " productive " one , based on " give and take . " but while this closeness to the regime may have secured him a celebrity status that he would never have enjoyed in the united states , it was also to prove his downfall .
his popularity began to ebb , partly because of his failure to take any kind of critical stance in public .
disillusioned cowboy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the popularity of his early years waning , depression set in over the years , reed had also become increasingly disillusioned with the less than heroic nature of everyday life in east germany .
and by the mid 1980s , his third marriage to a leading east german actress was also on the rocks . grün 's film gives little credence to the conspiracy stories that have surrounded his death by drowning , which was reported as a " tragic accident " on east german television .
reed 's long-term mistress and soulmate talks about the suicide pact that they had discussed at their clandestine apartment , still visibly grieving at the fact that he decided to cross this final frontier without her . more than a product of the cold war ?
the 90-minute film creates a subtle , multi-layered image of someone whose public and private personas were riven with contradictions .
while dean reed was , in one sense , very much a product of the cold war , grün said he believes his life story still has relevance today .
" one important goal of mine was to make a film that people could identify with in some way .
the themes that are dealt with are still topical : the palestinian issue , latin america , " he said .
" in addition to that , it deals with human problems that are not specific to east germany . " julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" reports about a better balanced budget and a new-found joie de spending among the notoriously cautious germans abound .
all of a sudden , the headlines are filled with a refreshingly convincing optimism , which seems to both reflect and spread a growing positive mood .
or is it just wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping is becoming fashionable birgit gebhardt , the managing director of the trendbüro agency for social change , said germany is not out of the woods yet . " after years of national depression , all of a sudden the tide has made a massive turn , and the media claims we 're in the throes of a consumer party , " she said .
" in actual fact , we really are n't at that point yet . " gebhardt added that although germany has managed to vastly improve its competitiveness over recent years and although a booming economy can contribute to reshaping the mood of a nation , germany still has a long way to go . what constitutes happiness ? the allensbach institute for public opinion has been conducting surveys about the happiness of germans since 1945 , when , with so many men killed in the war , women were asked whether they thought they could be happy alone . the question of happiness was raised over and again in subsequent polls until the point at which it became a research subject in its own right .
the most recent survey in the institute 's extensive archive was carried out last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxury holidays are n't what matters to most a cross-section of 1,800 germans from all over the country were interviewed face to face to try and establish what constitutes contemporary happiness .
wilhelm haumann , a project leader at the institute , said a blossoming economy is not the key to human joy . " if we look at how income and how the perception of happiness have changed since 1945 , we see a massive increase in income and absolutely zero change in the number of people who say they feel happy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty remains an unhappy reality on the other hand , however , living below the bread line is a fast track to misery , he added . " while there is no definitive correlation between a strong economy and happiness , there is certainly a relationship between a weak economy and unhappiness , " haumann said .
" sixty percent of interviewees who said they were really unhappy , had financial problems . " money is not the answer so if being able to throw money around is not what makes people smile , what does ? " people like to be able to have the feeling that they are in charge of their own lives , that they can be influential and do n't have to bow to external powers , " haumann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluence does n't equal joy in germany he added that germans have been bound up in a very hierarchical society for so long that they do n't have the freedom of personal autonomy .
being able to organize one 's own life and make decisions at work rather than simply being bossed around contributes greatly to creating a strength of personality , which in turn is a pre-requisite for happiness .

" at the start of the decade , according to us state department polling , 78 percent of germans had a favorable view of the us , " wike said .
" today , according to the latest pew global attitudes survey , only 30 percent have a favorable view , the lowest percentage of any european country included in the survey . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daily life in iraq : oil and explosions other surveys that confirm those findings stress that the current poor image of the us is largely linked to its invasion of iraq in 2003 - a decision which sparked vocal opposition in countries such as germany and france . german weekly magazine stern published a poll this spring , conducted by the forsa institute , which said that 48 percent of germans believe that the united states is " more dangerous for world peace than iran . " manfred güllner , head of the forsa institute , told the online portal stern.de that " since the beginning of the war in iraq , the image of the us as a power that has no qualms about military interventions and which sees itself as the world police has grown . " latent anti-americanism while güllner believes the negative image of the us in germany is linked to the iraq war , others suggest that a " latent " anti-american tendency has always existed in the country . wolfgang tönnesmann , a political scientist at the kaiserslautern-based atlantic academy which aims to foster trans-atlantic dialogue , said that anti-americanism has existed on both sides of the political spectrum in germany . " some people who disliked the us all along now feel vindicated -lsb- because of the war in iraq -rsb- , " tönnesmann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british soldier , and ally , of the us in iraq " germans do n't need american protection anymore -lrb- or so they believe -rrb- , " said alexander höse , a foreign policy expert at the university of cologne .
" america is now just seen as the 300-pound gorilla throwing its weight around ; nobody likes that . "
höse added that differing views among americans and germans on economic and social policies contributed to the problem . blatant anti-americanism others , however , say anti-americanism runs much deeper . andrei markovits , a professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , said not latent , but blatant anti-americanism is prevalent in both europe and germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel -lrb- l -rrb- has eased relations with us president bush " it is a conflicting emotion that is hard to define , a deep-seated resentment on the part of germans and europeans toward america , " said markovits , who has covered the topic extensively in his book " uncouth nation : why europe dislikes america . " he says that anti-americanism is nearly a sport among german intellectuals - an act of rebellion and subversion which flourishes among the educated elite . " europeans do n't like the us because it 's big , brash , uncouth , vulgar , yet quick , " he said .
" then , when it becomes powerful and intervenes in europe like it did throughout the 20th century , which was to many europeans ' benefit , they do n't like it . " markovits also claimed that anti-americanism goes back hundreds of years .
he said that all the constituents for anti-americanism were there " at the latest by july 5 , 1776 . " his explanation : " america represents modernity from the 19th century onward , and anyone who fears modernity associates that fear with america .

" students in particular get a lot of questions about what their government is doing , and they have to justify themselves , and occasionally germans show their disrespect or dislike . " americans in germany must not just attempt to justify iraq , but must also address questions about everything from the american penchant for guns , the questionable nature of the death penalty to the lax approach of the nation toward climate protection . to counter the one-sided image , the german-american institute at the university of tübingen has initiated a program called " rent an american , " which arranges for american exchange students to visit local german schools to talk about their view of the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a changing climate in trans-atlantic ties ?
america 's poor image not here to stay experts , however , are optimistic that current perceptions of us policies in europe will not cloud the overriding positive image of america in european minds . in the end , said tönnesmann , " europeans and americans are not that different ; ultimately , they have to rely on what their government tells them . " we can only hope that most people can realize what america really stands for : that is , multilateralism , liberalism , openness , and compassion . " wike of the pew center agreed .

five years ago , former chancellor gerhard schöder said " no " to germany 's participation in the war in iraq .
some say schröder merely exploited a public mood , but many agree that anti-americanism has grown . recent studies show that the us-led war in iraq has contributed to a growing negative view of america in germany .
dw-world.de spoke with wolfgang tönnesmann , a political scientist at the atlantic academy - based in kaisterslautern - which aims to foster trans-atlantic ties . dw-world.de : how strong do you think anti-americanism is in germany ? wolfgang tönnesmann : i think it 's there , but it 's hard to separate from the legitimate criticism of the current us administration .
there has always been anti-americanism in germany on both the left and in particular the right , and some people who have disliked the us all along now feel vindicated .
that 's why it 's difficult to say just how strong anti-americanism is right now .
however , when 48 percent of germans think that the us is a greater threat to world peace than iran , that 's cause for concern . how has anti-americanism changed over the years , particularly since former chancellor gerhard schröder said " no " to the war in iraq five years ago ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder said " no " all those years ago gerhard schröder has left office , but the war still goes on with no end in sight .
and as it has turned out , the iraq war was based on false information and manipulation of the public .
even the staunchest supporters of the us have a hard time to explain what happened .
the system of checks and balances , the core of the american constitution that almost every child in germany knows about , has not worked .
that has put germans who like the us very much on the defensive . do you think schröder 's decision against german participation in iraq exacerbated anti-american tendencies already prevalent ? what was the decision really about ? - not to send german soldiers to iraq .
with the benefit of hindsight , we can now say that that was a responsible decision taken in the national interest .
the emotions surrounding it were understandable since it was the first time that the germans said " no . "
again , people with anti-american attitudes felt justified .
others with less well-formed attitudes were drawn to that position .
life at the stammtisch -lsb- the pub table -rsb- became a lot easier when you voiced critical opinions on the us . what do you think about schröder 's decision ? interestingly enough , no one disputes that the decision was right .
but the way it was presented to the public during an election campaign was unfortunate .
that 's why schröder is not given credit for it .
still , i do n't think a german chancellor would say no to a war that our most important ally , the us , wants to conduct simply to further his re-election prospects .
the real failure was that the europeans did not stand together .
that might have prevented the war . was there an inherently anti-american component in it , in other words , did it have a " trickle-down " effect in the german public ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say german chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and bush make a better couple no , the decision not to participate in the iraq war was not inherently anti-american .
after 9/11 , many germans felt sympathy towards the americans .
supporting the americans in afghanistan , as schröder did , was criticized , but people have grasped that germany has to play its role , sometimes including the bundeswehr .
but we do n't think that the problem of terrorism can be solved mainly by killing the terrorists .
we also have to pursue other strategies . how have americans themselves , not just us president george w. bush , contributed to anti-americanism in germany ?
how have they not ? the americans themselves are no better off than many europeans .
they have to rely on what their government tells them .
however , the us now seems to be a polarized country .
when 14 percent of americans believe - as polls at last year 's election showed - that george bush was chosen by god to lead the us in a global war on terrorism , then we might start feeling quite desperate about some americans at the very least .
it 's important that the media play their proper role on both sides of the atlantic presenting the facts and furthering the understanding . in the end , i am confident that the world knows what america stands for : liberalism , openness and compassion . louisa schaefer interviewed wolfgang tönnesmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

five years ago , former chancellor gerhard schöder said " no " to germany 's participation in the war in iraq .
some say schröder merely exploited a public mood , but many agree that anti-americanism has grown . recent studies show that the us-led war in iraq has contributed to a growing negative view of america in germany .
dw-world.de spoke with wolfgang tönnesmann , a political scientist at the atlantic academy - based in kaisterslautern - which aims to foster trans-atlantic ties . dw-world.de : how strong do you think anti-americanism is in germany ? wolfgang tönnesmann : i think it 's there , but it 's hard to separate from the legitimate criticism of the current us administration .
there has always been anti-americanism in germany on both the left and in particular the right , and some people who have disliked the us all along now feel vindicated .
that 's why it 's difficult to say just how strong anti-americanism is right now .
however , when 48 percent of germans think that the us is a greater threat to world peace than iran , that 's cause for concern . how has anti-americanism changed over the years , particularly since former chancellor gerhard schröder said " no " to the war in iraq five years ago ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder said " no " all those years ago gerhard schröder has left office , but the war still goes on with no end in sight .
and as it has turned out , the iraq war was based on false information and manipulation of the public .
even the staunchest supporters of the us have a hard time to explain what happened .
the system of checks and balances , the core of the american constitution that almost every child in germany knows about , has not worked .
that has put germans who like the us very much on the defensive . do you think schröder 's decision against german participation in iraq exacerbated anti-american tendencies already prevalent ? what was the decision really about ? - not to send german soldiers to iraq .
with the benefit of hindsight , we can now say that that was a responsible decision taken in the national interest .
the emotions surrounding it were understandable since it was the first time that the germans said " no . "
again , people with anti-american attitudes felt justified .
others with less well-formed attitudes were drawn to that position .
life at the stammtisch -lsb- the pub table -rsb- became a lot easier when you voiced critical opinions on the us . what do you think about schröder 's decision ? interestingly enough , no one disputes that the decision was right .
but the way it was presented to the public during an election campaign was unfortunate .
that 's why schröder is not given credit for it .
still , i do n't think a german chancellor would say no to a war that our most important ally , the us , wants to conduct simply to further his re-election prospects .
the real failure was that the europeans did not stand together .
that might have prevented the war . was there an inherently anti-american component in it , in other words , did it have a " trickle-down " effect in the german public ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say german chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and bush make a better couple no , the decision not to participate in the iraq war was not inherently anti-american .
after 9/11 , many germans felt sympathy towards the americans .
supporting the americans in afghanistan , as schröder did , was criticized , but people have grasped that germany has to play its role , sometimes including the bundeswehr .
but we do n't think that the problem of terrorism can be solved mainly by killing the terrorists .
we also have to pursue other strategies . how have americans themselves , not just us president george w. bush , contributed to anti-americanism in germany ?
how have they not ? the americans themselves are no better off than many europeans .
they have to rely on what their government tells them .
however , the us now seems to be a polarized country .
when 14 percent of americans believe - as polls at last year 's election showed - that george bush was chosen by god to lead the us in a global war on terrorism , then we might start feeling quite desperate about some americans at the very least .
it 's important that the media play their proper role on both sides of the atlantic presenting the facts and furthering the understanding . in the end , i am confident that the world knows what america stands for : liberalism , openness and compassion . louisa schaefer interviewed wolfgang tönnesmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , when 48 percent of germans think that the us is a greater threat to world peace than iran , that 's cause for concern . how has anti-americanism changed over the years , particularly since former chancellor gerhard schröder said " no " to the war in iraq five years ago ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder said " no " all those years ago gerhard schröder has left office , but the war still goes on with no end in sight .
and as it has turned out , the iraq war was based on false information and manipulation of the public .
even the staunchest supporters of the us have a hard time to explain what happened .
the system of checks and balances , the core of the american constitution that almost every child in germany knows about , has not worked .
that has put germans who like the us very much on the defensive . do you think schröder 's decision against german participation in iraq exacerbated anti-american tendencies already prevalent ? what was the decision really about ? - not to send german soldiers to iraq .
with the benefit of hindsight , we can now say that that was a responsible decision taken in the national interest .
the emotions surrounding it were understandable since it was the first time that the germans said " no . "
again , people with anti-american attitudes felt justified .
others with less well-formed attitudes were drawn to that position .
life at the stammtisch -lsb- the pub table -rsb- became a lot easier when you voiced critical opinions on the us . what do you think about schröder 's decision ? interestingly enough , no one disputes that the decision was right .
but the way it was presented to the public during an election campaign was unfortunate .
that 's why schröder is not given credit for it .
still , i do n't think a german chancellor would say no to a war that our most important ally , the us , wants to conduct simply to further his re-election prospects .
the real failure was that the europeans did not stand together .
that might have prevented the war . was there an inherently anti-american component in it , in other words , did it have a " trickle-down " effect in the german public ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say german chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and bush make a better couple no , the decision not to participate in the iraq war was not inherently anti-american .
after 9/11 , many germans felt sympathy towards the americans .
supporting the americans in afghanistan , as schröder did , was criticized , but people have grasped that germany has to play its role , sometimes including the bundeswehr .
but we do n't think that the problem of terrorism can be solved mainly by killing the terrorists .
we also have to pursue other strategies . how have americans themselves , not just us president george w. bush , contributed to anti-americanism in germany ?
how have they not ? the americans themselves are no better off than many europeans .
they have to rely on what their government tells them .
however , the us now seems to be a polarized country .
when 14 percent of americans believe - as polls at last year 's election showed - that george bush was chosen by god to lead the us in a global war on terrorism , then we might start feeling quite desperate about some americans at the very least .
it 's important that the media play their proper role on both sides of the atlantic presenting the facts and furthering the understanding . in the end , i am confident that the world knows what america stands for : liberalism , openness and compassion . louisa schaefer interviewed wolfgang tönnesmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the papers agreed that china needed to do more to ensure human rights . china kicked off its one-year countdown celebrations to the 2008 olympic games on wednesday .
this prompted commentary from german papers on the human rights situation in china .
just on tuesday , chinese police detained six foreign nationals for demonstrating for a free tibet on the great wall . munich 's süddeutsche zeitung wrote that the olympics were a significant bench mark in china 's rapid advancement .
but the government in beijing had underestimated the political burden associated with the games . " beijing 2008 is a sporting , as well as a political event , " the paper wrote .
" it was the chinese government itself which gave the games their political character through an excess of national ambition during the application phase and the promise to heed human rights more strongly . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reporters without borders have protested against china 's lack of media freedom china wanted to act and be respected as a world power - but without the associated political and moral responsibility .
" someone who travels to zimbabwe with a checkbook and supports the dictator there , someone who accepts the genocide in sudan for the sake of much-loved oil , someone who operates internment camps at home , censures and randomly arrests can not expect undivided affection and can also not refer to the olympic peace , " the daily commented . the 2008 olympic games could be a turning point for china 's image abroad , as their success would n't only be decided in the stadiums and cash boxes , wrote handelsblatt .
" whether the people 's republic manages to develop a modern image is dependent on how it deals with its critics , " the düsseldorf business daily said .
but the results were still bleak , it added .
aids activists were being harassed , foreign press restricted and dissidents banned to labor camps . " the government in beijing is fatally wrong if it believes that it can relay the image of a clean china by muzzling disagreeable journalists , forced resettlers and dissidents , " it commented .
" as long as china rejects universal human rights standards , this dream will remain unfulfilled . " the daily frankfurter rundschau agreed that the world will call china to account for its actions .
" the olympics are more than just perfect organization and grandiose buildings , " it said .
" if china wants to win the world 's respect , the communist party leaders have to wage more freedom .
this is the only way the olympic games will be a success . " according to business daily financial times deutschland , the games should be seen as an opportunity for the west to influence china .
" the ultimate goal of this major event for china is organizing the perfect show and delivering the image of a modern , open-minded country , " the hamburg-based paper wrote . foreign countries should take advantage of this historical opportunity to influence china , but should n't overexcite this leverage , it said .
" a rapprochement between the far east and the west is always more valuable than a china , which is offended and seals itself off after the games . " yet western democracies should n't allow themselves to be degraded to extras in the game of chinese self-promotion , the badische neueste nachrichten warned .
at the same time , the west should n't destroy the unifying idea of sport by being " merciless spoilsports . " " it may be a tightrope walk , " the karlsruhe daily wrote .

just on tuesday , chinese police detained six foreign nationals for demonstrating for a free tibet on the great wall . munich 's süddeutsche zeitung wrote that the olympics were a significant bench mark in china 's rapid advancement .
but the government in beijing had underestimated the political burden associated with the games . " beijing 2008 is a sporting , as well as a political event , " the paper wrote .

they say access to the information should be strictly limited . the german cabinet on wednesday approved a bill to extensively change the country 's tax system .
however , plans to establish a central electronic databank of taxpayer information , which is part of the bill , have sparked a debate about privacy guidelines . the federal finance ministry said the electronic databank will lead to less tax fraud and less bureaucracy .
the databank will contain all relevant information necessary for calculating income tax .
this includes data on spouses , children , religion , as well as tax brackets and exemptions . germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar said he did not categorically oppose the electronic databank .
schaar 's spokesman , dietmar müller , said separately that the extent of the information collected was cause for concern , as it could invite abuse . " in view of the amount of sensitive data and the possible desire to retrieve it , we see a number of data protection provisions which are still open , " müller said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will citizens ' incomes become more transparent ?
müller pointed out that law enforcement agencies could be particularly interested in certain data .
this had been the case , for example , with data from electronic highway tolls , which is now being used to fight terrorism . information on religious belief was particularly sensitive , müller said .
the commissioner would therefore seek to press for this information to remain protected .

church taxes are withdrawn by people 's employers and passed on to the authorities . employer insight opposition politician hermann otto solms of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said he had fundamental reservations about the databank .
he warned of the " total transparency " it enabled . " a huge , self-contained data pool emerges which is n't necessary for the sole purpose of income tax , " said solms , the fiscal spokesman for the free-market-liberal fdp .
he said opening the file not only to tax authorities , but also to employers was a particularly precarious situation . " it is n't for nothing that in germany there 's fiscal secrecy , which stipulates that only fiscal authorities have the right to access tax data , " solms told the daily hessische / niedersächsische allgemeine on wednesday .
" a huge databank is being created about the working life of each citizen , which is n't protected from outside access . " citizens need privacy assurances the government will also introduce a central taxpayer identification number , with lifelong validity .

they say access to the information should be strictly limited . the german cabinet on wednesday approved a bill to extensively change the country 's tax system .
however , plans to establish a central electronic databank of taxpayer information , which is part of the bill , have sparked a debate about privacy guidelines . the federal finance ministry said the electronic databank will lead to less tax fraud and less bureaucracy .
the databank will contain all relevant information necessary for calculating income tax .
this includes data on spouses , children , religion , as well as tax brackets and exemptions . germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar said he did not categorically oppose the electronic databank .
schaar 's spokesman , dietmar müller , said separately that the extent of the information collected was cause for concern , as it could invite abuse . " in view of the amount of sensitive data and the possible desire to retrieve it , we see a number of data protection provisions which are still open , " müller said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will citizens ' incomes become more transparent ?
müller pointed out that law enforcement agencies could be particularly interested in certain data .
this had been the case , for example , with data from electronic highway tolls , which is now being used to fight terrorism . information on religious belief was particularly sensitive , müller said .
the commissioner would therefore seek to press for this information to remain protected .
germany does not have a formal separation of church and state .
church taxes are withdrawn by people 's employers and passed on to the authorities . employer insight opposition politician hermann otto solms of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said he had fundamental reservations about the databank .
he warned of the " total transparency " it enabled . " a huge , self-contained data pool emerges which is n't necessary for the sole purpose of income tax , " said solms , the fiscal spokesman for the free-market-liberal fdp .
he said opening the file not only to tax authorities , but also to employers was a particularly precarious situation . " it is n't for nothing that in germany there 's fiscal secrecy , which stipulates that only fiscal authorities have the right to access tax data , " solms told the daily hessische / niedersächsische allgemeine on wednesday .
" a huge databank is being created about the working life of each citizen , which is n't protected from outside access . " citizens need privacy assurances the government will also introduce a central taxpayer identification number , with lifelong validity .
at present , the numbers change according to a person 's residence .
this had made it easier for people to evade taxes by moving around . the fiscal spokeswoman from the opposition green party , christine scheel , said the central databank was necessary in order for the new identification numbers to work . " but citizens must have the confidence that their data will not be drawn on further , " scheel said .
the greens therefore were demanding strict specification of how and by whom the data could be used , she said . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on wednesday , the german government approved phasing out coal mining by 2018 .

subsidies to phase out the mining over the next decade will cost 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion . -rrb- a 200-year tradition will come to an end in europe 's largest economy .
on wednesday , the german government approved phasing out coal mining by 2018 .
germany 's eight coal mines employ approximately 33,000 people .
the phase-out is planned to start in 2009 , with miners receiving government compensation .

an industry without a future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic coal mining is n't profitable coal mining " has no future " glos said .
for decades , the industry has been heavily subsidized to the tune of more than 160 billion euros , he said .
inexpensive coal from abroad undercuts the expenses associated with heavily-subsidized domestic mining , he said .
seven of the mines are in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia .
one is in saarland , which borders france .
the phase-out will cost the federal and state governments 21.6 billion euros .
the rest of the money will come from a partial privatization of the industry as well as from the energy company rag .
essen-based rag is a group of companies which has chemical , energy and real estate holdings .
the company plans to enter the stock exchange in the spring of 2008 .

the rules contain a clause that allows the phase-out to be reversed if germany is ever faced with power shortages or extremely high prices for other forms of energy .

this prompted commentary from german papers on the human rights situation in china .
just on tuesday , chinese police detained six foreign nationals for demonstrating for a free tibet on the great wall . munich 's süddeutsche zeitung wrote that the olympics were a significant bench mark in china 's rapid advancement .
but the government in beijing had underestimated the political burden associated with the games . " beijing 2008 is a sporting , as well as a political event , " the paper wrote .

the papers agreed that china needed to do more to ensure human rights . china kicked off its one-year countdown celebrations to the 2008 olympic games on wednesday .
this prompted commentary from german papers on the human rights situation in china .
just on tuesday , chinese police detained six foreign nationals for demonstrating for a free tibet on the great wall . munich 's süddeutsche zeitung wrote that the olympics were a significant bench mark in china 's rapid advancement .
but the government in beijing had underestimated the political burden associated with the games . " beijing 2008 is a sporting , as well as a political event , " the paper wrote .
" it was the chinese government itself which gave the games their political character through an excess of national ambition during the application phase and the promise to heed human rights more strongly . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reporters without borders have protested against china 's lack of media freedom china wanted to act and be respected as a world power - but without the associated political and moral responsibility .
" someone who travels to zimbabwe with a checkbook and supports the dictator there , someone who accepts the genocide in sudan for the sake of much-loved oil , someone who operates internment camps at home , censures and randomly arrests can not expect undivided affection and can also not refer to the olympic peace , " the daily commented . the 2008 olympic games could be a turning point for china 's image abroad , as their success would n't only be decided in the stadiums and cash boxes , wrote handelsblatt .
" whether the people 's republic manages to develop a modern image is dependent on how it deals with its critics , " the düsseldorf business daily said .
but the results were still bleak , it added .
aids activists were being harassed , foreign press restricted and dissidents banned to labor camps . " the government in beijing is fatally wrong if it believes that it can relay the image of a clean china by muzzling disagreeable journalists , forced resettlers and dissidents , " it commented .
" as long as china rejects universal human rights standards , this dream will remain unfulfilled . " the daily frankfurter rundschau agreed that the world will call china to account for its actions .
" the olympics are more than just perfect organization and grandiose buildings , " it said .
" if china wants to win the world 's respect , the communist party leaders have to wage more freedom .
this is the only way the olympic games will be a success . " according to business daily financial times deutschland , the games should be seen as an opportunity for the west to influence china .
" the ultimate goal of this major event for china is organizing the perfect show and delivering the image of a modern , open-minded country , " the hamburg-based paper wrote . foreign countries should take advantage of this historical opportunity to influence china , but should n't overexcite this leverage , it said .
" a rapprochement between the far east and the west is always more valuable than a china , which is offended and seals itself off after the games . " yet western democracies should n't allow themselves to be degraded to extras in the game of chinese self-promotion , the badische neueste nachrichten warned .
at the same time , the west should n't destroy the unifying idea of sport by being " merciless spoilsports . " " it may be a tightrope walk , " the karlsruhe daily wrote .

five years ago , former chancellor gerhard schöder said " no " to germany 's participation in the war in iraq .
some say schröder merely exploited a public mood , but many agree that anti-americanism has grown . recent studies show that the us-led war in iraq has contributed to a growing negative view of america in germany .
dw-world.de spoke with wolfgang tönnesmann , a political scientist at the atlantic academy - based in kaisterslautern - which aims to foster trans-atlantic ties . dw-world.de : how strong do you think anti-americanism is in germany ? wolfgang tönnesmann : i think it 's there , but it 's hard to separate from the legitimate criticism of the current us administration .
there has always been anti-americanism in germany on both the left and in particular the right , and some people who have disliked the us all along now feel vindicated .
that 's why it 's difficult to say just how strong anti-americanism is right now .
however , when 48 percent of germans think that the us is a greater threat to world peace than iran , that 's cause for concern . how has anti-americanism changed over the years , particularly since former chancellor gerhard schröder said " no " to the war in iraq five years ago ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder said " no " all those years ago gerhard schröder has left office , but the war still goes on with no end in sight .
and as it has turned out , the iraq war was based on false information and manipulation of the public .
even the staunchest supporters of the us have a hard time to explain what happened .
the system of checks and balances , the core of the american constitution that almost every child in germany knows about , has not worked .
that has put germans who like the us very much on the defensive . do you think schröder 's decision against german participation in iraq exacerbated anti-american tendencies already prevalent ? what was the decision really about ? - not to send german soldiers to iraq .
with the benefit of hindsight , we can now say that that was a responsible decision taken in the national interest .
the emotions surrounding it were understandable since it was the first time that the germans said " no . "
again , people with anti-american attitudes felt justified .
others with less well-formed attitudes were drawn to that position .
life at the stammtisch -lsb- the pub table -rsb- became a lot easier when you voiced critical opinions on the us . what do you think about schröder 's decision ? interestingly enough , no one disputes that the decision was right .
but the way it was presented to the public during an election campaign was unfortunate .
that 's why schröder is not given credit for it .
still , i do n't think a german chancellor would say no to a war that our most important ally , the us , wants to conduct simply to further his re-election prospects .
the real failure was that the europeans did not stand together .
that might have prevented the war . was there an inherently anti-american component in it , in other words , did it have a " trickle-down " effect in the german public ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say german chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and bush make a better couple no , the decision not to participate in the iraq war was not inherently anti-american .
after 9/11 , many germans felt sympathy towards the americans .
supporting the americans in afghanistan , as schröder did , was criticized , but people have grasped that germany has to play its role , sometimes including the bundeswehr .
but we do n't think that the problem of terrorism can be solved mainly by killing the terrorists .
we also have to pursue other strategies . how have americans themselves , not just us president george w. bush , contributed to anti-americanism in germany ?
how have they not ? the americans themselves are no better off than many europeans .
they have to rely on what their government tells them .
however , the us now seems to be a polarized country .
when 14 percent of americans believe - as polls at last year 's election showed - that george bush was chosen by god to lead the us in a global war on terrorism , then we might start feeling quite desperate about some americans at the very least .
it 's important that the media play their proper role on both sides of the atlantic presenting the facts and furthering the understanding . in the end , i am confident that the world knows what america stands for : liberalism , openness and compassion . louisa schaefer interviewed wolfgang tönnesmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

five years ago , former chancellor gerhard schöder said " no " to germany 's participation in the war in iraq .
some say schröder merely exploited a public mood , but many agree that anti-americanism has grown . recent studies show that the us-led war in iraq has contributed to a growing negative view of america in germany .
dw-world.de spoke with wolfgang tönnesmann , a political scientist at the atlantic academy - based in kaisterslautern - which aims to foster trans-atlantic ties . dw-world.de : how strong do you think anti-americanism is in germany ? wolfgang tönnesmann : i think it 's there , but it 's hard to separate from the legitimate criticism of the current us administration .
there has always been anti-americanism in germany on both the left and in particular the right , and some people who have disliked the us all along now feel vindicated .
that 's why it 's difficult to say just how strong anti-americanism is right now .
however , when 48 percent of germans think that the us is a greater threat to world peace than iran , that 's cause for concern . how has anti-americanism changed over the years , particularly since former chancellor gerhard schröder said " no " to the war in iraq five years ago ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder said " no " all those years ago gerhard schröder has left office , but the war still goes on with no end in sight .
and as it has turned out , the iraq war was based on false information and manipulation of the public .
even the staunchest supporters of the us have a hard time to explain what happened .
the system of checks and balances , the core of the american constitution that almost every child in germany knows about , has not worked .
that has put germans who like the us very much on the defensive . do you think schröder 's decision against german participation in iraq exacerbated anti-american tendencies already prevalent ? what was the decision really about ? - not to send german soldiers to iraq .
with the benefit of hindsight , we can now say that that was a responsible decision taken in the national interest .
the emotions surrounding it were understandable since it was the first time that the germans said " no . "
again , people with anti-american attitudes felt justified .
others with less well-formed attitudes were drawn to that position .
life at the stammtisch -lsb- the pub table -rsb- became a lot easier when you voiced critical opinions on the us . what do you think about schröder 's decision ? interestingly enough , no one disputes that the decision was right .
but the way it was presented to the public during an election campaign was unfortunate .
that 's why schröder is not given credit for it .
still , i do n't think a german chancellor would say no to a war that our most important ally , the us , wants to conduct simply to further his re-election prospects .
the real failure was that the europeans did not stand together .
that might have prevented the war . was there an inherently anti-american component in it , in other words , did it have a " trickle-down " effect in the german public ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say german chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and bush make a better couple no , the decision not to participate in the iraq war was not inherently anti-american .
after 9/11 , many germans felt sympathy towards the americans .

" at the start of the decade , according to us state department polling , 78 percent of germans had a favorable view of the us , " wike said .
" today , according to the latest pew global attitudes survey , only 30 percent have a favorable view , the lowest percentage of any european country included in the survey . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daily life in iraq : oil and explosions other surveys that confirm those findings stress that the current poor image of the us is largely linked to its invasion of iraq in 2003 - a decision which sparked vocal opposition in countries such as germany and france . german weekly magazine stern published a poll this spring , conducted by the forsa institute , which said that 48 percent of germans believe that the united states is " more dangerous for world peace than iran . " manfred güllner , head of the forsa institute , told the online portal stern.de that " since the beginning of the war in iraq , the image of the us as a power that has no qualms about military interventions and which sees itself as the world police has grown . " latent anti-americanism while güllner believes the negative image of the us in germany is linked to the iraq war , others suggest that a " latent " anti-american tendency has always existed in the country . wolfgang tönnesmann , a political scientist at the kaiserslautern-based atlantic academy which aims to foster trans-atlantic dialogue , said that anti-americanism has existed on both sides of the political spectrum in germany . " some people who disliked the us all along now feel vindicated -lsb- because of the war in iraq -rsb- , " tönnesmann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british soldier , and ally , of the us in iraq " germans do n't need american protection anymore -lrb- or so they believe -rrb- , " said alexander höse , a foreign policy expert at the university of cologne .
" america is now just seen as the 300-pound gorilla throwing its weight around ; nobody likes that . "
höse added that differing views among americans and germans on economic and social policies contributed to the problem . blatant anti-americanism others , however , say anti-americanism runs much deeper . andrei markovits , a professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , said not latent , but blatant anti-americanism is prevalent in both europe and germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel -lrb- l -rrb- has eased relations with us president bush " it is a conflicting emotion that is hard to define , a deep-seated resentment on the part of germans and europeans toward america , " said markovits , who has covered the topic extensively in his book " uncouth nation : why europe dislikes america . " he says that anti-americanism is nearly a sport among german intellectuals - an act of rebellion and subversion which flourishes among the educated elite . " europeans do n't like the us because it 's big , brash , uncouth , vulgar , yet quick , " he said .
" then , when it becomes powerful and intervenes in europe like it did throughout the 20th century , which was to many europeans ' benefit , they do n't like it . " markovits also claimed that anti-americanism goes back hundreds of years .
he said that all the constituents for anti-americanism were there " at the latest by july 5 , 1776 . " his explanation : " america represents modernity from the 19th century onward , and anyone who fears modernity associates that fear with america . " latent optimism whether it 's fear of us foreign policy or a deeper-seated sentiment against the world 's superpower , as some suggest , there 's little doubt that ordinary americans are increasingly confronted with prejudices and hostility in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans mock us-german relations at " carnival " " americans have a difficult time here right now , " tönnesmann said .
" students in particular get a lot of questions about what their government is doing , and they have to justify themselves , and occasionally germans show their disrespect or dislike . " americans in germany must not just attempt to justify iraq , but must also address questions about everything from the american penchant for guns , the questionable nature of the death penalty to the lax approach of the nation toward climate protection . to counter the one-sided image , the german-american institute at the university of tübingen has initiated a program called " rent an american , " which arranges for american exchange students to visit local german schools to talk about their view of the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a changing climate in trans-atlantic ties ?
america 's poor image not here to stay experts , however , are optimistic that current perceptions of us policies in europe will not cloud the overriding positive image of america in european minds . in the end , said tönnesmann , " europeans and americans are not that different ; ultimately , they have to rely on what their government tells them . " we can only hope that most people can realize what america really stands for : that is , multilateralism , liberalism , openness , and compassion . " wike of the pew center agreed . " despite their misgivings about the bush administration and its policies , germans still tend to have a positive view of the american people , " he said .
" fully 63 percent say they have a favorable view of americans . " others point out that the same applies to americans looking across the atlantic too .

but that sunny outlook is n't reflected in the mood of the nation . after such a long stint in the economic doldrums , much has been made of the recent upturn in consumer spending in germany , improving growth rates and falling joblessness -lrb- 3.7 million in july compared to almost 4.4 million at the same time last year -rrb- . so much so in fact , that some are talking of a second " economic miracle . " reports about a better balanced budget and a new-found joie de spending among the notoriously cautious germans abound .
all of a sudden , the headlines are filled with a refreshingly convincing optimism , which seems to both reflect and spread a growing positive mood .
or is it just wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping is becoming fashionable birgit gebhardt , the managing director of the trendbüro agency for social change , said germany is not out of the woods yet . " after years of national depression , all of a sudden the tide has made a massive turn , and the media claims we 're in the throes of a consumer party , " she said .
" in actual fact , we really are n't at that point yet . " gebhardt added that although germany has managed to vastly improve its competitiveness over recent years and although a booming economy can contribute to reshaping the mood of a nation , germany still has a long way to go . what constitutes happiness ? the allensbach institute for public opinion has been conducting surveys about the happiness of germans since 1945 , when , with so many men killed in the war , women were asked whether they thought they could be happy alone . the question of happiness was raised over and again in subsequent polls until the point at which it became a research subject in its own right .
the most recent survey in the institute 's extensive archive was carried out last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxury holidays are n't what matters to most a cross-section of 1,800 germans from all over the country were interviewed face to face to try and establish what constitutes contemporary happiness .
wilhelm haumann , a project leader at the institute , said a blossoming economy is not the key to human joy . " if we look at how income and how the perception of happiness have changed since 1945 , we see a massive increase in income and absolutely zero change in the number of people who say they feel happy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty remains an unhappy reality on the other hand , however , living below the bread line is a fast track to misery , he added . " while there is no definitive correlation between a strong economy and happiness , there is certainly a relationship between a weak economy and unhappiness , " haumann said .
" sixty percent of interviewees who said they were really unhappy , had financial problems . " money is not the answer so if being able to throw money around is not what makes people smile , what does ? " people like to be able to have the feeling that they are in charge of their own lives , that they can be influential and do n't have to bow to external powers , " haumann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluence does n't equal joy in germany he added that germans have been bound up in a very hierarchical society for so long that they do n't have the freedom of personal autonomy .
being able to organize one 's own life and make decisions at work rather than simply being bossed around contributes greatly to creating a strength of personality , which in turn is a pre-requisite for happiness . " it 's no coincidence that those with the greatest sense of initiative are the happiest , " haumann concludes . all that being the case , the way in which the german labor market is developing must be a good thing .
although there is less security than in bygone days , there is far greater flexibility for both employers and staff , which should promote initiative , thus leading to happiness . happiness through flexibility tanja siegmund , a spokeswoman for the international recruitment agency adecco , said she recently witnessed a shift in the approach to finding work . " the german labor market has traditionally been quite conservative , once people had a job they stayed in it even if they were unhapp , " she said , adding that this is changing . " people are becoming more daring , they are giving up their full-time , secure jobs because they are beginning to understand that they have other possibilities , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employment is the answer siegmund said she believes germany has a lot to learn from countries like holland and the united kingdom where there is a far greater tradition of temporary and part-time work . " it used to have a negative connotation attached to it in germany , but people are beginning to see things differently , " she said . and it seems to be changing right across the employment board . jürgen weber , a freelance television director , agreed that there is a new willingness for people to take chances with their jobs . " there seems to be a new feeling that anything is possible , that if you lose one job , you can find another , " he said , adding that people are prepared to work for less money than in the past and that they seem to have more fun with what they are doing . " the industry is much more dynamic now , the mood is simply better , " he said . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de taxes -pipe- 08.08.2007 privacy concerns mark debate on german tax databank großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the electronic databank will put an end to fiscal authorities ' rubber stamp privacy advocates and opposition politicians have criticized plans by the german government to set up a central databank for tax information .
they say access to the information should be strictly limited . the german cabinet on wednesday approved a bill to extensively change the country 's tax system .
however , plans to establish a central electronic databank of taxpayer information , which is part of the bill , have sparked a debate about privacy guidelines . the federal finance ministry said the electronic databank will lead to less tax fraud and less bureaucracy .
the databank will contain all relevant information necessary for calculating income tax .
this includes data on spouses , children , religion , as well as tax brackets and exemptions . germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar said he did not categorically oppose the electronic databank .
schaar 's spokesman , dietmar müller , said separately that the extent of the information collected was cause for concern , as it could invite abuse . " in view of the amount of sensitive data and the possible desire to retrieve it , we see a number of data protection provisions which are still open , " müller said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will citizens ' incomes become more transparent ?
müller pointed out that law enforcement agencies could be particularly interested in certain data .
this had been the case , for example , with data from electronic highway tolls , which is now being used to fight terrorism . information on religious belief was particularly sensitive , müller said .
the commissioner would therefore seek to press for this information to remain protected .
germany does not have a formal separation of church and state .
church taxes are withdrawn by people 's employers and passed on to the authorities . employer insight opposition politician hermann otto solms of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said he had fundamental reservations about the databank .
he warned of the " total transparency " it enabled . " a huge , self-contained data pool emerges which is n't necessary for the sole purpose of income tax , " said solms , the fiscal spokesman for the free-market-liberal fdp .
he said opening the file not only to tax authorities , but also to employers was a particularly precarious situation . " it is n't for nothing that in germany there 's fiscal secrecy , which stipulates that only fiscal authorities have the right to access tax data , " solms told the daily hessische / niedersächsische allgemeine on wednesday .
" a huge databank is being created about the working life of each citizen , which is n't protected from outside access . " citizens need privacy assurances the government will also introduce a central taxpayer identification number , with lifelong validity .
at present , the numbers change according to a person 's residence .

the fact that a few hardy souls traveled in the opposite direction is far less well-known .
the american musician , actor and film director , dean reed was one of them . filmmaker leopold grün , who grew up in east germany , had forgotten about reed until a friend from the west jogged his memory six years ago . " i did n't like his music , so he 'd never really concerned me very much , " grün said .
" it was only when i started looking into his story that i became fascinated because it had so many twists and turns .
i discovered a completely crazy world that i had no idea about . "
the bizarre tale of dean reed has recently reawakened a flurry of interest .
as well as grün 's film - five years in the making and just opening in germany - a biography was published late last year .
us actor tom hanks is currently working on a feature film with steven spielberg about reed 's life with himself in the lead role . new angle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dean reed was an outspoken critic of the us 's war on vietnam leopold grün sees this interest as signs of a need for a change of perspective about the cold war era . " we all know that people fled east germany , " he said .
" but what could someone 's motives have been for going in the opposite direction ? "
called " the red elvis , " grün 's film does not set out to provide a comprehensive or conclusive account of reed 's colorful and chequered life .
the filmmaker is clear : " this is not a biography . "
instead , like a puzzle the documentary pieces together film clips , concert footage and a host of interviews , leaving it to the audience to make up their own mind . not exactly country-western by the time the photogenic reed settled in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , he had already strayed far from his roots .
following a couple of very minor hits in the united states , the singer embarked on a tour of latin america in the early 1960s that was to prove decisive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans have set up a web site dedicated to his memory not only did reed end up at number one on the chilean charts , he witnessed grinding poverty during his travels and forged contacts with the latin american leftist movement , eventually counting salvador allende among his friends .
in " the red elvis , " isabel allende bussi remembers with gratitude reed 's support for her father 's presidential campaign .
" in his performances in chile you can see he is genuine , " grün said .
" the posing began later . "
increasingly critical of us foreign policy , reed moved to latin america .
it was the start of his career as a political activist-cum-entertainer .
he also continued to perform further afield , becoming the first us singer to tour the soviet union where his repertoire of country-western and protest songs together with his screen idol looks took audiences by storm .
in the film , a russian fan , now living in reed 's home town , reverentially recalls how his appearances in russia " were like a holiday for us . "
her memories have a tragic irony .
the singing advocate of socialist policies functioned as a distraction from soviet realities . " we forgot that we were oppressed , " she tells the camera . propaganda coup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his films , the actor cum musician also supported the underdog the us performer 's tours were clearly a coup for soviet authorities .
this did not go unnoticed back home .
in 1972 , in an article dripping with sarcasm , the us magazine newsweek commented : " reed 's success is heavily subsidized by kremlin authorities .
how often do they get an american who looks like apple pie and treads the party line like a trained bear ? " significantly , reed never relinquished his us passport , retaining the right to roam .
one of the most memorable - and disturbing - images in " the red elvis " shows reed in lebanon in the late 1960s , posing with both a gun and a guitar .
in argentina , reed was given his own tv show to host , but was finally deported after his pro-communist stance got too much for the authorities who were wary of upsetting washington .
after building an acting career in spaghetti westerns in italy , he moved to east berlin in 1972 , meeting his second wife-to-be at a film festival in leipzig .
in east germany , reed continued to sing and act , most notably in the blockbuster , east-german western " blutsbrüder " -lrb- blood brothers -rrb- .
here , the showman created a role tailored to his own character - a us soldier who goes over to the other side , joining forces with the underdogs after witnessing a massacre of cheyenne indians . a rising star behind the iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even as a middle aged man , reed continued to play the cowboy at first , the gdr authorities had not been so keen on his staying , according to grün . " they were afraid that he would have an unsettling effect because he was such a showman , but then they realized what a fantastic opportunity he presented , " he said .
" he stood for the right cause and there was no need to manipulate him . " egon krenz , who was later to briefly succeed erich honecker at the top of the east german leadership , has described the relationship between reed and the authorities as a " productive " one , based on " give and take . " but while this closeness to the regime may have secured him a celebrity status that he would never have enjoyed in the united states , it was also to prove his downfall .
his popularity began to ebb , partly because of his failure to take any kind of critical stance in public .
disillusioned cowboy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the popularity of his early years waning , depression set in over the years , reed had also become increasingly disillusioned with the less than heroic nature of everyday life in east germany .
and by the mid 1980s , his third marriage to a leading east german actress was also on the rocks . grün 's film gives little credence to the conspiracy stories that have surrounded his death by drowning , which was reported as a " tragic accident " on east german television .
reed 's long-term mistress and soulmate talks about the suicide pact that they had discussed at their clandestine apartment , still visibly grieving at the fact that he decided to cross this final frontier without her . more than a product of the cold war ?
the 90-minute film creates a subtle , multi-layered image of someone whose public and private personas were riven with contradictions .
while dean reed was , in one sense , very much a product of the cold war , grün said he believes his life story still has relevance today .
" one important goal of mine was to make a film that people could identify with in some way .

the fact that a few hardy souls traveled in the opposite direction is far less well-known .
the american musician , actor and film director , dean reed was one of them . filmmaker leopold grün , who grew up in east germany , had forgotten about reed until a friend from the west jogged his memory six years ago . " i did n't like his music , so he 'd never really concerned me very much , " grün said .
" it was only when i started looking into his story that i became fascinated because it had so many twists and turns .
i discovered a completely crazy world that i had no idea about . "
the bizarre tale of dean reed has recently reawakened a flurry of interest .
as well as grün 's film - five years in the making and just opening in germany - a biography was published late last year .
us actor tom hanks is currently working on a feature film with steven spielberg about reed 's life with himself in the lead role . new angle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dean reed was an outspoken critic of the us 's war on vietnam leopold grün sees this interest as signs of a need for a change of perspective about the cold war era . " we all know that people fled east germany , " he said .
" but what could someone 's motives have been for going in the opposite direction ? "
called " the red elvis , " grün 's film does not set out to provide a comprehensive or conclusive account of reed 's colorful and chequered life .
the filmmaker is clear : " this is not a biography . "
instead , like a puzzle the documentary pieces together film clips , concert footage and a host of interviews , leaving it to the audience to make up their own mind . not exactly country-western by the time the photogenic reed settled in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , he had already strayed far from his roots .
following a couple of very minor hits in the united states , the singer embarked on a tour of latin america in the early 1960s that was to prove decisive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans have set up a web site dedicated to his memory not only did reed end up at number one on the chilean charts , he witnessed grinding poverty during his travels and forged contacts with the latin american leftist movement , eventually counting salvador allende among his friends .
in " the red elvis , " isabel allende bussi remembers with gratitude reed 's support for her father 's presidential campaign .
" in his performances in chile you can see he is genuine , " grün said .
" the posing began later . "
increasingly critical of us foreign policy , reed moved to latin america .
it was the start of his career as a political activist-cum-entertainer .
he also continued to perform further afield , becoming the first us singer to tour the soviet union where his repertoire of country-western and protest songs together with his screen idol looks took audiences by storm .
in the film , a russian fan , now living in reed 's home town , reverentially recalls how his appearances in russia " were like a holiday for us . "
her memories have a tragic irony .
the singing advocate of socialist policies functioned as a distraction from soviet realities . " we forgot that we were oppressed , " she tells the camera . propaganda coup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his films , the actor cum musician also supported the underdog the us performer 's tours were clearly a coup for soviet authorities .
this did not go unnoticed back home .
in 1972 , in an article dripping with sarcasm , the us magazine newsweek commented : " reed 's success is heavily subsidized by kremlin authorities .
how often do they get an american who looks like apple pie and treads the party line like a trained bear ? " significantly , reed never relinquished his us passport , retaining the right to roam .
one of the most memorable - and disturbing - images in " the red elvis " shows reed in lebanon in the late 1960s , posing with both a gun and a guitar .
in argentina , reed was given his own tv show to host , but was finally deported after his pro-communist stance got too much for the authorities who were wary of upsetting washington .
after building an acting career in spaghetti westerns in italy , he moved to east berlin in 1972 , meeting his second wife-to-be at a film festival in leipzig .
in east germany , reed continued to sing and act , most notably in the blockbuster , east-german western " blutsbrüder " -lrb- blood brothers -rrb- .
here , the showman created a role tailored to his own character - a us soldier who goes over to the other side , joining forces with the underdogs after witnessing a massacre of cheyenne indians . a rising star behind the iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even as a middle aged man , reed continued to play the cowboy at first , the gdr authorities had not been so keen on his staying , according to grün . " they were afraid that he would have an unsettling effect because he was such a showman , but then they realized what a fantastic opportunity he presented , " he said .
" he stood for the right cause and there was no need to manipulate him . " egon krenz , who was later to briefly succeed erich honecker at the top of the east german leadership , has described the relationship between reed and the authorities as a " productive " one , based on " give and take . " but while this closeness to the regime may have secured him a celebrity status that he would never have enjoyed in the united states , it was also to prove his downfall .
his popularity began to ebb , partly because of his failure to take any kind of critical stance in public .
disillusioned cowboy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the popularity of his early years waning , depression set in over the years , reed had also become increasingly disillusioned with the less than heroic nature of everyday life in east germany .
and by the mid 1980s , his third marriage to a leading east german actress was also on the rocks . grün 's film gives little credence to the conspiracy stories that have surrounded his death by drowning , which was reported as a " tragic accident " on east german television .
reed 's long-term mistress and soulmate talks about the suicide pact that they had discussed at their clandestine apartment , still visibly grieving at the fact that he decided to cross this final frontier without her . more than a product of the cold war ?
the 90-minute film creates a subtle , multi-layered image of someone whose public and private personas were riven with contradictions .
while dean reed was , in one sense , very much a product of the cold war , grün said he believes his life story still has relevance today .
" one important goal of mine was to make a film that people could identify with in some way .
the themes that are dealt with are still topical : the palestinian issue , latin america , " he said .
" in addition to that , it deals with human problems that are not specific to east germany . " julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say access to the information should be strictly limited . the german cabinet on wednesday approved a bill to extensively change the country 's tax system .
however , plans to establish a central electronic databank of taxpayer information , which is part of the bill , have sparked a debate about privacy guidelines . the federal finance ministry said the electronic databank will lead to less tax fraud and less bureaucracy .
the databank will contain all relevant information necessary for calculating income tax .
this includes data on spouses , children , religion , as well as tax brackets and exemptions . germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar said he did not categorically oppose the electronic databank .
schaar 's spokesman , dietmar müller , said separately that the extent of the information collected was cause for concern , as it could invite abuse . " in view of the amount of sensitive data and the possible desire to retrieve it , we see a number of data protection provisions which are still open , " müller said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will citizens ' incomes become more transparent ?
müller pointed out that law enforcement agencies could be particularly interested in certain data .
this had been the case , for example , with data from electronic highway tolls , which is now being used to fight terrorism . information on religious belief was particularly sensitive , müller said .
the commissioner would therefore seek to press for this information to remain protected .
germany does not have a formal separation of church and state .
church taxes are withdrawn by people 's employers and passed on to the authorities . employer insight opposition politician hermann otto solms of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said he had fundamental reservations about the databank .
he warned of the " total transparency " it enabled . " a huge , self-contained data pool emerges which is n't necessary for the sole purpose of income tax , " said solms , the fiscal spokesman for the free-market-liberal fdp .
he said opening the file not only to tax authorities , but also to employers was a particularly precarious situation . " it is n't for nothing that in germany there 's fiscal secrecy , which stipulates that only fiscal authorities have the right to access tax data , " solms told the daily hessische / niedersächsische allgemeine on wednesday .
" a huge databank is being created about the working life of each citizen , which is n't protected from outside access . " citizens need privacy assurances the government will also introduce a central taxpayer identification number , with lifelong validity .
at present , the numbers change according to a person 's residence .
this had made it easier for people to evade taxes by moving around . the fiscal spokeswoman from the opposition green party , christine scheel , said the central databank was necessary in order for the new identification numbers to work . " but citizens must have the confidence that their data will not be drawn on further , " scheel said .
the greens therefore were demanding strict specification of how and by whom the data could be used , she said . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the papers agreed that china needed to do more to ensure human rights . china kicked off its one-year countdown celebrations to the 2008 olympic games on wednesday .
this prompted commentary from german papers on the human rights situation in china .
just on tuesday , chinese police detained six foreign nationals for demonstrating for a free tibet on the great wall . munich 's süddeutsche zeitung wrote that the olympics were a significant bench mark in china 's rapid advancement .
but the government in beijing had underestimated the political burden associated with the games . " beijing 2008 is a sporting , as well as a political event , " the paper wrote .

aids activists were being harassed , foreign press restricted and dissidents banned to labor camps . " the government in beijing is fatally wrong if it believes that it can relay the image of a clean china by muzzling disagreeable journalists , forced resettlers and dissidents , " it commented .
" as long as china rejects universal human rights standards , this dream will remain unfulfilled . " the daily frankfurter rundschau agreed that the world will call china to account for its actions .
" the olympics are more than just perfect organization and grandiose buildings , " it said .
" if china wants to win the world 's respect , the communist party leaders have to wage more freedom .
this is the only way the olympic games will be a success . " according to business daily financial times deutschland , the games should be seen as an opportunity for the west to influence china .
" the ultimate goal of this major event for china is organizing the perfect show and delivering the image of a modern , open-minded country , " the hamburg-based paper wrote . foreign countries should take advantage of this historical opportunity to influence china , but should n't overexcite this leverage , it said .
" a rapprochement between the far east and the west is always more valuable than a china , which is offended and seals itself off after the games . " yet western democracies should n't allow themselves to be degraded to extras in the game of chinese self-promotion , the badische neueste nachrichten warned .
at the same time , the west should n't destroy the unifying idea of sport by being " merciless spoilsports . " " it may be a tightrope walk , " the karlsruhe daily wrote .

but the government in beijing had underestimated the political burden associated with the games . " beijing 2008 is a sporting , as well as a political event , " the paper wrote .

the papers agreed that china needed to do more to ensure human rights . china kicked off its one-year countdown celebrations to the 2008 olympic games on wednesday .
this prompted commentary from german papers on the human rights situation in china .
just on tuesday , chinese police detained six foreign nationals for demonstrating for a free tibet on the great wall . munich 's süddeutsche zeitung wrote that the olympics were a significant bench mark in china 's rapid advancement .
but the government in beijing had underestimated the political burden associated with the games . " beijing 2008 is a sporting , as well as a political event , " the paper wrote .
" it was the chinese government itself which gave the games their political character through an excess of national ambition during the application phase and the promise to heed human rights more strongly . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reporters without borders have protested against china 's lack of media freedom china wanted to act and be respected as a world power - but without the associated political and moral responsibility .
" someone who travels to zimbabwe with a checkbook and supports the dictator there , someone who accepts the genocide in sudan for the sake of much-loved oil , someone who operates internment camps at home , censures and randomly arrests can not expect undivided affection and can also not refer to the olympic peace , " the daily commented . the 2008 olympic games could be a turning point for china 's image abroad , as their success would n't only be decided in the stadiums and cash boxes , wrote handelsblatt .
" whether the people 's republic manages to develop a modern image is dependent on how it deals with its critics , " the düsseldorf business daily said .
but the results were still bleak , it added .
aids activists were being harassed , foreign press restricted and dissidents banned to labor camps . " the government in beijing is fatally wrong if it believes that it can relay the image of a clean china by muzzling disagreeable journalists , forced resettlers and dissidents , " it commented .
" as long as china rejects universal human rights standards , this dream will remain unfulfilled . " the daily frankfurter rundschau agreed that the world will call china to account for its actions .
" the olympics are more than just perfect organization and grandiose buildings , " it said .
" if china wants to win the world 's respect , the communist party leaders have to wage more freedom .
this is the only way the olympic games will be a success . " according to business daily financial times deutschland , the games should be seen as an opportunity for the west to influence china .
" the ultimate goal of this major event for china is organizing the perfect show and delivering the image of a modern , open-minded country , " the hamburg-based paper wrote . foreign countries should take advantage of this historical opportunity to influence china , but should n't overexcite this leverage , it said .
" a rapprochement between the far east and the west is always more valuable than a china , which is offended and seals itself off after the games . " yet western democracies should n't allow themselves to be degraded to extras in the game of chinese self-promotion , the badische neueste nachrichten warned .
at the same time , the west should n't destroy the unifying idea of sport by being " merciless spoilsports . " " it may be a tightrope walk , " the karlsruhe daily wrote .
" but when in doubt , backbone and clear words can help more than coy strategies to demand human rights and make public violations of the elementary rules of living together .

five years ago , former chancellor gerhard schöder said " no " to germany 's participation in the war in iraq .
some say schröder merely exploited a public mood , but many agree that anti-americanism has grown . recent studies show that the us-led war in iraq has contributed to a growing negative view of america in germany .
dw-world.de spoke with wolfgang tönnesmann , a political scientist at the atlantic academy - based in kaisterslautern - which aims to foster trans-atlantic ties . dw-world.de : how strong do you think anti-americanism is in germany ? wolfgang tönnesmann : i think it 's there , but it 's hard to separate from the legitimate criticism of the current us administration .
there has always been anti-americanism in germany on both the left and in particular the right , and some people who have disliked the us all along now feel vindicated .
that 's why it 's difficult to say just how strong anti-americanism is right now .
however , when 48 percent of germans think that the us is a greater threat to world peace than iran , that 's cause for concern . how has anti-americanism changed over the years , particularly since former chancellor gerhard schröder said " no " to the war in iraq five years ago ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder said " no " all those years ago gerhard schröder has left office , but the war still goes on with no end in sight .
and as it has turned out , the iraq war was based on false information and manipulation of the public .
even the staunchest supporters of the us have a hard time to explain what happened .
the system of checks and balances , the core of the american constitution that almost every child in germany knows about , has not worked .
that has put germans who like the us very much on the defensive . do you think schröder 's decision against german participation in iraq exacerbated anti-american tendencies already prevalent ? what was the decision really about ? - not to send german soldiers to iraq .
with the benefit of hindsight , we can now say that that was a responsible decision taken in the national interest .
the emotions surrounding it were understandable since it was the first time that the germans said " no . "
again , people with anti-american attitudes felt justified .
others with less well-formed attitudes were drawn to that position .
life at the stammtisch -lsb- the pub table -rsb- became a lot easier when you voiced critical opinions on the us . what do you think about schröder 's decision ? interestingly enough , no one disputes that the decision was right .
but the way it was presented to the public during an election campaign was unfortunate .
that 's why schröder is not given credit for it .
still , i do n't think a german chancellor would say no to a war that our most important ally , the us , wants to conduct simply to further his re-election prospects .
the real failure was that the europeans did not stand together .
that might have prevented the war . was there an inherently anti-american component in it , in other words , did it have a " trickle-down " effect in the german public ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say german chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and bush make a better couple no , the decision not to participate in the iraq war was not inherently anti-american .
after 9/11 , many germans felt sympathy towards the americans .
supporting the americans in afghanistan , as schröder did , was criticized , but people have grasped that germany has to play its role , sometimes including the bundeswehr .
but we do n't think that the problem of terrorism can be solved mainly by killing the terrorists .
we also have to pursue other strategies . how have americans themselves , not just us president george w. bush , contributed to anti-americanism in germany ?
how have they not ? the americans themselves are no better off than many europeans .
they have to rely on what their government tells them .
however , the us now seems to be a polarized country .
when 14 percent of americans believe - as polls at last year 's election showed - that george bush was chosen by god to lead the us in a global war on terrorism , then we might start feeling quite desperate about some americans at the very least .
it 's important that the media play their proper role on both sides of the atlantic presenting the facts and furthering the understanding . in the end , i am confident that the world knows what america stands for : liberalism , openness and compassion . louisa schaefer interviewed wolfgang tönnesmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

five years ago , former chancellor gerhard schöder said " no " to germany 's participation in the war in iraq .
some say schröder merely exploited a public mood , but many agree that anti-americanism has grown . recent studies show that the us-led war in iraq has contributed to a growing negative view of america in germany .
dw-world.de spoke with wolfgang tönnesmann , a political scientist at the atlantic academy - based in kaisterslautern - which aims to foster trans-atlantic ties . dw-world.de : how strong do you think anti-americanism is in germany ? wolfgang tönnesmann : i think it 's there , but it 's hard to separate from the legitimate criticism of the current us administration .
there has always been anti-americanism in germany on both the left and in particular the right , and some people who have disliked the us all along now feel vindicated .
that 's why it 's difficult to say just how strong anti-americanism is right now .
however , when 48 percent of germans think that the us is a greater threat to world peace than iran , that 's cause for concern . how has anti-americanism changed over the years , particularly since former chancellor gerhard schröder said " no " to the war in iraq five years ago ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder said " no " all those years ago gerhard schröder has left office , but the war still goes on with no end in sight .
and as it has turned out , the iraq war was based on false information and manipulation of the public .
even the staunchest supporters of the us have a hard time to explain what happened .
the system of checks and balances , the core of the american constitution that almost every child in germany knows about , has not worked .
that has put germans who like the us very much on the defensive . do you think schröder 's decision against german participation in iraq exacerbated anti-american tendencies already prevalent ? what was the decision really about ? - not to send german soldiers to iraq .

" at the start of the decade , according to us state department polling , 78 percent of germans had a favorable view of the us , " wike said .
" today , according to the latest pew global attitudes survey , only 30 percent have a favorable view , the lowest percentage of any european country included in the survey . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daily life in iraq : oil and explosions other surveys that confirm those findings stress that the current poor image of the us is largely linked to its invasion of iraq in 2003 - a decision which sparked vocal opposition in countries such as germany and france . german weekly magazine stern published a poll this spring , conducted by the forsa institute , which said that 48 percent of germans believe that the united states is " more dangerous for world peace than iran . " manfred güllner , head of the forsa institute , told the online portal stern.de that " since the beginning of the war in iraq , the image of the us as a power that has no qualms about military interventions and which sees itself as the world police has grown . " latent anti-americanism while güllner believes the negative image of the us in germany is linked to the iraq war , others suggest that a " latent " anti-american tendency has always existed in the country . wolfgang tönnesmann , a political scientist at the kaiserslautern-based atlantic academy which aims to foster trans-atlantic dialogue , said that anti-americanism has existed on both sides of the political spectrum in germany . " some people who disliked the us all along now feel vindicated -lsb- because of the war in iraq -rsb- , " tönnesmann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british soldier , and ally , of the us in iraq " germans do n't need american protection anymore -lrb- or so they believe -rrb- , " said alexander höse , a foreign policy expert at the university of cologne .
" america is now just seen as the 300-pound gorilla throwing its weight around ; nobody likes that . "
höse added that differing views among americans and germans on economic and social policies contributed to the problem . blatant anti-americanism others , however , say anti-americanism runs much deeper . andrei markovits , a professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , said not latent , but blatant anti-americanism is prevalent in both europe and germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel -lrb- l -rrb- has eased relations with us president bush " it is a conflicting emotion that is hard to define , a deep-seated resentment on the part of germans and europeans toward america , " said markovits , who has covered the topic extensively in his book " uncouth nation : why europe dislikes america . " he says that anti-americanism is nearly a sport among german intellectuals - an act of rebellion and subversion which flourishes among the educated elite . " europeans do n't like the us because it 's big , brash , uncouth , vulgar , yet quick , " he said .
" then , when it becomes powerful and intervenes in europe like it did throughout the 20th century , which was to many europeans ' benefit , they do n't like it . " markovits also claimed that anti-americanism goes back hundreds of years .
he said that all the constituents for anti-americanism were there " at the latest by july 5 , 1776 . " his explanation : " america represents modernity from the 19th century onward , and anyone who fears modernity associates that fear with america . " latent optimism whether it 's fear of us foreign policy or a deeper-seated sentiment against the world 's superpower , as some suggest , there 's little doubt that ordinary americans are increasingly confronted with prejudices and hostility in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans mock us-german relations at " carnival " " americans have a difficult time here right now , " tönnesmann said .
" students in particular get a lot of questions about what their government is doing , and they have to justify themselves , and occasionally germans show their disrespect or dislike . " americans in germany must not just attempt to justify iraq , but must also address questions about everything from the american penchant for guns , the questionable nature of the death penalty to the lax approach of the nation toward climate protection . to counter the one-sided image , the german-american institute at the university of tübingen has initiated a program called " rent an american , " which arranges for american exchange students to visit local german schools to talk about their view of the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a changing climate in trans-atlantic ties ?
america 's poor image not here to stay experts , however , are optimistic that current perceptions of us policies in europe will not cloud the overriding positive image of america in european minds . in the end , said tönnesmann , " europeans and americans are not that different ; ultimately , they have to rely on what their government tells them . " we can only hope that most people can realize what america really stands for : that is , multilateralism , liberalism , openness , and compassion . " wike of the pew center agreed . " despite their misgivings about the bush administration and its policies , germans still tend to have a positive view of the american people , " he said .
" fully 63 percent say they have a favorable view of americans . " others point out that the same applies to americans looking across the atlantic too .

" at the start of the decade , according to us state department polling , 78 percent of germans had a favorable view of the us , " wike said .
" today , according to the latest pew global attitudes survey , only 30 percent have a favorable view , the lowest percentage of any european country included in the survey . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daily life in iraq : oil and explosions other surveys that confirm those findings stress that the current poor image of the us is largely linked to its invasion of iraq in 2003 - a decision which sparked vocal opposition in countries such as germany and france . german weekly magazine stern published a poll this spring , conducted by the forsa institute , which said that 48 percent of germans believe that the united states is " more dangerous for world peace than iran . " manfred güllner , head of the forsa institute , told the online portal stern.de that " since the beginning of the war in iraq , the image of the us as a power that has no qualms about military interventions and which sees itself as the world police has grown . " latent anti-americanism while güllner believes the negative image of the us in germany is linked to the iraq war , others suggest that a " latent " anti-american tendency has always existed in the country . wolfgang tönnesmann , a political scientist at the kaiserslautern-based atlantic academy which aims to foster trans-atlantic dialogue , said that anti-americanism has existed on both sides of the political spectrum in germany . " some people who disliked the us all along now feel vindicated -lsb- because of the war in iraq -rsb- , " tönnesmann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british soldier , and ally , of the us in iraq " germans do n't need american protection anymore -lrb- or so they believe -rrb- , " said alexander höse , a foreign policy expert at the university of cologne .
" america is now just seen as the 300-pound gorilla throwing its weight around ; nobody likes that . "
höse added that differing views among americans and germans on economic and social policies contributed to the problem . blatant anti-americanism others , however , say anti-americanism runs much deeper . andrei markovits , a professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , said not latent , but blatant anti-americanism is prevalent in both europe and germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel -lrb- l -rrb- has eased relations with us president bush " it is a conflicting emotion that is hard to define , a deep-seated resentment on the part of germans and europeans toward america , " said markovits , who has covered the topic extensively in his book " uncouth nation : why europe dislikes america . " he says that anti-americanism is nearly a sport among german intellectuals - an act of rebellion and subversion which flourishes among the educated elite . " europeans do n't like the us because it 's big , brash , uncouth , vulgar , yet quick , " he said .
" then , when it becomes powerful and intervenes in europe like it did throughout the 20th century , which was to many europeans ' benefit , they do n't like it . " markovits also claimed that anti-americanism goes back hundreds of years .
he said that all the constituents for anti-americanism were there " at the latest by july 5 , 1776 . " his explanation : " america represents modernity from the 19th century onward , and anyone who fears modernity associates that fear with america . " latent optimism whether it 's fear of us foreign policy or a deeper-seated sentiment against the world 's superpower , as some suggest , there 's little doubt that ordinary americans are increasingly confronted with prejudices and hostility in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans mock us-german relations at " carnival " " americans have a difficult time here right now , " tönnesmann said .
" students in particular get a lot of questions about what their government is doing , and they have to justify themselves , and occasionally germans show their disrespect or dislike . " americans in germany must not just attempt to justify iraq , but must also address questions about everything from the american penchant for guns , the questionable nature of the death penalty to the lax approach of the nation toward climate protection . to counter the one-sided image , the german-american institute at the university of tübingen has initiated a program called " rent an american , " which arranges for american exchange students to visit local german schools to talk about their view of the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a changing climate in trans-atlantic ties ?
america 's poor image not here to stay experts , however , are optimistic that current perceptions of us policies in europe will not cloud the overriding positive image of america in european minds . in the end , said tönnesmann , " europeans and americans are not that different ; ultimately , they have to rely on what their government tells them . " we can only hope that most people can realize what america really stands for : that is , multilateralism , liberalism , openness , and compassion . " wike of the pew center agreed . " despite their misgivings about the bush administration and its policies , germans still tend to have a positive view of the american people , " he said .
" fully 63 percent say they have a favorable view of americans . " others point out that the same applies to americans looking across the atlantic too .
" the american public wants good german-american relations , " höse said .
" the american stance on multilateralism , climate change and other issues seem to be softening - good signs . " louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de expert : iraq not the only reason for german anti-americanism five years ago , former chancellor gerhard schöder said " no " to germany 's participation in the war in iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 08.08.2007 despite booming economy , germans not in celebratory mood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forget the economy , it was last year 's world cup that put germans in a sunnier mood business surveys and consumer confidence levels suggest that the german economic motor has roared back to life and is racing towards a bright future .
but that sunny outlook is n't reflected in the mood of the nation . after such a long stint in the economic doldrums , much has been made of the recent upturn in consumer spending in germany , improving growth rates and falling joblessness -lrb- 3.7 million in july compared to almost 4.4 million at the same time last year -rrb- . so much so in fact , that some are talking of a second " economic miracle . " reports about a better balanced budget and a new-found joie de spending among the notoriously cautious germans abound .
all of a sudden , the headlines are filled with a refreshingly convincing optimism , which seems to both reflect and spread a growing positive mood .
or is it just wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping is becoming fashionable birgit gebhardt , the managing director of the trendbüro agency for social change , said germany is not out of the woods yet . " after years of national depression , all of a sudden the tide has made a massive turn , and the media claims we 're in the throes of a consumer party , " she said .
" in actual fact , we really are n't at that point yet . " gebhardt added that although germany has managed to vastly improve its competitiveness over recent years and although a booming economy can contribute to reshaping the mood of a nation , germany still has a long way to go . what constitutes happiness ? the allensbach institute for public opinion has been conducting surveys about the happiness of germans since 1945 , when , with so many men killed in the war , women were asked whether they thought they could be happy alone . the question of happiness was raised over and again in subsequent polls until the point at which it became a research subject in its own right .
the most recent survey in the institute 's extensive archive was carried out last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxury holidays are n't what matters to most a cross-section of 1,800 germans from all over the country were interviewed face to face to try and establish what constitutes contemporary happiness .
wilhelm haumann , a project leader at the institute , said a blossoming economy is not the key to human joy . " if we look at how income and how the perception of happiness have changed since 1945 , we see a massive increase in income and absolutely zero change in the number of people who say they feel happy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty remains an unhappy reality on the other hand , however , living below the bread line is a fast track to misery , he added . " while there is no definitive correlation between a strong economy and happiness , there is certainly a relationship between a weak economy and unhappiness , " haumann said .
" sixty percent of interviewees who said they were really unhappy , had financial problems . " money is not the answer so if being able to throw money around is not what makes people smile , what does ? " people like to be able to have the feeling that they are in charge of their own lives , that they can be influential and do n't have to bow to external powers , " haumann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluence does n't equal joy in germany he added that germans have been bound up in a very hierarchical society for so long that they do n't have the freedom of personal autonomy .
being able to organize one 's own life and make decisions at work rather than simply being bossed around contributes greatly to creating a strength of personality , which in turn is a pre-requisite for happiness . " it 's no coincidence that those with the greatest sense of initiative are the happiest , " haumann concludes . all that being the case , the way in which the german labor market is developing must be a good thing .

they say access to the information should be strictly limited . the german cabinet on wednesday approved a bill to extensively change the country 's tax system .
however , plans to establish a central electronic databank of taxpayer information , which is part of the bill , have sparked a debate about privacy guidelines . the federal finance ministry said the electronic databank will lead to less tax fraud and less bureaucracy .
the databank will contain all relevant information necessary for calculating income tax .
this includes data on spouses , children , religion , as well as tax brackets and exemptions . germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar said he did not categorically oppose the electronic databank .
schaar 's spokesman , dietmar müller , said separately that the extent of the information collected was cause for concern , as it could invite abuse . " in view of the amount of sensitive data and the possible desire to retrieve it , we see a number of data protection provisions which are still open , " müller said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will citizens ' incomes become more transparent ?
müller pointed out that law enforcement agencies could be particularly interested in certain data .
this had been the case , for example , with data from electronic highway tolls , which is now being used to fight terrorism . information on religious belief was particularly sensitive , müller said .
the commissioner would therefore seek to press for this information to remain protected .
germany does not have a formal separation of church and state .
church taxes are withdrawn by people 's employers and passed on to the authorities . employer insight opposition politician hermann otto solms of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said he had fundamental reservations about the databank .
he warned of the " total transparency " it enabled . " a huge , self-contained data pool emerges which is n't necessary for the sole purpose of income tax , " said solms , the fiscal spokesman for the free-market-liberal fdp .
he said opening the file not only to tax authorities , but also to employers was a particularly precarious situation . " it is n't for nothing that in germany there 's fiscal secrecy , which stipulates that only fiscal authorities have the right to access tax data , " solms told the daily hessische / niedersächsische allgemeine on wednesday .
" a huge databank is being created about the working life of each citizen , which is n't protected from outside access . " citizens need privacy assurances the government will also introduce a central taxpayer identification number , with lifelong validity .
at present , the numbers change according to a person 's residence .
this had made it easier for people to evade taxes by moving around . the fiscal spokeswoman from the opposition green party , christine scheel , said the central databank was necessary in order for the new identification numbers to work .

they say access to the information should be strictly limited . the german cabinet on wednesday approved a bill to extensively change the country 's tax system .
however , plans to establish a central electronic databank of taxpayer information , which is part of the bill , have sparked a debate about privacy guidelines . the federal finance ministry said the electronic databank will lead to less tax fraud and less bureaucracy .
the databank will contain all relevant information necessary for calculating income tax .
this includes data on spouses , children , religion , as well as tax brackets and exemptions . germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar said he did not categorically oppose the electronic databank .
schaar 's spokesman , dietmar müller , said separately that the extent of the information collected was cause for concern , as it could invite abuse . " in view of the amount of sensitive data and the possible desire to retrieve it , we see a number of data protection provisions which are still open , " müller said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will citizens ' incomes become more transparent ?
müller pointed out that law enforcement agencies could be particularly interested in certain data .
this had been the case , for example , with data from electronic highway tolls , which is now being used to fight terrorism . information on religious belief was particularly sensitive , müller said .
the commissioner would therefore seek to press for this information to remain protected .
germany does not have a formal separation of church and state .
church taxes are withdrawn by people 's employers and passed on to the authorities . employer insight opposition politician hermann otto solms of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said he had fundamental reservations about the databank .
he warned of the " total transparency " it enabled . " a huge , self-contained data pool emerges which is n't necessary for the sole purpose of income tax , " said solms , the fiscal spokesman for the free-market-liberal fdp .
he said opening the file not only to tax authorities , but also to employers was a particularly precarious situation . " it is n't for nothing that in germany there 's fiscal secrecy , which stipulates that only fiscal authorities have the right to access tax data , " solms told the daily hessische / niedersächsische allgemeine on wednesday .
" a huge databank is being created about the working life of each citizen , which is n't protected from outside access . " citizens need privacy assurances the government will also introduce a central taxpayer identification number , with lifelong validity .
at present , the numbers change according to a person 's residence .
this had made it easier for people to evade taxes by moving around . the fiscal spokeswoman from the opposition green party , christine scheel , said the central databank was necessary in order for the new identification numbers to work . " but citizens must have the confidence that their data will not be drawn on further , " scheel said .
the greens therefore were demanding strict specification of how and by whom the data could be used , she said . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 08.08.2007 the strange , but true tale of a communist cowboy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after starring in spaghetti westerns , reed went on to star in eastern westerns a new german documentary , " the red elvis " , tells the extraordinary tale of dean reed from denver , colorado who became a star behind the iron curtain . it 's common knowledge that thousands of people fled communist east germany for the west .
the fact that a few hardy souls traveled in the opposite direction is far less well-known .
the american musician , actor and film director , dean reed was one of them . filmmaker leopold grün , who grew up in east germany , had forgotten about reed until a friend from the west jogged his memory six years ago . " i did n't like his music , so he 'd never really concerned me very much , " grün said .
" it was only when i started looking into his story that i became fascinated because it had so many twists and turns .
i discovered a completely crazy world that i had no idea about . "
the bizarre tale of dean reed has recently reawakened a flurry of interest .
as well as grün 's film - five years in the making and just opening in germany - a biography was published late last year .
us actor tom hanks is currently working on a feature film with steven spielberg about reed 's life with himself in the lead role . new angle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dean reed was an outspoken critic of the us 's war on vietnam leopold grün sees this interest as signs of a need for a change of perspective about the cold war era . " we all know that people fled east germany , " he said .
" but what could someone 's motives have been for going in the opposite direction ? "
called " the red elvis , " grün 's film does not set out to provide a comprehensive or conclusive account of reed 's colorful and chequered life .
the filmmaker is clear : " this is not a biography . "
instead , like a puzzle the documentary pieces together film clips , concert footage and a host of interviews , leaving it to the audience to make up their own mind . not exactly country-western by the time the photogenic reed settled in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , he had already strayed far from his roots .
following a couple of very minor hits in the united states , the singer embarked on a tour of latin america in the early 1960s that was to prove decisive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans have set up a web site dedicated to his memory not only did reed end up at number one on the chilean charts , he witnessed grinding poverty during his travels and forged contacts with the latin american leftist movement , eventually counting salvador allende among his friends .
in " the red elvis , " isabel allende bussi remembers with gratitude reed 's support for her father 's presidential campaign .
" in his performances in chile you can see he is genuine , " grün said .
" the posing began later . "
increasingly critical of us foreign policy , reed moved to latin america .
it was the start of his career as a political activist-cum-entertainer .
he also continued to perform further afield , becoming the first us singer to tour the soviet union where his repertoire of country-western and protest songs together with his screen idol looks took audiences by storm .
in the film , a russian fan , now living in reed 's home town , reverentially recalls how his appearances in russia " were like a holiday for us . "
her memories have a tragic irony .
the singing advocate of socialist policies functioned as a distraction from soviet realities . " we forgot that we were oppressed , " she tells the camera . propaganda coup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his films , the actor cum musician also supported the underdog the us performer 's tours were clearly a coup for soviet authorities .
this did not go unnoticed back home .
in 1972 , in an article dripping with sarcasm , the us magazine newsweek commented : " reed 's success is heavily subsidized by kremlin authorities .
how often do they get an american who looks like apple pie and treads the party line like a trained bear ? " significantly , reed never relinquished his us passport , retaining the right to roam .
one of the most memorable - and disturbing - images in " the red elvis " shows reed in lebanon in the late 1960s , posing with both a gun and a guitar .
in argentina , reed was given his own tv show to host , but was finally deported after his pro-communist stance got too much for the authorities who were wary of upsetting washington .
after building an acting career in spaghetti westerns in italy , he moved to east berlin in 1972 , meeting his second wife-to-be at a film festival in leipzig .
in east germany , reed continued to sing and act , most notably in the blockbuster , east-german western " blutsbrüder " -lrb- blood brothers -rrb- .
here , the showman created a role tailored to his own character - a us soldier who goes over to the other side , joining forces with the underdogs after witnessing a massacre of cheyenne indians . a rising star behind the iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even as a middle aged man , reed continued to play the cowboy at first , the gdr authorities had not been so keen on his staying , according to grün . " they were afraid that he would have an unsettling effect because he was such a showman , but then they realized what a fantastic opportunity he presented , " he said .
" he stood for the right cause and there was no need to manipulate him . " egon krenz , who was later to briefly succeed erich honecker at the top of the east german leadership , has described the relationship between reed and the authorities as a " productive " one , based on " give and take . " but while this closeness to the regime may have secured him a celebrity status that he would never have enjoyed in the united states , it was also to prove his downfall .
his popularity began to ebb , partly because of his failure to take any kind of critical stance in public .
disillusioned cowboy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the popularity of his early years waning , depression set in over the years , reed had also become increasingly disillusioned with the less than heroic nature of everyday life in east germany .
and by the mid 1980s , his third marriage to a leading east german actress was also on the rocks . grün 's film gives little credence to the conspiracy stories that have surrounded his death by drowning , which was reported as a " tragic accident " on east german television .
reed 's long-term mistress and soulmate talks about the suicide pact that they had discussed at their clandestine apartment , still visibly grieving at the fact that he decided to cross this final frontier without her . more than a product of the cold war ?
the 90-minute film creates a subtle , multi-layered image of someone whose public and private personas were riven with contradictions .
while dean reed was , in one sense , very much a product of the cold war , grün said he believes his life story still has relevance today .
" one important goal of mine was to make a film that people could identify with in some way .
the themes that are dealt with are still topical : the palestinian issue , latin america , " he said .

" i did n't like his music , so he 'd never really concerned me very much , " grün said .
" it was only when i started looking into his story that i became fascinated because it had so many twists and turns .
i discovered a completely crazy world that i had no idea about . "
the bizarre tale of dean reed has recently reawakened a flurry of interest .
as well as grün 's film - five years in the making and just opening in germany - a biography was published late last year .
us actor tom hanks is currently working on a feature film with steven spielberg about reed 's life with himself in the lead role . new angle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dean reed was an outspoken critic of the us 's war on vietnam leopold grün sees this interest as signs of a need for a change of perspective about the cold war era . " we all know that people fled east germany , " he said .
" but what could someone 's motives have been for going in the opposite direction ? "
called " the red elvis , " grün 's film does not set out to provide a comprehensive or conclusive account of reed 's colorful and chequered life .
the filmmaker is clear : " this is not a biography . "
instead , like a puzzle the documentary pieces together film clips , concert footage and a host of interviews , leaving it to the audience to make up their own mind . not exactly country-western by the time the photogenic reed settled in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , he had already strayed far from his roots .
following a couple of very minor hits in the united states , the singer embarked on a tour of latin america in the early 1960s that was to prove decisive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans have set up a web site dedicated to his memory not only did reed end up at number one on the chilean charts , he witnessed grinding poverty during his travels and forged contacts with the latin american leftist movement , eventually counting salvador allende among his friends .
in " the red elvis , " isabel allende bussi remembers with gratitude reed 's support for her father 's presidential campaign .
" in his performances in chile you can see he is genuine , " grün said .
" the posing began later . "
increasingly critical of us foreign policy , reed moved to latin america .
it was the start of his career as a political activist-cum-entertainer .
he also continued to perform further afield , becoming the first us singer to tour the soviet union where his repertoire of country-western and protest songs together with his screen idol looks took audiences by storm .
in the film , a russian fan , now living in reed 's home town , reverentially recalls how his appearances in russia " were like a holiday for us . "
her memories have a tragic irony .
the singing advocate of socialist policies functioned as a distraction from soviet realities . " we forgot that we were oppressed , " she tells the camera . propaganda coup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his films , the actor cum musician also supported the underdog the us performer 's tours were clearly a coup for soviet authorities .
this did not go unnoticed back home .
in 1972 , in an article dripping with sarcasm , the us magazine newsweek commented : " reed 's success is heavily subsidized by kremlin authorities .
how often do they get an american who looks like apple pie and treads the party line like a trained bear ? " significantly , reed never relinquished his us passport , retaining the right to roam .
one of the most memorable - and disturbing - images in " the red elvis " shows reed in lebanon in the late 1960s , posing with both a gun and a guitar .
in argentina , reed was given his own tv show to host , but was finally deported after his pro-communist stance got too much for the authorities who were wary of upsetting washington .
after building an acting career in spaghetti westerns in italy , he moved to east berlin in 1972 , meeting his second wife-to-be at a film festival in leipzig .
in east germany , reed continued to sing and act , most notably in the blockbuster , east-german western " blutsbrüder " -lrb- blood brothers -rrb- .
here , the showman created a role tailored to his own character - a us soldier who goes over to the other side , joining forces with the underdogs after witnessing a massacre of cheyenne indians . a rising star behind the iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even as a middle aged man , reed continued to play the cowboy at first , the gdr authorities had not been so keen on his staying , according to grün . " they were afraid that he would have an unsettling effect because he was such a showman , but then they realized what a fantastic opportunity he presented , " he said .
" he stood for the right cause and there was no need to manipulate him . " egon krenz , who was later to briefly succeed erich honecker at the top of the east german leadership , has described the relationship between reed and the authorities as a " productive " one , based on " give and take . " but while this closeness to the regime may have secured him a celebrity status that he would never have enjoyed in the united states , it was also to prove his downfall .
his popularity began to ebb , partly because of his failure to take any kind of critical stance in public .
disillusioned cowboy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the popularity of his early years waning , depression set in over the years , reed had also become increasingly disillusioned with the less than heroic nature of everyday life in east germany .
and by the mid 1980s , his third marriage to a leading east german actress was also on the rocks . grün 's film gives little credence to the conspiracy stories that have surrounded his death by drowning , which was reported as a " tragic accident " on east german television .

the 90-minute film creates a subtle , multi-layered image of someone whose public and private personas were riven with contradictions .
while dean reed was , in one sense , very much a product of the cold war , grün said he believes his life story still has relevance today .
" one important goal of mine was to make a film that people could identify with in some way .

us actor tom hanks is currently working on a feature film with steven spielberg about reed 's life with himself in the lead role . new angle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dean reed was an outspoken critic of the us 's war on vietnam leopold grün sees this interest as signs of a need for a change of perspective about the cold war era . " we all know that people fled east germany , " he said .
" but what could someone 's motives have been for going in the opposite direction ? "
called " the red elvis , " grün 's film does not set out to provide a comprehensive or conclusive account of reed 's colorful and chequered life .
the filmmaker is clear : " this is not a biography . "
instead , like a puzzle the documentary pieces together film clips , concert footage and a host of interviews , leaving it to the audience to make up their own mind . not exactly country-western by the time the photogenic reed settled in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , he had already strayed far from his roots .
following a couple of very minor hits in the united states , the singer embarked on a tour of latin america in the early 1960s that was to prove decisive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans have set up a web site dedicated to his memory not only did reed end up at number one on the chilean charts , he witnessed grinding poverty during his travels and forged contacts with the latin american leftist movement , eventually counting salvador allende among his friends .
in " the red elvis , " isabel allende bussi remembers with gratitude reed 's support for her father 's presidential campaign .
" in his performances in chile you can see he is genuine , " grün said .
" the posing began later . "
increasingly critical of us foreign policy , reed moved to latin america .
it was the start of his career as a political activist-cum-entertainer .
he also continued to perform further afield , becoming the first us singer to tour the soviet union where his repertoire of country-western and protest songs together with his screen idol looks took audiences by storm .
in the film , a russian fan , now living in reed 's home town , reverentially recalls how his appearances in russia " were like a holiday for us . "
her memories have a tragic irony .
the singing advocate of socialist policies functioned as a distraction from soviet realities . " we forgot that we were oppressed , " she tells the camera . propaganda coup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his films , the actor cum musician also supported the underdog the us performer 's tours were clearly a coup for soviet authorities .
this did not go unnoticed back home .
in 1972 , in an article dripping with sarcasm , the us magazine newsweek commented : " reed 's success is heavily subsidized by kremlin authorities .
how often do they get an american who looks like apple pie and treads the party line like a trained bear ? " significantly , reed never relinquished his us passport , retaining the right to roam .
one of the most memorable - and disturbing - images in " the red elvis " shows reed in lebanon in the late 1960s , posing with both a gun and a guitar .
in argentina , reed was given his own tv show to host , but was finally deported after his pro-communist stance got too much for the authorities who were wary of upsetting washington .
after building an acting career in spaghetti westerns in italy , he moved to east berlin in 1972 , meeting his second wife-to-be at a film festival in leipzig .
in east germany , reed continued to sing and act , most notably in the blockbuster , east-german western " blutsbrüder " -lrb- blood brothers -rrb- .
here , the showman created a role tailored to his own character - a us soldier who goes over to the other side , joining forces with the underdogs after witnessing a massacre of cheyenne indians . a rising star behind the iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even as a middle aged man , reed continued to play the cowboy at first , the gdr authorities had not been so keen on his staying , according to grün . " they were afraid that he would have an unsettling effect because he was such a showman , but then they realized what a fantastic opportunity he presented , " he said .
" he stood for the right cause and there was no need to manipulate him . " egon krenz , who was later to briefly succeed erich honecker at the top of the east german leadership , has described the relationship between reed and the authorities as a " productive " one , based on " give and take . " but while this closeness to the regime may have secured him a celebrity status that he would never have enjoyed in the united states , it was also to prove his downfall .
his popularity began to ebb , partly because of his failure to take any kind of critical stance in public .
disillusioned cowboy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the popularity of his early years waning , depression set in over the years , reed had also become increasingly disillusioned with the less than heroic nature of everyday life in east germany .
and by the mid 1980s , his third marriage to a leading east german actress was also on the rocks . grün 's film gives little credence to the conspiracy stories that have surrounded his death by drowning , which was reported as a " tragic accident " on east german television .
reed 's long-term mistress and soulmate talks about the suicide pact that they had discussed at their clandestine apartment , still visibly grieving at the fact that he decided to cross this final frontier without her . more than a product of the cold war ?
the 90-minute film creates a subtle , multi-layered image of someone whose public and private personas were riven with contradictions .
while dean reed was , in one sense , very much a product of the cold war , grün said he believes his life story still has relevance today .
" one important goal of mine was to make a film that people could identify with in some way .
the themes that are dealt with are still topical : the palestinian issue , latin america , " he said .
" in addition to that , it deals with human problems that are not specific to east germany . " julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that sunny outlook is n't reflected in the mood of the nation . after such a long stint in the economic doldrums , much has been made of the recent upturn in consumer spending in germany , improving growth rates and falling joblessness -lrb- 3.7 million in july compared to almost 4.4 million at the same time last year -rrb- . so much so in fact , that some are talking of a second " economic miracle . " reports about a better balanced budget and a new-found joie de spending among the notoriously cautious germans abound .
all of a sudden , the headlines are filled with a refreshingly convincing optimism , which seems to both reflect and spread a growing positive mood .
or is it just wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping is becoming fashionable birgit gebhardt , the managing director of the trendbüro agency for social change , said germany is not out of the woods yet . " after years of national depression , all of a sudden the tide has made a massive turn , and the media claims we 're in the throes of a consumer party , " she said .
" in actual fact , we really are n't at that point yet . " gebhardt added that although germany has managed to vastly improve its competitiveness over recent years and although a booming economy can contribute to reshaping the mood of a nation , germany still has a long way to go . what constitutes happiness ? the allensbach institute for public opinion has been conducting surveys about the happiness of germans since 1945 , when , with so many men killed in the war , women were asked whether they thought they could be happy alone . the question of happiness was raised over and again in subsequent polls until the point at which it became a research subject in its own right .
the most recent survey in the institute 's extensive archive was carried out last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxury holidays are n't what matters to most a cross-section of 1,800 germans from all over the country were interviewed face to face to try and establish what constitutes contemporary happiness .
wilhelm haumann , a project leader at the institute , said a blossoming economy is not the key to human joy . " if we look at how income and how the perception of happiness have changed since 1945 , we see a massive increase in income and absolutely zero change in the number of people who say they feel happy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty remains an unhappy reality on the other hand , however , living below the bread line is a fast track to misery , he added . " while there is no definitive correlation between a strong economy and happiness , there is certainly a relationship between a weak economy and unhappiness , " haumann said .
" sixty percent of interviewees who said they were really unhappy , had financial problems . " money is not the answer so if being able to throw money around is not what makes people smile , what does ? " people like to be able to have the feeling that they are in charge of their own lives , that they can be influential and do n't have to bow to external powers , " haumann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluence does n't equal joy in germany he added that germans have been bound up in a very hierarchical society for so long that they do n't have the freedom of personal autonomy .
being able to organize one 's own life and make decisions at work rather than simply being bossed around contributes greatly to creating a strength of personality , which in turn is a pre-requisite for happiness . " it 's no coincidence that those with the greatest sense of initiative are the happiest , " haumann concludes . all that being the case , the way in which the german labor market is developing must be a good thing .
although there is less security than in bygone days , there is far greater flexibility for both employers and staff , which should promote initiative , thus leading to happiness . happiness through flexibility tanja siegmund , a spokeswoman for the international recruitment agency adecco , said she recently witnessed a shift in the approach to finding work . " the german labor market has traditionally been quite conservative , once people had a job they stayed in it even if they were unhapp , " she said , adding that this is changing . " people are becoming more daring , they are giving up their full-time , secure jobs because they are beginning to understand that they have other possibilities , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employment is the answer siegmund said she believes germany has a lot to learn from countries like holland and the united kingdom where there is a far greater tradition of temporary and part-time work . " it used to have a negative connotation attached to it in germany , but people are beginning to see things differently , " she said . and it seems to be changing right across the employment board . jürgen weber , a freelance television director , agreed that there is a new willingness for people to take chances with their jobs . " there seems to be a new feeling that anything is possible , that if you lose one job , you can find another , " he said , adding that people are prepared to work for less money than in the past and that they seem to have more fun with what they are doing . " the industry is much more dynamic now , the mood is simply better , " he said . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 08.08.2007 despite booming economy , germans not in celebratory mood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forget the economy , it was last year 's world cup that put germans in a sunnier mood business surveys and consumer confidence levels suggest that the german economic motor has roared back to life and is racing towards a bright future .
but that sunny outlook is n't reflected in the mood of the nation . after such a long stint in the economic doldrums , much has been made of the recent upturn in consumer spending in germany , improving growth rates and falling joblessness -lrb- 3.7 million in july compared to almost 4.4 million at the same time last year -rrb- . so much so in fact , that some are talking of a second " economic miracle . " reports about a better balanced budget and a new-found joie de spending among the notoriously cautious germans abound .
all of a sudden , the headlines are filled with a refreshingly convincing optimism , which seems to both reflect and spread a growing positive mood .
or is it just wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping is becoming fashionable birgit gebhardt , the managing director of the trendbüro agency for social change , said germany is not out of the woods yet . " after years of national depression , all of a sudden the tide has made a massive turn , and the media claims we 're in the throes of a consumer party , " she said .
" in actual fact , we really are n't at that point yet . " gebhardt added that although germany has managed to vastly improve its competitiveness over recent years and although a booming economy can contribute to reshaping the mood of a nation , germany still has a long way to go . what constitutes happiness ? the allensbach institute for public opinion has been conducting surveys about the happiness of germans since 1945 , when , with so many men killed in the war , women were asked whether they thought they could be happy alone . the question of happiness was raised over and again in subsequent polls until the point at which it became a research subject in its own right .
the most recent survey in the institute 's extensive archive was carried out last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxury holidays are n't what matters to most a cross-section of 1,800 germans from all over the country were interviewed face to face to try and establish what constitutes contemporary happiness .
wilhelm haumann , a project leader at the institute , said a blossoming economy is not the key to human joy . " if we look at how income and how the perception of happiness have changed since 1945 , we see a massive increase in income and absolutely zero change in the number of people who say they feel happy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty remains an unhappy reality on the other hand , however , living below the bread line is a fast track to misery , he added . " while there is no definitive correlation between a strong economy and happiness , there is certainly a relationship between a weak economy and unhappiness , " haumann said .
" sixty percent of interviewees who said they were really unhappy , had financial problems . " money is not the answer so if being able to throw money around is not what makes people smile , what does ? " people like to be able to have the feeling that they are in charge of their own lives , that they can be influential and do n't have to bow to external powers , " haumann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluence does n't equal joy in germany he added that germans have been bound up in a very hierarchical society for so long that they do n't have the freedom of personal autonomy .
being able to organize one 's own life and make decisions at work rather than simply being bossed around contributes greatly to creating a strength of personality , which in turn is a pre-requisite for happiness . " it 's no coincidence that those with the greatest sense of initiative are the happiest , " haumann concludes . all that being the case , the way in which the german labor market is developing must be a good thing .
although there is less security than in bygone days , there is far greater flexibility for both employers and staff , which should promote initiative , thus leading to happiness . happiness through flexibility tanja siegmund , a spokeswoman for the international recruitment agency adecco , said she recently witnessed a shift in the approach to finding work .

" at the start of the decade , according to us state department polling , 78 percent of germans had a favorable view of the us , " wike said .

five years ago , former chancellor gerhard schöder said " no " to germany 's participation in the war in iraq .
some say schröder merely exploited a public mood , but many agree that anti-americanism has grown . recent studies show that the us-led war in iraq has contributed to a growing negative view of america in germany .
dw-world.de spoke with wolfgang tönnesmann , a political scientist at the atlantic academy - based in kaisterslautern - which aims to foster trans-atlantic ties . dw-world.de : how strong do you think anti-americanism is in germany ? wolfgang tönnesmann : i think it 's there , but it 's hard to separate from the legitimate criticism of the current us administration .
there has always been anti-americanism in germany on both the left and in particular the right , and some people who have disliked the us all along now feel vindicated .
that 's why it 's difficult to say just how strong anti-americanism is right now .
however , when 48 percent of germans think that the us is a greater threat to world peace than iran , that 's cause for concern . how has anti-americanism changed over the years , particularly since former chancellor gerhard schröder said " no " to the war in iraq five years ago ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder said " no " all those years ago gerhard schröder has left office , but the war still goes on with no end in sight .
and as it has turned out , the iraq war was based on false information and manipulation of the public .
even the staunchest supporters of the us have a hard time to explain what happened .
the system of checks and balances , the core of the american constitution that almost every child in germany knows about , has not worked .
that has put germans who like the us very much on the defensive . do you think schröder 's decision against german participation in iraq exacerbated anti-american tendencies already prevalent ? what was the decision really about ? - not to send german soldiers to iraq .
with the benefit of hindsight , we can now say that that was a responsible decision taken in the national interest .
the emotions surrounding it were understandable since it was the first time that the germans said " no . "
again , people with anti-american attitudes felt justified .
others with less well-formed attitudes were drawn to that position .
life at the stammtisch -lsb- the pub table -rsb- became a lot easier when you voiced critical opinions on the us . what do you think about schröder 's decision ? interestingly enough , no one disputes that the decision was right .
but the way it was presented to the public during an election campaign was unfortunate .
that 's why schröder is not given credit for it .
still , i do n't think a german chancellor would say no to a war that our most important ally , the us , wants to conduct simply to further his re-election prospects .
the real failure was that the europeans did not stand together .
that might have prevented the war . was there an inherently anti-american component in it , in other words , did it have a " trickle-down " effect in the german public ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say german chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and bush make a better couple no , the decision not to participate in the iraq war was not inherently anti-american .
after 9/11 , many germans felt sympathy towards the americans .
supporting the americans in afghanistan , as schröder did , was criticized , but people have grasped that germany has to play its role , sometimes including the bundeswehr .
but we do n't think that the problem of terrorism can be solved mainly by killing the terrorists .
we also have to pursue other strategies . how have americans themselves , not just us president george w. bush , contributed to anti-americanism in germany ?
how have they not ? the americans themselves are no better off than many europeans .
they have to rely on what their government tells them .
however , the us now seems to be a polarized country .
when 14 percent of americans believe - as polls at last year 's election showed - that george bush was chosen by god to lead the us in a global war on terrorism , then we might start feeling quite desperate about some americans at the very least .
it 's important that the media play their proper role on both sides of the atlantic presenting the facts and furthering the understanding . in the end , i am confident that the world knows what america stands for : liberalism , openness and compassion . louisa schaefer interviewed wolfgang tönnesmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

five years ago , former chancellor gerhard schöder said " no " to germany 's participation in the war in iraq .
some say schröder merely exploited a public mood , but many agree that anti-americanism has grown . recent studies show that the us-led war in iraq has contributed to a growing negative view of america in germany .
dw-world.de spoke with wolfgang tönnesmann , a political scientist at the atlantic academy - based in kaisterslautern - which aims to foster trans-atlantic ties . dw-world.de : how strong do you think anti-americanism is in germany ? wolfgang tönnesmann : i think it 's there , but it 's hard to separate from the legitimate criticism of the current us administration .

the papers agreed that china needed to do more to ensure human rights . china kicked off its one-year countdown celebrations to the 2008 olympic games on wednesday .
this prompted commentary from german papers on the human rights situation in china .
just on tuesday , chinese police detained six foreign nationals for demonstrating for a free tibet on the great wall . munich 's süddeutsche zeitung wrote that the olympics were a significant bench mark in china 's rapid advancement .
but the government in beijing had underestimated the political burden associated with the games . " beijing 2008 is a sporting , as well as a political event , " the paper wrote .

" as long as china rejects universal human rights standards , this dream will remain unfulfilled . " the daily frankfurter rundschau agreed that the world will call china to account for its actions .
" the olympics are more than just perfect organization and grandiose buildings , " it said .
" if china wants to win the world 's respect , the communist party leaders have to wage more freedom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 08.08.2007 the strange , but true tale of a communist cowboy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after starring in spaghetti westerns , reed went on to star in eastern westerns a new german documentary , " the red elvis " , tells the extraordinary tale of dean reed from denver , colorado who became a star behind the iron curtain . it 's common knowledge that thousands of people fled communist east germany for the west .
the fact that a few hardy souls traveled in the opposite direction is far less well-known .
the american musician , actor and film director , dean reed was one of them . filmmaker leopold grün , who grew up in east germany , had forgotten about reed until a friend from the west jogged his memory six years ago . " i did n't like his music , so he 'd never really concerned me very much , " grün said .
" it was only when i started looking into his story that i became fascinated because it had so many twists and turns .
i discovered a completely crazy world that i had no idea about . "
the bizarre tale of dean reed has recently reawakened a flurry of interest .
as well as grün 's film - five years in the making and just opening in germany - a biography was published late last year .
us actor tom hanks is currently working on a feature film with steven spielberg about reed 's life with himself in the lead role . new angle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dean reed was an outspoken critic of the us 's war on vietnam leopold grün sees this interest as signs of a need for a change of perspective about the cold war era . " we all know that people fled east germany , " he said .
" but what could someone 's motives have been for going in the opposite direction ? "
called " the red elvis , " grün 's film does not set out to provide a comprehensive or conclusive account of reed 's colorful and chequered life .
the filmmaker is clear : " this is not a biography . "
instead , like a puzzle the documentary pieces together film clips , concert footage and a host of interviews , leaving it to the audience to make up their own mind . not exactly country-western by the time the photogenic reed settled in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , he had already strayed far from his roots .
following a couple of very minor hits in the united states , the singer embarked on a tour of latin america in the early 1960s that was to prove decisive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans have set up a web site dedicated to his memory not only did reed end up at number one on the chilean charts , he witnessed grinding poverty during his travels and forged contacts with the latin american leftist movement , eventually counting salvador allende among his friends .
in " the red elvis , " isabel allende bussi remembers with gratitude reed 's support for her father 's presidential campaign .
" in his performances in chile you can see he is genuine , " grün said .
" the posing began later . "
increasingly critical of us foreign policy , reed moved to latin america .
it was the start of his career as a political activist-cum-entertainer .
he also continued to perform further afield , becoming the first us singer to tour the soviet union where his repertoire of country-western and protest songs together with his screen idol looks took audiences by storm .
in the film , a russian fan , now living in reed 's home town , reverentially recalls how his appearances in russia " were like a holiday for us . "
her memories have a tragic irony .
the singing advocate of socialist policies functioned as a distraction from soviet realities . " we forgot that we were oppressed , " she tells the camera . propaganda coup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his films , the actor cum musician also supported the underdog the us performer 's tours were clearly a coup for soviet authorities .
this did not go unnoticed back home .
in 1972 , in an article dripping with sarcasm , the us magazine newsweek commented : " reed 's success is heavily subsidized by kremlin authorities .
how often do they get an american who looks like apple pie and treads the party line like a trained bear ? " significantly , reed never relinquished his us passport , retaining the right to roam .
one of the most memorable - and disturbing - images in " the red elvis " shows reed in lebanon in the late 1960s , posing with both a gun and a guitar .
in argentina , reed was given his own tv show to host , but was finally deported after his pro-communist stance got too much for the authorities who were wary of upsetting washington .
after building an acting career in spaghetti westerns in italy , he moved to east berlin in 1972 , meeting his second wife-to-be at a film festival in leipzig .
in east germany , reed continued to sing and act , most notably in the blockbuster , east-german western " blutsbrüder " -lrb- blood brothers -rrb- .
here , the showman created a role tailored to his own character - a us soldier who goes over to the other side , joining forces with the underdogs after witnessing a massacre of cheyenne indians . a rising star behind the iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even as a middle aged man , reed continued to play the cowboy at first , the gdr authorities had not been so keen on his staying , according to grün . " they were afraid that he would have an unsettling effect because he was such a showman , but then they realized what a fantastic opportunity he presented , " he said .
" he stood for the right cause and there was no need to manipulate him . " egon krenz , who was later to briefly succeed erich honecker at the top of the east german leadership , has described the relationship between reed and the authorities as a " productive " one , based on " give and take . " but while this closeness to the regime may have secured him a celebrity status that he would never have enjoyed in the united states , it was also to prove his downfall .
his popularity began to ebb , partly because of his failure to take any kind of critical stance in public .
disillusioned cowboy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the popularity of his early years waning , depression set in over the years , reed had also become increasingly disillusioned with the less than heroic nature of everyday life in east germany .
and by the mid 1980s , his third marriage to a leading east german actress was also on the rocks . grün 's film gives little credence to the conspiracy stories that have surrounded his death by drowning , which was reported as a " tragic accident " on east german television .
reed 's long-term mistress and soulmate talks about the suicide pact that they had discussed at their clandestine apartment , still visibly grieving at the fact that he decided to cross this final frontier without her . more than a product of the cold war ?
the 90-minute film creates a subtle , multi-layered image of someone whose public and private personas were riven with contradictions .
while dean reed was , in one sense , very much a product of the cold war , grün said he believes his life story still has relevance today .
" one important goal of mine was to make a film that people could identify with in some way .
the themes that are dealt with are still topical : the palestinian issue , latin america , " he said .
" in addition to that , it deals with human problems that are not specific to east germany . " julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say access to the information should be strictly limited . the german cabinet on wednesday approved a bill to extensively change the country 's tax system .
however , plans to establish a central electronic databank of taxpayer information , which is part of the bill , have sparked a debate about privacy guidelines . the federal finance ministry said the electronic databank will lead to less tax fraud and less bureaucracy .
the databank will contain all relevant information necessary for calculating income tax .
this includes data on spouses , children , religion , as well as tax brackets and exemptions . germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar said he did not categorically oppose the electronic databank .
schaar 's spokesman , dietmar müller , said separately that the extent of the information collected was cause for concern , as it could invite abuse .

they say access to the information should be strictly limited . the german cabinet on wednesday approved a bill to extensively change the country 's tax system .
however , plans to establish a central electronic databank of taxpayer information , which is part of the bill , have sparked a debate about privacy guidelines . the federal finance ministry said the electronic databank will lead to less tax fraud and less bureaucracy .
the databank will contain all relevant information necessary for calculating income tax .
this includes data on spouses , children , religion , as well as tax brackets and exemptions . germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar said he did not categorically oppose the electronic databank .
schaar 's spokesman , dietmar müller , said separately that the extent of the information collected was cause for concern , as it could invite abuse . " in view of the amount of sensitive data and the possible desire to retrieve it , we see a number of data protection provisions which are still open , " müller said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will citizens ' incomes become more transparent ?
müller pointed out that law enforcement agencies could be particularly interested in certain data .
this had been the case , for example , with data from electronic highway tolls , which is now being used to fight terrorism . information on religious belief was particularly sensitive , müller said .
the commissioner would therefore seek to press for this information to remain protected .
germany does not have a formal separation of church and state .
church taxes are withdrawn by people 's employers and passed on to the authorities . employer insight opposition politician hermann otto solms of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said he had fundamental reservations about the databank .
he warned of the " total transparency " it enabled . " a huge , self-contained data pool emerges which is n't necessary for the sole purpose of income tax , " said solms , the fiscal spokesman for the free-market-liberal fdp .
he said opening the file not only to tax authorities , but also to employers was a particularly precarious situation . " it is n't for nothing that in germany there 's fiscal secrecy , which stipulates that only fiscal authorities have the right to access tax data , " solms told the daily hessische / niedersächsische allgemeine on wednesday .
" a huge databank is being created about the working life of each citizen , which is n't protected from outside access . " citizens need privacy assurances the government will also introduce a central taxpayer identification number , with lifelong validity .
at present , the numbers change according to a person 's residence .
this had made it easier for people to evade taxes by moving around . the fiscal spokeswoman from the opposition green party , christine scheel , said the central databank was necessary in order for the new identification numbers to work . " but citizens must have the confidence that their data will not be drawn on further , " scheel said .
the greens therefore were demanding strict specification of how and by whom the data could be used , she said . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fact that a few hardy souls traveled in the opposite direction is far less well-known .
the american musician , actor and film director , dean reed was one of them . filmmaker leopold grün , who grew up in east germany , had forgotten about reed until a friend from the west jogged his memory six years ago . " i did n't like his music , so he 'd never really concerned me very much , " grün said .
" it was only when i started looking into his story that i became fascinated because it had so many twists and turns .
i discovered a completely crazy world that i had no idea about . "
the bizarre tale of dean reed has recently reawakened a flurry of interest .
as well as grün 's film - five years in the making and just opening in germany - a biography was published late last year .
us actor tom hanks is currently working on a feature film with steven spielberg about reed 's life with himself in the lead role . new angle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dean reed was an outspoken critic of the us 's war on vietnam leopold grün sees this interest as signs of a need for a change of perspective about the cold war era . " we all know that people fled east germany , " he said .
" but what could someone 's motives have been for going in the opposite direction ? "
called " the red elvis , " grün 's film does not set out to provide a comprehensive or conclusive account of reed 's colorful and chequered life .
the filmmaker is clear : " this is not a biography . "
instead , like a puzzle the documentary pieces together film clips , concert footage and a host of interviews , leaving it to the audience to make up their own mind . not exactly country-western by the time the photogenic reed settled in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , he had already strayed far from his roots .
following a couple of very minor hits in the united states , the singer embarked on a tour of latin america in the early 1960s that was to prove decisive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans have set up a web site dedicated to his memory not only did reed end up at number one on the chilean charts , he witnessed grinding poverty during his travels and forged contacts with the latin american leftist movement , eventually counting salvador allende among his friends .
in " the red elvis , " isabel allende bussi remembers with gratitude reed 's support for her father 's presidential campaign .
" in his performances in chile you can see he is genuine , " grün said .
" the posing began later . "
increasingly critical of us foreign policy , reed moved to latin america .
it was the start of his career as a political activist-cum-entertainer .
he also continued to perform further afield , becoming the first us singer to tour the soviet union where his repertoire of country-western and protest songs together with his screen idol looks took audiences by storm .
in the film , a russian fan , now living in reed 's home town , reverentially recalls how his appearances in russia " were like a holiday for us . "
her memories have a tragic irony .
the singing advocate of socialist policies functioned as a distraction from soviet realities . " we forgot that we were oppressed , " she tells the camera . propaganda coup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his films , the actor cum musician also supported the underdog the us performer 's tours were clearly a coup for soviet authorities .
this did not go unnoticed back home .
in 1972 , in an article dripping with sarcasm , the us magazine newsweek commented : " reed 's success is heavily subsidized by kremlin authorities .
how often do they get an american who looks like apple pie and treads the party line like a trained bear ? " significantly , reed never relinquished his us passport , retaining the right to roam .
one of the most memorable - and disturbing - images in " the red elvis " shows reed in lebanon in the late 1960s , posing with both a gun and a guitar .
in argentina , reed was given his own tv show to host , but was finally deported after his pro-communist stance got too much for the authorities who were wary of upsetting washington .
after building an acting career in spaghetti westerns in italy , he moved to east berlin in 1972 , meeting his second wife-to-be at a film festival in leipzig .
in east germany , reed continued to sing and act , most notably in the blockbuster , east-german western " blutsbrüder " -lrb- blood brothers -rrb- .
here , the showman created a role tailored to his own character - a us soldier who goes over to the other side , joining forces with the underdogs after witnessing a massacre of cheyenne indians . a rising star behind the iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even as a middle aged man , reed continued to play the cowboy at first , the gdr authorities had not been so keen on his staying , according to grün . " they were afraid that he would have an unsettling effect because he was such a showman , but then they realized what a fantastic opportunity he presented , " he said .
" he stood for the right cause and there was no need to manipulate him . " egon krenz , who was later to briefly succeed erich honecker at the top of the east german leadership , has described the relationship between reed and the authorities as a " productive " one , based on " give and take . " but while this closeness to the regime may have secured him a celebrity status that he would never have enjoyed in the united states , it was also to prove his downfall .
his popularity began to ebb , partly because of his failure to take any kind of critical stance in public .
disillusioned cowboy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the popularity of his early years waning , depression set in over the years , reed had also become increasingly disillusioned with the less than heroic nature of everyday life in east germany .
and by the mid 1980s , his third marriage to a leading east german actress was also on the rocks . grün 's film gives little credence to the conspiracy stories that have surrounded his death by drowning , which was reported as a " tragic accident " on east german television .
reed 's long-term mistress and soulmate talks about the suicide pact that they had discussed at their clandestine apartment , still visibly grieving at the fact that he decided to cross this final frontier without her . more than a product of the cold war ?
the 90-minute film creates a subtle , multi-layered image of someone whose public and private personas were riven with contradictions .
while dean reed was , in one sense , very much a product of the cold war , grün said he believes his life story still has relevance today .
" one important goal of mine was to make a film that people could identify with in some way .
the themes that are dealt with are still topical : the palestinian issue , latin america , " he said .

the fact that a few hardy souls traveled in the opposite direction is far less well-known .
the american musician , actor and film director , dean reed was one of them . filmmaker leopold grün , who grew up in east germany , had forgotten about reed until a friend from the west jogged his memory six years ago . " i did n't like his music , so he 'd never really concerned me very much , " grün said .
" it was only when i started looking into his story that i became fascinated because it had so many twists and turns .
i discovered a completely crazy world that i had no idea about . "
the bizarre tale of dean reed has recently reawakened a flurry of interest .
as well as grün 's film - five years in the making and just opening in germany - a biography was published late last year .
us actor tom hanks is currently working on a feature film with steven spielberg about reed 's life with himself in the lead role . new angle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dean reed was an outspoken critic of the us 's war on vietnam leopold grün sees this interest as signs of a need for a change of perspective about the cold war era . " we all know that people fled east germany , " he said .
" but what could someone 's motives have been for going in the opposite direction ? "
called " the red elvis , " grün 's film does not set out to provide a comprehensive or conclusive account of reed 's colorful and chequered life .
the filmmaker is clear : " this is not a biography . "
instead , like a puzzle the documentary pieces together film clips , concert footage and a host of interviews , leaving it to the audience to make up their own mind . not exactly country-western by the time the photogenic reed settled in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , he had already strayed far from his roots .
following a couple of very minor hits in the united states , the singer embarked on a tour of latin america in the early 1960s that was to prove decisive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans have set up a web site dedicated to his memory not only did reed end up at number one on the chilean charts , he witnessed grinding poverty during his travels and forged contacts with the latin american leftist movement , eventually counting salvador allende among his friends .
in " the red elvis , " isabel allende bussi remembers with gratitude reed 's support for her father 's presidential campaign .
" in his performances in chile you can see he is genuine , " grün said .
" the posing began later . "
increasingly critical of us foreign policy , reed moved to latin america .
it was the start of his career as a political activist-cum-entertainer .
he also continued to perform further afield , becoming the first us singer to tour the soviet union where his repertoire of country-western and protest songs together with his screen idol looks took audiences by storm .
in the film , a russian fan , now living in reed 's home town , reverentially recalls how his appearances in russia " were like a holiday for us . "
her memories have a tragic irony .
the singing advocate of socialist policies functioned as a distraction from soviet realities . " we forgot that we were oppressed , " she tells the camera . propaganda coup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his films , the actor cum musician also supported the underdog the us performer 's tours were clearly a coup for soviet authorities .
this did not go unnoticed back home .
in 1972 , in an article dripping with sarcasm , the us magazine newsweek commented : " reed 's success is heavily subsidized by kremlin authorities .
how often do they get an american who looks like apple pie and treads the party line like a trained bear ? " significantly , reed never relinquished his us passport , retaining the right to roam .
one of the most memorable - and disturbing - images in " the red elvis " shows reed in lebanon in the late 1960s , posing with both a gun and a guitar .
in argentina , reed was given his own tv show to host , but was finally deported after his pro-communist stance got too much for the authorities who were wary of upsetting washington .
after building an acting career in spaghetti westerns in italy , he moved to east berlin in 1972 , meeting his second wife-to-be at a film festival in leipzig .
in east germany , reed continued to sing and act , most notably in the blockbuster , east-german western " blutsbrüder " -lrb- blood brothers -rrb- .
here , the showman created a role tailored to his own character - a us soldier who goes over to the other side , joining forces with the underdogs after witnessing a massacre of cheyenne indians . a rising star behind the iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even as a middle aged man , reed continued to play the cowboy at first , the gdr authorities had not been so keen on his staying , according to grün . " they were afraid that he would have an unsettling effect because he was such a showman , but then they realized what a fantastic opportunity he presented , " he said .
" he stood for the right cause and there was no need to manipulate him . " egon krenz , who was later to briefly succeed erich honecker at the top of the east german leadership , has described the relationship between reed and the authorities as a " productive " one , based on " give and take . " but while this closeness to the regime may have secured him a celebrity status that he would never have enjoyed in the united states , it was also to prove his downfall .

" reports about a better balanced budget and a new-found joie de spending among the notoriously cautious germans abound .
all of a sudden , the headlines are filled with a refreshingly convincing optimism , which seems to both reflect and spread a growing positive mood .
or is it just wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping is becoming fashionable birgit gebhardt , the managing director of the trendbüro agency for social change , said germany is not out of the woods yet . " after years of national depression , all of a sudden the tide has made a massive turn , and the media claims we 're in the throes of a consumer party , " she said .
" in actual fact , we really are n't at that point yet . " gebhardt added that although germany has managed to vastly improve its competitiveness over recent years and although a booming economy can contribute to reshaping the mood of a nation , germany still has a long way to go . what constitutes happiness ? the allensbach institute for public opinion has been conducting surveys about the happiness of germans since 1945 , when , with so many men killed in the war , women were asked whether they thought they could be happy alone . the question of happiness was raised over and again in subsequent polls until the point at which it became a research subject in its own right .
the most recent survey in the institute 's extensive archive was carried out last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxury holidays are n't what matters to most a cross-section of 1,800 germans from all over the country were interviewed face to face to try and establish what constitutes contemporary happiness .
wilhelm haumann , a project leader at the institute , said a blossoming economy is not the key to human joy . " if we look at how income and how the perception of happiness have changed since 1945 , we see a massive increase in income and absolutely zero change in the number of people who say they feel happy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty remains an unhappy reality on the other hand , however , living below the bread line is a fast track to misery , he added . " while there is no definitive correlation between a strong economy and happiness , there is certainly a relationship between a weak economy and unhappiness , " haumann said .
" sixty percent of interviewees who said they were really unhappy , had financial problems . " money is not the answer so if being able to throw money around is not what makes people smile , what does ? " people like to be able to have the feeling that they are in charge of their own lives , that they can be influential and do n't have to bow to external powers , " haumann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluence does n't equal joy in germany he added that germans have been bound up in a very hierarchical society for so long that they do n't have the freedom of personal autonomy .
being able to organize one 's own life and make decisions at work rather than simply being bossed around contributes greatly to creating a strength of personality , which in turn is a pre-requisite for happiness . " it 's no coincidence that those with the greatest sense of initiative are the happiest , " haumann concludes . all that being the case , the way in which the german labor market is developing must be a good thing .
although there is less security than in bygone days , there is far greater flexibility for both employers and staff , which should promote initiative , thus leading to happiness . happiness through flexibility tanja siegmund , a spokeswoman for the international recruitment agency adecco , said she recently witnessed a shift in the approach to finding work . " the german labor market has traditionally been quite conservative , once people had a job they stayed in it even if they were unhapp , " she said , adding that this is changing .

but that sunny outlook is n't reflected in the mood of the nation . after such a long stint in the economic doldrums , much has been made of the recent upturn in consumer spending in germany , improving growth rates and falling joblessness -lrb- 3.7 million in july compared to almost 4.4 million at the same time last year -rrb- . so much so in fact , that some are talking of a second " economic miracle . " reports about a better balanced budget and a new-found joie de spending among the notoriously cautious germans abound .
all of a sudden , the headlines are filled with a refreshingly convincing optimism , which seems to both reflect and spread a growing positive mood .
or is it just wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping is becoming fashionable birgit gebhardt , the managing director of the trendbüro agency for social change , said germany is not out of the woods yet . " after years of national depression , all of a sudden the tide has made a massive turn , and the media claims we 're in the throes of a consumer party , " she said .
" in actual fact , we really are n't at that point yet . " gebhardt added that although germany has managed to vastly improve its competitiveness over recent years and although a booming economy can contribute to reshaping the mood of a nation , germany still has a long way to go . what constitutes happiness ? the allensbach institute for public opinion has been conducting surveys about the happiness of germans since 1945 , when , with so many men killed in the war , women were asked whether they thought they could be happy alone . the question of happiness was raised over and again in subsequent polls until the point at which it became a research subject in its own right .
the most recent survey in the institute 's extensive archive was carried out last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxury holidays are n't what matters to most a cross-section of 1,800 germans from all over the country were interviewed face to face to try and establish what constitutes contemporary happiness .
wilhelm haumann , a project leader at the institute , said a blossoming economy is not the key to human joy . " if we look at how income and how the perception of happiness have changed since 1945 , we see a massive increase in income and absolutely zero change in the number of people who say they feel happy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty remains an unhappy reality on the other hand , however , living below the bread line is a fast track to misery , he added . " while there is no definitive correlation between a strong economy and happiness , there is certainly a relationship between a weak economy and unhappiness , " haumann said .
" sixty percent of interviewees who said they were really unhappy , had financial problems . " money is not the answer so if being able to throw money around is not what makes people smile , what does ? " people like to be able to have the feeling that they are in charge of their own lives , that they can be influential and do n't have to bow to external powers , " haumann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluence does n't equal joy in germany he added that germans have been bound up in a very hierarchical society for so long that they do n't have the freedom of personal autonomy .
being able to organize one 's own life and make decisions at work rather than simply being bossed around contributes greatly to creating a strength of personality , which in turn is a pre-requisite for happiness . " it 's no coincidence that those with the greatest sense of initiative are the happiest , " haumann concludes . all that being the case , the way in which the german labor market is developing must be a good thing .
although there is less security than in bygone days , there is far greater flexibility for both employers and staff , which should promote initiative , thus leading to happiness . happiness through flexibility tanja siegmund , a spokeswoman for the international recruitment agency adecco , said she recently witnessed a shift in the approach to finding work . " the german labor market has traditionally been quite conservative , once people had a job they stayed in it even if they were unhapp , " she said , adding that this is changing . " people are becoming more daring , they are giving up their full-time , secure jobs because they are beginning to understand that they have other possibilities , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employment is the answer siegmund said she believes germany has a lot to learn from countries like holland and the united kingdom where there is a far greater tradition of temporary and part-time work . " it used to have a negative connotation attached to it in germany , but people are beginning to see things differently , " she said . and it seems to be changing right across the employment board . jürgen weber , a freelance television director , agreed that there is a new willingness for people to take chances with their jobs . " there seems to be a new feeling that anything is possible , that if you lose one job , you can find another , " he said , adding that people are prepared to work for less money than in the past and that they seem to have more fun with what they are doing . " the industry is much more dynamic now , the mood is simply better , " he said . tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" at the start of the decade , according to us state department polling , 78 percent of germans had a favorable view of the us , " wike said .
" today , according to the latest pew global attitudes survey , only 30 percent have a favorable view , the lowest percentage of any european country included in the survey . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daily life in iraq : oil and explosions other surveys that confirm those findings stress that the current poor image of the us is largely linked to its invasion of iraq in 2003 - a decision which sparked vocal opposition in countries such as germany and france . german weekly magazine stern published a poll this spring , conducted by the forsa institute , which said that 48 percent of germans believe that the united states is " more dangerous for world peace than iran . " manfred güllner , head of the forsa institute , told the online portal stern.de that " since the beginning of the war in iraq , the image of the us as a power that has no qualms about military interventions and which sees itself as the world police has grown . " latent anti-americanism while güllner believes the negative image of the us in germany is linked to the iraq war , others suggest that a " latent " anti-american tendency has always existed in the country . wolfgang tönnesmann , a political scientist at the kaiserslautern-based atlantic academy which aims to foster trans-atlantic dialogue , said that anti-americanism has existed on both sides of the political spectrum in germany . " some people who disliked the us all along now feel vindicated -lsb- because of the war in iraq -rsb- , " tönnesmann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british soldier , and ally , of the us in iraq " germans do n't need american protection anymore -lrb- or so they believe -rrb- , " said alexander höse , a foreign policy expert at the university of cologne .
" america is now just seen as the 300-pound gorilla throwing its weight around ; nobody likes that . "
höse added that differing views among americans and germans on economic and social policies contributed to the problem . blatant anti-americanism others , however , say anti-americanism runs much deeper . andrei markovits , a professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , said not latent , but blatant anti-americanism is prevalent in both europe and germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel -lrb- l -rrb- has eased relations with us president bush " it is a conflicting emotion that is hard to define , a deep-seated resentment on the part of germans and europeans toward america , " said markovits , who has covered the topic extensively in his book " uncouth nation : why europe dislikes america . " he says that anti-americanism is nearly a sport among german intellectuals - an act of rebellion and subversion which flourishes among the educated elite . " europeans do n't like the us because it 's big , brash , uncouth , vulgar , yet quick , " he said .
" then , when it becomes powerful and intervenes in europe like it did throughout the 20th century , which was to many europeans ' benefit , they do n't like it . " markovits also claimed that anti-americanism goes back hundreds of years .
he said that all the constituents for anti-americanism were there " at the latest by july 5 , 1776 . " his explanation : " america represents modernity from the 19th century onward , and anyone who fears modernity associates that fear with america . " latent optimism whether it 's fear of us foreign policy or a deeper-seated sentiment against the world 's superpower , as some suggest , there 's little doubt that ordinary americans are increasingly confronted with prejudices and hostility in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans mock us-german relations at " carnival " " americans have a difficult time here right now , " tönnesmann said .
" students in particular get a lot of questions about what their government is doing , and they have to justify themselves , and occasionally germans show their disrespect or dislike . " americans in germany must not just attempt to justify iraq , but must also address questions about everything from the american penchant for guns , the questionable nature of the death penalty to the lax approach of the nation toward climate protection . to counter the one-sided image , the german-american institute at the university of tübingen has initiated a program called " rent an american , " which arranges for american exchange students to visit local german schools to talk about their view of the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a changing climate in trans-atlantic ties ?
america 's poor image not here to stay experts , however , are optimistic that current perceptions of us policies in europe will not cloud the overriding positive image of america in european minds . in the end , said tönnesmann , " europeans and americans are not that different ; ultimately , they have to rely on what their government tells them . " we can only hope that most people can realize what america really stands for : that is , multilateralism , liberalism , openness , and compassion . " wike of the pew center agreed . " despite their misgivings about the bush administration and its policies , germans still tend to have a positive view of the american people , " he said .
" fully 63 percent say they have a favorable view of americans . " others point out that the same applies to americans looking across the atlantic too .

höse added that differing views among americans and germans on economic and social policies contributed to the problem . blatant anti-americanism others , however , say anti-americanism runs much deeper . andrei markovits , a professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , said not latent , but blatant anti-americanism is prevalent in both europe and germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel -lrb- l -rrb- has eased relations with us president bush " it is a conflicting emotion that is hard to define , a deep-seated resentment on the part of germans and europeans toward america , " said markovits , who has covered the topic extensively in his book " uncouth nation : why europe dislikes america . " he says that anti-americanism is nearly a sport among german intellectuals - an act of rebellion and subversion which flourishes among the educated elite . " europeans do n't like the us because it 's big , brash , uncouth , vulgar , yet quick , " he said .
" then , when it becomes powerful and intervenes in europe like it did throughout the 20th century , which was to many europeans ' benefit , they do n't like it . " markovits also claimed that anti-americanism goes back hundreds of years .
he said that all the constituents for anti-americanism were there " at the latest by july 5 , 1776 . " his explanation : " america represents modernity from the 19th century onward , and anyone who fears modernity associates that fear with america . " latent optimism whether it 's fear of us foreign policy or a deeper-seated sentiment against the world 's superpower , as some suggest , there 's little doubt that ordinary americans are increasingly confronted with prejudices and hostility in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans mock us-german relations at " carnival " " americans have a difficult time here right now , " tönnesmann said .
" students in particular get a lot of questions about what their government is doing , and they have to justify themselves , and occasionally germans show their disrespect or dislike . " americans in germany must not just attempt to justify iraq , but must also address questions about everything from the american penchant for guns , the questionable nature of the death penalty to the lax approach of the nation toward climate protection . to counter the one-sided image , the german-american institute at the university of tübingen has initiated a program called " rent an american , " which arranges for american exchange students to visit local german schools to talk about their view of the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a changing climate in trans-atlantic ties ?
america 's poor image not here to stay experts , however , are optimistic that current perceptions of us policies in europe will not cloud the overriding positive image of america in european minds . in the end , said tönnesmann , " europeans and americans are not that different ; ultimately , they have to rely on what their government tells them . " we can only hope that most people can realize what america really stands for : that is , multilateralism , liberalism , openness , and compassion . " wike of the pew center agreed . " despite their misgivings about the bush administration and its policies , germans still tend to have a positive view of the american people , " he said .
" fully 63 percent say they have a favorable view of americans . " others point out that the same applies to americans looking across the atlantic too .
" the american public wants good german-american relations , " höse said .

five years ago , former chancellor gerhard schöder said " no " to germany 's participation in the war in iraq .
some say schröder merely exploited a public mood , but many agree that anti-americanism has grown . recent studies show that the us-led war in iraq has contributed to a growing negative view of america in germany .
dw-world.de spoke with wolfgang tönnesmann , a political scientist at the atlantic academy - based in kaisterslautern - which aims to foster trans-atlantic ties . dw-world.de : how strong do you think anti-americanism is in germany ? wolfgang tönnesmann : i think it 's there , but it 's hard to separate from the legitimate criticism of the current us administration .
there has always been anti-americanism in germany on both the left and in particular the right , and some people who have disliked the us all along now feel vindicated .
that 's why it 's difficult to say just how strong anti-americanism is right now .
however , when 48 percent of germans think that the us is a greater threat to world peace than iran , that 's cause for concern . how has anti-americanism changed over the years , particularly since former chancellor gerhard schröder said " no " to the war in iraq five years ago ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder said " no " all those years ago gerhard schröder has left office , but the war still goes on with no end in sight .
and as it has turned out , the iraq war was based on false information and manipulation of the public .
even the staunchest supporters of the us have a hard time to explain what happened .
the system of checks and balances , the core of the american constitution that almost every child in germany knows about , has not worked .
that has put germans who like the us very much on the defensive . do you think schröder 's decision against german participation in iraq exacerbated anti-american tendencies already prevalent ? what was the decision really about ? - not to send german soldiers to iraq .
with the benefit of hindsight , we can now say that that was a responsible decision taken in the national interest .
the emotions surrounding it were understandable since it was the first time that the germans said " no . "
again , people with anti-american attitudes felt justified .
others with less well-formed attitudes were drawn to that position .
life at the stammtisch -lsb- the pub table -rsb- became a lot easier when you voiced critical opinions on the us . what do you think about schröder 's decision ? interestingly enough , no one disputes that the decision was right .
but the way it was presented to the public during an election campaign was unfortunate .
that 's why schröder is not given credit for it .
still , i do n't think a german chancellor would say no to a war that our most important ally , the us , wants to conduct simply to further his re-election prospects .
the real failure was that the europeans did not stand together .
that might have prevented the war . was there an inherently anti-american component in it , in other words , did it have a " trickle-down " effect in the german public ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say german chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and bush make a better couple no , the decision not to participate in the iraq war was not inherently anti-american .
after 9/11 , many germans felt sympathy towards the americans .
supporting the americans in afghanistan , as schröder did , was criticized , but people have grasped that germany has to play its role , sometimes including the bundeswehr .
but we do n't think that the problem of terrorism can be solved mainly by killing the terrorists .
we also have to pursue other strategies . how have americans themselves , not just us president george w. bush , contributed to anti-americanism in germany ?
how have they not ? the americans themselves are no better off than many europeans .
they have to rely on what their government tells them .
however , the us now seems to be a polarized country .
when 14 percent of americans believe - as polls at last year 's election showed - that george bush was chosen by god to lead the us in a global war on terrorism , then we might start feeling quite desperate about some americans at the very least .

five years ago , former chancellor gerhard schöder said " no " to germany 's participation in the war in iraq .
some say schröder merely exploited a public mood , but many agree that anti-americanism has grown . recent studies show that the us-led war in iraq has contributed to a growing negative view of america in germany .
dw-world.de spoke with wolfgang tönnesmann , a political scientist at the atlantic academy - based in kaisterslautern - which aims to foster trans-atlantic ties . dw-world.de : how strong do you think anti-americanism is in germany ? wolfgang tönnesmann : i think it 's there , but it 's hard to separate from the legitimate criticism of the current us administration .
there has always been anti-americanism in germany on both the left and in particular the right , and some people who have disliked the us all along now feel vindicated .
that 's why it 's difficult to say just how strong anti-americanism is right now .
however , when 48 percent of germans think that the us is a greater threat to world peace than iran , that 's cause for concern . how has anti-americanism changed over the years , particularly since former chancellor gerhard schröder said " no " to the war in iraq five years ago ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder said " no " all those years ago gerhard schröder has left office , but the war still goes on with no end in sight .
and as it has turned out , the iraq war was based on false information and manipulation of the public .
even the staunchest supporters of the us have a hard time to explain what happened .
the system of checks and balances , the core of the american constitution that almost every child in germany knows about , has not worked .
that has put germans who like the us very much on the defensive . do you think schröder 's decision against german participation in iraq exacerbated anti-american tendencies already prevalent ? what was the decision really about ? - not to send german soldiers to iraq .
with the benefit of hindsight , we can now say that that was a responsible decision taken in the national interest .
the emotions surrounding it were understandable since it was the first time that the germans said " no . "
again , people with anti-american attitudes felt justified .
others with less well-formed attitudes were drawn to that position .
life at the stammtisch -lsb- the pub table -rsb- became a lot easier when you voiced critical opinions on the us . what do you think about schröder 's decision ? interestingly enough , no one disputes that the decision was right .
but the way it was presented to the public during an election campaign was unfortunate .
that 's why schröder is not given credit for it .

subsidies to phase out the mining over the next decade will cost 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion . -rrb- a 200-year tradition will come to an end in europe 's largest economy .
on wednesday , the german government approved phasing out coal mining by 2018 .
germany 's eight coal mines employ approximately 33,000 people .
the phase-out is planned to start in 2009 , with miners receiving government compensation .
" a great , long era is coming to an end in a socially responsible way , " economy minister michael glos said wednesday .
an industry without a future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic coal mining is n't profitable coal mining " has no future " glos said .
for decades , the industry has been heavily subsidized to the tune of more than 160 billion euros , he said .
inexpensive coal from abroad undercuts the expenses associated with heavily-subsidized domestic mining , he said .
seven of the mines are in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia .
one is in saarland , which borders france .
the phase-out will cost the federal and state governments 21.6 billion euros .
the rest of the money will come from a partial privatization of the industry as well as from the energy company rag .
essen-based rag is a group of companies which has chemical , energy and real estate holdings .
the company plans to enter the stock exchange in the spring of 2008 .
rag reached a deal with the unions and the government in february regarding how the phase-out would occur .
leaving some wiggle room bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german coal miners will become an endangered species the head of the mining , chemical and energy industrial union -lrb- ig bce -rrb- , hubertus schmoldt , said the decision was of " historical importance , " and pointed out the phase-out plan could be revised in the future .
the rules contain a clause that allows the phase-out to be reversed if germany is ever faced with power shortages or extremely high prices for other forms of energy .
wednesday 's decision by germany 's cabinet requires parliamentary approval , which is a formality since the government has majorities in both the upper and lower houses . article based on news reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say access to the information should be strictly limited . the german cabinet on wednesday approved a bill to extensively change the country 's tax system .
however , plans to establish a central electronic databank of taxpayer information , which is part of the bill , have sparked a debate about privacy guidelines . the federal finance ministry said the electronic databank will lead to less tax fraud and less bureaucracy .
the databank will contain all relevant information necessary for calculating income tax .

they say access to the information should be strictly limited . the german cabinet on wednesday approved a bill to extensively change the country 's tax system .
however , plans to establish a central electronic databank of taxpayer information , which is part of the bill , have sparked a debate about privacy guidelines . the federal finance ministry said the electronic databank will lead to less tax fraud and less bureaucracy .
the databank will contain all relevant information necessary for calculating income tax .
this includes data on spouses , children , religion , as well as tax brackets and exemptions . germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar said he did not categorically oppose the electronic databank .
schaar 's spokesman , dietmar müller , said separately that the extent of the information collected was cause for concern , as it could invite abuse . " in view of the amount of sensitive data and the possible desire to retrieve it , we see a number of data protection provisions which are still open , " müller said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will citizens ' incomes become more transparent ?
müller pointed out that law enforcement agencies could be particularly interested in certain data .
this had been the case , for example , with data from electronic highway tolls , which is now being used to fight terrorism . information on religious belief was particularly sensitive , müller said .
the commissioner would therefore seek to press for this information to remain protected .
germany does not have a formal separation of church and state .
church taxes are withdrawn by people 's employers and passed on to the authorities . employer insight opposition politician hermann otto solms of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said he had fundamental reservations about the databank .

the fact that a few hardy souls traveled in the opposite direction is far less well-known .
the american musician , actor and film director , dean reed was one of them . filmmaker leopold grün , who grew up in east germany , had forgotten about reed until a friend from the west jogged his memory six years ago . " i did n't like his music , so he 'd never really concerned me very much , " grün said .
" it was only when i started looking into his story that i became fascinated because it had so many twists and turns .
i discovered a completely crazy world that i had no idea about . "
the bizarre tale of dean reed has recently reawakened a flurry of interest .
as well as grün 's film - five years in the making and just opening in germany - a biography was published late last year .
us actor tom hanks is currently working on a feature film with steven spielberg about reed 's life with himself in the lead role . new angle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dean reed was an outspoken critic of the us 's war on vietnam leopold grün sees this interest as signs of a need for a change of perspective about the cold war era . " we all know that people fled east germany , " he said .
" but what could someone 's motives have been for going in the opposite direction ? "
called " the red elvis , " grün 's film does not set out to provide a comprehensive or conclusive account of reed 's colorful and chequered life .
the filmmaker is clear : " this is not a biography . "
instead , like a puzzle the documentary pieces together film clips , concert footage and a host of interviews , leaving it to the audience to make up their own mind . not exactly country-western by the time the photogenic reed settled in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , he had already strayed far from his roots .
following a couple of very minor hits in the united states , the singer embarked on a tour of latin america in the early 1960s that was to prove decisive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans have set up a web site dedicated to his memory not only did reed end up at number one on the chilean charts , he witnessed grinding poverty during his travels and forged contacts with the latin american leftist movement , eventually counting salvador allende among his friends .
in " the red elvis , " isabel allende bussi remembers with gratitude reed 's support for her father 's presidential campaign .
" in his performances in chile you can see he is genuine , " grün said .
" the posing began later . "
increasingly critical of us foreign policy , reed moved to latin america .
it was the start of his career as a political activist-cum-entertainer .
he also continued to perform further afield , becoming the first us singer to tour the soviet union where his repertoire of country-western and protest songs together with his screen idol looks took audiences by storm .
in the film , a russian fan , now living in reed 's home town , reverentially recalls how his appearances in russia " were like a holiday for us . "
her memories have a tragic irony .
the singing advocate of socialist policies functioned as a distraction from soviet realities . " we forgot that we were oppressed , " she tells the camera . propaganda coup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his films , the actor cum musician also supported the underdog the us performer 's tours were clearly a coup for soviet authorities .
this did not go unnoticed back home .
in 1972 , in an article dripping with sarcasm , the us magazine newsweek commented : " reed 's success is heavily subsidized by kremlin authorities .
how often do they get an american who looks like apple pie and treads the party line like a trained bear ? " significantly , reed never relinquished his us passport , retaining the right to roam .
one of the most memorable - and disturbing - images in " the red elvis " shows reed in lebanon in the late 1960s , posing with both a gun and a guitar .
in argentina , reed was given his own tv show to host , but was finally deported after his pro-communist stance got too much for the authorities who were wary of upsetting washington .
after building an acting career in spaghetti westerns in italy , he moved to east berlin in 1972 , meeting his second wife-to-be at a film festival in leipzig .
in east germany , reed continued to sing and act , most notably in the blockbuster , east-german western " blutsbrüder " -lrb- blood brothers -rrb- .
here , the showman created a role tailored to his own character - a us soldier who goes over to the other side , joining forces with the underdogs after witnessing a massacre of cheyenne indians . a rising star behind the iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even as a middle aged man , reed continued to play the cowboy at first , the gdr authorities had not been so keen on his staying , according to grün . " they were afraid that he would have an unsettling effect because he was such a showman , but then they realized what a fantastic opportunity he presented , " he said .
" he stood for the right cause and there was no need to manipulate him . " egon krenz , who was later to briefly succeed erich honecker at the top of the east german leadership , has described the relationship between reed and the authorities as a " productive " one , based on " give and take . " but while this closeness to the regime may have secured him a celebrity status that he would never have enjoyed in the united states , it was also to prove his downfall .
his popularity began to ebb , partly because of his failure to take any kind of critical stance in public .
disillusioned cowboy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the popularity of his early years waning , depression set in over the years , reed had also become increasingly disillusioned with the less than heroic nature of everyday life in east germany .
and by the mid 1980s , his third marriage to a leading east german actress was also on the rocks . grün 's film gives little credence to the conspiracy stories that have surrounded his death by drowning , which was reported as a " tragic accident " on east german television .

the 90-minute film creates a subtle , multi-layered image of someone whose public and private personas were riven with contradictions .
while dean reed was , in one sense , very much a product of the cold war , grün said he believes his life story still has relevance today .
" one important goal of mine was to make a film that people could identify with in some way .

the fact that a few hardy souls traveled in the opposite direction is far less well-known .
the american musician , actor and film director , dean reed was one of them . filmmaker leopold grün , who grew up in east germany , had forgotten about reed until a friend from the west jogged his memory six years ago . " i did n't like his music , so he 'd never really concerned me very much , " grün said .
" it was only when i started looking into his story that i became fascinated because it had so many twists and turns .
i discovered a completely crazy world that i had no idea about . "
the bizarre tale of dean reed has recently reawakened a flurry of interest .
as well as grün 's film - five years in the making and just opening in germany - a biography was published late last year .
us actor tom hanks is currently working on a feature film with steven spielberg about reed 's life with himself in the lead role . new angle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dean reed was an outspoken critic of the us 's war on vietnam leopold grün sees this interest as signs of a need for a change of perspective about the cold war era . " we all know that people fled east germany , " he said .
" but what could someone 's motives have been for going in the opposite direction ? "
called " the red elvis , " grün 's film does not set out to provide a comprehensive or conclusive account of reed 's colorful and chequered life .
the filmmaker is clear : " this is not a biography . "
instead , like a puzzle the documentary pieces together film clips , concert footage and a host of interviews , leaving it to the audience to make up their own mind . not exactly country-western by the time the photogenic reed settled in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , he had already strayed far from his roots .
following a couple of very minor hits in the united states , the singer embarked on a tour of latin america in the early 1960s that was to prove decisive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans have set up a web site dedicated to his memory not only did reed end up at number one on the chilean charts , he witnessed grinding poverty during his travels and forged contacts with the latin american leftist movement , eventually counting salvador allende among his friends .
in " the red elvis , " isabel allende bussi remembers with gratitude reed 's support for her father 's presidential campaign .
" in his performances in chile you can see he is genuine , " grün said .
" the posing began later . "
increasingly critical of us foreign policy , reed moved to latin america .
it was the start of his career as a political activist-cum-entertainer .
he also continued to perform further afield , becoming the first us singer to tour the soviet union where his repertoire of country-western and protest songs together with his screen idol looks took audiences by storm .
in the film , a russian fan , now living in reed 's home town , reverentially recalls how his appearances in russia " were like a holiday for us . "
her memories have a tragic irony .
the singing advocate of socialist policies functioned as a distraction from soviet realities . " we forgot that we were oppressed , " she tells the camera . propaganda coup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his films , the actor cum musician also supported the underdog the us performer 's tours were clearly a coup for soviet authorities .
this did not go unnoticed back home .
in 1972 , in an article dripping with sarcasm , the us magazine newsweek commented : " reed 's success is heavily subsidized by kremlin authorities .
how often do they get an american who looks like apple pie and treads the party line like a trained bear ? " significantly , reed never relinquished his us passport , retaining the right to roam .
one of the most memorable - and disturbing - images in " the red elvis " shows reed in lebanon in the late 1960s , posing with both a gun and a guitar .
in argentina , reed was given his own tv show to host , but was finally deported after his pro-communist stance got too much for the authorities who were wary of upsetting washington .
after building an acting career in spaghetti westerns in italy , he moved to east berlin in 1972 , meeting his second wife-to-be at a film festival in leipzig .
in east germany , reed continued to sing and act , most notably in the blockbuster , east-german western " blutsbrüder " -lrb- blood brothers -rrb- .
here , the showman created a role tailored to his own character - a us soldier who goes over to the other side , joining forces with the underdogs after witnessing a massacre of cheyenne indians . a rising star behind the iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even as a middle aged man , reed continued to play the cowboy at first , the gdr authorities had not been so keen on his staying , according to grün . " they were afraid that he would have an unsettling effect because he was such a showman , but then they realized what a fantastic opportunity he presented , " he said .
" he stood for the right cause and there was no need to manipulate him . " egon krenz , who was later to briefly succeed erich honecker at the top of the east german leadership , has described the relationship between reed and the authorities as a " productive " one , based on " give and take . " but while this closeness to the regime may have secured him a celebrity status that he would never have enjoyed in the united states , it was also to prove his downfall .
his popularity began to ebb , partly because of his failure to take any kind of critical stance in public .
disillusioned cowboy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the popularity of his early years waning , depression set in over the years , reed had also become increasingly disillusioned with the less than heroic nature of everyday life in east germany .
and by the mid 1980s , his third marriage to a leading east german actress was also on the rocks . grün 's film gives little credence to the conspiracy stories that have surrounded his death by drowning , which was reported as a " tragic accident " on east german television .
reed 's long-term mistress and soulmate talks about the suicide pact that they had discussed at their clandestine apartment , still visibly grieving at the fact that he decided to cross this final frontier without her . more than a product of the cold war ?
the 90-minute film creates a subtle , multi-layered image of someone whose public and private personas were riven with contradictions .
while dean reed was , in one sense , very much a product of the cold war , grün said he believes his life story still has relevance today .
" one important goal of mine was to make a film that people could identify with in some way .
the themes that are dealt with are still topical : the palestinian issue , latin america , " he said .

the fact that a few hardy souls traveled in the opposite direction is far less well-known .
the american musician , actor and film director , dean reed was one of them . filmmaker leopold grün , who grew up in east germany , had forgotten about reed until a friend from the west jogged his memory six years ago . " i did n't like his music , so he 'd never really concerned me very much , " grün said .
" it was only when i started looking into his story that i became fascinated because it had so many twists and turns .
i discovered a completely crazy world that i had no idea about . "
the bizarre tale of dean reed has recently reawakened a flurry of interest .
as well as grün 's film - five years in the making and just opening in germany - a biography was published late last year .
us actor tom hanks is currently working on a feature film with steven spielberg about reed 's life with himself in the lead role . new angle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dean reed was an outspoken critic of the us 's war on vietnam leopold grün sees this interest as signs of a need for a change of perspective about the cold war era . " we all know that people fled east germany , " he said .
" but what could someone 's motives have been for going in the opposite direction ? "
called " the red elvis , " grün 's film does not set out to provide a comprehensive or conclusive account of reed 's colorful and chequered life .
the filmmaker is clear : " this is not a biography . "
instead , like a puzzle the documentary pieces together film clips , concert footage and a host of interviews , leaving it to the audience to make up their own mind . not exactly country-western by the time the photogenic reed settled in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , he had already strayed far from his roots .
following a couple of very minor hits in the united states , the singer embarked on a tour of latin america in the early 1960s that was to prove decisive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans have set up a web site dedicated to his memory not only did reed end up at number one on the chilean charts , he witnessed grinding poverty during his travels and forged contacts with the latin american leftist movement , eventually counting salvador allende among his friends .
in " the red elvis , " isabel allende bussi remembers with gratitude reed 's support for her father 's presidential campaign .
" in his performances in chile you can see he is genuine , " grün said .
" the posing began later . "
increasingly critical of us foreign policy , reed moved to latin america .
it was the start of his career as a political activist-cum-entertainer .
he also continued to perform further afield , becoming the first us singer to tour the soviet union where his repertoire of country-western and protest songs together with his screen idol looks took audiences by storm .
in the film , a russian fan , now living in reed 's home town , reverentially recalls how his appearances in russia " were like a holiday for us . "
her memories have a tragic irony .
the singing advocate of socialist policies functioned as a distraction from soviet realities . " we forgot that we were oppressed , " she tells the camera . propaganda coup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his films , the actor cum musician also supported the underdog the us performer 's tours were clearly a coup for soviet authorities .
this did not go unnoticed back home .
in 1972 , in an article dripping with sarcasm , the us magazine newsweek commented : " reed 's success is heavily subsidized by kremlin authorities .
how often do they get an american who looks like apple pie and treads the party line like a trained bear ? " significantly , reed never relinquished his us passport , retaining the right to roam .
one of the most memorable - and disturbing - images in " the red elvis " shows reed in lebanon in the late 1960s , posing with both a gun and a guitar .
in argentina , reed was given his own tv show to host , but was finally deported after his pro-communist stance got too much for the authorities who were wary of upsetting washington .
after building an acting career in spaghetti westerns in italy , he moved to east berlin in 1972 , meeting his second wife-to-be at a film festival in leipzig .
in east germany , reed continued to sing and act , most notably in the blockbuster , east-german western " blutsbrüder " -lrb- blood brothers -rrb- .
here , the showman created a role tailored to his own character - a us soldier who goes over to the other side , joining forces with the underdogs after witnessing a massacre of cheyenne indians . a rising star behind the iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even as a middle aged man , reed continued to play the cowboy at first , the gdr authorities had not been so keen on his staying , according to grün . " they were afraid that he would have an unsettling effect because he was such a showman , but then they realized what a fantastic opportunity he presented , " he said .
" he stood for the right cause and there was no need to manipulate him . " egon krenz , who was later to briefly succeed erich honecker at the top of the east german leadership , has described the relationship between reed and the authorities as a " productive " one , based on " give and take . " but while this closeness to the regime may have secured him a celebrity status that he would never have enjoyed in the united states , it was also to prove his downfall .
his popularity began to ebb , partly because of his failure to take any kind of critical stance in public .
disillusioned cowboy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the popularity of his early years waning , depression set in over the years , reed had also become increasingly disillusioned with the less than heroic nature of everyday life in east germany .
and by the mid 1980s , his third marriage to a leading east german actress was also on the rocks . grün 's film gives little credence to the conspiracy stories that have surrounded his death by drowning , which was reported as a " tragic accident " on east german television .
reed 's long-term mistress and soulmate talks about the suicide pact that they had discussed at their clandestine apartment , still visibly grieving at the fact that he decided to cross this final frontier without her . more than a product of the cold war ?
the 90-minute film creates a subtle , multi-layered image of someone whose public and private personas were riven with contradictions .
while dean reed was , in one sense , very much a product of the cold war , grün said he believes his life story still has relevance today .
" one important goal of mine was to make a film that people could identify with in some way .
the themes that are dealt with are still topical : the palestinian issue , latin america , " he said .
" in addition to that , it deals with human problems that are not specific to east germany . " julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the papers agreed that china needed to do more to ensure human rights . china kicked off its one-year countdown celebrations to the 2008 olympic games on wednesday .
this prompted commentary from german papers on the human rights situation in china .
just on tuesday , chinese police detained six foreign nationals for demonstrating for a free tibet on the great wall . munich 's süddeutsche zeitung wrote that the olympics were a significant bench mark in china 's rapid advancement .
but the government in beijing had underestimated the political burden associated with the games . " beijing 2008 is a sporting , as well as a political event , " the paper wrote .
" it was the chinese government itself which gave the games their political character through an excess of national ambition during the application phase and the promise to heed human rights more strongly . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reporters without borders have protested against china 's lack of media freedom china wanted to act and be respected as a world power - but without the associated political and moral responsibility .
" someone who travels to zimbabwe with a checkbook and supports the dictator there , someone who accepts the genocide in sudan for the sake of much-loved oil , someone who operates internment camps at home , censures and randomly arrests can not expect undivided affection and can also not refer to the olympic peace , " the daily commented . the 2008 olympic games could be a turning point for china 's image abroad , as their success would n't only be decided in the stadiums and cash boxes , wrote handelsblatt .
" whether the people 's republic manages to develop a modern image is dependent on how it deals with its critics , " the düsseldorf business daily said .
but the results were still bleak , it added .
aids activists were being harassed , foreign press restricted and dissidents banned to labor camps . " the government in beijing is fatally wrong if it believes that it can relay the image of a clean china by muzzling disagreeable journalists , forced resettlers and dissidents , " it commented .
" as long as china rejects universal human rights standards , this dream will remain unfulfilled . " the daily frankfurter rundschau agreed that the world will call china to account for its actions .
" the olympics are more than just perfect organization and grandiose buildings , " it said .

the papers agreed that china needed to do more to ensure human rights . china kicked off its one-year countdown celebrations to the 2008 olympic games on wednesday .
this prompted commentary from german papers on the human rights situation in china .
just on tuesday , chinese police detained six foreign nationals for demonstrating for a free tibet on the great wall . munich 's süddeutsche zeitung wrote that the olympics were a significant bench mark in china 's rapid advancement .
but the government in beijing had underestimated the political burden associated with the games . " beijing 2008 is a sporting , as well as a political event , " the paper wrote .
" it was the chinese government itself which gave the games their political character through an excess of national ambition during the application phase and the promise to heed human rights more strongly .

aids activists were being harassed , foreign press restricted and dissidents banned to labor camps . " the government in beijing is fatally wrong if it believes that it can relay the image of a clean china by muzzling disagreeable journalists , forced resettlers and dissidents , " it commented .

just on tuesday , chinese police detained six foreign nationals for demonstrating for a free tibet on the great wall . munich 's süddeutsche zeitung wrote that the olympics were a significant bench mark in china 's rapid advancement .
but the government in beijing had underestimated the political burden associated with the games . " beijing 2008 is a sporting , as well as a political event , " the paper wrote .
" it was the chinese government itself which gave the games their political character through an excess of national ambition during the application phase and the promise to heed human rights more strongly . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reporters without borders have protested against china 's lack of media freedom china wanted to act and be respected as a world power - but without the associated political and moral responsibility .
" someone who travels to zimbabwe with a checkbook and supports the dictator there , someone who accepts the genocide in sudan for the sake of much-loved oil , someone who operates internment camps at home , censures and randomly arrests can not expect undivided affection and can also not refer to the olympic peace , " the daily commented . the 2008 olympic games could be a turning point for china 's image abroad , as their success would n't only be decided in the stadiums and cash boxes , wrote handelsblatt .
" whether the people 's republic manages to develop a modern image is dependent on how it deals with its critics , " the düsseldorf business daily said .
but the results were still bleak , it added .
aids activists were being harassed , foreign press restricted and dissidents banned to labor camps . " the government in beijing is fatally wrong if it believes that it can relay the image of a clean china by muzzling disagreeable journalists , forced resettlers and dissidents , " it commented .
" as long as china rejects universal human rights standards , this dream will remain unfulfilled . " the daily frankfurter rundschau agreed that the world will call china to account for its actions .
" the olympics are more than just perfect organization and grandiose buildings , " it said .
" if china wants to win the world 's respect , the communist party leaders have to wage more freedom .
this is the only way the olympic games will be a success . " according to business daily financial times deutschland , the games should be seen as an opportunity for the west to influence china .
" the ultimate goal of this major event for china is organizing the perfect show and delivering the image of a modern , open-minded country , " the hamburg-based paper wrote . foreign countries should take advantage of this historical opportunity to influence china , but should n't overexcite this leverage , it said .
" a rapprochement between the far east and the west is always more valuable than a china , which is offended and seals itself off after the games . " yet western democracies should n't allow themselves to be degraded to extras in the game of chinese self-promotion , the badische neueste nachrichten warned .
at the same time , the west should n't destroy the unifying idea of sport by being " merciless spoilsports . " " it may be a tightrope walk , " the karlsruhe daily wrote .
" but when in doubt , backbone and clear words can help more than coy strategies to demand human rights and make public violations of the elementary rules of living together .

" reports about a better balanced budget and a new-found joie de spending among the notoriously cautious germans abound .
all of a sudden , the headlines are filled with a refreshingly convincing optimism , which seems to both reflect and spread a growing positive mood .
or is it just wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping is becoming fashionable birgit gebhardt , the managing director of the trendbüro agency for social change , said germany is not out of the woods yet . " after years of national depression , all of a sudden the tide has made a massive turn , and the media claims we 're in the throes of a consumer party , " she said .
" in actual fact , we really are n't at that point yet . " gebhardt added that although germany has managed to vastly improve its competitiveness over recent years and although a booming economy can contribute to reshaping the mood of a nation , germany still has a long way to go . what constitutes happiness ? the allensbach institute for public opinion has been conducting surveys about the happiness of germans since 1945 , when , with so many men killed in the war , women were asked whether they thought they could be happy alone . the question of happiness was raised over and again in subsequent polls until the point at which it became a research subject in its own right .
the most recent survey in the institute 's extensive archive was carried out last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxury holidays are n't what matters to most a cross-section of 1,800 germans from all over the country were interviewed face to face to try and establish what constitutes contemporary happiness .
wilhelm haumann , a project leader at the institute , said a blossoming economy is not the key to human joy . " if we look at how income and how the perception of happiness have changed since 1945 , we see a massive increase in income and absolutely zero change in the number of people who say they feel happy , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty remains an unhappy reality on the other hand , however , living below the bread line is a fast track to misery , he added . " while there is no definitive correlation between a strong economy and happiness , there is certainly a relationship between a weak economy and unhappiness , " haumann said .
" sixty percent of interviewees who said they were really unhappy , had financial problems . " money is not the answer so if being able to throw money around is not what makes people smile , what does ? " people like to be able to have the feeling that they are in charge of their own lives , that they can be influential and do n't have to bow to external powers , " haumann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : affluence does n't equal joy in germany he added that germans have been bound up in a very hierarchical society for so long that they do n't have the freedom of personal autonomy .
being able to organize one 's own life and make decisions at work rather than simply being bossed around contributes greatly to creating a strength of personality , which in turn is a pre-requisite for happiness . " it 's no coincidence that those with the greatest sense of initiative are the happiest , " haumann concludes . all that being the case , the way in which the german labor market is developing must be a good thing .
although there is less security than in bygone days , there is far greater flexibility for both employers and staff , which should promote initiative , thus leading to happiness . happiness through flexibility tanja siegmund , a spokeswoman for the international recruitment agency adecco , said she recently witnessed a shift in the approach to finding work . " the german labor market has traditionally been quite conservative , once people had a job they stayed in it even if they were unhapp , " she said , adding that this is changing .

they say access to the information should be strictly limited . the german cabinet on wednesday approved a bill to extensively change the country 's tax system .
however , plans to establish a central electronic databank of taxpayer information , which is part of the bill , have sparked a debate about privacy guidelines . the federal finance ministry said the electronic databank will lead to less tax fraud and less bureaucracy .
the databank will contain all relevant information necessary for calculating income tax .
this includes data on spouses , children , religion , as well as tax brackets and exemptions . germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar said he did not categorically oppose the electronic databank .
schaar 's spokesman , dietmar müller , said separately that the extent of the information collected was cause for concern , as it could invite abuse . " in view of the amount of sensitive data and the possible desire to retrieve it , we see a number of data protection provisions which are still open , " müller said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will citizens ' incomes become more transparent ?
müller pointed out that law enforcement agencies could be particularly interested in certain data .
this had been the case , for example , with data from electronic highway tolls , which is now being used to fight terrorism . information on religious belief was particularly sensitive , müller said .
the commissioner would therefore seek to press for this information to remain protected .

he said opening the file not only to tax authorities , but also to employers was a particularly precarious situation . " it is n't for nothing that in germany there 's fiscal secrecy , which stipulates that only fiscal authorities have the right to access tax data , " solms told the daily hessische / niedersächsische allgemeine on wednesday .
" a huge databank is being created about the working life of each citizen , which is n't protected from outside access . " citizens need privacy assurances the government will also introduce a central taxpayer identification number , with lifelong validity .

they say access to the information should be strictly limited . the german cabinet on wednesday approved a bill to extensively change the country 's tax system .
however , plans to establish a central electronic databank of taxpayer information , which is part of the bill , have sparked a debate about privacy guidelines . the federal finance ministry said the electronic databank will lead to less tax fraud and less bureaucracy .
the databank will contain all relevant information necessary for calculating income tax .
this includes data on spouses , children , religion , as well as tax brackets and exemptions . germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar said he did not categorically oppose the electronic databank .
schaar 's spokesman , dietmar müller , said separately that the extent of the information collected was cause for concern , as it could invite abuse . " in view of the amount of sensitive data and the possible desire to retrieve it , we see a number of data protection provisions which are still open , " müller said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will citizens ' incomes become more transparent ?
müller pointed out that law enforcement agencies could be particularly interested in certain data .
this had been the case , for example , with data from electronic highway tolls , which is now being used to fight terrorism . information on religious belief was particularly sensitive , müller said .
the commissioner would therefore seek to press for this information to remain protected .
germany does not have a formal separation of church and state .
church taxes are withdrawn by people 's employers and passed on to the authorities . employer insight opposition politician hermann otto solms of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said he had fundamental reservations about the databank .
he warned of the " total transparency " it enabled . " a huge , self-contained data pool emerges which is n't necessary for the sole purpose of income tax , " said solms , the fiscal spokesman for the free-market-liberal fdp .
he said opening the file not only to tax authorities , but also to employers was a particularly precarious situation . " it is n't for nothing that in germany there 's fiscal secrecy , which stipulates that only fiscal authorities have the right to access tax data , " solms told the daily hessische / niedersächsische allgemeine on wednesday .
" a huge databank is being created about the working life of each citizen , which is n't protected from outside access . " citizens need privacy assurances the government will also introduce a central taxpayer identification number , with lifelong validity .
at present , the numbers change according to a person 's residence .
this had made it easier for people to evade taxes by moving around . the fiscal spokeswoman from the opposition green party , christine scheel , said the central databank was necessary in order for the new identification numbers to work . " but citizens must have the confidence that their data will not be drawn on further , " scheel said .
the greens therefore were demanding strict specification of how and by whom the data could be used , she said . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

subsidies to phase out the mining over the next decade will cost 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion . -rrb- a 200-year tradition will come to an end in europe 's largest economy .
on wednesday , the german government approved phasing out coal mining by 2018 .
germany 's eight coal mines employ approximately 33,000 people .
the phase-out is planned to start in 2009 , with miners receiving government compensation .
" a great , long era is coming to an end in a socially responsible way , " economy minister michael glos said wednesday .
an industry without a future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : domestic coal mining is n't profitable coal mining " has no future " glos said .
for decades , the industry has been heavily subsidized to the tune of more than 160 billion euros , he said .
inexpensive coal from abroad undercuts the expenses associated with heavily-subsidized domestic mining , he said .
seven of the mines are in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia .
one is in saarland , which borders france .
the phase-out will cost the federal and state governments 21.6 billion euros .
the rest of the money will come from a partial privatization of the industry as well as from the energy company rag .
essen-based rag is a group of companies which has chemical , energy and real estate holdings .
the company plans to enter the stock exchange in the spring of 2008 .

the rules contain a clause that allows the phase-out to be reversed if germany is ever faced with power shortages or extremely high prices for other forms of energy .

" at the start of the decade , according to us state department polling , 78 percent of germans had a favorable view of the us , " wike said .
" today , according to the latest pew global attitudes survey , only 30 percent have a favorable view , the lowest percentage of any european country included in the survey . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daily life in iraq : oil and explosions other surveys that confirm those findings stress that the current poor image of the us is largely linked to its invasion of iraq in 2003 - a decision which sparked vocal opposition in countries such as germany and france . german weekly magazine stern published a poll this spring , conducted by the forsa institute , which said that 48 percent of germans believe that the united states is " more dangerous for world peace than iran . " manfred güllner , head of the forsa institute , told the online portal stern.de that " since the beginning of the war in iraq , the image of the us as a power that has no qualms about military interventions and which sees itself as the world police has grown . " latent anti-americanism while güllner believes the negative image of the us in germany is linked to the iraq war , others suggest that a " latent " anti-american tendency has always existed in the country . wolfgang tönnesmann , a political scientist at the kaiserslautern-based atlantic academy which aims to foster trans-atlantic dialogue , said that anti-americanism has existed on both sides of the political spectrum in germany . " some people who disliked the us all along now feel vindicated -lsb- because of the war in iraq -rsb- , " tönnesmann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british soldier , and ally , of the us in iraq " germans do n't need american protection anymore -lrb- or so they believe -rrb- , " said alexander höse , a foreign policy expert at the university of cologne .
" america is now just seen as the 300-pound gorilla throwing its weight around ; nobody likes that . "
höse added that differing views among americans and germans on economic and social policies contributed to the problem . blatant anti-americanism others , however , say anti-americanism runs much deeper . andrei markovits , a professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , said not latent , but blatant anti-americanism is prevalent in both europe and germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel -lrb- l -rrb- has eased relations with us president bush " it is a conflicting emotion that is hard to define , a deep-seated resentment on the part of germans and europeans toward america , " said markovits , who has covered the topic extensively in his book " uncouth nation : why europe dislikes america . " he says that anti-americanism is nearly a sport among german intellectuals - an act of rebellion and subversion which flourishes among the educated elite . " europeans do n't like the us because it 's big , brash , uncouth , vulgar , yet quick , " he said .
" then , when it becomes powerful and intervenes in europe like it did throughout the 20th century , which was to many europeans ' benefit , they do n't like it . " markovits also claimed that anti-americanism goes back hundreds of years .
he said that all the constituents for anti-americanism were there " at the latest by july 5 , 1776 . " his explanation : " america represents modernity from the 19th century onward , and anyone who fears modernity associates that fear with america . " latent optimism whether it 's fear of us foreign policy or a deeper-seated sentiment against the world 's superpower , as some suggest , there 's little doubt that ordinary americans are increasingly confronted with prejudices and hostility in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans mock us-german relations at " carnival " " americans have a difficult time here right now , " tönnesmann said .
" students in particular get a lot of questions about what their government is doing , and they have to justify themselves , and occasionally germans show their disrespect or dislike . " americans in germany must not just attempt to justify iraq , but must also address questions about everything from the american penchant for guns , the questionable nature of the death penalty to the lax approach of the nation toward climate protection . to counter the one-sided image , the german-american institute at the university of tübingen has initiated a program called " rent an american , " which arranges for american exchange students to visit local german schools to talk about their view of the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a changing climate in trans-atlantic ties ?
america 's poor image not here to stay experts , however , are optimistic that current perceptions of us policies in europe will not cloud the overriding positive image of america in european minds . in the end , said tönnesmann , " europeans and americans are not that different ; ultimately , they have to rely on what their government tells them . " we can only hope that most people can realize what america really stands for : that is , multilateralism , liberalism , openness , and compassion . " wike of the pew center agreed . " despite their misgivings about the bush administration and its policies , germans still tend to have a positive view of the american people , " he said .
" fully 63 percent say they have a favorable view of americans . " others point out that the same applies to americans looking across the atlantic too .
" the american public wants good german-american relations , " höse said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 08.08.2007 despite booming economy , germans not in celebratory mood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forget the economy , it was last year 's world cup that put germans in a sunnier mood business surveys and consumer confidence levels suggest that the german economic motor has roared back to life and is racing towards a bright future .
but that sunny outlook is n't reflected in the mood of the nation . after such a long stint in the economic doldrums , much has been made of the recent upturn in consumer spending in germany , improving growth rates and falling joblessness -lrb- 3.7 million in july compared to almost 4.4 million at the same time last year -rrb- . so much so in fact , that some are talking of a second " economic miracle . " reports about a better balanced budget and a new-found joie de spending among the notoriously cautious germans abound .
all of a sudden , the headlines are filled with a refreshingly convincing optimism , which seems to both reflect and spread a growing positive mood .
or is it just wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping is becoming fashionable birgit gebhardt , the managing director of the trendbüro agency for social change , said germany is not out of the woods yet . " after years of national depression , all of a sudden the tide has made a massive turn , and the media claims we 're in the throes of a consumer party , " she said .
" in actual fact , we really are n't at that point yet . " gebhardt added that although germany has managed to vastly improve its competitiveness over recent years and although a booming economy can contribute to reshaping the mood of a nation , germany still has a long way to go . what constitutes happiness ? the allensbach institute for public opinion has been conducting surveys about the happiness of germans since 1945 , when , with so many men killed in the war , women were asked whether they thought they could be happy alone . the question of happiness was raised over and again in subsequent polls until the point at which it became a research subject in its own right .
the most recent survey in the institute 's extensive archive was carried out last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxury holidays are n't what matters to most a cross-section of 1,800 germans from all over the country were interviewed face to face to try and establish what constitutes contemporary happiness .
wilhelm haumann , a project leader at the institute , said a blossoming economy is not the key to human joy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 08.08.2007 the strange , but true tale of a communist cowboy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after starring in spaghetti westerns , reed went on to star in eastern westerns a new german documentary , " the red elvis " , tells the extraordinary tale of dean reed from denver , colorado who became a star behind the iron curtain . it 's common knowledge that thousands of people fled communist east germany for the west .
the fact that a few hardy souls traveled in the opposite direction is far less well-known .
the american musician , actor and film director , dean reed was one of them . filmmaker leopold grün , who grew up in east germany , had forgotten about reed until a friend from the west jogged his memory six years ago . " i did n't like his music , so he 'd never really concerned me very much , " grün said .
" it was only when i started looking into his story that i became fascinated because it had so many twists and turns .
i discovered a completely crazy world that i had no idea about . "
the bizarre tale of dean reed has recently reawakened a flurry of interest .
as well as grün 's film - five years in the making and just opening in germany - a biography was published late last year .
us actor tom hanks is currently working on a feature film with steven spielberg about reed 's life with himself in the lead role . new angle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dean reed was an outspoken critic of the us 's war on vietnam leopold grün sees this interest as signs of a need for a change of perspective about the cold war era . " we all know that people fled east germany , " he said .
" but what could someone 's motives have been for going in the opposite direction ? "
called " the red elvis , " grün 's film does not set out to provide a comprehensive or conclusive account of reed 's colorful and chequered life .
the filmmaker is clear : " this is not a biography . "
instead , like a puzzle the documentary pieces together film clips , concert footage and a host of interviews , leaving it to the audience to make up their own mind . not exactly country-western by the time the photogenic reed settled in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , he had already strayed far from his roots .
following a couple of very minor hits in the united states , the singer embarked on a tour of latin america in the early 1960s that was to prove decisive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans have set up a web site dedicated to his memory not only did reed end up at number one on the chilean charts , he witnessed grinding poverty during his travels and forged contacts with the latin american leftist movement , eventually counting salvador allende among his friends .
in " the red elvis , " isabel allende bussi remembers with gratitude reed 's support for her father 's presidential campaign .
" in his performances in chile you can see he is genuine , " grün said .
" the posing began later . "
increasingly critical of us foreign policy , reed moved to latin america .
it was the start of his career as a political activist-cum-entertainer .
he also continued to perform further afield , becoming the first us singer to tour the soviet union where his repertoire of country-western and protest songs together with his screen idol looks took audiences by storm .
in the film , a russian fan , now living in reed 's home town , reverentially recalls how his appearances in russia " were like a holiday for us . "
her memories have a tragic irony .
the singing advocate of socialist policies functioned as a distraction from soviet realities . " we forgot that we were oppressed , " she tells the camera . propaganda coup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his films , the actor cum musician also supported the underdog the us performer 's tours were clearly a coup for soviet authorities .
this did not go unnoticed back home .
in 1972 , in an article dripping with sarcasm , the us magazine newsweek commented : " reed 's success is heavily subsidized by kremlin authorities .
how often do they get an american who looks like apple pie and treads the party line like a trained bear ? " significantly , reed never relinquished his us passport , retaining the right to roam .
one of the most memorable - and disturbing - images in " the red elvis " shows reed in lebanon in the late 1960s , posing with both a gun and a guitar .
in argentina , reed was given his own tv show to host , but was finally deported after his pro-communist stance got too much for the authorities who were wary of upsetting washington .
after building an acting career in spaghetti westerns in italy , he moved to east berlin in 1972 , meeting his second wife-to-be at a film festival in leipzig .
in east germany , reed continued to sing and act , most notably in the blockbuster , east-german western " blutsbrüder " -lrb- blood brothers -rrb- .
here , the showman created a role tailored to his own character - a us soldier who goes over to the other side , joining forces with the underdogs after witnessing a massacre of cheyenne indians . a rising star behind the iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even as a middle aged man , reed continued to play the cowboy at first , the gdr authorities had not been so keen on his staying , according to grün . " they were afraid that he would have an unsettling effect because he was such a showman , but then they realized what a fantastic opportunity he presented , " he said .
" he stood for the right cause and there was no need to manipulate him . " egon krenz , who was later to briefly succeed erich honecker at the top of the east german leadership , has described the relationship between reed and the authorities as a " productive " one , based on " give and take . " but while this closeness to the regime may have secured him a celebrity status that he would never have enjoyed in the united states , it was also to prove his downfall .
his popularity began to ebb , partly because of his failure to take any kind of critical stance in public .
disillusioned cowboy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the popularity of his early years waning , depression set in over the years , reed had also become increasingly disillusioned with the less than heroic nature of everyday life in east germany .
and by the mid 1980s , his third marriage to a leading east german actress was also on the rocks . grün 's film gives little credence to the conspiracy stories that have surrounded his death by drowning , which was reported as a " tragic accident " on east german television .
reed 's long-term mistress and soulmate talks about the suicide pact that they had discussed at their clandestine apartment , still visibly grieving at the fact that he decided to cross this final frontier without her . more than a product of the cold war ?
the 90-minute film creates a subtle , multi-layered image of someone whose public and private personas were riven with contradictions .
while dean reed was , in one sense , very much a product of the cold war , grün said he believes his life story still has relevance today .
" one important goal of mine was to make a film that people could identify with in some way .
the themes that are dealt with are still topical : the palestinian issue , latin america , " he said .
" in addition to that , it deals with human problems that are not specific to east germany . " julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fact that a few hardy souls traveled in the opposite direction is far less well-known .
the american musician , actor and film director , dean reed was one of them . filmmaker leopold grün , who grew up in east germany , had forgotten about reed until a friend from the west jogged his memory six years ago . " i did n't like his music , so he 'd never really concerned me very much , " grün said .
" it was only when i started looking into his story that i became fascinated because it had so many twists and turns .
i discovered a completely crazy world that i had no idea about . "
the bizarre tale of dean reed has recently reawakened a flurry of interest .
as well as grün 's film - five years in the making and just opening in germany - a biography was published late last year .
us actor tom hanks is currently working on a feature film with steven spielberg about reed 's life with himself in the lead role . new angle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dean reed was an outspoken critic of the us 's war on vietnam leopold grün sees this interest as signs of a need for a change of perspective about the cold war era . " we all know that people fled east germany , " he said .
" but what could someone 's motives have been for going in the opposite direction ? "
called " the red elvis , " grün 's film does not set out to provide a comprehensive or conclusive account of reed 's colorful and chequered life .
the filmmaker is clear : " this is not a biography . "
instead , like a puzzle the documentary pieces together film clips , concert footage and a host of interviews , leaving it to the audience to make up their own mind . not exactly country-western by the time the photogenic reed settled in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , he had already strayed far from his roots .
following a couple of very minor hits in the united states , the singer embarked on a tour of latin america in the early 1960s that was to prove decisive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans have set up a web site dedicated to his memory not only did reed end up at number one on the chilean charts , he witnessed grinding poverty during his travels and forged contacts with the latin american leftist movement , eventually counting salvador allende among his friends .
in " the red elvis , " isabel allende bussi remembers with gratitude reed 's support for her father 's presidential campaign .
" in his performances in chile you can see he is genuine , " grün said .
" the posing began later . "
increasingly critical of us foreign policy , reed moved to latin america .
it was the start of his career as a political activist-cum-entertainer .
he also continued to perform further afield , becoming the first us singer to tour the soviet union where his repertoire of country-western and protest songs together with his screen idol looks took audiences by storm .
in the film , a russian fan , now living in reed 's home town , reverentially recalls how his appearances in russia " were like a holiday for us . "
her memories have a tragic irony .
the singing advocate of socialist policies functioned as a distraction from soviet realities . " we forgot that we were oppressed , " she tells the camera . propaganda coup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his films , the actor cum musician also supported the underdog the us performer 's tours were clearly a coup for soviet authorities .
this did not go unnoticed back home .
in 1972 , in an article dripping with sarcasm , the us magazine newsweek commented : " reed 's success is heavily subsidized by kremlin authorities .
how often do they get an american who looks like apple pie and treads the party line like a trained bear ? " significantly , reed never relinquished his us passport , retaining the right to roam .
one of the most memorable - and disturbing - images in " the red elvis " shows reed in lebanon in the late 1960s , posing with both a gun and a guitar .
in argentina , reed was given his own tv show to host , but was finally deported after his pro-communist stance got too much for the authorities who were wary of upsetting washington .
after building an acting career in spaghetti westerns in italy , he moved to east berlin in 1972 , meeting his second wife-to-be at a film festival in leipzig .
in east germany , reed continued to sing and act , most notably in the blockbuster , east-german western " blutsbrüder " -lrb- blood brothers -rrb- .
here , the showman created a role tailored to his own character - a us soldier who goes over to the other side , joining forces with the underdogs after witnessing a massacre of cheyenne indians . a rising star behind the iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even as a middle aged man , reed continued to play the cowboy at first , the gdr authorities had not been so keen on his staying , according to grün . " they were afraid that he would have an unsettling effect because he was such a showman , but then they realized what a fantastic opportunity he presented , " he said .
" he stood for the right cause and there was no need to manipulate him . " egon krenz , who was later to briefly succeed erich honecker at the top of the east german leadership , has described the relationship between reed and the authorities as a " productive " one , based on " give and take . " but while this closeness to the regime may have secured him a celebrity status that he would never have enjoyed in the united states , it was also to prove his downfall .
his popularity began to ebb , partly because of his failure to take any kind of critical stance in public .
disillusioned cowboy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the popularity of his early years waning , depression set in over the years , reed had also become increasingly disillusioned with the less than heroic nature of everyday life in east germany .
and by the mid 1980s , his third marriage to a leading east german actress was also on the rocks . grün 's film gives little credence to the conspiracy stories that have surrounded his death by drowning , which was reported as a " tragic accident " on east german television .
reed 's long-term mistress and soulmate talks about the suicide pact that they had discussed at their clandestine apartment , still visibly grieving at the fact that he decided to cross this final frontier without her . more than a product of the cold war ?
the 90-minute film creates a subtle , multi-layered image of someone whose public and private personas were riven with contradictions .
while dean reed was , in one sense , very much a product of the cold war , grün said he believes his life story still has relevance today .
" one important goal of mine was to make a film that people could identify with in some way .
the themes that are dealt with are still topical : the palestinian issue , latin america , " he said .

they say access to the information should be strictly limited . the german cabinet on wednesday approved a bill to extensively change the country 's tax system .
however , plans to establish a central electronic databank of taxpayer information , which is part of the bill , have sparked a debate about privacy guidelines . the federal finance ministry said the electronic databank will lead to less tax fraud and less bureaucracy .
the databank will contain all relevant information necessary for calculating income tax .
this includes data on spouses , children , religion , as well as tax brackets and exemptions . germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar said he did not categorically oppose the electronic databank .
schaar 's spokesman , dietmar müller , said separately that the extent of the information collected was cause for concern , as it could invite abuse . " in view of the amount of sensitive data and the possible desire to retrieve it , we see a number of data protection provisions which are still open , " müller said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will citizens ' incomes become more transparent ?
müller pointed out that law enforcement agencies could be particularly interested in certain data .
this had been the case , for example , with data from electronic highway tolls , which is now being used to fight terrorism . information on religious belief was particularly sensitive , müller said .
the commissioner would therefore seek to press for this information to remain protected .
germany does not have a formal separation of church and state .
church taxes are withdrawn by people 's employers and passed on to the authorities . employer insight opposition politician hermann otto solms of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said he had fundamental reservations about the databank .
he warned of the " total transparency " it enabled . " a huge , self-contained data pool emerges which is n't necessary for the sole purpose of income tax , " said solms , the fiscal spokesman for the free-market-liberal fdp .
he said opening the file not only to tax authorities , but also to employers was a particularly precarious situation . " it is n't for nothing that in germany there 's fiscal secrecy , which stipulates that only fiscal authorities have the right to access tax data , " solms told the daily hessische / niedersächsische allgemeine on wednesday .
" a huge databank is being created about the working life of each citizen , which is n't protected from outside access . " citizens need privacy assurances the government will also introduce a central taxpayer identification number , with lifelong validity .
at present , the numbers change according to a person 's residence .
this had made it easier for people to evade taxes by moving around . the fiscal spokeswoman from the opposition green party , christine scheel , said the central databank was necessary in order for the new identification numbers to work . " but citizens must have the confidence that their data will not be drawn on further , " scheel said .

they say access to the information should be strictly limited . the german cabinet on wednesday approved a bill to extensively change the country 's tax system .
however , plans to establish a central electronic databank of taxpayer information , which is part of the bill , have sparked a debate about privacy guidelines . the federal finance ministry said the electronic databank will lead to less tax fraud and less bureaucracy .
the databank will contain all relevant information necessary for calculating income tax .
this includes data on spouses , children , religion , as well as tax brackets and exemptions . germany 's data protection commissioner , peter schaar said he did not categorically oppose the electronic databank .
schaar 's spokesman , dietmar müller , said separately that the extent of the information collected was cause for concern , as it could invite abuse . " in view of the amount of sensitive data and the possible desire to retrieve it , we see a number of data protection provisions which are still open , " müller said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will citizens ' incomes become more transparent ?
müller pointed out that law enforcement agencies could be particularly interested in certain data .
this had been the case , for example , with data from electronic highway tolls , which is now being used to fight terrorism . information on religious belief was particularly sensitive , müller said .
the commissioner would therefore seek to press for this information to remain protected .
germany does not have a formal separation of church and state .
church taxes are withdrawn by people 's employers and passed on to the authorities . employer insight opposition politician hermann otto solms of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- said he had fundamental reservations about the databank .
he warned of the " total transparency " it enabled . " a huge , self-contained data pool emerges which is n't necessary for the sole purpose of income tax , " said solms , the fiscal spokesman for the free-market-liberal fdp .
he said opening the file not only to tax authorities , but also to employers was a particularly precarious situation . " it is n't for nothing that in germany there 's fiscal secrecy , which stipulates that only fiscal authorities have the right to access tax data , " solms told the daily hessische / niedersächsische allgemeine on wednesday .
" a huge databank is being created about the working life of each citizen , which is n't protected from outside access . " citizens need privacy assurances the government will also introduce a central taxpayer identification number , with lifelong validity .
at present , the numbers change according to a person 's residence .
this had made it easier for people to evade taxes by moving around . the fiscal spokeswoman from the opposition green party , christine scheel , said the central databank was necessary in order for the new identification numbers to work . " but citizens must have the confidence that their data will not be drawn on further , " scheel said .
the greens therefore were demanding strict specification of how and by whom the data could be used , she said . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

five years ago , former chancellor gerhard schöder said " no " to germany 's participation in the war in iraq .
some say schröder merely exploited a public mood , but many agree that anti-americanism has grown . recent studies show that the us-led war in iraq has contributed to a growing negative view of america in germany .
dw-world.de spoke with wolfgang tönnesmann , a political scientist at the atlantic academy - based in kaisterslautern - which aims to foster trans-atlantic ties . dw-world.de : how strong do you think anti-americanism is in germany ? wolfgang tönnesmann : i think it 's there , but it 's hard to separate from the legitimate criticism of the current us administration .
there has always been anti-americanism in germany on both the left and in particular the right , and some people who have disliked the us all along now feel vindicated .
that 's why it 's difficult to say just how strong anti-americanism is right now .
however , when 48 percent of germans think that the us is a greater threat to world peace than iran , that 's cause for concern . how has anti-americanism changed over the years , particularly since former chancellor gerhard schröder said " no " to the war in iraq five years ago ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor schröder said " no " all those years ago gerhard schröder has left office , but the war still goes on with no end in sight .
and as it has turned out , the iraq war was based on false information and manipulation of the public .
even the staunchest supporters of the us have a hard time to explain what happened .
the system of checks and balances , the core of the american constitution that almost every child in germany knows about , has not worked .
that has put germans who like the us very much on the defensive . do you think schröder 's decision against german participation in iraq exacerbated anti-american tendencies already prevalent ? what was the decision really about ? - not to send german soldiers to iraq .
with the benefit of hindsight , we can now say that that was a responsible decision taken in the national interest .
the emotions surrounding it were understandable since it was the first time that the germans said " no . "
again , people with anti-american attitudes felt justified .
others with less well-formed attitudes were drawn to that position .
life at the stammtisch -lsb- the pub table -rsb- became a lot easier when you voiced critical opinions on the us . what do you think about schröder 's decision ? interestingly enough , no one disputes that the decision was right .
but the way it was presented to the public during an election campaign was unfortunate .
that 's why schröder is not given credit for it .
still , i do n't think a german chancellor would say no to a war that our most important ally , the us , wants to conduct simply to further his re-election prospects .
the real failure was that the europeans did not stand together .
that might have prevented the war . was there an inherently anti-american component in it , in other words , did it have a " trickle-down " effect in the german public ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say german chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and bush make a better couple no , the decision not to participate in the iraq war was not inherently anti-american .
after 9/11 , many germans felt sympathy towards the americans .
supporting the americans in afghanistan , as schröder did , was criticized , but people have grasped that germany has to play its role , sometimes including the bundeswehr .
but we do n't think that the problem of terrorism can be solved mainly by killing the terrorists .
we also have to pursue other strategies . how have americans themselves , not just us president george w. bush , contributed to anti-americanism in germany ?
how have they not ? the americans themselves are no better off than many europeans .
they have to rely on what their government tells them .
however , the us now seems to be a polarized country .
when 14 percent of americans believe - as polls at last year 's election showed - that george bush was chosen by god to lead the us in a global war on terrorism , then we might start feeling quite desperate about some americans at the very least .
it 's important that the media play their proper role on both sides of the atlantic presenting the facts and furthering the understanding . in the end , i am confident that the world knows what america stands for : liberalism , openness and compassion . louisa schaefer interviewed wolfgang tönnesmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with the benefit of hindsight , we can now say that that was a responsible decision taken in the national interest .
the emotions surrounding it were understandable since it was the first time that the germans said " no . "
again , people with anti-american attitudes felt justified .
others with less well-formed attitudes were drawn to that position .
life at the stammtisch -lsb- the pub table -rsb- became a lot easier when you voiced critical opinions on the us . what do you think about schröder 's decision ? interestingly enough , no one disputes that the decision was right .
but the way it was presented to the public during an election campaign was unfortunate .
that 's why schröder is not given credit for it .
still , i do n't think a german chancellor would say no to a war that our most important ally , the us , wants to conduct simply to further his re-election prospects .
the real failure was that the europeans did not stand together .
that might have prevented the war . was there an inherently anti-american component in it , in other words , did it have a " trickle-down " effect in the german public ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say german chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and bush make a better couple no , the decision not to participate in the iraq war was not inherently anti-american .
after 9/11 , many germans felt sympathy towards the americans .
supporting the americans in afghanistan , as schröder did , was criticized , but people have grasped that germany has to play its role , sometimes including the bundeswehr .
but we do n't think that the problem of terrorism can be solved mainly by killing the terrorists .
we also have to pursue other strategies . how have americans themselves , not just us president george w. bush , contributed to anti-americanism in germany ?
how have they not ? the americans themselves are no better off than many europeans .
they have to rely on what their government tells them .
however , the us now seems to be a polarized country .
when 14 percent of americans believe - as polls at last year 's election showed - that george bush was chosen by god to lead the us in a global war on terrorism , then we might start feeling quite desperate about some americans at the very least .
it 's important that the media play their proper role on both sides of the atlantic presenting the facts and furthering the understanding . in the end , i am confident that the world knows what america stands for : liberalism , openness and compassion . louisa schaefer interviewed wolfgang tönnesmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 08.08.2007 surveys show us image plummeting in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : america 's image has taken a beating in large parts of the world five years after former german chancellor schröder refused to join the us in its invasion of iraq , surveys show that the continuing bloody conflict there has contributed to a growing negative view of america in germany . in its latest poll gauging how the us is viewed by other nations , the washington-based pew research center says that over the past five years , america 's image has plummeted throughout much of the world , including sharp drops in favorability among traditional allies in western europe . richard wike , senior researcher at the pew center , said that " favorable views " of the united states in germany have nosedived . " at the start of the decade , according to us state department polling , 78 percent of germans had a favorable view of the us , " wike said .
" today , according to the latest pew global attitudes survey , only 30 percent have a favorable view , the lowest percentage of any european country included in the survey . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daily life in iraq : oil and explosions other surveys that confirm those findings stress that the current poor image of the us is largely linked to its invasion of iraq in 2003 - a decision which sparked vocal opposition in countries such as germany and france . german weekly magazine stern published a poll this spring , conducted by the forsa institute , which said that 48 percent of germans believe that the united states is " more dangerous for world peace than iran . " manfred güllner , head of the forsa institute , told the online portal stern.de that " since the beginning of the war in iraq , the image of the us as a power that has no qualms about military interventions and which sees itself as the world police has grown . " latent anti-americanism while güllner believes the negative image of the us in germany is linked to the iraq war , others suggest that a " latent " anti-american tendency has always existed in the country . wolfgang tönnesmann , a political scientist at the kaiserslautern-based atlantic academy which aims to foster trans-atlantic dialogue , said that anti-americanism has existed on both sides of the political spectrum in germany . " some people who disliked the us all along now feel vindicated -lsb- because of the war in iraq -rsb- , " tönnesmann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british soldier , and ally , of the us in iraq " germans do n't need american protection anymore -lrb- or so they believe -rrb- , " said alexander höse , a foreign policy expert at the university of cologne .
" america is now just seen as the 300-pound gorilla throwing its weight around ; nobody likes that . "
höse added that differing views among americans and germans on economic and social policies contributed to the problem . blatant anti-americanism others , however , say anti-americanism runs much deeper . andrei markovits , a professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , said not latent , but blatant anti-americanism is prevalent in both europe and germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel -lrb- l -rrb- has eased relations with us president bush " it is a conflicting emotion that is hard to define , a deep-seated resentment on the part of germans and europeans toward america , " said markovits , who has covered the topic extensively in his book " uncouth nation : why europe dislikes america . " he says that anti-americanism is nearly a sport among german intellectuals - an act of rebellion and subversion which flourishes among the educated elite . " europeans do n't like the us because it 's big , brash , uncouth , vulgar , yet quick , " he said .
" then , when it becomes powerful and intervenes in europe like it did throughout the 20th century , which was to many europeans ' benefit , they do n't like it . " markovits also claimed that anti-americanism goes back hundreds of years .
he said that all the constituents for anti-americanism were there " at the latest by july 5 , 1776 . " his explanation : " america represents modernity from the 19th century onward , and anyone who fears modernity associates that fear with america . " latent optimism whether it 's fear of us foreign policy or a deeper-seated sentiment against the world 's superpower , as some suggest , there 's little doubt that ordinary americans are increasingly confronted with prejudices and hostility in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans mock us-german relations at " carnival " " americans have a difficult time here right now , " tönnesmann said .
" students in particular get a lot of questions about what their government is doing , and they have to justify themselves , and occasionally germans show their disrespect or dislike . " americans in germany must not just attempt to justify iraq , but must also address questions about everything from the american penchant for guns , the questionable nature of the death penalty to the lax approach of the nation toward climate protection . to counter the one-sided image , the german-american institute at the university of tübingen has initiated a program called " rent an american , " which arranges for american exchange students to visit local german schools to talk about their view of the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a changing climate in trans-atlantic ties ?
america 's poor image not here to stay experts , however , are optimistic that current perceptions of us policies in europe will not cloud the overriding positive image of america in european minds . in the end , said tönnesmann , " europeans and americans are not that different ; ultimately , they have to rely on what their government tells them . " we can only hope that most people can realize what america really stands for : that is , multilateralism , liberalism , openness , and compassion . " wike of the pew center agreed . " despite their misgivings about the bush administration and its policies , germans still tend to have a positive view of the american people , " he said .
" fully 63 percent say they have a favorable view of americans . " others point out that the same applies to americans looking across the atlantic too .
" the american public wants good german-american relations , " höse said .

" at the start of the decade , according to us state department polling , 78 percent of germans had a favorable view of the us , " wike said .
" today , according to the latest pew global attitudes survey , only 30 percent have a favorable view , the lowest percentage of any european country included in the survey . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daily life in iraq : oil and explosions other surveys that confirm those findings stress that the current poor image of the us is largely linked to its invasion of iraq in 2003 - a decision which sparked vocal opposition in countries such as germany and france . german weekly magazine stern published a poll this spring , conducted by the forsa institute , which said that 48 percent of germans believe that the united states is " more dangerous for world peace than iran . " manfred güllner , head of the forsa institute , told the online portal stern.de that " since the beginning of the war in iraq , the image of the us as a power that has no qualms about military interventions and which sees itself as the world police has grown . " latent anti-americanism while güllner believes the negative image of the us in germany is linked to the iraq war , others suggest that a " latent " anti-american tendency has always existed in the country . wolfgang tönnesmann , a political scientist at the kaiserslautern-based atlantic academy which aims to foster trans-atlantic dialogue , said that anti-americanism has existed on both sides of the political spectrum in germany . " some people who disliked the us all along now feel vindicated -lsb- because of the war in iraq -rsb- , " tönnesmann said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a british soldier , and ally , of the us in iraq " germans do n't need american protection anymore -lrb- or so they believe -rrb- , " said alexander höse , a foreign policy expert at the university of cologne .
" america is now just seen as the 300-pound gorilla throwing its weight around ; nobody likes that . "
höse added that differing views among americans and germans on economic and social policies contributed to the problem . blatant anti-americanism others , however , say anti-americanism runs much deeper . andrei markovits , a professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , said not latent , but blatant anti-americanism is prevalent in both europe and germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel -lrb- l -rrb- has eased relations with us president bush " it is a conflicting emotion that is hard to define , a deep-seated resentment on the part of germans and europeans toward america , " said markovits , who has covered the topic extensively in his book " uncouth nation : why europe dislikes america . " he says that anti-americanism is nearly a sport among german intellectuals - an act of rebellion and subversion which flourishes among the educated elite . " europeans do n't like the us because it 's big , brash , uncouth , vulgar , yet quick , " he said .
" then , when it becomes powerful and intervenes in europe like it did throughout the 20th century , which was to many europeans ' benefit , they do n't like it . " markovits also claimed that anti-americanism goes back hundreds of years .
he said that all the constituents for anti-americanism were there " at the latest by july 5 , 1776 . " his explanation : " america represents modernity from the 19th century onward , and anyone who fears modernity associates that fear with america . " latent optimism whether it 's fear of us foreign policy or a deeper-seated sentiment against the world 's superpower , as some suggest , there 's little doubt that ordinary americans are increasingly confronted with prejudices and hostility in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans mock us-german relations at " carnival " " americans have a difficult time here right now , " tönnesmann said .
" students in particular get a lot of questions about what their government is doing , and they have to justify themselves , and occasionally germans show their disrespect or dislike . " americans in germany must not just attempt to justify iraq , but must also address questions about everything from the american penchant for guns , the questionable nature of the death penalty to the lax approach of the nation toward climate protection . to counter the one-sided image , the german-american institute at the university of tübingen has initiated a program called " rent an american , " which arranges for american exchange students to visit local german schools to talk about their view of the us . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a changing climate in trans-atlantic ties ?
america 's poor image not here to stay experts , however , are optimistic that current perceptions of us policies in europe will not cloud the overriding positive image of america in european minds . in the end , said tönnesmann , " europeans and americans are not that different ; ultimately , they have to rely on what their government tells them . " we can only hope that most people can realize what america really stands for : that is , multilateralism , liberalism , openness , and compassion . " wike of the pew center agreed . " despite their misgivings about the bush administration and its policies , germans still tend to have a positive view of the american people , " he said .
" fully 63 percent say they have a favorable view of americans . " others point out that the same applies to americans looking across the atlantic too .
" the american public wants good german-american relations , " höse said .

football promotes enthusiasm and a feeling of community .
so mel young and some associates formed a plan in 2001 : to stage a football world championship for the homeless . since 2003 , the homeless world cup has not just become reality it has become a phenomenal success .
sportswear manufacturer nike , the european fooball association uefa , and even the united nations provide support .
professional teams like manchester united and real madrid have sponsored players from their countries .
mel young is now the " fifa-präsident " of homeless football .
" 100 million people are homeless around the world , " he says .
" we have to integrate them back in society .
football can make them heroes again : " our reporter patrick benning met mel young in his home city , edinburgh , and accompanied him to the homeless worldcup 2007 , which ran until august 4 in copenhagen . - bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mel young always has something to talk about with the people who sell " the big issue " they are all homeless and each sale brings them seventy pence .
this successful project is now in operation throughout scotland .
it was founded back in 1993 by mel young : " primarily it 's a job .
so the homeless now they have a job and have an income and making a way in the world . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david duke used to sell newspapers on the street .
now he 's a coach for a very special football club .
the scottish team is practising in glasgow for the homeless worldcup also a brainchild of mel young that was founded in 2002 .
david 's life took a major turn in 2004 : " a few personal things happened , which made me start drinking and stuff which forced me out of my flat .
that 's why i became homeless .
once i 'd seen the advertisment for the homeless worldcup things started to look up so i eventually got selected for the scottish team .
after various trial processes i went over to sweden , had a great time .
so i completely changed : attitude , and self respect and awareness and stuff . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : football – a remedy for people who seem to have reached a seemingly dead end ?
mel young explains : " all we are doing is providing a platform here : a pitch , a coach , some goals , a ball and we invented this international competition and see what 's up to you . ...
look , what they 've raised !
three thousand pounds ! "
it ’ s donations for a homeless team from afghanistan .
the teams depend on donations , because they have no funds of their own .
a great task for an even greater cause – mel youngs cause : " entrepreneurs want to make money and social entrepreneurs want to change the world so therefore an entrepreneur gets all excited about big profit and a big car and everything like that .
a social entrepreneur gets very excited about the outcome of the change .
that 's what moves me – and my profit is seeing change in front of my eyes . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danish capital copenhagen is hosting the 2007 homeless worldcup .
denmark versus scotland .
mel young would n't miss this match for the world .
team denmark plays well but after half time , team scotland hits back .
and comes out on top with a 7:3 victory .
so with that success in the bag it is time for mel young to focus his attention on more serious matters .
merchandising for example : " medium – you 're very kind !
i think it 's large .
so this was actually a design competition where homeless people had the opportunity to create a design for the t-shirt .
and this was the one that was selected by nike and they applied the design to the t-shirt .
so it 's actually a guy frank – he actually plays for the danish team – and nike then gave us a merchandise , and we sell them . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerseys , food and lodging – all donations .
over a dozen of the 48 teams participating come from developing nations .
ten of them from africa .
an important newcomer this year is india .
" welcome to india , where ten thousand homeless people have joined together to form football teams . " says virsen s. barse , the team manager of india " we have tournaments on the local level , grassroot level .
then the street level , then the state level , and then national level .
we are the oldest and we are organising from 2001 .
mel young is a pioneer of that !
here in india we call it the ‚ slum soccer ' .
but now we are part of homeless worldcup . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : next year 64 countries will be attending the 2008 homeless worldcup .
mel young is always looking for new sponsors and organising the event is getting more and more complex all the time .
vounteers have come along in copenhagen to lend a hand .
mel young : " you could say , we should stop growing .
but my view is : it 's not about managing a business .
we 're managing a social enterprise .
the outcome is that we 're involving homeless people changing their lives .
so , as long as we keep doing that , the more we should be doing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cup final – and prinz frederik von danmark has arrived to greet the referee and the team members .
scotland has made it into the finals against poland .
the first homeless worldcup victory for scotland .
mel young congratulates the champions .
but as far as he is concerned , every team 's a winner : " they 've been fantastic ambassadors for their country have been all week .
and it 's the same every tournament .
they 're incredibly proud .
in some ways they should n't be proud – given the circumstances .
but it 's always a very moving moment . "

the fact that a few hardy souls traveled in the opposite direction is far less well-known .
the american musician , actor and film director , dean reed was one of them . filmmaker leopold grün , who grew up in east germany , had forgotten about reed until a friend from the west jogged his memory six years ago . " i did n't like his music , so he 'd never really concerned me very much , " grün said .
" it was only when i started looking into his story that i became fascinated because it had so many twists and turns .
i discovered a completely crazy world that i had no idea about . "
the bizarre tale of dean reed has recently reawakened a flurry of interest .
as well as grün 's film - five years in the making and just opening in germany - a biography was published late last year .
us actor tom hanks is currently working on a feature film with steven spielberg about reed 's life with himself in the lead role . new angle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dean reed was an outspoken critic of the us 's war on vietnam leopold grün sees this interest as signs of a need for a change of perspective about the cold war era . " we all know that people fled east germany , " he said .
" but what could someone 's motives have been for going in the opposite direction ? "
called " the red elvis , " grün 's film does not set out to provide a comprehensive or conclusive account of reed 's colorful and chequered life .
the filmmaker is clear : " this is not a biography . "
instead , like a puzzle the documentary pieces together film clips , concert footage and a host of interviews , leaving it to the audience to make up their own mind . not exactly country-western by the time the photogenic reed settled in the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , he had already strayed far from his roots .
following a couple of very minor hits in the united states , the singer embarked on a tour of latin america in the early 1960s that was to prove decisive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans have set up a web site dedicated to his memory not only did reed end up at number one on the chilean charts , he witnessed grinding poverty during his travels and forged contacts with the latin american leftist movement , eventually counting salvador allende among his friends .
in " the red elvis , " isabel allende bussi remembers with gratitude reed 's support for her father 's presidential campaign .
" in his performances in chile you can see he is genuine , " grün said .
" the posing began later . "
increasingly critical of us foreign policy , reed moved to latin america .
it was the start of his career as a political activist-cum-entertainer .
he also continued to perform further afield , becoming the first us singer to tour the soviet union where his repertoire of country-western and protest songs together with his screen idol looks took audiences by storm .
in the film , a russian fan , now living in reed 's home town , reverentially recalls how his appearances in russia " were like a holiday for us . "
her memories have a tragic irony .
the singing advocate of socialist policies functioned as a distraction from soviet realities . " we forgot that we were oppressed , " she tells the camera . propaganda coup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his films , the actor cum musician also supported the underdog the us performer 's tours were clearly a coup for soviet authorities .
this did not go unnoticed back home .
in 1972 , in an article dripping with sarcasm , the us magazine newsweek commented : " reed 's success is heavily subsidized by kremlin authorities .
how often do they get an american who looks like apple pie and treads the party line like a trained bear ? " significantly , reed never relinquished his us passport , retaining the right to roam .
one of the most memorable - and disturbing - images in " the red elvis " shows reed in lebanon in the late 1960s , posing with both a gun and a guitar .
in argentina , reed was given his own tv show to host , but was finally deported after his pro-communist stance got too much for the authorities who were wary of upsetting washington .
after building an acting career in spaghetti westerns in italy , he moved to east berlin in 1972 , meeting his second wife-to-be at a film festival in leipzig .
in east germany , reed continued to sing and act , most notably in the blockbuster , east-german western " blutsbrüder " -lrb- blood brothers -rrb- .
here , the showman created a role tailored to his own character - a us soldier who goes over to the other side , joining forces with the underdogs after witnessing a massacre of cheyenne indians . a rising star behind the iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even as a middle aged man , reed continued to play the cowboy at first , the gdr authorities had not been so keen on his staying , according to grün . " they were afraid that he would have an unsettling effect because he was such a showman , but then they realized what a fantastic opportunity he presented , " he said .
" he stood for the right cause and there was no need to manipulate him . " egon krenz , who was later to briefly succeed erich honecker at the top of the east german leadership , has described the relationship between reed and the authorities as a " productive " one , based on " give and take . " but while this closeness to the regime may have secured him a celebrity status that he would never have enjoyed in the united states , it was also to prove his downfall .
his popularity began to ebb , partly because of his failure to take any kind of critical stance in public .
disillusioned cowboy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the popularity of his early years waning , depression set in over the years , reed had also become increasingly disillusioned with the less than heroic nature of everyday life in east germany .
and by the mid 1980s , his third marriage to a leading east german actress was also on the rocks . grün 's film gives little credence to the conspiracy stories that have surrounded his death by drowning , which was reported as a " tragic accident " on east german television .
reed 's long-term mistress and soulmate talks about the suicide pact that they had discussed at their clandestine apartment , still visibly grieving at the fact that he decided to cross this final frontier without her . more than a product of the cold war ?
the 90-minute film creates a subtle , multi-layered image of someone whose public and private personas were riven with contradictions .
while dean reed was , in one sense , very much a product of the cold war , grün said he believes his life story still has relevance today .
" one important goal of mine was to make a film that people could identify with in some way .
the themes that are dealt with are still topical : the palestinian issue , latin america , " he said .
" in addition to that , it deals with human problems that are not specific to east germany . " julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the researchers failed to spot any yangtze river dolphins , also known as baijis , during an extensive six-week survey of the mammals ' habitat .
the team , writing in biology letters journal , blamed unregulated fishing as the main reason behind their demise .
if confirmed , it would be the first extinction of a large vertebrate for over 50 years .
the world conservation union 's red list of threaten species currently classifies the creature as " critically endangered " . "

" the yangtze river dolphin was a remarkable mammal that separated from all other species over 20 million years ago , " dr turvey explained .
" this extinction represents the disappearance of a complete branch of the evolutionary tree of life and emphasises that we have yet to take full responsibility in our role as guardians of the planet . "
' incidental impact ' the species -lrb- lipotes vexillifer -rrb- was the only remaining member of the lipotidae , an ancient mammal family that is understood to have separated from other marine mammals , including whales , dolphins and porpoises , about 40-20 million years ago .
the white , freshwater dolphin had a long , narrow beak and low dorsal fin ; lived in groups of three or four and fed on fish .
the team carried out six-week visual and acoustic survey , using two research vessels , in november and december 2006 .
" while it is conceivable that a couple of surviving individuals were missed by the survey teams , " the team wrote , " our inability to detect any baiji despite this intensive search effort indicates that the prospect of finding and translocating them to a -lsb- reserve -rsb- has all but vanished . "
the scientists added that there were a number of human activities that caused baiji numbers to decline , including construction of dams and boat collisions .
" however , the primary factor was probably unsustainable by-catch in local fisheries , which used rolling hooks , nets and electrofishing , " they suggested .
" unlike most historical-era extinctions of large bodied animals , the baiji was the victim not of active persecution but incidental mortality resulting from massive-scale human environmental impacts - primarily uncontrolled and unselective fishing , " the researchers concluded .

in tests on young rats , animals given low-calorie versions of foods were induced to overeat , whether they were lean or obese .
the researchers believe low-calorie versions of usually high-calorie foods disrupt the body 's ability to use taste to regulate calorific intake .
the university of alberta study appears in the journal obesity .
diet foods are probably not a good idea for growing youngsters dr david pierce university of alberta lead researcher professor david pierce said : " based on what we 've learned , it is better for children to eat healthy , well-balanced diets with sufficient calories for their daily activities rather than low-calorie snacks or meals . "
the researchers found that young rats given low-calorie foods began to overeat during their regular meals .
however , older , adolescent rats also fed diet foods did not show the same tendency to overeat .
taste cues the researchers believe the older rats did not overeat because they , unlike the younger rats , were able to rely on a variety of taste-related cues to correctly assess the energy value of their food .
in contrast the younger animals learned to match tastes usually associated with food high in calories with low-fat alternatives , and so carried on eating to try to get their calorie count up when in fact it had already reached a healthy level .
professor pierce said the research underlined the importance of promoting a balanced diet and exercise as the best ways to keep children fit and healthy .
he said : " diet foods are probably not a good idea for growing youngsters . "
obesity is a significant risk factor for both type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease , and soaring rates are posing an increasing public health problem .
dr colin waine , chairman of the uk national obesity forum , sounded a note of caution about extrapolating from rats to humans .

but this speedy number cruncher could soon look like the equivalent of a dusty abacus if scientists who have gathered in york deliver on their promises .
nearly 150 of them have convened in the medieval town to explore the future of spintronics -lrb- spin-based electronics -rrb- , an area that could have profound effects on areas as diverse as data storage , microelectronics and quantum computing .
" with quantum computing you are able to attack some problems on the time scales of seconds , which might take an almost infinite amount of time with classical computers , " said professor david awschalom of the university of california , santa barbara .
endless possibility spintronics , also known as magnetoelectronics , is an emerging technology that harnesses the spin of particles .
conventional electronics ignores these rotations and instead exploits the movement or accumulation of electrons to do useful calculations or store data .
the movement of electrons through the tiny wires found in modern microchips is the reason why laptops become so hot .
but , by harnessing the twist and turns of particles - detected as a weak magnetic force - scientists hope to unlock almost infinite computing power and storage , without the heat .
" if you think about the spin of a particle , such as an electron , it can point up or down or at any superposition of the two ; partially up or partially down , " said professor awschalom .
each of these different " superpositions " can represent an almost infinite number of combinations of ones and zeros .
" you can store an almost infinite number of bits of information in one particle space , " he added .
this almost limitless number of possibilities would also pave the way for advanced computer processing , such as is needed in quantum computing .
" the spin of a particle is a very natural particle for quantum information processing , " said professor awschalom .
next generation this type of advanced computation is still a long-way off , but hi-tech companies intent on packing ever-increasing power and storage into smaller and smaller areas , are already taking spintronics seriously .
" the conventional microelectronics industry and the magnetic storage industry are approaching their limits very fast .
spintronics might offer a way out , " said dr yongbing xu of the university of york .
inside the hard drive advances have already been made , with basic spintronic devices already inside the vast majority of computers and laptops .
for example , most hard drives today use a " spin valve " , a device that reads information off the individual disks or platters that make up a hard drive .
" that enabled a thousand fold improvement in the storage capacity of disk drives from when we introduced it in 1998 , " said dr stuart parkin of computer giant ibm and the inventor of the device .
he describes the spin valve as part of " the first generation " of spintronic devices , relatively simple structures built of magnetic materials .
second generation devices , he said , have also recently hit the shelves in the form of a type of computer memory known as mram -lrb- magnetoresistive random access memory -rrb- .
in 2006 , chip firm freescale began to offer 1mb mram devices for example .
these devices are a hybrid of a hard disk and more up to date types of memory , such as flash memory , commonly used in digital cameras .
like flash , mram has no moving parts and retains all of its data even when the power is switched off .
but , like a hard drive , it stores data as magnetic charges .
but , dr parkin is already working on what he believes could be the third generation of spintronic memory devices .
back and forth he is currently building a spintronic prototype of what he calls " racetrack memory " , a device that could increase storage density by up to 100 times .
it achieves this by building " high-rise " chips .
" the racetrack is a very tall column of magnetic material ; it is essentially a magnetic nanowire standing on end above the surface a silicon wafer , " said dr parkin .
along the nanowire would be polarised regions , magnetised to point towards the north or south pole .
" the boundary between these regions is a magnetic domain wall and that is where the information is stored . "
the domain walls are moved up and down the u-shaped wire by applying a tiny pulse of spin-polarised current - a flow of electrons all spinning in one direction - to either end of the wire .
when the electrons make contact with a domain wall it moves it along the wire , shuffling the data like train carriages being shunted around a track .
" you 're not moving any atoms you 're just moving a magnetic orientation , " he said .
the data would be read by a simple read / write device at the bottom of the " u " .
a working device would look like a small forest of nanowires covering the surface of a chip .
but , it could be some time before racetrack memory is common place .
" it will probably take another five years before we have a complete prototype . "
first steps but this maybe long before researchers are able to build one of the holy grails of spintronics , a semiconductor that integrates both computer processing and storage .
" in that case it would be faster and it would consume less energy -lsb- than today 's semiconductors -rsb- , " explained dr xu .
a key challenge of building advanced devices is controlling and manipulating the spin of sub-atomic particles so that the data , in the form of different spin orientations , can be written and read accurately .
" in the last few years people have been able to read one single spin and manipulate it , " said professor awschalom .
" now some of the challenges are to do a lot of these operations efficiently . "
material researchers also need to come up with new materials that allow these operations to be done at room temperature , rather than the impractical sub-zero temperatures used in the lab .
and when that happens , spintronics may truly have come of age .
" we could make a computer that is completely different than what we are using today , " said dr xu .

but this speedy number cruncher could soon look like the equivalent of a dusty abacus if scientists who have gathered in york deliver on their promises .
nearly 150 of them have convened in the medieval town to explore the future of spintronics -lrb- spin-based electronics -rrb- , an area that could have profound effects on areas as diverse as data storage , microelectronics and quantum computing .
" with quantum computing you are able to attack some problems on the time scales of seconds , which might take an almost infinite amount of time with classical computers , " said professor david awschalom of the university of california , santa barbara .
endless possibility spintronics , also known as magnetoelectronics , is an emerging technology that harnesses the spin of particles .
conventional electronics ignores these rotations and instead exploits the movement or accumulation of electrons to do useful calculations or store data .
spintronics is already used in mram devices produced by freescale the movement of electrons through the tiny wires found in modern microchips is the reason why laptops become so hot .
but , by harnessing the twist and turns of particles - detected as a weak magnetic force - scientists hope to unlock almost infinite computing power and storage , without the heat .
" if you think about the spin of a particle , such as an electron , it can point up or down or at any superposition of the two ; partially up or partially down , " said professor awschalom .
each of these different " superpositions " can represent an almost infinite number of combinations of ones and zeros .
" you can store an almost infinite number of bits of information in one particle space , " he added .
this almost limitless number of possibilities would also pave the way for advanced computer processing , such as is needed in quantum computing .
" the spin of a particle is a very natural particle for quantum information processing , " said professor awschalom .
next generation this type of advanced computation is still a long-way off , but hi-tech companies intent on packing ever-increasing power and storage into smaller and smaller areas , are already taking spintronics seriously .
" the conventional microelectronics industry and the magnetic storage industry are approaching their limits very fast .
spintronics might offer a way out , " said dr yongbing xu of the university of york .
inside the hard drive advances have already been made , with basic spintronic devices already inside the vast majority of computers and laptops .
for example , most hard drives today use a " spin valve " , a device that reads information off the individual disks or platters that make up a hard drive .
" that enabled a thousand fold improvement in the storage capacity of disk drives from when we introduced it in 1998 , " said dr stuart parkin of computer giant ibm and the inventor of the device .
he describes the spin valve as part of " the first generation " of spintronic devices , relatively simple structures built of magnetic materials .
second generation devices , he said , have also recently hit the shelves in the form of a type of computer memory known as mram -lrb- magnetoresistive random access memory -rrb- .
in 2006 , chip firm freescale began to offer 1mb mram devices for example .
these devices are a hybrid of a hard disk and more up to date types of memory , such as flash memory , commonly used in digital cameras .
like flash , mram has no moving parts and retains all of its data even when the power is switched off .
but , like a hard drive , it stores data as magnetic charges .
but , dr parkin is already working on what he believes could be the third generation of spintronic memory devices .
back and forth he is currently building a spintronic prototype of what he calls " racetrack memory " , a device that could increase storage density by up to 100 times .
it achieves this by building " high-rise " chips .
spintronics could render today 's supercomputers obsolete " the racetrack is a very tall column of magnetic material ; it is essentially a magnetic nanowire standing on end above the surface a silicon wafer , " said dr parkin .
along the nanowire would be polarised regions , magnetised to point towards the north or south pole .
" the boundary between these regions is a magnetic domain wall and that is where the information is stored . "
see how racetrack memory could work the domain walls are moved up and down the u-shaped wire by applying a tiny pulse of spin-polarised current - a flow of electrons all spinning in one direction - to either end of the wire .
when the electrons make contact with a domain wall it moves it along the wire , shuffling the data like train carriages being shunted around a track .
" you 're not moving any atoms you 're just moving a magnetic orientation , " he said .
the data would be read by a simple read / write device at the bottom of the " u " .
a working device would look like a small forest of nanowires covering the surface of a chip .
but , it could be some time before racetrack memory is common place .
" it will probably take another five years before we have a complete prototype . "
first steps but this maybe long before researchers are able to build one of the holy grails of spintronics , a semiconductor that integrates both computer processing and storage .
" in that case it would be faster and it would consume less energy -lsb- than today 's semiconductors -rsb- , " explained dr xu .
a key challenge of building advanced devices is controlling and manipulating the spin of sub-atomic particles so that the data , in the form of different spin orientations , can be written and read accurately .
" in the last few years people have been able to read one single spin and manipulate it , " said professor awschalom .
" now some of the challenges are to do a lot of these operations efficiently . "
material researchers also need to come up with new materials that allow these operations to be done at room temperature , rather than the impractical sub-zero temperatures used in the lab .
and when that happens , spintronics may truly have come of age .
" we could make a computer that is completely different than what we are using today , " said dr xu .

nearly 150 of them have convened in the medieval town to explore the future of spintronics -lrb- spin-based electronics -rrb- , an area that could have profound effects on areas as diverse as data storage , microelectronics and quantum computing .
" with quantum computing you are able to attack some problems on the time scales of seconds , which might take an almost infinite amount of time with classical computers , " said professor david awschalom of the university of california , santa barbara .
endless possibility spintronics , also known as magnetoelectronics , is an emerging technology that harnesses the spin of particles .
conventional electronics ignores these rotations and instead exploits the movement or accumulation of electrons to do useful calculations or store data .
spintronics is already used in mram devices produced by freescale the movement of electrons through the tiny wires found in modern microchips is the reason why laptops become so hot .
but , by harnessing the twist and turns of particles - detected as a weak magnetic force - scientists hope to unlock almost infinite computing power and storage , without the heat .
" if you think about the spin of a particle , such as an electron , it can point up or down or at any superposition of the two ; partially up or partially down , " said professor awschalom .
each of these different " superpositions " can represent an almost infinite number of combinations of ones and zeros .
" you can store an almost infinite number of bits of information in one particle space , " he added .
this almost limitless number of possibilities would also pave the way for advanced computer processing , such as is needed in quantum computing .
" the spin of a particle is a very natural particle for quantum information processing , " said professor awschalom .
next generation this type of advanced computation is still a long-way off , but hi-tech companies intent on packing ever-increasing power and storage into smaller and smaller areas , are already taking spintronics seriously .
" the conventional microelectronics industry and the magnetic storage industry are approaching their limits very fast .
spintronics might offer a way out , " said dr yongbing xu of the university of york .
inside the hard drive advances have already been made , with basic spintronic devices already inside the vast majority of computers and laptops .
for example , most hard drives today use a " spin valve " , a device that reads information off the individual disks or platters that make up a hard drive .
" that enabled a thousand fold improvement in the storage capacity of disk drives from when we introduced it in 1998 , " said dr stuart parkin of computer giant ibm and the inventor of the device .
he describes the spin valve as part of " the first generation " of spintronic devices , relatively simple structures built of magnetic materials .
second generation devices , he said , have also recently hit the shelves in the form of a type of computer memory known as mram -lrb- magnetoresistive random access memory -rrb- .
in 2006 , chip firm freescale began to offer 1mb mram devices for example .
these devices are a hybrid of a hard disk and more up to date types of memory , such as flash memory , commonly used in digital cameras .
like flash , mram has no moving parts and retains all of its data even when the power is switched off .
but , like a hard drive , it stores data as magnetic charges .
but , dr parkin is already working on what he believes could be the third generation of spintronic memory devices .
back and forth he is currently building a spintronic prototype of what he calls " racetrack memory " , a device that could increase storage density by up to 100 times .
it achieves this by building " high-rise " chips .
spintronics could render today 's supercomputers obsolete " the racetrack is a very tall column of magnetic material ; it is essentially a magnetic nanowire standing on end above the surface a silicon wafer , " said dr parkin .
along the nanowire would be polarised regions , magnetised to point towards the north or south pole .
" the boundary between these regions is a magnetic domain wall and that is where the information is stored . "
see how racetrack memory could work the domain walls are moved up and down the u-shaped wire by applying a tiny pulse of spin-polarised current - a flow of electrons all spinning in one direction - to either end of the wire .
when the electrons make contact with a domain wall it moves it along the wire , shuffling the data like train carriages being shunted around a track .
" you 're not moving any atoms you 're just moving a magnetic orientation , " he said .
the data would be read by a simple read / write device at the bottom of the " u " .
a working device would look like a small forest of nanowires covering the surface of a chip .
but , it could be some time before racetrack memory is common place .
" it will probably take another five years before we have a complete prototype . "
first steps but this maybe long before researchers are able to build one of the holy grails of spintronics , a semiconductor that integrates both computer processing and storage .
" in that case it would be faster and it would consume less energy -lsb- than today 's semiconductors -rsb- , " explained dr xu .
a key challenge of building advanced devices is controlling and manipulating the spin of sub-atomic particles so that the data , in the form of different spin orientations , can be written and read accurately .
" in the last few years people have been able to read one single spin and manipulate it , " said professor awschalom .
" now some of the challenges are to do a lot of these operations efficiently . "
material researchers also need to come up with new materials that allow these operations to be done at room temperature , rather than the impractical sub-zero temperatures used in the lab .
and when that happens , spintronics may truly have come of age .
" we could make a computer that is completely different than what we are using today , " said dr xu .

but this speedy number cruncher could soon look like the equivalent of a dusty abacus if scientists who have gathered in york deliver on their promises .
nearly 150 of them have convened in the medieval town to explore the future of spintronics -lrb- spin-based electronics -rrb- , an area that could have profound effects on areas as diverse as data storage , microelectronics and quantum computing .
" with quantum computing you are able to attack some problems on the time scales of seconds , which might take an almost infinite amount of time with classical computers , " said professor david awschalom of the university of california , santa barbara .
endless possibility spintronics , also known as magnetoelectronics , is an emerging technology that harnesses the spin of particles .
conventional electronics ignores these rotations and instead exploits the movement or accumulation of electrons to do useful calculations or store data .
spintronics is already used in mram devices produced by freescale the movement of electrons through the tiny wires found in modern microchips is the reason why laptops become so hot .
but , by harnessing the twist and turns of particles - detected as a weak magnetic force - scientists hope to unlock almost infinite computing power and storage , without the heat .
" if you think about the spin of a particle , such as an electron , it can point up or down or at any superposition of the two ; partially up or partially down , " said professor awschalom .
each of these different " superpositions " can represent an almost infinite number of combinations of ones and zeros .
" you can store an almost infinite number of bits of information in one particle space , " he added .
this almost limitless number of possibilities would also pave the way for advanced computer processing , such as is needed in quantum computing .
" the spin of a particle is a very natural particle for quantum information processing , " said professor awschalom .
next generation this type of advanced computation is still a long-way off , but hi-tech companies intent on packing ever-increasing power and storage into smaller and smaller areas , are already taking spintronics seriously .
" the conventional microelectronics industry and the magnetic storage industry are approaching their limits very fast .
spintronics might offer a way out , " said dr yongbing xu of the university of york .
inside the hard drive advances have already been made , with basic spintronic devices already inside the vast majority of computers and laptops .
for example , most hard drives today use a " spin valve " , a device that reads information off the individual disks or platters that make up a hard drive .
" that enabled a thousand fold improvement in the storage capacity of disk drives from when we introduced it in 1998 , " said dr stuart parkin of computer giant ibm and the inventor of the device .
he describes the spin valve as part of " the first generation " of spintronic devices , relatively simple structures built of magnetic materials .
second generation devices , he said , have also recently hit the shelves in the form of a type of computer memory known as mram -lrb- magnetoresistive random access memory -rrb- .
in 2006 , chip firm freescale began to offer 1mb mram devices for example .
these devices are a hybrid of a hard disk and more up to date types of memory , such as flash memory , commonly used in digital cameras .
like flash , mram has no moving parts and retains all of its data even when the power is switched off .
but , like a hard drive , it stores data as magnetic charges .
but , dr parkin is already working on what he believes could be the third generation of spintronic memory devices .
back and forth he is currently building a spintronic prototype of what he calls " racetrack memory " , a device that could increase storage density by up to 100 times .
it achieves this by building " high-rise " chips .
spintronics could render today 's supercomputers obsolete " the racetrack is a very tall column of magnetic material ; it is essentially a magnetic nanowire standing on end above the surface a silicon wafer , " said dr parkin .
along the nanowire would be polarised regions , magnetised to point towards the north or south pole .
" the boundary between these regions is a magnetic domain wall and that is where the information is stored . "
see how racetrack memory could work the domain walls are moved up and down the u-shaped wire by applying a tiny pulse of spin-polarised current - a flow of electrons all spinning in one direction - to either end of the wire .
when the electrons make contact with a domain wall it moves it along the wire , shuffling the data like train carriages being shunted around a track .
" you 're not moving any atoms you 're just moving a magnetic orientation , " he said .
the data would be read by a simple read / write device at the bottom of the " u " .
a working device would look like a small forest of nanowires covering the surface of a chip .
but , it could be some time before racetrack memory is common place .
" it will probably take another five years before we have a complete prototype . "
first steps but this maybe long before researchers are able to build one of the holy grails of spintronics , a semiconductor that integrates both computer processing and storage .
" in that case it would be faster and it would consume less energy -lsb- than today 's semiconductors -rsb- , " explained dr xu .
a key challenge of building advanced devices is controlling and manipulating the spin of sub-atomic particles so that the data , in the form of different spin orientations , can be written and read accurately .
" in the last few years people have been able to read one single spin and manipulate it , " said professor awschalom .
" now some of the challenges are to do a lot of these operations efficiently . "
material researchers also need to come up with new materials that allow these operations to be done at room temperature , rather than the impractical sub-zero temperatures used in the lab .

a comparison of fast broadband in london and paris , shows it is a far , far better thing to head to the french capital if you want to surf at speed .
before leaving for paris , i checked my own home connection .
it offers 2mbps - pretty typical for london - and was working at a respectable 1.6mbps when i used an online speed test .
in theory , you can now get up to 24mbps from a couple of uk providers .
in practice , hardly anyone gets that speed and even those on 8mbps broadband were getting an average of just 2.7mbps in a recent test carried out by which ?
in paris , though , there is a bewildering amount of choice if you want fast broadband .
" a few years ago there was virtually nothing , " guillaume kuch told me when i visited his apartment in the paris suburb of neuilly .
" now all sorts of companies are offering at least 10mbps . "
sparked investment guillaume is paying 14 euros a month -lrb- around £ 10 -rrb- for a 12mbs connection and free phone calls .
that 's about half as much as i pay in london for something one sixth as fast .
what has sparked investment in broadband is france is the low take-up of digital television , which makes it more attractive to offer tv over the internet .
many broadband providers now throw in a set-top box with a package which gives customers television , telephone and internet down a fast broadband line for around 30 euros -lrb- about £ 20 -rrb- a month .
but something even faster is on its way .
beneath the streets of paris two companies , france telecom 's orange and free , are laying down fibre-optic cables to bring speeds of up to 100mbps to homes in parts of the city .
fibre-to-the-home , as it is known , is viewed as far too expensive a solution in the uk .
but a france telecom engineer lifts a manhole in the pavement to show me that the fibre is being run through existing pipes .
that , and the fact that many parisians live in apartment blocks , means that the cost of installing the new network is not quite as high as it would be in london .
so what does 100mbps actually look like ?
orange provides a helpful table showing that it would enable me to download an hd quality film in just 40 minutes , as compared with more than eight hours on an 8mbps line .
at a shop in a paris suburb plastered with adverts for " la fibre " , the company is demonstrating the new service .
when i try it out with my laptop i find i 'm only getting around 22mbps - but then i am using a wi-fi connection , which would curb the speed , and there is a high-definition television online using some of the bandwidth .
so far just two thousand people have signed up to the fibre service , which costs 45 euros a month -lrb- £ 30 -rrb- for the internet connection , a 51 channel television service and unlimited phone calls .
but orange is aiming for up to 200,000 customers by the end of 2008 .
extra bandwidth why then , should anyone want super-fast broadband ?
after all , bt says that its vision internet television service runs perfectly well in the uk on a 2mbps connection .
but paris is convinced that extra bandwidth can provide big economic benefits , with the city 's mayor throwing his weight behind fibre-to-the-home as a way of making the french capital europe 's leading digital city .
rodrigo sepulveda schulz believes the strategy is working .
he showed me round his internet television business , vpod.tv , run from a small office in central paris .
he said the availability of fast broadband was one of the reasons he chose to locate his business here .
" the videos start immediately , rather than buffering for ten seconds as happens in the us .
so it 's a fantastic experience and it means we can sell more technology to our customers . "
back in the uk , it has been estimated that a project to build fibre-to-the-home reaching 90 % of customers would cost £ 10 billion .
right now , nobody is prepared to risk that kind of money .
but the paris experiment will be watched closely to see if it can prove profitable to deliver lightning fast broadband to homes .

it offers 2mbps - pretty typical for london - and was working at a respectable 1.6mbps when i used an online speed test .
in theory , you can now get up to 24mbps from a couple of uk providers .
in practice , hardly anyone gets that speed and even those on 8mbps broadband were getting an average of just 2.7mbps in a recent test carried out by which ?
in paris , though , there is a bewildering amount of choice if you want fast broadband .
" a few years ago there was virtually nothing , " guillaume kuch told me when i visited his apartment in the paris suburb of neuilly .
" now all sorts of companies are offering at least 10mbps . "
sparked investment guillaume is paying 14 euros a month -lrb- around £ 10 -rrb- for a 12mbs connection and free phone calls .
that 's about half as much as i pay in london for something one sixth as fast .
what has sparked investment in broadband is france is the low take-up of digital television , which makes it more attractive to offer tv over the internet .
many broadband providers now throw in a set-top box with a package which gives customers television , telephone and internet down a fast broadband line for around 30 euros -lrb- about £ 20 -rrb- a month .
but something even faster is on its way .
beneath the streets of paris two companies , france telecom 's orange and free , are laying down fibre-optic cables to bring speeds of up to 100mbps to homes in parts of the city .
fibre-to-the-home , as it is known , is viewed as far too expensive a solution in the uk .
but a france telecom engineer lifts a manhole in the pavement to show me that the fibre is being run through existing pipes .
that , and the fact that many parisians live in apartment blocks , means that the cost of installing the new network is not quite as high as it would be in london .
so what does 100mbps actually look like ?
orange provides a helpful table showing that it would enable me to download an hd quality film in just 40 minutes , as compared with more than eight hours on an 8mbps line .
at a shop in a paris suburb plastered with adverts for " la fibre " , the company is demonstrating the new service .
when i try it out with my laptop i find i 'm only getting around 22mbps - but then i am using a wi-fi connection , which would curb the speed , and there is a high-definition television online using some of the bandwidth .
so far just two thousand people have signed up to the fibre service , which costs 45 euros a month -lrb- £ 30 -rrb- for the internet connection , a 51 channel television service and unlimited phone calls .
but orange is aiming for up to 200,000 customers by the end of 2008 .
extra bandwidth why then , should anyone want super-fast broadband ?
after all , bt says that its vision internet television service runs perfectly well in the uk on a 2mbps connection .
but paris is convinced that extra bandwidth can provide big economic benefits , with the city 's mayor throwing his weight behind fibre-to-the-home as a way of making the french capital europe 's leading digital city .
rodrigo sepulveda schulz believes the strategy is working .
he showed me round his internet television business , vpod.tv , run from a small office in central paris .
he said the availability of fast broadband was one of the reasons he chose to locate his business here .
" the videos start immediately , rather than buffering for ten seconds as happens in the us .
so it 's a fantastic experience and it means we can sell more technology to our customers . "
back in the uk , it has been estimated that a project to build fibre-to-the-home reaching 90 % of customers would cost £ 10 billion .
right now , nobody is prepared to risk that kind of money .
but the paris experiment will be watched closely to see if it can prove profitable to deliver lightning fast broadband to homes .

at a shop in a paris suburb plastered with adverts for " la fibre " , the company is demonstrating the new service .
when i try it out with my laptop i find i 'm only getting around 22mbps - but then i am using a wi-fi connection , which would curb the speed , and there is a high-definition television online using some of the bandwidth .
so far just two thousand people have signed up to the fibre service , which costs 45 euros a month -lrb- £ 30 -rrb- for the internet connection , a 51 channel television service and unlimited phone calls .

extra bandwidth why then , should anyone want super-fast broadband ?
after all , bt says that its vision internet television service runs perfectly well in the uk on a 2mbps connection .
but paris is convinced that extra bandwidth can provide big economic benefits , with the city 's mayor throwing his weight behind fibre-to-the-home as a way of making the french capital europe 's leading digital city .
rodrigo sepulveda schulz believes the strategy is working .
he showed me round his internet television business , vpod.tv , run from a small office in central paris .
he said the availability of fast broadband was one of the reasons he chose to locate his business here .
" the videos start immediately , rather than buffering for ten seconds as happens in the us .
so it 's a fantastic experience and it means we can sell more technology to our customers . "
back in the uk , it has been estimated that a project to build fibre-to-the-home reaching 90 % of customers would cost £ 10 billion .
right now , nobody is prepared to risk that kind of money .
but the paris experiment will be watched closely to see if it can prove profitable to deliver lightning fast broadband to homes .

a comparison of fast broadband in london and paris , shows it is a far , far better thing to head to the french capital if you want to surf at speed .
before leaving for paris , i checked my own home connection .
it offers 2mbps - pretty typical for london - and was working at a respectable 1.6mbps when i used an online speed test .
in theory , you can now get up to 24mbps from a couple of uk providers .
in practice , hardly anyone gets that speed and even those on 8mbps broadband were getting an average of just 2.7mbps in a recent test carried out by which ?
in paris , though , there is a bewildering amount of choice if you want fast broadband .
" a few years ago there was virtually nothing , " guillaume kuch told me when i visited his apartment in the paris suburb of neuilly .
" now all sorts of companies are offering at least 10mbps . "
sparked investment guillaume is paying 14 euros a month -lrb- around £ 10 -rrb- for a 12mbs connection and free phone calls .
that 's about half as much as i pay in london for something one sixth as fast .
what has sparked investment in broadband is france is the low take-up of digital television , which makes it more attractive to offer tv over the internet .
many broadband providers now throw in a set-top box with a package which gives customers television , telephone and internet down a fast broadband line for around 30 euros -lrb- about £ 20 -rrb- a month .
but something even faster is on its way .
beneath the streets of paris two companies , france telecom 's orange and free , are laying down fibre-optic cables to bring speeds of up to 100mbps to homes in parts of the city .
fibre-to-the-home , as it is known , is viewed as far too expensive a solution in the uk .
but a france telecom engineer lifts a manhole in the pavement to show me that the fibre is being run through existing pipes .
that , and the fact that many parisians live in apartment blocks , means that the cost of installing the new network is not quite as high as it would be in london .
so what does 100mbps actually look like ?
