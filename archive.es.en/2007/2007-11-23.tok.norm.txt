program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 23.11.2007 authorities under fire after infant death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many cases slip through the net the death by starvation of a five-year-old in the eastern german town of schwerin has triggered calls from politicians and social workers to introduce compulsory preventative medical check-ups . the parents of lea-sophie were arrested this week on charges of neglect after allegedly failing to adequately feed their daughter for months on end .
she died on tuesday , nov .
20 , after being admitted to a hospital in schwerin , weighing just over seven kilos -lrb- 15 pounds -rrb- - three times less than an average child her age .
her death has prompted calls from politicians for more thorough preemptive controls .
" i am a vehement advocate of making preventative medical check-ups compulsory , " kerstin griese , the social democratic chairwoman of the german parliament 's family affairs committee told the daily berliner zeitung on friday .
" this would provide a fundamental building block for child protection . "
but wolfram hartmann , president of the pediatricians association , told dpa that gaps between such visits are too long to make them effective .
" it would be wrong to think that compulsory health checks could prevent cases of child neglect , " he said .
instead , hartmann argued for greater cooperation between health officials and social workers .
opposition parties agree that the problem is a result of authorities failing to do their job .
" given that cuts have been made in youth-protection offices for years , it should come as no surprise that these cases happen , " said jörn wunderlich from the left party .
effects of cost-cutting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors need to be attuned to signs of possible abuse every time such stories make the headlines in germany , the nation is left wondering how these families can fall through the net .
fingers are invariably pointed at the child-protection services .
when a two-year old died in bremen last year , many blamed the local welfare office which had left the boy in the care of his drug-addicted foster father despite repeated warnings .
the authorities in schwerin have also come in for criticism .
hermann junghans , head of schwerin social services , insists that welfare officers did their job properly but has admitted that the two social workers who visited the family a fortnight ago after an anonymous tip-off had " found nothing amiss . "
neighbors , meanwhile , said the two social workers never actually entered the apartment .
according to newspaper reports , heike seifert , head of schwerin 's youth welfare office , complained to the local council earlier this year that financial cuts were hampering the work of the office .
on friday , schwerin 's mayor , norbert claussen , acknowledged flaws in the welfare system .
lea-sophie 's death " showed that adequate mechanisms are not in place , " he said in a statement .
heike seifert , meanwhile , was quoted in the daily taz as saying that this was by no means the first time that children had been admitted with symptoms of malnutrition to hospitals in schwerin .
the number of child endangerment cases has been increasing in the town , confirmed junghans at a press conference this week .
eighty-six cases were registered in the first six months of 2007 .
in 2006 , the figure was 133 , compared to just 42 in 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to dignitate 's deputy director . a few weeks ago , dignitas hit the headlines for helping two germans to die in a car park in switzerland .
the apparently undignified circumstances of their deaths sparked renewed criticism of the controversial organization , which has been accused of treating assisted suicide as a money-making enterprise . while assisted suicide is legal in switzerland , german law is much less clear-cut .
uwe-christian arnold , the deputy director of dignitate , the german branch of dignitas , and himself a doctor , says his group wants to set a legal precedent by carrying out an assisted suicide here in germany . the head of the german doctors ' chamber has called for dignitate to be banned . dw-world.de : why do you think your plan has created such an uproar in germany ? uwe-christian arnold : the reason that certain circles get so worked up about this topic is because it was completely taboo for decades .
it was linked to euthanasia and the nazis .
anyone who concerned themselves with this subject was lumped together with the nazis .
no one differentiated between the fact , for example , that no one asked the people who were killed then whether they wanted to die or not .
someone else decided that they should die .
that is completely different from what we 're planning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill mnd sufferer diane pretty lost her battle to change britain 's laws on assisted suicide the precondition is that the patient wants to die and that they have legitimate reason to want to end their life .
this is quite different from what the nazis did .
doctors tend to be conservative and the german medical association is particularly conservative because it was closely involved with the nazis .
they have not dealt with this past over the last 60 years .
on the occasions they did , it was always very uncomfortable . i do n't want to reproach them for the fact that they want to avoid the topic of assisted suicide , but we have to deal with this topic .
it is a pressing social need . have significant numbers of germans been traveling to switzerland to take up the services of dignitas ? no , the numbers are not very significant .
last year , there were 176 or so assisted suicides in total , 120 of those were germans .
that is a bit of an increase in the numbers of germans , but it roughly corresponds to that of previous years .
and it corresponds to the numbers going to other assisted suicide organizations , in switzerland and in oregon . the number of people who decide to end their lives in this way has remained steady . why is assisted suicide such a pressing social need ? the majority of people - 82 percent of the germans and the same numbers in england , in france , the us and canada - are in favor of legalizing assisted suicide .
in oregon it was made legal , but many other american cities want it .
and i think germany should have it .
it is a big country and the patients have big problems with this topic . is it partly a problem that was created by modern medicine ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under european law , it is up to individual states to decide on right-to-die legislation it is exclusively a problem of medicine - high tech medicine - that for decades has only been concerned with progress and it has notched up fantastic achievements .
but it has completely forgotten that death also stands , lurks , at the end of all these strivings .
making this taboo can be very unpleasant for the patient .
many people have the experience that death can be dreadful with high-tech medicine .
it can be something as simple as a feeding probe for an old person in a nursing-care home . is n't it also partly a problem that the hospice system and palliative medicine is n't sufficient in germany ? that is a very important factor .
but even if we had such good palliative medicine and hospice provision as there is in scandinavia - where they have provision for 20 percent of people against our 4 percent - then there would still be a very small minority who , if they got certain illnesses , would want to be able to determine the time when they die - and if they ca n't with the help of a doctor .
there are still illnesses that palliative medicine ca n't help , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis . there are certain preconditions that you have to fulfill to be eligible for assisted suicide .
what are they ? you need to have a terminal illness or a serious illness that you ca n't live with anymore , one that handicaps you so strongly that you can no longer lead a dignified life .
in other words , if you 're lovelorn or you 're suffering from an acute depression , then you wo n't be able to ask for assisted suicide . why are you trying to create a legal precedent here in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands is the only country where mercy killing is legal we are looking to set a test case because it is not clear whether a person can be prosecuted if they do not go to the aid of a person who is dying .
there are judgments and a statement from the ministry of justice that confirms that you can do it under certain conditions , if the person has made the decision freely and that the will of the patient should be placed above the duty to preserve life . is it possible to protect this area from abuse ? in other countries , in the united states and , as far as i know , in the uk , things are more advanced .
there are ethical committees that meet and when there is an 86-year-old and he has a serious illness and he is due for a big operation , then they will discuss whether he should be operated on or given palliative medicine .
a lot more is done to spare people from this hyper-medicine .
that should be done more in germany , too .
it should be considered when there are cases where death might be the better solution .
you do n't have to kill them .
you can just leave them .
this can be entrusted in the hands of doctors .
of course , it is open to abuse .
but this argument is not a good one .
every area in life is open to abuse .
abuse can always happen with or without assisted suicide . you referred to ethical committees .
do you want to make assisted suicide into something that the state is involved in and remove it from the private sector ? that is the sense of our campaign that we get a sensible assisted-suicide policy in germany .
it should n't be the case that this only can be carried out in private .
it should be possible in accordance with certain regulations as in switzerland .
in switzerland , a doctor visits a patient after long and thorough preparation .
you ca n't ring me and say , " doctor , will you give me a lethal injection tomorrow . "
that 's out of the question .
this topic is much too serious and much too sensitive for that . the chief accusation that has been leveled at dignitas is that it is trying to profit from people .
and that dignitas demands three times as much money as exit , another swiss-based right-to-die group .
what would you say to that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muscular-dystrophy sufferer piergiorgio welby battled in italy for his respirator to be switched off exit has 50 million members and it carried out a constant number of assisted suicides a year , 35 , 40 or 50 in a year .
they have a certain price .
for long-term members it is free and for those who have just recently joined , they take around 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,950 -rrb- .
i ca n't tell you exactly , but they take a fee and it is lower than dignitas .
from their swiss members dignitas takes 2,000 euros .
only for those coming from abroad , they take more because they have cremation costs , counseling costs that are much higher than for people in switzerland , who can just go to their local doctor .
and then fees have to be paid to the swiss authorities because costs are incurred by the foreigners .
this is n't about making money .
dignitas has a large office and , unlike exit , which works with volunteers , it works consciously with professionals . do you think you will be successful with your demands ? something will happen .
there has been so much media attention .
i think that if we make a test case , then we will see how they react .
only two things can happen .
either people will accept it , as with abortion in germany .
or we will get a reactionary solution and fall back into the middle ages .
but i 'm hopeful .
because of the churches and the medical association , abortion was also completely taboo here for years , and nowadays we can perform abortion here just like in england and other countries . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 23.11.2007 german right-to-die group plans assisted-suicide test case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversy has led to criticism of germany 's low hospice provision the german branch of a swiss right-to-die organization has unleashed a storm of protest by saying it is planning to carry out an assisted suicide in germany .
dw-world.de spoke to dignitate 's deputy director . a few weeks ago , dignitas hit the headlines for helping two germans to die in a car park in switzerland .
the apparently undignified circumstances of their deaths sparked renewed criticism of the controversial organization , which has been accused of treating assisted suicide as a money-making enterprise . while assisted suicide is legal in switzerland , german law is much less clear-cut .
uwe-christian arnold , the deputy director of dignitate , the german branch of dignitas , and himself a doctor , says his group wants to set a legal precedent by carrying out an assisted suicide here in germany . the head of the german doctors ' chamber has called for dignitate to be banned . dw-world.de : why do you think your plan has created such an uproar in germany ? uwe-christian arnold : the reason that certain circles get so worked up about this topic is because it was completely taboo for decades .
it was linked to euthanasia and the nazis .
anyone who concerned themselves with this subject was lumped together with the nazis .
no one differentiated between the fact , for example , that no one asked the people who were killed then whether they wanted to die or not .
someone else decided that they should die .
that is completely different from what we 're planning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill mnd sufferer diane pretty lost her battle to change britain 's laws on assisted suicide the precondition is that the patient wants to die and that they have legitimate reason to want to end their life .
this is quite different from what the nazis did .
doctors tend to be conservative and the german medical association is particularly conservative because it was closely involved with the nazis .
they have not dealt with this past over the last 60 years .
on the occasions they did , it was always very uncomfortable . i do n't want to reproach them for the fact that they want to avoid the topic of assisted suicide , but we have to deal with this topic .
it is a pressing social need . have significant numbers of germans been traveling to switzerland to take up the services of dignitas ? no , the numbers are not very significant .
last year , there were 176 or so assisted suicides in total , 120 of those were germans .
that is a bit of an increase in the numbers of germans , but it roughly corresponds to that of previous years .
and it corresponds to the numbers going to other assisted suicide organizations , in switzerland and in oregon . the number of people who decide to end their lives in this way has remained steady . why is assisted suicide such a pressing social need ? the majority of people - 82 percent of the germans and the same numbers in england , in france , the us and canada - are in favor of legalizing assisted suicide .
in oregon it was made legal , but many other american cities want it .
and i think germany should have it .
it is a big country and the patients have big problems with this topic . is it partly a problem that was created by modern medicine ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under european law , it is up to individual states to decide on right-to-die legislation it is exclusively a problem of medicine - high tech medicine - that for decades has only been concerned with progress and it has notched up fantastic achievements .
but it has completely forgotten that death also stands , lurks , at the end of all these strivings .
making this taboo can be very unpleasant for the patient .
many people have the experience that death can be dreadful with high-tech medicine .
it can be something as simple as a feeding probe for an old person in a nursing-care home . is n't it also partly a problem that the hospice system and palliative medicine is n't sufficient in germany ? that is a very important factor .
but even if we had such good palliative medicine and hospice provision as there is in scandinavia - where they have provision for 20 percent of people against our 4 percent - then there would still be a very small minority who , if they got certain illnesses , would want to be able to determine the time when they die - and if they ca n't with the help of a doctor .
there are still illnesses that palliative medicine ca n't help , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis . there are certain preconditions that you have to fulfill to be eligible for assisted suicide .
what are they ? you need to have a terminal illness or a serious illness that you ca n't live with anymore , one that handicaps you so strongly that you can no longer lead a dignified life .
in other words , if you 're lovelorn or you 're suffering from an acute depression , then you wo n't be able to ask for assisted suicide . why are you trying to create a legal precedent here in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands is the only country where mercy killing is legal we are looking to set a test case because it is not clear whether a person can be prosecuted if they do not go to the aid of a person who is dying .
there are judgments and a statement from the ministry of justice that confirms that you can do it under certain conditions , if the person has made the decision freely and that the will of the patient should be placed above the duty to preserve life . is it possible to protect this area from abuse ? in other countries , in the united states and , as far as i know , in the uk , things are more advanced .
there are ethical committees that meet and when there is an 86-year-old and he has a serious illness and he is due for a big operation , then they will discuss whether he should be operated on or given palliative medicine .
a lot more is done to spare people from this hyper-medicine .
that should be done more in germany , too .
it should be considered when there are cases where death might be the better solution .
you do n't have to kill them .
you can just leave them .
this can be entrusted in the hands of doctors .
of course , it is open to abuse .
but this argument is not a good one .
every area in life is open to abuse .
abuse can always happen with or without assisted suicide . you referred to ethical committees .
do you want to make assisted suicide into something that the state is involved in and remove it from the private sector ? that is the sense of our campaign that we get a sensible assisted-suicide policy in germany .
it should n't be the case that this only can be carried out in private .
it should be possible in accordance with certain regulations as in switzerland .
in switzerland , a doctor visits a patient after long and thorough preparation .
you ca n't ring me and say , " doctor , will you give me a lethal injection tomorrow . "
that 's out of the question .
this topic is much too serious and much too sensitive for that . the chief accusation that has been leveled at dignitas is that it is trying to profit from people .
and that dignitas demands three times as much money as exit , another swiss-based right-to-die group .
what would you say to that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muscular-dystrophy sufferer piergiorgio welby battled in italy for his respirator to be switched off exit has 50 million members and it carried out a constant number of assisted suicides a year , 35 , 40 or 50 in a year .
they have a certain price .
for long-term members it is free and for those who have just recently joined , they take around 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,950 -rrb- .
i ca n't tell you exactly , but they take a fee and it is lower than dignitas .
from their swiss members dignitas takes 2,000 euros .
only for those coming from abroad , they take more because they have cremation costs , counseling costs that are much higher than for people in switzerland , who can just go to their local doctor .
and then fees have to be paid to the swiss authorities because costs are incurred by the foreigners .
this is n't about making money .
dignitas has a large office and , unlike exit , which works with volunteers , it works consciously with professionals . do you think you will be successful with your demands ? something will happen .
there has been so much media attention .
i think that if we make a test case , then we will see how they react .
only two things can happen .

flug said that although the reparation agreement with germany would not be amended , if there were " specific problems " germany would try to solve them .
" we did n't ask for money , we spoke of the responsibility of the german government , " added flug .
complaints that germany 's reparations fail to compensate in any reasonable way for the trauma of the holocaust are ongoing .

flug said that although the reparation agreement with germany would not be amended , if there were " specific problems " germany would try to solve them .
" we did n't ask for money , we spoke of the responsibility of the german government , " added flug .

he resigned in march 2007 to focus on his interests in alternative energy and climate change .
in october 2007 , the 39-year-old founded project better place , a company that 's working on a green transportation infrastructure based on electric cars as an alternative to fossil fuel technology . dw-tv : what will things be like in 2030 ? shai agassi : my belief is that you will not see cars going on oil .
we take oil out of the ground and look how hard it is to find oil today .
there are now oil-rigs that go 12,000 feet -lrb- 3,650 meters -rrb- into water and then another 6,000 feet into the ground - to find oil .
it is a technological marvel .
but why would you do this ?
if we can find cheaper , easier ways to drive our cars , to energize our cars we are probably going to do that . i think you are also going to have a different experience with water : we do not think about it today .
but there is a growing population of people that do not have drinking water .
yet in most of the western world , we use water to flush our sewage .
why would you take clean water and use it for sewage .
it makes absolutely no sense .
there was an economy of abundance and we are going to shift into an economy of constraints .
and when you shift into the economy of constraints , you have to come in with technological improvements to change the way we do things . we are going to need energy , we are going to need water and we are going to need food .
those three fundamentals will get a lot more attention , for example , than medicine today .
we will run out of clean water , we 've already run out of easy energy .
and we will run out of food . what is your favourite technological , futuristic gimmick ? i would say that energy is probably the biggest problem that we are facing today .
if we do not solve the energy crisis , the lack of energy , all the other good things will not happen .
we are going to get wars .
the biggest wars in the world were either started or ended as result of energy issues .
if i look at the fundamental things that are happening right now , they are all geared towards creating materials or engineering materials that will solve energy problems .
and i think that is the most exiting part of the world right now in technology . what is driving you personally to shape the future ? i think two things .
one : you wake up in the morning , you see the eyes of your kids and you have a huge responsibility to the next generation to do something with the power you are given .
all young global leaders have been tremendously lucky .
we have been fortunate to get education at a young age , we have been fortunate to be successful and we have been fortunate to be able to take risk .
some of us have been fortunate to face adversity in a way that has actually made us grow .
what do you do with it ?
if you worry about your personal wealth or personal benefits you are wasting this gift - that you are here .
so what i am mostly worried about is : how do i give back ?
i am getting to 40 , what do you give back in he next 40 years ?
it is a huge responsibility .
if you do not take it as an opportunity to serve and an opportunity to give , you are really wasting god 's gift .
i think that motivates me to wake up in the morning and go to try to solve the biggest problem that i can solve in a successful way . interview : michael wetzel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 23.11.2007 danish government calls for fresh euro referendum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danes may be shaking off their euroskeptic image the danish government is planning to hold a new referendum on whether or not to adopt the euro .
this comes seven years after danes firmly rejected the european single currency . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen also wants voters to decide whether they are still in favor of opting out of eu policy in three other areas related to joint defense , justice and home affairs .
" the time is approaching , " rasmussen told a news conference .
" it is the government 's view that the people in this parliamentary term should have the opportunity to take a stance on the danish eu opt-outs . "
rasmussen , who is a staunch supporter of the european union , said the exemptions harmed danish interests .
he did not say when the vote might be held .
but it should happen some time within the newly elected center-right government 's four-year mandate period .
government push for more integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danish prime minister is treating his re-election as a mandate to forge more eu integration he also said he wanted the recently agreed eu treaty to be quickly ratified , but did not say if this would require its own referendum .
the danes had scheduled a vote on an earlier proposed eu constitution in september 2005 , but called it off after french and dutch voters rejected the treaty .
only two of the eight parties in the danish parliament , together representing about 17 percent of the vote in last week 's election , are opposed to the eu and further co-operation .
analysts predict that , if denmark were to join the single currency , the practical economic impact would be limited because the danish krone tracks the euro .
" it will change nothing , " said danske bank chief economist steen bocian .
" the danish economy is acting as if it were a full member of the union .
there will be a limited effect on the currency but not much because it 's been extremely stable for a long period . "
polls show eu rising in popularity among danes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen is hoping that the danes will say " yes " this time around danes rejected the euro in 2000 .
the other opt-outs were secured in 1993 after the country initially rejected the maastricht treaty .
recently they seem to have warmed a little to the european bloc .
according to a poll published last month , 51 percent of nearly 1,000 danes surveyed said they were in favor of getting rid of the exemption on the euro , while 40 percent said they were opposed to the move .
the poll also indicated a majority of danes were in favor of lifting the exemptions on joint defense and judiciary cooperation , but that 73 percent wanted to maintain the exemption on european citizenship .
in the nordic region , only finland has joined the 13-member euro zone .
neighboring sweden has , like denmark , maintained its krona currency despite its eu membership , while norway and iceland have rejected even joining the eu . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes seven years after danes firmly rejected the european single currency . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen also wants voters to decide whether they are still in favor of opting out of eu policy in three other areas related to joint defense , justice and home affairs .
" the time is approaching , " rasmussen told a news conference .
" it is the government 's view that the people in this parliamentary term should have the opportunity to take a stance on the danish eu opt-outs . "
rasmussen , who is a staunch supporter of the european union , said the exemptions harmed danish interests .
he did not say when the vote might be held .
but it should happen some time within the newly elected center-right government 's four-year mandate period .
government push for more integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danish prime minister is treating his re-election as a mandate to forge more eu integration he also said he wanted the recently agreed eu treaty to be quickly ratified , but did not say if this would require its own referendum .
the danes had scheduled a vote on an earlier proposed eu constitution in september 2005 , but called it off after french and dutch voters rejected the treaty .
only two of the eight parties in the danish parliament , together representing about 17 percent of the vote in last week 's election , are opposed to the eu and further co-operation .
analysts predict that , if denmark were to join the single currency , the practical economic impact would be limited because the danish krone tracks the euro .
" it will change nothing , " said danske bank chief economist steen bocian .
" the danish economy is acting as if it were a full member of the union .
there will be a limited effect on the currency but not much because it 's been extremely stable for a long period . "
polls show eu rising in popularity among danes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen is hoping that the danes will say " yes " this time around danes rejected the euro in 2000 .
the other opt-outs were secured in 1993 after the country initially rejected the maastricht treaty .
recently they seem to have warmed a little to the european bloc .
according to a poll published last month , 51 percent of nearly 1,000 danes surveyed said they were in favor of getting rid of the exemption on the euro , while 40 percent said they were opposed to the move .
the poll also indicated a majority of danes were in favor of lifting the exemptions on joint defense and judiciary cooperation , but that 73 percent wanted to maintain the exemption on european citizenship .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 23.11.2007 german right-to-die group plans assisted-suicide test case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversy has led to criticism of germany 's low hospice provision the german branch of a swiss right-to-die organization has unleashed a storm of protest by saying it is planning to carry out an assisted suicide in germany .
dw-world.de spoke to dignitate 's deputy director . a few weeks ago , dignitas hit the headlines for helping two germans to die in a car park in switzerland .
the apparently undignified circumstances of their deaths sparked renewed criticism of the controversial organization , which has been accused of treating assisted suicide as a money-making enterprise . while assisted suicide is legal in switzerland , german law is much less clear-cut .
uwe-christian arnold , the deputy director of dignitate , the german branch of dignitas , and himself a doctor , says his group wants to set a legal precedent by carrying out an assisted suicide here in germany . the head of the german doctors ' chamber has called for dignitate to be banned . dw-world.de : why do you think your plan has created such an uproar in germany ? uwe-christian arnold : the reason that certain circles get so worked up about this topic is because it was completely taboo for decades .
it was linked to euthanasia and the nazis .
anyone who concerned themselves with this subject was lumped together with the nazis .
no one differentiated between the fact , for example , that no one asked the people who were killed then whether they wanted to die or not .
someone else decided that they should die .
that is completely different from what we 're planning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill mnd sufferer diane pretty lost her battle to change britain 's laws on assisted suicide the precondition is that the patient wants to die and that they have legitimate reason to want to end their life .
this is quite different from what the nazis did .
doctors tend to be conservative and the german medical association is particularly conservative because it was closely involved with the nazis .
they have not dealt with this past over the last 60 years .
on the occasions they did , it was always very uncomfortable . i do n't want to reproach them for the fact that they want to avoid the topic of assisted suicide , but we have to deal with this topic .
it is a pressing social need . have significant numbers of germans been traveling to switzerland to take up the services of dignitas ? no , the numbers are not very significant .
last year , there were 176 or so assisted suicides in total , 120 of those were germans .
that is a bit of an increase in the numbers of germans , but it roughly corresponds to that of previous years .
and it corresponds to the numbers going to other assisted suicide organizations , in switzerland and in oregon . the number of people who decide to end their lives in this way has remained steady . why is assisted suicide such a pressing social need ? the majority of people - 82 percent of the germans and the same numbers in england , in france , the us and canada - are in favor of legalizing assisted suicide .
in oregon it was made legal , but many other american cities want it .
and i think germany should have it .
it is a big country and the patients have big problems with this topic . is it partly a problem that was created by modern medicine ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under european law , it is up to individual states to decide on right-to-die legislation it is exclusively a problem of medicine - high tech medicine - that for decades has only been concerned with progress and it has notched up fantastic achievements .
but it has completely forgotten that death also stands , lurks , at the end of all these strivings .
making this taboo can be very unpleasant for the patient .
many people have the experience that death can be dreadful with high-tech medicine .
it can be something as simple as a feeding probe for an old person in a nursing-care home . is n't it also partly a problem that the hospice system and palliative medicine is n't sufficient in germany ? that is a very important factor .
but even if we had such good palliative medicine and hospice provision as there is in scandinavia - where they have provision for 20 percent of people against our 4 percent - then there would still be a very small minority who , if they got certain illnesses , would want to be able to determine the time when they die - and if they ca n't with the help of a doctor .
there are still illnesses that palliative medicine ca n't help , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis . there are certain preconditions that you have to fulfill to be eligible for assisted suicide .
what are they ? you need to have a terminal illness or a serious illness that you ca n't live with anymore , one that handicaps you so strongly that you can no longer lead a dignified life .
in other words , if you 're lovelorn or you 're suffering from an acute depression , then you wo n't be able to ask for assisted suicide . why are you trying to create a legal precedent here in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands is the only country where mercy killing is legal we are looking to set a test case because it is not clear whether a person can be prosecuted if they do not go to the aid of a person who is dying .
there are judgments and a statement from the ministry of justice that confirms that you can do it under certain conditions , if the person has made the decision freely and that the will of the patient should be placed above the duty to preserve life . is it possible to protect this area from abuse ? in other countries , in the united states and , as far as i know , in the uk , things are more advanced .
there are ethical committees that meet and when there is an 86-year-old and he has a serious illness and he is due for a big operation , then they will discuss whether he should be operated on or given palliative medicine .
a lot more is done to spare people from this hyper-medicine .
that should be done more in germany , too .
it should be considered when there are cases where death might be the better solution .
you do n't have to kill them .
you can just leave them .
this can be entrusted in the hands of doctors .
of course , it is open to abuse .
but this argument is not a good one .
every area in life is open to abuse .
abuse can always happen with or without assisted suicide . you referred to ethical committees .
do you want to make assisted suicide into something that the state is involved in and remove it from the private sector ? that is the sense of our campaign that we get a sensible assisted-suicide policy in germany .
it should n't be the case that this only can be carried out in private .
it should be possible in accordance with certain regulations as in switzerland .
in switzerland , a doctor visits a patient after long and thorough preparation .
you ca n't ring me and say , " doctor , will you give me a lethal injection tomorrow . "
that 's out of the question .
this topic is much too serious and much too sensitive for that . the chief accusation that has been leveled at dignitas is that it is trying to profit from people .
and that dignitas demands three times as much money as exit , another swiss-based right-to-die group .
what would you say to that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muscular-dystrophy sufferer piergiorgio welby battled in italy for his respirator to be switched off exit has 50 million members and it carried out a constant number of assisted suicides a year , 35 , 40 or 50 in a year .
they have a certain price .
for long-term members it is free and for those who have just recently joined , they take around 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,950 -rrb- .
i ca n't tell you exactly , but they take a fee and it is lower than dignitas .
from their swiss members dignitas takes 2,000 euros .
only for those coming from abroad , they take more because they have cremation costs , counseling costs that are much higher than for people in switzerland , who can just go to their local doctor .
and then fees have to be paid to the swiss authorities because costs are incurred by the foreigners .
this is n't about making money .
dignitas has a large office and , unlike exit , which works with volunteers , it works consciously with professionals . do you think you will be successful with your demands ? something will happen .
there has been so much media attention .
i think that if we make a test case , then we will see how they react .
only two things can happen .
either people will accept it , as with abortion in germany .
or we will get a reactionary solution and fall back into the middle ages .
but i 'm hopeful .
because of the churches and the medical association , abortion was also completely taboo here for years , and nowadays we can perform abortion here just like in england and other countries . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in october 2007 , the 39-year-old founded project better place , a company that 's working on a green transportation infrastructure based on electric cars as an alternative to fossil fuel technology . dw-tv : what will things be like in 2030 ? shai agassi : my belief is that you will not see cars going on oil .
we take oil out of the ground and look how hard it is to find oil today .
there are now oil-rigs that go 12,000 feet -lrb- 3,650 meters -rrb- into water and then another 6,000 feet into the ground - to find oil .
it is a technological marvel .
but why would you do this ?
if we can find cheaper , easier ways to drive our cars , to energize our cars we are probably going to do that . i think you are also going to have a different experience with water : we do not think about it today .
but there is a growing population of people that do not have drinking water .
yet in most of the western world , we use water to flush our sewage .
why would you take clean water and use it for sewage .
it makes absolutely no sense .
there was an economy of abundance and we are going to shift into an economy of constraints .
and when you shift into the economy of constraints , you have to come in with technological improvements to change the way we do things . we are going to need energy , we are going to need water and we are going to need food .
those three fundamentals will get a lot more attention , for example , than medicine today .
we will run out of clean water , we 've already run out of easy energy .
and we will run out of food . what is your favourite technological , futuristic gimmick ? i would say that energy is probably the biggest problem that we are facing today .
if we do not solve the energy crisis , the lack of energy , all the other good things will not happen .
we are going to get wars .
the biggest wars in the world were either started or ended as result of energy issues .
if i look at the fundamental things that are happening right now , they are all geared towards creating materials or engineering materials that will solve energy problems .
and i think that is the most exiting part of the world right now in technology . what is driving you personally to shape the future ? i think two things .
one : you wake up in the morning , you see the eyes of your kids and you have a huge responsibility to the next generation to do something with the power you are given .
all young global leaders have been tremendously lucky .
we have been fortunate to get education at a young age , we have been fortunate to be successful and we have been fortunate to be able to take risk .
some of us have been fortunate to face adversity in a way that has actually made us grow .
what do you do with it ?
if you worry about your personal wealth or personal benefits you are wasting this gift - that you are here .
so what i am mostly worried about is : how do i give back ?
i am getting to 40 , what do you give back in he next 40 years ?
it is a huge responsibility .
if you do not take it as an opportunity to serve and an opportunity to give , you are really wasting god 's gift .
i think that motivates me to wake up in the morning and go to try to solve the biggest problem that i can solve in a successful way . interview : michael wetzel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 23.11.2007 german right-to-die group plans assisted-suicide test case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversy has led to criticism of germany 's low hospice provision the german branch of a swiss right-to-die organization has unleashed a storm of protest by saying it is planning to carry out an assisted suicide in germany .
dw-world.de spoke to dignitate 's deputy director . a few weeks ago , dignitas hit the headlines for helping two germans to die in a car park in switzerland .
the apparently undignified circumstances of their deaths sparked renewed criticism of the controversial organization , which has been accused of treating assisted suicide as a money-making enterprise . while assisted suicide is legal in switzerland , german law is much less clear-cut .
uwe-christian arnold , the deputy director of dignitate , the german branch of dignitas , and himself a doctor , says his group wants to set a legal precedent by carrying out an assisted suicide here in germany . the head of the german doctors ' chamber has called for dignitate to be banned . dw-world.de : why do you think your plan has created such an uproar in germany ? uwe-christian arnold : the reason that certain circles get so worked up about this topic is because it was completely taboo for decades .
it was linked to euthanasia and the nazis .
anyone who concerned themselves with this subject was lumped together with the nazis .
no one differentiated between the fact , for example , that no one asked the people who were killed then whether they wanted to die or not .
someone else decided that they should die .
that is completely different from what we 're planning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill mnd sufferer diane pretty lost her battle to change britain 's laws on assisted suicide the precondition is that the patient wants to die and that they have legitimate reason to want to end their life .
this is quite different from what the nazis did .
doctors tend to be conservative and the german medical association is particularly conservative because it was closely involved with the nazis .
they have not dealt with this past over the last 60 years .
on the occasions they did , it was always very uncomfortable . i do n't want to reproach them for the fact that they want to avoid the topic of assisted suicide , but we have to deal with this topic .
it is a pressing social need . have significant numbers of germans been traveling to switzerland to take up the services of dignitas ? no , the numbers are not very significant .
last year , there were 176 or so assisted suicides in total , 120 of those were germans .
that is a bit of an increase in the numbers of germans , but it roughly corresponds to that of previous years .
and it corresponds to the numbers going to other assisted suicide organizations , in switzerland and in oregon . the number of people who decide to end their lives in this way has remained steady . why is assisted suicide such a pressing social need ? the majority of people - 82 percent of the germans and the same numbers in england , in france , the us and canada - are in favor of legalizing assisted suicide .
in oregon it was made legal , but many other american cities want it .
and i think germany should have it .
it is a big country and the patients have big problems with this topic . is it partly a problem that was created by modern medicine ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under european law , it is up to individual states to decide on right-to-die legislation it is exclusively a problem of medicine - high tech medicine - that for decades has only been concerned with progress and it has notched up fantastic achievements .
but it has completely forgotten that death also stands , lurks , at the end of all these strivings .
making this taboo can be very unpleasant for the patient .
many people have the experience that death can be dreadful with high-tech medicine .
it can be something as simple as a feeding probe for an old person in a nursing-care home . is n't it also partly a problem that the hospice system and palliative medicine is n't sufficient in germany ? that is a very important factor .
but even if we had such good palliative medicine and hospice provision as there is in scandinavia - where they have provision for 20 percent of people against our 4 percent - then there would still be a very small minority who , if they got certain illnesses , would want to be able to determine the time when they die - and if they ca n't with the help of a doctor .
there are still illnesses that palliative medicine ca n't help , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis . there are certain preconditions that you have to fulfill to be eligible for assisted suicide .
what are they ? you need to have a terminal illness or a serious illness that you ca n't live with anymore , one that handicaps you so strongly that you can no longer lead a dignified life .
in other words , if you 're lovelorn or you 're suffering from an acute depression , then you wo n't be able to ask for assisted suicide . why are you trying to create a legal precedent here in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands is the only country where mercy killing is legal we are looking to set a test case because it is not clear whether a person can be prosecuted if they do not go to the aid of a person who is dying .
there are judgments and a statement from the ministry of justice that confirms that you can do it under certain conditions , if the person has made the decision freely and that the will of the patient should be placed above the duty to preserve life . is it possible to protect this area from abuse ? in other countries , in the united states and , as far as i know , in the uk , things are more advanced .
there are ethical committees that meet and when there is an 86-year-old and he has a serious illness and he is due for a big operation , then they will discuss whether he should be operated on or given palliative medicine .
a lot more is done to spare people from this hyper-medicine .
that should be done more in germany , too .
it should be considered when there are cases where death might be the better solution .
you do n't have to kill them .
you can just leave them .
this can be entrusted in the hands of doctors .
of course , it is open to abuse .
but this argument is not a good one .
every area in life is open to abuse .
abuse can always happen with or without assisted suicide . you referred to ethical committees .
do you want to make assisted suicide into something that the state is involved in and remove it from the private sector ? that is the sense of our campaign that we get a sensible assisted-suicide policy in germany .
it should n't be the case that this only can be carried out in private .
it should be possible in accordance with certain regulations as in switzerland .
in switzerland , a doctor visits a patient after long and thorough preparation .
you ca n't ring me and say , " doctor , will you give me a lethal injection tomorrow . "
that 's out of the question .
this topic is much too serious and much too sensitive for that . the chief accusation that has been leveled at dignitas is that it is trying to profit from people .
and that dignitas demands three times as much money as exit , another swiss-based right-to-die group .
what would you say to that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muscular-dystrophy sufferer piergiorgio welby battled in italy for his respirator to be switched off exit has 50 million members and it carried out a constant number of assisted suicides a year , 35 , 40 or 50 in a year .
they have a certain price .
for long-term members it is free and for those who have just recently joined , they take around 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,950 -rrb- .
i ca n't tell you exactly , but they take a fee and it is lower than dignitas .
from their swiss members dignitas takes 2,000 euros .
only for those coming from abroad , they take more because they have cremation costs , counseling costs that are much higher than for people in switzerland , who can just go to their local doctor .
and then fees have to be paid to the swiss authorities because costs are incurred by the foreigners .
this is n't about making money .
dignitas has a large office and , unlike exit , which works with volunteers , it works consciously with professionals . do you think you will be successful with your demands ? something will happen .
there has been so much media attention .
i think that if we make a test case , then we will see how they react .
only two things can happen .
either people will accept it , as with abortion in germany .
or we will get a reactionary solution and fall back into the middle ages .
but i 'm hopeful .
because of the churches and the medical association , abortion was also completely taboo here for years , and nowadays we can perform abortion here just like in england and other countries . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in may 2006 , he was named one of time magazine 's 100 most influential people . dw-tv : what will education be like in 2030 ? jimmy wales : i think that a lot of trends that we see happening right now are going to continue .
there is an increased importance of education as technology is constantly changing .
it is really important for lots of different people to have more education than they did in the past .
if you think about computer science , the field is changing so rapidly that your college degree may be valuable in the sense of providing some real background knowledge .
but in day-to-day work it is a constant process of educating yourself on techniques and new software , new programming languages .
i think that kind of change is going to happen in more and more fields .
it will require people to learn lots of new things all the time . what kind of invention would you like to see by 2030 ? a lot of what i am frustrated with in terms of technology right now has to do with technology that has already been invented , but that just does not work as well as it should .
i think everybody has had trouble with the internet .
sometimes it is slow , sometimes it is not working .
i like the idea of the internet being available everywhere .
that is coming , but it will take a while - 10 or 20 years . some of the more exiting technologies that are a lot more visionary would be things like nano-technology , where we are inventing new kinds of materials that are going to give rise to new kinds of products , to new kind of medical cures .
those things are really going to be very important in the future . what drives you ? for me it is really my daughter and thinking about the future of the world from her perspective : what kind of planet are we building , what kind of planet are we going to leave to the next generation and what are the things that we can do today that are productive and useful and will lay down a framework , so that the next generation coming along can inherit a good planet , prosperity , health , fairness and justice and all those things .

fate is driven by the belief that young people are able to directly address the high rates of unemployment and poverty in their country .
the goal is to foster the establishment and growth of more than 5,000 businesses by 2015 , which are expected to generate employment for at least 50,000 nigerians . dw-tv : what would you like the world in 2030 to be like ? osayi oruene : i would want opportunity for growth in terms of work and businesses .
i am talking about the kind of opportunities that people do not have right now .
we have strong businesses in nigeria .
they have very strong , good ideas , good businesses , but there is no avenue for them to be able to show it to the next person in the next community . what invention would you like to see in 2030 ? if i could just sleep tonight and wake up in nigeria tomorrow morning without getting on the plane , that would be perfect .
i do not like flying and i hate jet lag . what 's driving you ? i am very passionate , first of all , about nigeria .
i always loved my country , loved the people .
we have so many resources : people , capital , things that i believe can change the country and take it to the right direction .
i also believe that there can be change .
if i can just see one person walk into my office and leave my office smiling , that is enough for me .
because i can believe that this is tomorrow .
and there is a better tomorrow for nigeria , for other africans , for the world .
i think that is what pushes me . interview : michael wetzel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

23 , that warsaw was sticking by the previous government 's decision not to adopt the eu charter of fundamental rights . before snap elections in october , tusk 's civic platform party -lrb- po -rrb- had pledged to review the policy decision .
but president lech kaczynski , the twin brother of the former prime minister , threatened to vote down the new european treaty in the event of a reversal .
the kaczynskis and their ultra-conservative allies regard the charter as being too morally liberal .
" in civic platform 's opinion , the charter would be a positive act , but a safe ratification of the treaty is the most important issue , " said tusk in his first address to parliament after his civic platform party won the elections in october .

the former polish government under jaroslaw kaczynski only agreed to support the treaty on condition that the country could opt-out of the charter .
in particular , the rightist coalition argued that the charter would limit warsaw 's ability to maintain a traditional roman catholic family policy and enable the european court of justice to force poland to grant new rights to homosexuals .
the law and justice party also warned that the charter could spur legal claims by germans who lost property after the polish-german border was redrawn after world war ii .
tusk sets course for the euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new polish pm will have to get along with the polish president until 2010 during the unveiling of his new government 's program , the new prime minister also pledged to pursue a more european-oriented policy than his euroskeptic predecessor and push towards the adoption of the euro as quickly as possible .
he also reiterated his earlier pledges to pull troops out of iraq in 2008 .
" this government will do everything to make sure poland and the poles are quickly ready for the euro , " tusk said .
he also confirmed his cabinet would lower taxes , cut the budget deficit and speed up privatization to keep up economic growth rates while pursuing its euro-zone entry .
tusk , however , did not announce a timeframe for the joining plans .
" we want to nearly balance the budget in a few years , so our road to entry is safe , " he said .

the kaczynskis and their ultra-conservative allies regard the charter as being too morally liberal .

the former polish government under jaroslaw kaczynski only agreed to support the treaty on condition that the country could opt-out of the charter .
in particular , the rightist coalition argued that the charter would limit warsaw 's ability to maintain a traditional roman catholic family policy and enable the european court of justice to force poland to grant new rights to homosexuals .
the law and justice party also warned that the charter could spur legal claims by germans who lost property after the polish-german border was redrawn after world war ii .
tusk sets course for the euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new polish pm will have to get along with the polish president until 2010 during the unveiling of his new government 's program , the new prime minister also pledged to pursue a more european-oriented policy than his euroskeptic predecessor and push towards the adoption of the euro as quickly as possible .
he also reiterated his earlier pledges to pull troops out of iraq in 2008 .
" this government will do everything to make sure poland and the poles are quickly ready for the euro , " tusk said .
he also confirmed his cabinet would lower taxes , cut the budget deficit and speed up privatization to keep up economic growth rates while pursuing its euro-zone entry .

he resigned in march 2007 to focus on his interests in alternative energy and climate change .
in october 2007 , the 39-year-old founded project better place , a company that 's working on a green transportation infrastructure based on electric cars as an alternative to fossil fuel technology . dw-tv : what will things be like in 2030 ? shai agassi : my belief is that you will not see cars going on oil .
we take oil out of the ground and look how hard it is to find oil today .
there are now oil-rigs that go 12,000 feet -lrb- 3,650 meters -rrb- into water and then another 6,000 feet into the ground - to find oil .
it is a technological marvel .
but why would you do this ?
if we can find cheaper , easier ways to drive our cars , to energize our cars we are probably going to do that . i think you are also going to have a different experience with water : we do not think about it today .
but there is a growing population of people that do not have drinking water .
yet in most of the western world , we use water to flush our sewage .
why would you take clean water and use it for sewage .
it makes absolutely no sense .
there was an economy of abundance and we are going to shift into an economy of constraints .
and when you shift into the economy of constraints , you have to come in with technological improvements to change the way we do things . we are going to need energy , we are going to need water and we are going to need food .
those three fundamentals will get a lot more attention , for example , than medicine today .
we will run out of clean water , we 've already run out of easy energy .
and we will run out of food . what is your favourite technological , futuristic gimmick ? i would say that energy is probably the biggest problem that we are facing today .
if we do not solve the energy crisis , the lack of energy , all the other good things will not happen .
we are going to get wars .
the biggest wars in the world were either started or ended as result of energy issues .
if i look at the fundamental things that are happening right now , they are all geared towards creating materials or engineering materials that will solve energy problems .
and i think that is the most exiting part of the world right now in technology . what is driving you personally to shape the future ? i think two things .
one : you wake up in the morning , you see the eyes of your kids and you have a huge responsibility to the next generation to do something with the power you are given .
all young global leaders have been tremendously lucky .
we have been fortunate to get education at a young age , we have been fortunate to be successful and we have been fortunate to be able to take risk .
some of us have been fortunate to face adversity in a way that has actually made us grow .
what do you do with it ?
if you worry about your personal wealth or personal benefits you are wasting this gift - that you are here .
so what i am mostly worried about is : how do i give back ?
i am getting to 40 , what do you give back in he next 40 years ?
it is a huge responsibility .
if you do not take it as an opportunity to serve and an opportunity to give , you are really wasting god 's gift .

they say security is threatened .
passport controls are being scrapped under the schengen system . under the plans , around 1,850 officers will be withdrawn from the area when germany 's borders with poland and the czech republic are completely opened on dec .
21 .
on that day , six other former communist countries in eastern europe as well as malta will also join the european union 's schengen system , which does away with passport controls at the borders of participating states .
many germans in the border region have expressed fears that opening the borders could lead to an influx of petty criminals , such as shoplifters , burglars and car thieves .
reforms criticized for coming too soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emphasis will switch to joint mobile police patrols german police carried banners saying : " yes to europe , no to hasty reforms , " on their march on thursday , nov .
22 , from the border to the venue of a meeting attended by interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
the head of the police union gdp , konrad freiberg , said in a radio interview that the opening of the border was " premature " in terms of security .
he said important communication systems were not yet in place .
schäuble rejected the claims .
" on the contrary , switching from stationary border controls to mobile border surveillance will lead to a growth in freedom and an increase in security , " he said after meeting his counterpart grzegorz schetyna in the baltic resort of heringsdorf .
schäuble stressed that the worries of the population were being taken seriously and that the move had been prepared carefully in partnership with germany 's eastern neighbors .
he said joint patrols would be intensified on both sides of the border .
a german-polish center is planned in the polish town of swiecko for customs and security officials .
police unprepared ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much closer cooperation is envisaged between germany and its eastern neighbors gdp head freiberg also said the eastern european states did not have the same security standards as germany and had problems with corruption , equipment and police cooperation .
in contrast , the head of german police union dpoig , rainer wendt , criticized the state of the german force 's equipment .
he said there were no computers in german patrol cars and no digital radios to facilitate carrying out mobile checks , and no real deployment strategy .
with the nine new schengen members - the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia - the countries covered by the accord now number 24 .
schengen facilitates freedom of movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the moves will make travel easier for non-eu tourists the lifting of restrictions applies only to land and sea borders at first .
passport control at airports are to remain in place until the end of march 2008 .
named after a small village in luxembourg where it was signed in 1985 , the schengen agreement abolishes internal border controls among participating states .
this means people can travel from one schengen country to another without having their passports checked , and non-eu visitors can travel to all schengen states on a single visa . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he resigned in march 2007 to focus on his interests in alternative energy and climate change .
in october 2007 , the 39-year-old founded project better place , a company that 's working on a green transportation infrastructure based on electric cars as an alternative to fossil fuel technology . dw-tv : what will things be like in 2030 ? shai agassi : my belief is that you will not see cars going on oil .
we take oil out of the ground and look how hard it is to find oil today .
there are now oil-rigs that go 12,000 feet -lrb- 3,650 meters -rrb- into water and then another 6,000 feet into the ground - to find oil .
it is a technological marvel .
but why would you do this ?
if we can find cheaper , easier ways to drive our cars , to energize our cars we are probably going to do that . i think you are also going to have a different experience with water : we do not think about it today .
but there is a growing population of people that do not have drinking water .
yet in most of the western world , we use water to flush our sewage .
why would you take clean water and use it for sewage .
it makes absolutely no sense .
there was an economy of abundance and we are going to shift into an economy of constraints .
and when you shift into the economy of constraints , you have to come in with technological improvements to change the way we do things . we are going to need energy , we are going to need water and we are going to need food .
those three fundamentals will get a lot more attention , for example , than medicine today .
we will run out of clean water , we 've already run out of easy energy .
and we will run out of food . what is your favourite technological , futuristic gimmick ? i would say that energy is probably the biggest problem that we are facing today .
if we do not solve the energy crisis , the lack of energy , all the other good things will not happen .
we are going to get wars .
the biggest wars in the world were either started or ended as result of energy issues .
if i look at the fundamental things that are happening right now , they are all geared towards creating materials or engineering materials that will solve energy problems .
and i think that is the most exiting part of the world right now in technology . what is driving you personally to shape the future ? i think two things .
one : you wake up in the morning , you see the eyes of your kids and you have a huge responsibility to the next generation to do something with the power you are given .
all young global leaders have been tremendously lucky .
we have been fortunate to get education at a young age , we have been fortunate to be successful and we have been fortunate to be able to take risk .
some of us have been fortunate to face adversity in a way that has actually made us grow .
what do you do with it ?
if you worry about your personal wealth or personal benefits you are wasting this gift - that you are here .
so what i am mostly worried about is : how do i give back ?
i am getting to 40 , what do you give back in he next 40 years ?
it is a huge responsibility .
if you do not take it as an opportunity to serve and an opportunity to give , you are really wasting god 's gift .
i think that motivates me to wake up in the morning and go to try to solve the biggest problem that i can solve in a successful way . interview : michael wetzel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she died on tuesday , nov .
20 , after being admitted to a hospital in schwerin , weighing just over seven kilos -lrb- 15 pounds -rrb- - three times less than an average child her age .
her death has prompted calls from politicians for more thorough preemptive controls .
" i am a vehement advocate of making preventative medical check-ups compulsory , " kerstin griese , the social democratic chairwoman of the german parliament 's family affairs committee told the daily berliner zeitung on friday .
" this would provide a fundamental building block for child protection . "
but wolfram hartmann , president of the pediatricians association , told dpa that gaps between such visits are too long to make them effective .
" it would be wrong to think that compulsory health checks could prevent cases of child neglect , " he said .
instead , hartmann argued for greater cooperation between health officials and social workers .
opposition parties agree that the problem is a result of authorities failing to do their job .
" given that cuts have been made in youth-protection offices for years , it should come as no surprise that these cases happen , " said jörn wunderlich from the left party .
effects of cost-cutting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors need to be attuned to signs of possible abuse every time such stories make the headlines in germany , the nation is left wondering how these families can fall through the net .
fingers are invariably pointed at the child-protection services .
when a two-year old died in bremen last year , many blamed the local welfare office which had left the boy in the care of his drug-addicted foster father despite repeated warnings .
the authorities in schwerin have also come in for criticism .
hermann junghans , head of schwerin social services , insists that welfare officers did their job properly but has admitted that the two social workers who visited the family a fortnight ago after an anonymous tip-off had " found nothing amiss . "
neighbors , meanwhile , said the two social workers never actually entered the apartment .
according to newspaper reports , heike seifert , head of schwerin 's youth welfare office , complained to the local council earlier this year that financial cuts were hampering the work of the office .
on friday , schwerin 's mayor , norbert claussen , acknowledged flaws in the welfare system .
lea-sophie 's death " showed that adequate mechanisms are not in place , " he said in a statement .
heike seifert , meanwhile , was quoted in the daily taz as saying that this was by no means the first time that children had been admitted with symptoms of malnutrition to hospitals in schwerin .
the number of child endangerment cases has been increasing in the town , confirmed junghans at a press conference this week .
eighty-six cases were registered in the first six months of 2007 .

she died on tuesday , nov .
20 , after being admitted to a hospital in schwerin , weighing just over seven kilos -lrb- 15 pounds -rrb- - three times less than an average child her age .
her death has prompted calls from politicians for more thorough preemptive controls .
" i am a vehement advocate of making preventative medical check-ups compulsory , " kerstin griese , the social democratic chairwoman of the german parliament 's family affairs committee told the daily berliner zeitung on friday .
" this would provide a fundamental building block for child protection . "
but wolfram hartmann , president of the pediatricians association , told dpa that gaps between such visits are too long to make them effective .
" it would be wrong to think that compulsory health checks could prevent cases of child neglect , " he said .
instead , hartmann argued for greater cooperation between health officials and social workers .
opposition parties agree that the problem is a result of authorities failing to do their job .
" given that cuts have been made in youth-protection offices for years , it should come as no surprise that these cases happen , " said jörn wunderlich from the left party .

fingers are invariably pointed at the child-protection services .
when a two-year old died in bremen last year , many blamed the local welfare office which had left the boy in the care of his drug-addicted foster father despite repeated warnings .
the authorities in schwerin have also come in for criticism .
hermann junghans , head of schwerin social services , insists that welfare officers did their job properly but has admitted that the two social workers who visited the family a fortnight ago after an anonymous tip-off had " found nothing amiss . "
neighbors , meanwhile , said the two social workers never actually entered the apartment .
according to newspaper reports , heike seifert , head of schwerin 's youth welfare office , complained to the local council earlier this year that financial cuts were hampering the work of the office .
on friday , schwerin 's mayor , norbert claussen , acknowledged flaws in the welfare system .
lea-sophie 's death " showed that adequate mechanisms are not in place , " he said in a statement .
heike seifert , meanwhile , was quoted in the daily taz as saying that this was by no means the first time that children had been admitted with symptoms of malnutrition to hospitals in schwerin .
the number of child endangerment cases has been increasing in the town , confirmed junghans at a press conference this week .
eighty-six cases were registered in the first six months of 2007 .

with more than 1 million articles in english , wikipedia has become one of the largest collaboratively edited reference projects in the world and one of the 15 most visited web sites on the internet .

he is also founder of the for-profit company wikia , inc .
in may 2006 , he was named one of time magazine 's 100 most influential people . dw-tv : what will education be like in 2030 ? jimmy wales : i think that a lot of trends that we see happening right now are going to continue .
there is an increased importance of education as technology is constantly changing .
it is really important for lots of different people to have more education than they did in the past .
if you think about computer science , the field is changing so rapidly that your college degree may be valuable in the sense of providing some real background knowledge .
but in day-to-day work it is a constant process of educating yourself on techniques and new software , new programming languages .
i think that kind of change is going to happen in more and more fields .
it will require people to learn lots of new things all the time . what kind of invention would you like to see by 2030 ? a lot of what i am frustrated with in terms of technology right now has to do with technology that has already been invented , but that just does not work as well as it should .
i think everybody has had trouble with the internet .
sometimes it is slow , sometimes it is not working .
i like the idea of the internet being available everywhere .
that is coming , but it will take a while - 10 or 20 years . some of the more exiting technologies that are a lot more visionary would be things like nano-technology , where we are inventing new kinds of materials that are going to give rise to new kinds of products , to new kind of medical cures .
those things are really going to be very important in the future . what drives you ? for me it is really my daughter and thinking about the future of the world from her perspective : what kind of planet are we building , what kind of planet are we going to leave to the next generation and what are the things that we can do today that are productive and useful and will lay down a framework , so that the next generation coming along can inherit a good planet , prosperity , health , fairness and justice and all those things .
that is the kind of thing that inspires me - to think about my own daughter .
maybe it is corny but it is true . interview : michael wetzel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 23.11.2007 german right-to-die group plans assisted-suicide test case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversy has led to criticism of germany 's low hospice provision the german branch of a swiss right-to-die organization has unleashed a storm of protest by saying it is planning to carry out an assisted suicide in germany .
dw-world.de spoke to dignitate 's deputy director . a few weeks ago , dignitas hit the headlines for helping two germans to die in a car park in switzerland .
the apparently undignified circumstances of their deaths sparked renewed criticism of the controversial organization , which has been accused of treating assisted suicide as a money-making enterprise . while assisted suicide is legal in switzerland , german law is much less clear-cut .
uwe-christian arnold , the deputy director of dignitate , the german branch of dignitas , and himself a doctor , says his group wants to set a legal precedent by carrying out an assisted suicide here in germany . the head of the german doctors ' chamber has called for dignitate to be banned . dw-world.de : why do you think your plan has created such an uproar in germany ? uwe-christian arnold : the reason that certain circles get so worked up about this topic is because it was completely taboo for decades .
it was linked to euthanasia and the nazis .
anyone who concerned themselves with this subject was lumped together with the nazis .
no one differentiated between the fact , for example , that no one asked the people who were killed then whether they wanted to die or not .
someone else decided that they should die .
that is completely different from what we 're planning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill mnd sufferer diane pretty lost her battle to change britain 's laws on assisted suicide the precondition is that the patient wants to die and that they have legitimate reason to want to end their life .
this is quite different from what the nazis did .
doctors tend to be conservative and the german medical association is particularly conservative because it was closely involved with the nazis .
they have not dealt with this past over the last 60 years .
on the occasions they did , it was always very uncomfortable . i do n't want to reproach them for the fact that they want to avoid the topic of assisted suicide , but we have to deal with this topic .
it is a pressing social need . have significant numbers of germans been traveling to switzerland to take up the services of dignitas ? no , the numbers are not very significant .
last year , there were 176 or so assisted suicides in total , 120 of those were germans .
that is a bit of an increase in the numbers of germans , but it roughly corresponds to that of previous years .
and it corresponds to the numbers going to other assisted suicide organizations , in switzerland and in oregon . the number of people who decide to end their lives in this way has remained steady . why is assisted suicide such a pressing social need ? the majority of people - 82 percent of the germans and the same numbers in england , in france , the us and canada - are in favor of legalizing assisted suicide .
in oregon it was made legal , but many other american cities want it .
and i think germany should have it .
it is a big country and the patients have big problems with this topic . is it partly a problem that was created by modern medicine ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under european law , it is up to individual states to decide on right-to-die legislation it is exclusively a problem of medicine - high tech medicine - that for decades has only been concerned with progress and it has notched up fantastic achievements .
but it has completely forgotten that death also stands , lurks , at the end of all these strivings .
making this taboo can be very unpleasant for the patient .
many people have the experience that death can be dreadful with high-tech medicine .
it can be something as simple as a feeding probe for an old person in a nursing-care home . is n't it also partly a problem that the hospice system and palliative medicine is n't sufficient in germany ? that is a very important factor .
but even if we had such good palliative medicine and hospice provision as there is in scandinavia - where they have provision for 20 percent of people against our 4 percent - then there would still be a very small minority who , if they got certain illnesses , would want to be able to determine the time when they die - and if they ca n't with the help of a doctor .
there are still illnesses that palliative medicine ca n't help , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis . there are certain preconditions that you have to fulfill to be eligible for assisted suicide .
what are they ? you need to have a terminal illness or a serious illness that you ca n't live with anymore , one that handicaps you so strongly that you can no longer lead a dignified life .
in other words , if you 're lovelorn or you 're suffering from an acute depression , then you wo n't be able to ask for assisted suicide . why are you trying to create a legal precedent here in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands is the only country where mercy killing is legal we are looking to set a test case because it is not clear whether a person can be prosecuted if they do not go to the aid of a person who is dying .
there are judgments and a statement from the ministry of justice that confirms that you can do it under certain conditions , if the person has made the decision freely and that the will of the patient should be placed above the duty to preserve life . is it possible to protect this area from abuse ? in other countries , in the united states and , as far as i know , in the uk , things are more advanced .
there are ethical committees that meet and when there is an 86-year-old and he has a serious illness and he is due for a big operation , then they will discuss whether he should be operated on or given palliative medicine .
a lot more is done to spare people from this hyper-medicine .
that should be done more in germany , too .
it should be considered when there are cases where death might be the better solution .
you do n't have to kill them .
you can just leave them .
this can be entrusted in the hands of doctors .
of course , it is open to abuse .
but this argument is not a good one .
every area in life is open to abuse .
abuse can always happen with or without assisted suicide . you referred to ethical committees .
do you want to make assisted suicide into something that the state is involved in and remove it from the private sector ? that is the sense of our campaign that we get a sensible assisted-suicide policy in germany .
it should n't be the case that this only can be carried out in private .
it should be possible in accordance with certain regulations as in switzerland .
in switzerland , a doctor visits a patient after long and thorough preparation .
you ca n't ring me and say , " doctor , will you give me a lethal injection tomorrow . "
that 's out of the question .
this topic is much too serious and much too sensitive for that . the chief accusation that has been leveled at dignitas is that it is trying to profit from people .
and that dignitas demands three times as much money as exit , another swiss-based right-to-die group .
what would you say to that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muscular-dystrophy sufferer piergiorgio welby battled in italy for his respirator to be switched off exit has 50 million members and it carried out a constant number of assisted suicides a year , 35 , 40 or 50 in a year .
they have a certain price .
for long-term members it is free and for those who have just recently joined , they take around 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,950 -rrb- .
i ca n't tell you exactly , but they take a fee and it is lower than dignitas .
from their swiss members dignitas takes 2,000 euros .
only for those coming from abroad , they take more because they have cremation costs , counseling costs that are much higher than for people in switzerland , who can just go to their local doctor .
and then fees have to be paid to the swiss authorities because costs are incurred by the foreigners .
this is n't about making money .
dignitas has a large office and , unlike exit , which works with volunteers , it works consciously with professionals . do you think you will be successful with your demands ? something will happen .
there has been so much media attention .
i think that if we make a test case , then we will see how they react .
only two things can happen .
either people will accept it , as with abortion in germany .
or we will get a reactionary solution and fall back into the middle ages .
but i 'm hopeful .
because of the churches and the medical association , abortion was also completely taboo here for years , and nowadays we can perform abortion here just like in england and other countries . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to dignitate 's deputy director . a few weeks ago , dignitas hit the headlines for helping two germans to die in a car park in switzerland .
the apparently undignified circumstances of their deaths sparked renewed criticism of the controversial organization , which has been accused of treating assisted suicide as a money-making enterprise . while assisted suicide is legal in switzerland , german law is much less clear-cut .
uwe-christian arnold , the deputy director of dignitate , the german branch of dignitas , and himself a doctor , says his group wants to set a legal precedent by carrying out an assisted suicide here in germany . the head of the german doctors ' chamber has called for dignitate to be banned . dw-world.de : why do you think your plan has created such an uproar in germany ? uwe-christian arnold : the reason that certain circles get so worked up about this topic is because it was completely taboo for decades .
it was linked to euthanasia and the nazis .
anyone who concerned themselves with this subject was lumped together with the nazis .
no one differentiated between the fact , for example , that no one asked the people who were killed then whether they wanted to die or not .
someone else decided that they should die .
that is completely different from what we 're planning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill mnd sufferer diane pretty lost her battle to change britain 's laws on assisted suicide the precondition is that the patient wants to die and that they have legitimate reason to want to end their life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 23.11.2007 german right-to-die group plans assisted-suicide test case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversy has led to criticism of germany 's low hospice provision the german branch of a swiss right-to-die organization has unleashed a storm of protest by saying it is planning to carry out an assisted suicide in germany .
dw-world.de spoke to dignitate 's deputy director . a few weeks ago , dignitas hit the headlines for helping two germans to die in a car park in switzerland .
the apparently undignified circumstances of their deaths sparked renewed criticism of the controversial organization , which has been accused of treating assisted suicide as a money-making enterprise . while assisted suicide is legal in switzerland , german law is much less clear-cut .
uwe-christian arnold , the deputy director of dignitate , the german branch of dignitas , and himself a doctor , says his group wants to set a legal precedent by carrying out an assisted suicide here in germany . the head of the german doctors ' chamber has called for dignitate to be banned . dw-world.de : why do you think your plan has created such an uproar in germany ? uwe-christian arnold : the reason that certain circles get so worked up about this topic is because it was completely taboo for decades .
it was linked to euthanasia and the nazis .
anyone who concerned themselves with this subject was lumped together with the nazis .
no one differentiated between the fact , for example , that no one asked the people who were killed then whether they wanted to die or not .
someone else decided that they should die .
that is completely different from what we 're planning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill mnd sufferer diane pretty lost her battle to change britain 's laws on assisted suicide the precondition is that the patient wants to die and that they have legitimate reason to want to end their life .
this is quite different from what the nazis did .
doctors tend to be conservative and the german medical association is particularly conservative because it was closely involved with the nazis .
they have not dealt with this past over the last 60 years .
on the occasions they did , it was always very uncomfortable . i do n't want to reproach them for the fact that they want to avoid the topic of assisted suicide , but we have to deal with this topic .
it is a pressing social need . have significant numbers of germans been traveling to switzerland to take up the services of dignitas ? no , the numbers are not very significant .
last year , there were 176 or so assisted suicides in total , 120 of those were germans .
that is a bit of an increase in the numbers of germans , but it roughly corresponds to that of previous years .
and it corresponds to the numbers going to other assisted suicide organizations , in switzerland and in oregon . the number of people who decide to end their lives in this way has remained steady . why is assisted suicide such a pressing social need ? the majority of people - 82 percent of the germans and the same numbers in england , in france , the us and canada - are in favor of legalizing assisted suicide .
in oregon it was made legal , but many other american cities want it .
and i think germany should have it .
it is a big country and the patients have big problems with this topic . is it partly a problem that was created by modern medicine ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under european law , it is up to individual states to decide on right-to-die legislation it is exclusively a problem of medicine - high tech medicine - that for decades has only been concerned with progress and it has notched up fantastic achievements .
but it has completely forgotten that death also stands , lurks , at the end of all these strivings .
making this taboo can be very unpleasant for the patient .
many people have the experience that death can be dreadful with high-tech medicine .
it can be something as simple as a feeding probe for an old person in a nursing-care home . is n't it also partly a problem that the hospice system and palliative medicine is n't sufficient in germany ? that is a very important factor .
but even if we had such good palliative medicine and hospice provision as there is in scandinavia - where they have provision for 20 percent of people against our 4 percent - then there would still be a very small minority who , if they got certain illnesses , would want to be able to determine the time when they die - and if they ca n't with the help of a doctor .
there are still illnesses that palliative medicine ca n't help , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis . there are certain preconditions that you have to fulfill to be eligible for assisted suicide .
what are they ? you need to have a terminal illness or a serious illness that you ca n't live with anymore , one that handicaps you so strongly that you can no longer lead a dignified life .
in other words , if you 're lovelorn or you 're suffering from an acute depression , then you wo n't be able to ask for assisted suicide . why are you trying to create a legal precedent here in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands is the only country where mercy killing is legal we are looking to set a test case because it is not clear whether a person can be prosecuted if they do not go to the aid of a person who is dying .
there are judgments and a statement from the ministry of justice that confirms that you can do it under certain conditions , if the person has made the decision freely and that the will of the patient should be placed above the duty to preserve life . is it possible to protect this area from abuse ? in other countries , in the united states and , as far as i know , in the uk , things are more advanced .
there are ethical committees that meet and when there is an 86-year-old and he has a serious illness and he is due for a big operation , then they will discuss whether he should be operated on or given palliative medicine .
a lot more is done to spare people from this hyper-medicine .
that should be done more in germany , too .
it should be considered when there are cases where death might be the better solution .
you do n't have to kill them .
you can just leave them .
this can be entrusted in the hands of doctors .
of course , it is open to abuse .
but this argument is not a good one .
every area in life is open to abuse .
abuse can always happen with or without assisted suicide . you referred to ethical committees .
do you want to make assisted suicide into something that the state is involved in and remove it from the private sector ? that is the sense of our campaign that we get a sensible assisted-suicide policy in germany .
it should n't be the case that this only can be carried out in private .
it should be possible in accordance with certain regulations as in switzerland .
in switzerland , a doctor visits a patient after long and thorough preparation .
you ca n't ring me and say , " doctor , will you give me a lethal injection tomorrow . "
that 's out of the question .
this topic is much too serious and much too sensitive for that . the chief accusation that has been leveled at dignitas is that it is trying to profit from people .
and that dignitas demands three times as much money as exit , another swiss-based right-to-die group .
what would you say to that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muscular-dystrophy sufferer piergiorgio welby battled in italy for his respirator to be switched off exit has 50 million members and it carried out a constant number of assisted suicides a year , 35 , 40 or 50 in a year .
they have a certain price .
for long-term members it is free and for those who have just recently joined , they take around 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,950 -rrb- .
i ca n't tell you exactly , but they take a fee and it is lower than dignitas .
from their swiss members dignitas takes 2,000 euros .
only for those coming from abroad , they take more because they have cremation costs , counseling costs that are much higher than for people in switzerland , who can just go to their local doctor .
and then fees have to be paid to the swiss authorities because costs are incurred by the foreigners .
this is n't about making money .
dignitas has a large office and , unlike exit , which works with volunteers , it works consciously with professionals . do you think you will be successful with your demands ? something will happen .
there has been so much media attention .
i think that if we make a test case , then we will see how they react .
only two things can happen .
either people will accept it , as with abortion in germany .
or we will get a reactionary solution and fall back into the middle ages .
but i 'm hopeful .
because of the churches and the medical association , abortion was also completely taboo here for years , and nowadays we can perform abortion here just like in england and other countries . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes seven years after danes firmly rejected the european single currency . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen also wants voters to decide whether they are still in favor of opting out of eu policy in three other areas related to joint defense , justice and home affairs .
" the time is approaching , " rasmussen told a news conference .
" it is the government 's view that the people in this parliamentary term should have the opportunity to take a stance on the danish eu opt-outs . "
rasmussen , who is a staunch supporter of the european union , said the exemptions harmed danish interests .
he did not say when the vote might be held .
but it should happen some time within the newly elected center-right government 's four-year mandate period .
government push for more integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danish prime minister is treating his re-election as a mandate to forge more eu integration he also said he wanted the recently agreed eu treaty to be quickly ratified , but did not say if this would require its own referendum .
the danes had scheduled a vote on an earlier proposed eu constitution in september 2005 , but called it off after french and dutch voters rejected the treaty .
only two of the eight parties in the danish parliament , together representing about 17 percent of the vote in last week 's election , are opposed to the eu and further co-operation .
analysts predict that , if denmark were to join the single currency , the practical economic impact would be limited because the danish krone tracks the euro .
" it will change nothing , " said danske bank chief economist steen bocian .
" the danish economy is acting as if it were a full member of the union .
there will be a limited effect on the currency but not much because it 's been extremely stable for a long period . "
polls show eu rising in popularity among danes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen is hoping that the danes will say " yes " this time around danes rejected the euro in 2000 .
the other opt-outs were secured in 1993 after the country initially rejected the maastricht treaty .
recently they seem to have warmed a little to the european bloc .
according to a poll published last month , 51 percent of nearly 1,000 danes surveyed said they were in favor of getting rid of the exemption on the euro , while 40 percent said they were opposed to the move .
the poll also indicated a majority of danes were in favor of lifting the exemptions on joint defense and judiciary cooperation , but that 73 percent wanted to maintain the exemption on european citizenship .
in the nordic region , only finland has joined the 13-member euro zone .
neighboring sweden has , like denmark , maintained its krona currency despite its eu membership , while norway and iceland have rejected even joining the eu . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the existing deal is signed and final and there is no need to change it , " said steinbrück after meeting with the chairman of the center of organizations of holocaust survivors in israel , noah flug .
flug said that although the reparation agreement with germany would not be amended , if there were " specific problems " germany would try to solve them .
" we did n't ask for money , we spoke of the responsibility of the german government , " added flug .
complaints that germany 's reparations fail to compensate in any reasonable way for the trauma of the holocaust are ongoing .
but the israeli holocaust survivors who met with steinbrück on thursday , nov .
23 , to request improvements to the reparations arrangement specifically argued that the original agreement failed to take into account today 's longer life expectancy or the tens of thousands of survivors who immigrated to israel after the fall of the soviet union .
according to news agency dpa , steinbrück did agree that germany would try to help needy survivors via the claims committee , the international organization that coordinates compensation payments to survivors .
an unofficial request ?
earlier this month , an israeli paper published comments by israel 's pensioners affairs minister rafael eytan saying israel was keen to reopen the deal , but he later said he was misquoted and only wished to examine with germany ways to support survivors given the ' holes ' in the original agreement .
on thursday , a spokeswomen for the israeli finance ministry confirmed that israel has never officially requested germany revise the reparations deal .
the luxembourg agreement between the two countries stipulated that germany would pay israel reparations , and israel would look after the survivors , who would not be permitted to sue germany directly .
since the 1950s , germany has paid 26 billion euros -lrb- $ 38 billion -rrb- in compensation .
around 1.7 billion of this went to israel , the rest to german claimants .
israel takes responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 240,000 holocaust survivors live in israel others say that israel 's reliance on germany is unreasonable and that the country should look after its elderly holocaust survivors itself .
after a recent storm of protest by holocaust survivors who accused the government of abandoning them , prime minister ehud olmert announced that for the first time in its history , the israeli government would pay monthly allowances from its own budget to holocaust survivors and refugees .
the state agreed to give israelis who survived nazi ghettos and concentration camps a monthly stipend of nearly $ 300 -lrb- $ 200 -rrb- , in addition to tax discounts and other breaks .
it also approved monthly payments ranging from $ 40 to $ 125 for 80,000 israelis , most from the former soviet union , who became refugees as the nazis conquered europe but never lived under nazi occupation .

" the existing deal is signed and final and there is no need to change it , " said steinbrück after meeting with the chairman of the center of organizations of holocaust survivors in israel , noah flug .
flug said that although the reparation agreement with germany would not be amended , if there were " specific problems " germany would try to solve them .
" we did n't ask for money , we spoke of the responsibility of the german government , " added flug .
complaints that germany 's reparations fail to compensate in any reasonable way for the trauma of the holocaust are ongoing .
but the israeli holocaust survivors who met with steinbrück on thursday , nov .
23 , to request improvements to the reparations arrangement specifically argued that the original agreement failed to take into account today 's longer life expectancy or the tens of thousands of survivors who immigrated to israel after the fall of the soviet union .
according to news agency dpa , steinbrück did agree that germany would try to help needy survivors via the claims committee , the international organization that coordinates compensation payments to survivors .
an unofficial request ?
earlier this month , an israeli paper published comments by israel 's pensioners affairs minister rafael eytan saying israel was keen to reopen the deal , but he later said he was misquoted and only wished to examine with germany ways to support survivors given the ' holes ' in the original agreement .
on thursday , a spokeswomen for the israeli finance ministry confirmed that israel has never officially requested germany revise the reparations deal .
the luxembourg agreement between the two countries stipulated that germany would pay israel reparations , and israel would look after the survivors , who would not be permitted to sue germany directly .
since the 1950s , germany has paid 26 billion euros -lrb- $ 38 billion -rrb- in compensation .
around 1.7 billion of this went to israel , the rest to german claimants .
israel takes responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 240,000 holocaust survivors live in israel others say that israel 's reliance on germany is unreasonable and that the country should look after its elderly holocaust survivors itself .
after a recent storm of protest by holocaust survivors who accused the government of abandoning them , prime minister ehud olmert announced that for the first time in its history , the israeli government would pay monthly allowances from its own budget to holocaust survivors and refugees .
the state agreed to give israelis who survived nazi ghettos and concentration camps a monthly stipend of nearly $ 300 -lrb- $ 200 -rrb- , in addition to tax discounts and other breaks .
it also approved monthly payments ranging from $ 40 to $ 125 for 80,000 israelis , most from the former soviet union , who became refugees as the nazis conquered europe but never lived under nazi occupation .

there is an increased importance of education as technology is constantly changing .
it is really important for lots of different people to have more education than they did in the past .
if you think about computer science , the field is changing so rapidly that your college degree may be valuable in the sense of providing some real background knowledge .

it will require people to learn lots of new things all the time . what kind of invention would you like to see by 2030 ? a lot of what i am frustrated with in terms of technology right now has to do with technology that has already been invented , but that just does not work as well as it should .

that is coming , but it will take a while - 10 or 20 years . some of the more exiting technologies that are a lot more visionary would be things like nano-technology , where we are inventing new kinds of materials that are going to give rise to new kinds of products , to new kind of medical cures .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 23.11.2007 no more holocaust reparations , says german finance minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück pays his respects at the yad vashem memorial finance minister peer steinbrück said in jerusalem thursday that germany had no plans to renegotiate a holocaust reparations deal signed with israel in 1952 . " the existing deal is signed and final and there is no need to change it , " said steinbrück after meeting with the chairman of the center of organizations of holocaust survivors in israel , noah flug .
flug said that although the reparation agreement with germany would not be amended , if there were " specific problems " germany would try to solve them .
" we did n't ask for money , we spoke of the responsibility of the german government , " added flug .
complaints that germany 's reparations fail to compensate in any reasonable way for the trauma of the holocaust are ongoing .
but the israeli holocaust survivors who met with steinbrück on thursday , nov .
23 , to request improvements to the reparations arrangement specifically argued that the original agreement failed to take into account today 's longer life expectancy or the tens of thousands of survivors who immigrated to israel after the fall of the soviet union .
according to news agency dpa , steinbrück did agree that germany would try to help needy survivors via the claims committee , the international organization that coordinates compensation payments to survivors .
an unofficial request ?
earlier this month , an israeli paper published comments by israel 's pensioners affairs minister rafael eytan saying israel was keen to reopen the deal , but he later said he was misquoted and only wished to examine with germany ways to support survivors given the ' holes ' in the original agreement .
on thursday , a spokeswomen for the israeli finance ministry confirmed that israel has never officially requested germany revise the reparations deal .
the luxembourg agreement between the two countries stipulated that germany would pay israel reparations , and israel would look after the survivors , who would not be permitted to sue germany directly .
since the 1950s , germany has paid 26 billion euros -lrb- $ 38 billion -rrb- in compensation .
around 1.7 billion of this went to israel , the rest to german claimants .
israel takes responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 240,000 holocaust survivors live in israel others say that israel 's reliance on germany is unreasonable and that the country should look after its elderly holocaust survivors itself .
after a recent storm of protest by holocaust survivors who accused the government of abandoning them , prime minister ehud olmert announced that for the first time in its history , the israeli government would pay monthly allowances from its own budget to holocaust survivors and refugees .
the state agreed to give israelis who survived nazi ghettos and concentration camps a monthly stipend of nearly $ 300 -lrb- $ 200 -rrb- , in addition to tax discounts and other breaks .
it also approved monthly payments ranging from $ 40 to $ 125 for 80,000 israelis , most from the former soviet union , who became refugees as the nazis conquered europe but never lived under nazi occupation .
one-third of pensioners in israel are holocaust survivors .
nearly a third of them live below the poverty line , recent welfare reports have shown . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 23.11.2007 danish government calls for fresh euro referendum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danes may be shaking off their euroskeptic image the danish government is planning to hold a new referendum on whether or not to adopt the euro .
this comes seven years after danes firmly rejected the european single currency . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen also wants voters to decide whether they are still in favor of opting out of eu policy in three other areas related to joint defense , justice and home affairs .
" the time is approaching , " rasmussen told a news conference .
" it is the government 's view that the people in this parliamentary term should have the opportunity to take a stance on the danish eu opt-outs . "
rasmussen , who is a staunch supporter of the european union , said the exemptions harmed danish interests .
he did not say when the vote might be held .
but it should happen some time within the newly elected center-right government 's four-year mandate period .
government push for more integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danish prime minister is treating his re-election as a mandate to forge more eu integration he also said he wanted the recently agreed eu treaty to be quickly ratified , but did not say if this would require its own referendum .
the danes had scheduled a vote on an earlier proposed eu constitution in september 2005 , but called it off after french and dutch voters rejected the treaty .
only two of the eight parties in the danish parliament , together representing about 17 percent of the vote in last week 's election , are opposed to the eu and further co-operation .
analysts predict that , if denmark were to join the single currency , the practical economic impact would be limited because the danish krone tracks the euro .
" it will change nothing , " said danske bank chief economist steen bocian .
" the danish economy is acting as if it were a full member of the union .
there will be a limited effect on the currency but not much because it 's been extremely stable for a long period . "
polls show eu rising in popularity among danes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen is hoping that the danes will say " yes " this time around danes rejected the euro in 2000 .
the other opt-outs were secured in 1993 after the country initially rejected the maastricht treaty .
recently they seem to have warmed a little to the european bloc .
according to a poll published last month , 51 percent of nearly 1,000 danes surveyed said they were in favor of getting rid of the exemption on the euro , while 40 percent said they were opposed to the move .
the poll also indicated a majority of danes were in favor of lifting the exemptions on joint defense and judiciary cooperation , but that 73 percent wanted to maintain the exemption on european citizenship .
in the nordic region , only finland has joined the 13-member euro zone .
neighboring sweden has , like denmark , maintained its krona currency despite its eu membership , while norway and iceland have rejected even joining the eu . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she died on tuesday , nov .
20 , after being admitted to a hospital in schwerin , weighing just over seven kilos -lrb- 15 pounds -rrb- - three times less than an average child her age .
her death has prompted calls from politicians for more thorough preemptive controls .
" i am a vehement advocate of making preventative medical check-ups compulsory , " kerstin griese , the social democratic chairwoman of the german parliament 's family affairs committee told the daily berliner zeitung on friday .
" this would provide a fundamental building block for child protection . "
but wolfram hartmann , president of the pediatricians association , told dpa that gaps between such visits are too long to make them effective .
" it would be wrong to think that compulsory health checks could prevent cases of child neglect , " he said .
instead , hartmann argued for greater cooperation between health officials and social workers .
opposition parties agree that the problem is a result of authorities failing to do their job .
" given that cuts have been made in youth-protection offices for years , it should come as no surprise that these cases happen , " said jörn wunderlich from the left party .
effects of cost-cutting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors need to be attuned to signs of possible abuse every time such stories make the headlines in germany , the nation is left wondering how these families can fall through the net .
fingers are invariably pointed at the child-protection services .
when a two-year old died in bremen last year , many blamed the local welfare office which had left the boy in the care of his drug-addicted foster father despite repeated warnings .
the authorities in schwerin have also come in for criticism .
hermann junghans , head of schwerin social services , insists that welfare officers did their job properly but has admitted that the two social workers who visited the family a fortnight ago after an anonymous tip-off had " found nothing amiss . "
neighbors , meanwhile , said the two social workers never actually entered the apartment .
according to newspaper reports , heike seifert , head of schwerin 's youth welfare office , complained to the local council earlier this year that financial cuts were hampering the work of the office .
on friday , schwerin 's mayor , norbert claussen , acknowledged flaws in the welfare system .
lea-sophie 's death " showed that adequate mechanisms are not in place , " he said in a statement .
heike seifert , meanwhile , was quoted in the daily taz as saying that this was by no means the first time that children had been admitted with symptoms of malnutrition to hospitals in schwerin .
the number of child endangerment cases has been increasing in the town , confirmed junghans at a press conference this week .

she died on tuesday , nov .
20 , after being admitted to a hospital in schwerin , weighing just over seven kilos -lrb- 15 pounds -rrb- - three times less than an average child her age .
her death has prompted calls from politicians for more thorough preemptive controls .
" i am a vehement advocate of making preventative medical check-ups compulsory , " kerstin griese , the social democratic chairwoman of the german parliament 's family affairs committee told the daily berliner zeitung on friday .
" this would provide a fundamental building block for child protection . "
but wolfram hartmann , president of the pediatricians association , told dpa that gaps between such visits are too long to make them effective .
" it would be wrong to think that compulsory health checks could prevent cases of child neglect , " he said .
instead , hartmann argued for greater cooperation between health officials and social workers .
opposition parties agree that the problem is a result of authorities failing to do their job .
" given that cuts have been made in youth-protection offices for years , it should come as no surprise that these cases happen , " said jörn wunderlich from the left party .

fingers are invariably pointed at the child-protection services .
when a two-year old died in bremen last year , many blamed the local welfare office which had left the boy in the care of his drug-addicted foster father despite repeated warnings .
the authorities in schwerin have also come in for criticism .
hermann junghans , head of schwerin social services , insists that welfare officers did their job properly but has admitted that the two social workers who visited the family a fortnight ago after an anonymous tip-off had " found nothing amiss . "
neighbors , meanwhile , said the two social workers never actually entered the apartment .
according to newspaper reports , heike seifert , head of schwerin 's youth welfare office , complained to the local council earlier this year that financial cuts were hampering the work of the office .
on friday , schwerin 's mayor , norbert claussen , acknowledged flaws in the welfare system .
lea-sophie 's death " showed that adequate mechanisms are not in place , " he said in a statement .
heike seifert , meanwhile , was quoted in the daily taz as saying that this was by no means the first time that children had been admitted with symptoms of malnutrition to hospitals in schwerin .
the number of child endangerment cases has been increasing in the town , confirmed junghans at a press conference this week .

23 , that warsaw was sticking by the previous government 's decision not to adopt the eu charter of fundamental rights . before snap elections in october , tusk 's civic platform party -lrb- po -rrb- had pledged to review the policy decision .
but president lech kaczynski , the twin brother of the former prime minister , threatened to vote down the new european treaty in the event of a reversal .
the kaczynskis and their ultra-conservative allies regard the charter as being too morally liberal .
" in civic platform 's opinion , the charter would be a positive act , but a safe ratification of the treaty is the most important issue , " said tusk in his first address to parliament after his civic platform party won the elections in october .
the new government needs the kaczynskis ' support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his success at the snap elections , tusk still needs the opposition tusk 's center-right coalition with the centrist peasants ' party coalition does not have a two-thirds majority so it is reliant on opposition support to ratify the eu treaty .
the former polish government under jaroslaw kaczynski only agreed to support the treaty on condition that the country could opt-out of the charter .
in particular , the rightist coalition argued that the charter would limit warsaw 's ability to maintain a traditional roman catholic family policy and enable the european court of justice to force poland to grant new rights to homosexuals .
the law and justice party also warned that the charter could spur legal claims by germans who lost property after the polish-german border was redrawn after world war ii .
tusk sets course for the euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new polish pm will have to get along with the polish president until 2010 during the unveiling of his new government 's program , the new prime minister also pledged to pursue a more european-oriented policy than his euroskeptic predecessor and push towards the adoption of the euro as quickly as possible .
he also reiterated his earlier pledges to pull troops out of iraq in 2008 .
" this government will do everything to make sure poland and the poles are quickly ready for the euro , " tusk said .
he also confirmed his cabinet would lower taxes , cut the budget deficit and speed up privatization to keep up economic growth rates while pursuing its euro-zone entry .
tusk , however , did not announce a timeframe for the joining plans .
" we want to nearly balance the budget in a few years , so our road to entry is safe , " he said .

schäuble rejected the claims .
" on the contrary , switching from stationary border controls to mobile border surveillance will lead to a growth in freedom and an increase in security , " he said after meeting his counterpart grzegorz schetyna in the baltic resort of heringsdorf .
schäuble stressed that the worries of the population were being taken seriously and that the move had been prepared carefully in partnership with germany 's eastern neighbors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 23.11.2007 authorities under fire after infant death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many cases slip through the net the death by starvation of a five-year-old in the eastern german town of schwerin has triggered calls from politicians and social workers to introduce compulsory preventative medical check-ups . the parents of lea-sophie were arrested this week on charges of neglect after allegedly failing to adequately feed their daughter for months on end .
she died on tuesday , nov .
20 , after being admitted to a hospital in schwerin , weighing just over seven kilos -lrb- 15 pounds -rrb- - three times less than an average child her age .
her death has prompted calls from politicians for more thorough preemptive controls .
" i am a vehement advocate of making preventative medical check-ups compulsory , " kerstin griese , the social democratic chairwoman of the german parliament 's family affairs committee told the daily berliner zeitung on friday .
" this would provide a fundamental building block for child protection . "
but wolfram hartmann , president of the pediatricians association , told dpa that gaps between such visits are too long to make them effective .
" it would be wrong to think that compulsory health checks could prevent cases of child neglect , " he said .
instead , hartmann argued for greater cooperation between health officials and social workers .
opposition parties agree that the problem is a result of authorities failing to do their job .
" given that cuts have been made in youth-protection offices for years , it should come as no surprise that these cases happen , " said jörn wunderlich from the left party .
effects of cost-cutting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors need to be attuned to signs of possible abuse every time such stories make the headlines in germany , the nation is left wondering how these families can fall through the net .
fingers are invariably pointed at the child-protection services .
when a two-year old died in bremen last year , many blamed the local welfare office which had left the boy in the care of his drug-addicted foster father despite repeated warnings .
the authorities in schwerin have also come in for criticism .
hermann junghans , head of schwerin social services , insists that welfare officers did their job properly but has admitted that the two social workers who visited the family a fortnight ago after an anonymous tip-off had " found nothing amiss . "
neighbors , meanwhile , said the two social workers never actually entered the apartment .
according to newspaper reports , heike seifert , head of schwerin 's youth welfare office , complained to the local council earlier this year that financial cuts were hampering the work of the office .
on friday , schwerin 's mayor , norbert claussen , acknowledged flaws in the welfare system .
lea-sophie 's death " showed that adequate mechanisms are not in place , " he said in a statement .
heike seifert , meanwhile , was quoted in the daily taz as saying that this was by no means the first time that children had been admitted with symptoms of malnutrition to hospitals in schwerin .
the number of child endangerment cases has been increasing in the town , confirmed junghans at a press conference this week .
eighty-six cases were registered in the first six months of 2007 .
in 2006 , the figure was 133 , compared to just 42 in 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he resigned in march 2007 to focus on his interests in alternative energy and climate change .
in october 2007 , the 39-year-old founded project better place , a company that 's working on a green transportation infrastructure based on electric cars as an alternative to fossil fuel technology . dw-tv : what will things be like in 2030 ? shai agassi : my belief is that you will not see cars going on oil .
we take oil out of the ground and look how hard it is to find oil today .
there are now oil-rigs that go 12,000 feet -lrb- 3,650 meters -rrb- into water and then another 6,000 feet into the ground - to find oil .
it is a technological marvel .
but why would you do this ?
if we can find cheaper , easier ways to drive our cars , to energize our cars we are probably going to do that . i think you are also going to have a different experience with water : we do not think about it today .
but there is a growing population of people that do not have drinking water .
yet in most of the western world , we use water to flush our sewage .
why would you take clean water and use it for sewage .
it makes absolutely no sense .
there was an economy of abundance and we are going to shift into an economy of constraints .
and when you shift into the economy of constraints , you have to come in with technological improvements to change the way we do things . we are going to need energy , we are going to need water and we are going to need food .
those three fundamentals will get a lot more attention , for example , than medicine today .
we will run out of clean water , we 've already run out of easy energy .
and we will run out of food . what is your favourite technological , futuristic gimmick ? i would say that energy is probably the biggest problem that we are facing today .
if we do not solve the energy crisis , the lack of energy , all the other good things will not happen .
we are going to get wars .
the biggest wars in the world were either started or ended as result of energy issues .
if i look at the fundamental things that are happening right now , they are all geared towards creating materials or engineering materials that will solve energy problems .
and i think that is the most exiting part of the world right now in technology . what is driving you personally to shape the future ? i think two things .
one : you wake up in the morning , you see the eyes of your kids and you have a huge responsibility to the next generation to do something with the power you are given .
all young global leaders have been tremendously lucky .
we have been fortunate to get education at a young age , we have been fortunate to be successful and we have been fortunate to be able to take risk .
some of us have been fortunate to face adversity in a way that has actually made us grow .
what do you do with it ?
if you worry about your personal wealth or personal benefits you are wasting this gift - that you are here .
so what i am mostly worried about is : how do i give back ?
i am getting to 40 , what do you give back in he next 40 years ?
it is a huge responsibility .
if you do not take it as an opportunity to serve and an opportunity to give , you are really wasting god 's gift .

program guide programs made in germany video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home / dw-tv latinoamerica : made in germany young global leaders -pipe- 23.11.2007 shai agassi : energy is our biggest problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agassi left his job at sap to fight for climate protection born in israel , shai agassi was a member of the executive board of germany-based sap , the world 's largest business software company .
he resigned in march 2007 to focus on his interests in alternative energy and climate change .
in october 2007 , the 39-year-old founded project better place , a company that 's working on a green transportation infrastructure based on electric cars as an alternative to fossil fuel technology . dw-tv : what will things be like in 2030 ? shai agassi : my belief is that you will not see cars going on oil .
we take oil out of the ground and look how hard it is to find oil today .
there are now oil-rigs that go 12,000 feet -lrb- 3,650 meters -rrb- into water and then another 6,000 feet into the ground - to find oil .
it is a technological marvel .
but why would you do this ?
if we can find cheaper , easier ways to drive our cars , to energize our cars we are probably going to do that . i think you are also going to have a different experience with water : we do not think about it today .
but there is a growing population of people that do not have drinking water .
yet in most of the western world , we use water to flush our sewage .
why would you take clean water and use it for sewage .
it makes absolutely no sense .
there was an economy of abundance and we are going to shift into an economy of constraints .
and when you shift into the economy of constraints , you have to come in with technological improvements to change the way we do things . we are going to need energy , we are going to need water and we are going to need food .
those three fundamentals will get a lot more attention , for example , than medicine today .
we will run out of clean water , we 've already run out of easy energy .
and we will run out of food . what is your favourite technological , futuristic gimmick ? i would say that energy is probably the biggest problem that we are facing today .
if we do not solve the energy crisis , the lack of energy , all the other good things will not happen .
we are going to get wars .
the biggest wars in the world were either started or ended as result of energy issues .
if i look at the fundamental things that are happening right now , they are all geared towards creating materials or engineering materials that will solve energy problems .
and i think that is the most exiting part of the world right now in technology . what is driving you personally to shape the future ? i think two things .
one : you wake up in the morning , you see the eyes of your kids and you have a huge responsibility to the next generation to do something with the power you are given .
all young global leaders have been tremendously lucky .
we have been fortunate to get education at a young age , we have been fortunate to be successful and we have been fortunate to be able to take risk .
some of us have been fortunate to face adversity in a way that has actually made us grow .
what do you do with it ?
if you worry about your personal wealth or personal benefits you are wasting this gift - that you are here .
so what i am mostly worried about is : how do i give back ?
i am getting to 40 , what do you give back in he next 40 years ?
it is a huge responsibility .
if you do not take it as an opportunity to serve and an opportunity to give , you are really wasting god 's gift .
i think that motivates me to wake up in the morning and go to try to solve the biggest problem that i can solve in a successful way . interview : michael wetzel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes seven years after danes firmly rejected the european single currency . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen also wants voters to decide whether they are still in favor of opting out of eu policy in three other areas related to joint defense , justice and home affairs .
" the time is approaching , " rasmussen told a news conference .
" it is the government 's view that the people in this parliamentary term should have the opportunity to take a stance on the danish eu opt-outs . "
rasmussen , who is a staunch supporter of the european union , said the exemptions harmed danish interests .
he did not say when the vote might be held .
but it should happen some time within the newly elected center-right government 's four-year mandate period .
government push for more integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danish prime minister is treating his re-election as a mandate to forge more eu integration he also said he wanted the recently agreed eu treaty to be quickly ratified , but did not say if this would require its own referendum .
the danes had scheduled a vote on an earlier proposed eu constitution in september 2005 , but called it off after french and dutch voters rejected the treaty .
only two of the eight parties in the danish parliament , together representing about 17 percent of the vote in last week 's election , are opposed to the eu and further co-operation .
analysts predict that , if denmark were to join the single currency , the practical economic impact would be limited because the danish krone tracks the euro .
" it will change nothing , " said danske bank chief economist steen bocian .
" the danish economy is acting as if it were a full member of the union .
there will be a limited effect on the currency but not much because it 's been extremely stable for a long period . "
polls show eu rising in popularity among danes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen is hoping that the danes will say " yes " this time around danes rejected the euro in 2000 .
the other opt-outs were secured in 1993 after the country initially rejected the maastricht treaty .
recently they seem to have warmed a little to the european bloc .
according to a poll published last month , 51 percent of nearly 1,000 danes surveyed said they were in favor of getting rid of the exemption on the euro , while 40 percent said they were opposed to the move .
the poll also indicated a majority of danes were in favor of lifting the exemptions on joint defense and judiciary cooperation , but that 73 percent wanted to maintain the exemption on european citizenship .
in the nordic region , only finland has joined the 13-member euro zone .

this comes seven years after danes firmly rejected the european single currency . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen also wants voters to decide whether they are still in favor of opting out of eu policy in three other areas related to joint defense , justice and home affairs .
" the time is approaching , " rasmussen told a news conference .
" it is the government 's view that the people in this parliamentary term should have the opportunity to take a stance on the danish eu opt-outs . "
rasmussen , who is a staunch supporter of the european union , said the exemptions harmed danish interests .
he did not say when the vote might be held .
but it should happen some time within the newly elected center-right government 's four-year mandate period .
government push for more integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danish prime minister is treating his re-election as a mandate to forge more eu integration he also said he wanted the recently agreed eu treaty to be quickly ratified , but did not say if this would require its own referendum .
the danes had scheduled a vote on an earlier proposed eu constitution in september 2005 , but called it off after french and dutch voters rejected the treaty .
only two of the eight parties in the danish parliament , together representing about 17 percent of the vote in last week 's election , are opposed to the eu and further co-operation .
analysts predict that , if denmark were to join the single currency , the practical economic impact would be limited because the danish krone tracks the euro .
" it will change nothing , " said danske bank chief economist steen bocian .
" the danish economy is acting as if it were a full member of the union .
there will be a limited effect on the currency but not much because it 's been extremely stable for a long period . "

the other opt-outs were secured in 1993 after the country initially rejected the maastricht treaty .
recently they seem to have warmed a little to the european bloc .
according to a poll published last month , 51 percent of nearly 1,000 danes surveyed said they were in favor of getting rid of the exemption on the euro , while 40 percent said they were opposed to the move .
the poll also indicated a majority of danes were in favor of lifting the exemptions on joint defense and judiciary cooperation , but that 73 percent wanted to maintain the exemption on european citizenship .

23 , that warsaw was sticking by the previous government 's decision not to adopt the eu charter of fundamental rights . before snap elections in october , tusk 's civic platform party -lrb- po -rrb- had pledged to review the policy decision .
but president lech kaczynski , the twin brother of the former prime minister , threatened to vote down the new european treaty in the event of a reversal .
the kaczynskis and their ultra-conservative allies regard the charter as being too morally liberal .
" in civic platform 's opinion , the charter would be a positive act , but a safe ratification of the treaty is the most important issue , " said tusk in his first address to parliament after his civic platform party won the elections in october .
the new government needs the kaczynskis ' support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his success at the snap elections , tusk still needs the opposition tusk 's center-right coalition with the centrist peasants ' party coalition does not have a two-thirds majority so it is reliant on opposition support to ratify the eu treaty .
the former polish government under jaroslaw kaczynski only agreed to support the treaty on condition that the country could opt-out of the charter .
in particular , the rightist coalition argued that the charter would limit warsaw 's ability to maintain a traditional roman catholic family policy and enable the european court of justice to force poland to grant new rights to homosexuals .
the law and justice party also warned that the charter could spur legal claims by germans who lost property after the polish-german border was redrawn after world war ii .
tusk sets course for the euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new polish pm will have to get along with the polish president until 2010 during the unveiling of his new government 's program , the new prime minister also pledged to pursue a more european-oriented policy than his euroskeptic predecessor and push towards the adoption of the euro as quickly as possible .
he also reiterated his earlier pledges to pull troops out of iraq in 2008 .
" this government will do everything to make sure poland and the poles are quickly ready for the euro , " tusk said .
he also confirmed his cabinet would lower taxes , cut the budget deficit and speed up privatization to keep up economic growth rates while pursuing its euro-zone entry .
tusk , however , did not announce a timeframe for the joining plans .
" we want to nearly balance the budget in a few years , so our road to entry is safe , " he said .

" the existing deal is signed and final and there is no need to change it , " said steinbrück after meeting with the chairman of the center of organizations of holocaust survivors in israel , noah flug .
flug said that although the reparation agreement with germany would not be amended , if there were " specific problems " germany would try to solve them .
" we did n't ask for money , we spoke of the responsibility of the german government , " added flug .
complaints that germany 's reparations fail to compensate in any reasonable way for the trauma of the holocaust are ongoing .
but the israeli holocaust survivors who met with steinbrück on thursday , nov .
23 , to request improvements to the reparations arrangement specifically argued that the original agreement failed to take into account today 's longer life expectancy or the tens of thousands of survivors who immigrated to israel after the fall of the soviet union .
according to news agency dpa , steinbrück did agree that germany would try to help needy survivors via the claims committee , the international organization that coordinates compensation payments to survivors .
an unofficial request ?
earlier this month , an israeli paper published comments by israel 's pensioners affairs minister rafael eytan saying israel was keen to reopen the deal , but he later said he was misquoted and only wished to examine with germany ways to support survivors given the ' holes ' in the original agreement .
on thursday , a spokeswomen for the israeli finance ministry confirmed that israel has never officially requested germany revise the reparations deal .
the luxembourg agreement between the two countries stipulated that germany would pay israel reparations , and israel would look after the survivors , who would not be permitted to sue germany directly .
since the 1950s , germany has paid 26 billion euros -lrb- $ 38 billion -rrb- in compensation .
around 1.7 billion of this went to israel , the rest to german claimants .
israel takes responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 240,000 holocaust survivors live in israel others say that israel 's reliance on germany is unreasonable and that the country should look after its elderly holocaust survivors itself .
after a recent storm of protest by holocaust survivors who accused the government of abandoning them , prime minister ehud olmert announced that for the first time in its history , the israeli government would pay monthly allowances from its own budget to holocaust survivors and refugees .
the state agreed to give israelis who survived nazi ghettos and concentration camps a monthly stipend of nearly $ 300 -lrb- $ 200 -rrb- , in addition to tax discounts and other breaks .
it also approved monthly payments ranging from $ 40 to $ 125 for 80,000 israelis , most from the former soviet union , who became refugees as the nazis conquered europe but never lived under nazi occupation .

with more than 1 million articles in english , wikipedia has become one of the largest collaboratively edited reference projects in the world and one of the 15 most visited web sites on the internet .
today , wales is seen as a champion of internet-enabled egalitarianism .
he is also founder of the for-profit company wikia , inc .
in may 2006 , he was named one of time magazine 's 100 most influential people . dw-tv : what will education be like in 2030 ? jimmy wales : i think that a lot of trends that we see happening right now are going to continue .
there is an increased importance of education as technology is constantly changing .
it is really important for lots of different people to have more education than they did in the past .
if you think about computer science , the field is changing so rapidly that your college degree may be valuable in the sense of providing some real background knowledge .
but in day-to-day work it is a constant process of educating yourself on techniques and new software , new programming languages .
i think that kind of change is going to happen in more and more fields .
it will require people to learn lots of new things all the time . what kind of invention would you like to see by 2030 ? a lot of what i am frustrated with in terms of technology right now has to do with technology that has already been invented , but that just does not work as well as it should .
i think everybody has had trouble with the internet .
sometimes it is slow , sometimes it is not working .
i like the idea of the internet being available everywhere .
that is coming , but it will take a while - 10 or 20 years . some of the more exiting technologies that are a lot more visionary would be things like nano-technology , where we are inventing new kinds of materials that are going to give rise to new kinds of products , to new kind of medical cures .
those things are really going to be very important in the future . what drives you ? for me it is really my daughter and thinking about the future of the world from her perspective : what kind of planet are we building , what kind of planet are we going to leave to the next generation and what are the things that we can do today that are productive and useful and will lay down a framework , so that the next generation coming along can inherit a good planet , prosperity , health , fairness and justice and all those things .
that is the kind of thing that inspires me - to think about my own daughter .

fate is driven by the belief that young people are able to directly address the high rates of unemployment and poverty in their country .
the goal is to foster the establishment and growth of more than 5,000 businesses by 2015 , which are expected to generate employment for at least 50,000 nigerians . dw-tv : what would you like the world in 2030 to be like ? osayi oruene : i would want opportunity for growth in terms of work and businesses .
i am talking about the kind of opportunities that people do not have right now .
we have strong businesses in nigeria .
they have very strong , good ideas , good businesses , but there is no avenue for them to be able to show it to the next person in the next community . what invention would you like to see in 2030 ? if i could just sleep tonight and wake up in nigeria tomorrow morning without getting on the plane , that would be perfect .
i do not like flying and i hate jet lag . what 's driving you ? i am very passionate , first of all , about nigeria .
i always loved my country , loved the people .
we have so many resources : people , capital , things that i believe can change the country and take it to the right direction .
i also believe that there can be change .
if i can just see one person walk into my office and leave my office smiling , that is enough for me .
because i can believe that this is tomorrow .
and there is a better tomorrow for nigeria , for other africans , for the world .
i think that is what pushes me . interview : michael wetzel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 23.11.2007 authorities under fire after infant death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many cases slip through the net the death by starvation of a five-year-old in the eastern german town of schwerin has triggered calls from politicians and social workers to introduce compulsory preventative medical check-ups . the parents of lea-sophie were arrested this week on charges of neglect after allegedly failing to adequately feed their daughter for months on end .
she died on tuesday , nov .
20 , after being admitted to a hospital in schwerin , weighing just over seven kilos -lrb- 15 pounds -rrb- - three times less than an average child her age .
her death has prompted calls from politicians for more thorough preemptive controls .
" i am a vehement advocate of making preventative medical check-ups compulsory , " kerstin griese , the social democratic chairwoman of the german parliament 's family affairs committee told the daily berliner zeitung on friday .
" this would provide a fundamental building block for child protection . "
but wolfram hartmann , president of the pediatricians association , told dpa that gaps between such visits are too long to make them effective .
" it would be wrong to think that compulsory health checks could prevent cases of child neglect , " he said .
instead , hartmann argued for greater cooperation between health officials and social workers .
opposition parties agree that the problem is a result of authorities failing to do their job .
" given that cuts have been made in youth-protection offices for years , it should come as no surprise that these cases happen , " said jörn wunderlich from the left party .
effects of cost-cutting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors need to be attuned to signs of possible abuse every time such stories make the headlines in germany , the nation is left wondering how these families can fall through the net .
fingers are invariably pointed at the child-protection services .
when a two-year old died in bremen last year , many blamed the local welfare office which had left the boy in the care of his drug-addicted foster father despite repeated warnings .
the authorities in schwerin have also come in for criticism .
hermann junghans , head of schwerin social services , insists that welfare officers did their job properly but has admitted that the two social workers who visited the family a fortnight ago after an anonymous tip-off had " found nothing amiss . "
neighbors , meanwhile , said the two social workers never actually entered the apartment .
according to newspaper reports , heike seifert , head of schwerin 's youth welfare office , complained to the local council earlier this year that financial cuts were hampering the work of the office .
on friday , schwerin 's mayor , norbert claussen , acknowledged flaws in the welfare system .

this comes seven years after danes firmly rejected the european single currency . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen also wants voters to decide whether they are still in favor of opting out of eu policy in three other areas related to joint defense , justice and home affairs .
" the time is approaching , " rasmussen told a news conference .
" it is the government 's view that the people in this parliamentary term should have the opportunity to take a stance on the danish eu opt-outs . "
rasmussen , who is a staunch supporter of the european union , said the exemptions harmed danish interests .
he did not say when the vote might be held .
but it should happen some time within the newly elected center-right government 's four-year mandate period .
government push for more integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danish prime minister is treating his re-election as a mandate to forge more eu integration he also said he wanted the recently agreed eu treaty to be quickly ratified , but did not say if this would require its own referendum .
the danes had scheduled a vote on an earlier proposed eu constitution in september 2005 , but called it off after french and dutch voters rejected the treaty .
only two of the eight parties in the danish parliament , together representing about 17 percent of the vote in last week 's election , are opposed to the eu and further co-operation .
analysts predict that , if denmark were to join the single currency , the practical economic impact would be limited because the danish krone tracks the euro .
" it will change nothing , " said danske bank chief economist steen bocian .
" the danish economy is acting as if it were a full member of the union .
there will be a limited effect on the currency but not much because it 's been extremely stable for a long period . "
polls show eu rising in popularity among danes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen is hoping that the danes will say " yes " this time around danes rejected the euro in 2000 .
the other opt-outs were secured in 1993 after the country initially rejected the maastricht treaty .
recently they seem to have warmed a little to the european bloc .
according to a poll published last month , 51 percent of nearly 1,000 danes surveyed said they were in favor of getting rid of the exemption on the euro , while 40 percent said they were opposed to the move .
the poll also indicated a majority of danes were in favor of lifting the exemptions on joint defense and judiciary cooperation , but that 73 percent wanted to maintain the exemption on european citizenship .

they say security is threatened .
passport controls are being scrapped under the schengen system . under the plans , around 1,850 officers will be withdrawn from the area when germany 's borders with poland and the czech republic are completely opened on dec .
21 .
on that day , six other former communist countries in eastern europe as well as malta will also join the european union 's schengen system , which does away with passport controls at the borders of participating states .
many germans in the border region have expressed fears that opening the borders could lead to an influx of petty criminals , such as shoplifters , burglars and car thieves .
reforms criticized for coming too soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emphasis will switch to joint mobile police patrols german police carried banners saying : " yes to europe , no to hasty reforms , " on their march on thursday , nov .
22 , from the border to the venue of a meeting attended by interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
the head of the police union gdp , konrad freiberg , said in a radio interview that the opening of the border was " premature " in terms of security .
he said important communication systems were not yet in place .
schäuble rejected the claims .
" on the contrary , switching from stationary border controls to mobile border surveillance will lead to a growth in freedom and an increase in security , " he said after meeting his counterpart grzegorz schetyna in the baltic resort of heringsdorf .
schäuble stressed that the worries of the population were being taken seriously and that the move had been prepared carefully in partnership with germany 's eastern neighbors .
he said joint patrols would be intensified on both sides of the border .
a german-polish center is planned in the polish town of swiecko for customs and security officials .
police unprepared ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much closer cooperation is envisaged between germany and its eastern neighbors gdp head freiberg also said the eastern european states did not have the same security standards as germany and had problems with corruption , equipment and police cooperation .
in contrast , the head of german police union dpoig , rainer wendt , criticized the state of the german force 's equipment .
he said there were no computers in german patrol cars and no digital radios to facilitate carrying out mobile checks , and no real deployment strategy .
with the nine new schengen members - the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia - the countries covered by the accord now number 24 .
schengen facilitates freedom of movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the moves will make travel easier for non-eu tourists the lifting of restrictions applies only to land and sea borders at first .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 23.11.2007 german right-to-die group plans assisted-suicide test case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversy has led to criticism of germany 's low hospice provision the german branch of a swiss right-to-die organization has unleashed a storm of protest by saying it is planning to carry out an assisted suicide in germany .
dw-world.de spoke to dignitate 's deputy director . a few weeks ago , dignitas hit the headlines for helping two germans to die in a car park in switzerland .
the apparently undignified circumstances of their deaths sparked renewed criticism of the controversial organization , which has been accused of treating assisted suicide as a money-making enterprise . while assisted suicide is legal in switzerland , german law is much less clear-cut .
uwe-christian arnold , the deputy director of dignitate , the german branch of dignitas , and himself a doctor , says his group wants to set a legal precedent by carrying out an assisted suicide here in germany . the head of the german doctors ' chamber has called for dignitate to be banned . dw-world.de : why do you think your plan has created such an uproar in germany ? uwe-christian arnold : the reason that certain circles get so worked up about this topic is because it was completely taboo for decades .
it was linked to euthanasia and the nazis .
anyone who concerned themselves with this subject was lumped together with the nazis .
no one differentiated between the fact , for example , that no one asked the people who were killed then whether they wanted to die or not .
someone else decided that they should die .
that is completely different from what we 're planning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill mnd sufferer diane pretty lost her battle to change britain 's laws on assisted suicide the precondition is that the patient wants to die and that they have legitimate reason to want to end their life .
this is quite different from what the nazis did .
doctors tend to be conservative and the german medical association is particularly conservative because it was closely involved with the nazis .
they have not dealt with this past over the last 60 years .
on the occasions they did , it was always very uncomfortable . i do n't want to reproach them for the fact that they want to avoid the topic of assisted suicide , but we have to deal with this topic .
it is a pressing social need . have significant numbers of germans been traveling to switzerland to take up the services of dignitas ? no , the numbers are not very significant .
last year , there were 176 or so assisted suicides in total , 120 of those were germans .
that is a bit of an increase in the numbers of germans , but it roughly corresponds to that of previous years .
and it corresponds to the numbers going to other assisted suicide organizations , in switzerland and in oregon . the number of people who decide to end their lives in this way has remained steady . why is assisted suicide such a pressing social need ? the majority of people - 82 percent of the germans and the same numbers in england , in france , the us and canada - are in favor of legalizing assisted suicide .
in oregon it was made legal , but many other american cities want it .
and i think germany should have it .
it is a big country and the patients have big problems with this topic . is it partly a problem that was created by modern medicine ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under european law , it is up to individual states to decide on right-to-die legislation it is exclusively a problem of medicine - high tech medicine - that for decades has only been concerned with progress and it has notched up fantastic achievements .
but it has completely forgotten that death also stands , lurks , at the end of all these strivings .
making this taboo can be very unpleasant for the patient .
many people have the experience that death can be dreadful with high-tech medicine .
it can be something as simple as a feeding probe for an old person in a nursing-care home . is n't it also partly a problem that the hospice system and palliative medicine is n't sufficient in germany ? that is a very important factor .
but even if we had such good palliative medicine and hospice provision as there is in scandinavia - where they have provision for 20 percent of people against our 4 percent - then there would still be a very small minority who , if they got certain illnesses , would want to be able to determine the time when they die - and if they ca n't with the help of a doctor .
there are still illnesses that palliative medicine ca n't help , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis . there are certain preconditions that you have to fulfill to be eligible for assisted suicide .
what are they ? you need to have a terminal illness or a serious illness that you ca n't live with anymore , one that handicaps you so strongly that you can no longer lead a dignified life .
in other words , if you 're lovelorn or you 're suffering from an acute depression , then you wo n't be able to ask for assisted suicide . why are you trying to create a legal precedent here in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands is the only country where mercy killing is legal we are looking to set a test case because it is not clear whether a person can be prosecuted if they do not go to the aid of a person who is dying .
there are judgments and a statement from the ministry of justice that confirms that you can do it under certain conditions , if the person has made the decision freely and that the will of the patient should be placed above the duty to preserve life . is it possible to protect this area from abuse ? in other countries , in the united states and , as far as i know , in the uk , things are more advanced .
there are ethical committees that meet and when there is an 86-year-old and he has a serious illness and he is due for a big operation , then they will discuss whether he should be operated on or given palliative medicine .
a lot more is done to spare people from this hyper-medicine .
that should be done more in germany , too .
it should be considered when there are cases where death might be the better solution .
you do n't have to kill them .
you can just leave them .
this can be entrusted in the hands of doctors .
of course , it is open to abuse .
but this argument is not a good one .
every area in life is open to abuse .
abuse can always happen with or without assisted suicide . you referred to ethical committees .
do you want to make assisted suicide into something that the state is involved in and remove it from the private sector ? that is the sense of our campaign that we get a sensible assisted-suicide policy in germany .
it should n't be the case that this only can be carried out in private .
it should be possible in accordance with certain regulations as in switzerland .
in switzerland , a doctor visits a patient after long and thorough preparation .
you ca n't ring me and say , " doctor , will you give me a lethal injection tomorrow . "
that 's out of the question .
this topic is much too serious and much too sensitive for that . the chief accusation that has been leveled at dignitas is that it is trying to profit from people .
and that dignitas demands three times as much money as exit , another swiss-based right-to-die group .
what would you say to that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muscular-dystrophy sufferer piergiorgio welby battled in italy for his respirator to be switched off exit has 50 million members and it carried out a constant number of assisted suicides a year , 35 , 40 or 50 in a year .
they have a certain price .
for long-term members it is free and for those who have just recently joined , they take around 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,950 -rrb- .
i ca n't tell you exactly , but they take a fee and it is lower than dignitas .
from their swiss members dignitas takes 2,000 euros .
only for those coming from abroad , they take more because they have cremation costs , counseling costs that are much higher than for people in switzerland , who can just go to their local doctor .
and then fees have to be paid to the swiss authorities because costs are incurred by the foreigners .
this is n't about making money .
dignitas has a large office and , unlike exit , which works with volunteers , it works consciously with professionals . do you think you will be successful with your demands ? something will happen .
there has been so much media attention .
i think that if we make a test case , then we will see how they react .
only two things can happen .
either people will accept it , as with abortion in germany .
or we will get a reactionary solution and fall back into the middle ages .
but i 'm hopeful .
because of the churches and the medical association , abortion was also completely taboo here for years , and nowadays we can perform abortion here just like in england and other countries . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands is the only country where mercy killing is legal we are looking to set a test case because it is not clear whether a person can be prosecuted if they do not go to the aid of a person who is dying .
there are judgments and a statement from the ministry of justice that confirms that you can do it under certain conditions , if the person has made the decision freely and that the will of the patient should be placed above the duty to preserve life . is it possible to protect this area from abuse ? in other countries , in the united states and , as far as i know , in the uk , things are more advanced .
there are ethical committees that meet and when there is an 86-year-old and he has a serious illness and he is due for a big operation , then they will discuss whether he should be operated on or given palliative medicine .
a lot more is done to spare people from this hyper-medicine .
that should be done more in germany , too .
it should be considered when there are cases where death might be the better solution .
you do n't have to kill them .
you can just leave them .
this can be entrusted in the hands of doctors .
of course , it is open to abuse .
but this argument is not a good one .
every area in life is open to abuse .
abuse can always happen with or without assisted suicide . you referred to ethical committees .
do you want to make assisted suicide into something that the state is involved in and remove it from the private sector ? that is the sense of our campaign that we get a sensible assisted-suicide policy in germany .
it should n't be the case that this only can be carried out in private .
it should be possible in accordance with certain regulations as in switzerland .
in switzerland , a doctor visits a patient after long and thorough preparation .
you ca n't ring me and say , " doctor , will you give me a lethal injection tomorrow . "
that 's out of the question .
this topic is much too serious and much too sensitive for that . the chief accusation that has been leveled at dignitas is that it is trying to profit from people .
and that dignitas demands three times as much money as exit , another swiss-based right-to-die group .
what would you say to that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muscular-dystrophy sufferer piergiorgio welby battled in italy for his respirator to be switched off exit has 50 million members and it carried out a constant number of assisted suicides a year , 35 , 40 or 50 in a year .
they have a certain price .
for long-term members it is free and for those who have just recently joined , they take around 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,950 -rrb- .
i ca n't tell you exactly , but they take a fee and it is lower than dignitas .
from their swiss members dignitas takes 2,000 euros .
only for those coming from abroad , they take more because they have cremation costs , counseling costs that are much higher than for people in switzerland , who can just go to their local doctor .
and then fees have to be paid to the swiss authorities because costs are incurred by the foreigners .
this is n't about making money .
dignitas has a large office and , unlike exit , which works with volunteers , it works consciously with professionals . do you think you will be successful with your demands ? something will happen .
there has been so much media attention .
i think that if we make a test case , then we will see how they react .
only two things can happen .
either people will accept it , as with abortion in germany .
or we will get a reactionary solution and fall back into the middle ages .
but i 'm hopeful .
because of the churches and the medical association , abortion was also completely taboo here for years , and nowadays we can perform abortion here just like in england and other countries . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to dignitate 's deputy director . a few weeks ago , dignitas hit the headlines for helping two germans to die in a car park in switzerland .
the apparently undignified circumstances of their deaths sparked renewed criticism of the controversial organization , which has been accused of treating assisted suicide as a money-making enterprise . while assisted suicide is legal in switzerland , german law is much less clear-cut .
uwe-christian arnold , the deputy director of dignitate , the german branch of dignitas , and himself a doctor , says his group wants to set a legal precedent by carrying out an assisted suicide here in germany . the head of the german doctors ' chamber has called for dignitate to be banned . dw-world.de : why do you think your plan has created such an uproar in germany ? uwe-christian arnold : the reason that certain circles get so worked up about this topic is because it was completely taboo for decades .
it was linked to euthanasia and the nazis .
anyone who concerned themselves with this subject was lumped together with the nazis .
no one differentiated between the fact , for example , that no one asked the people who were killed then whether they wanted to die or not .
someone else decided that they should die .
that is completely different from what we 're planning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill mnd sufferer diane pretty lost her battle to change britain 's laws on assisted suicide the precondition is that the patient wants to die and that they have legitimate reason to want to end their life .
this is quite different from what the nazis did .
doctors tend to be conservative and the german medical association is particularly conservative because it was closely involved with the nazis .
they have not dealt with this past over the last 60 years .
on the occasions they did , it was always very uncomfortable . i do n't want to reproach them for the fact that they want to avoid the topic of assisted suicide , but we have to deal with this topic .
it is a pressing social need . have significant numbers of germans been traveling to switzerland to take up the services of dignitas ? no , the numbers are not very significant .
last year , there were 176 or so assisted suicides in total , 120 of those were germans .
that is a bit of an increase in the numbers of germans , but it roughly corresponds to that of previous years .
and it corresponds to the numbers going to other assisted suicide organizations , in switzerland and in oregon . the number of people who decide to end their lives in this way has remained steady . why is assisted suicide such a pressing social need ? the majority of people - 82 percent of the germans and the same numbers in england , in france , the us and canada - are in favor of legalizing assisted suicide .
in oregon it was made legal , but many other american cities want it .
and i think germany should have it .
it is a big country and the patients have big problems with this topic . is it partly a problem that was created by modern medicine ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under european law , it is up to individual states to decide on right-to-die legislation it is exclusively a problem of medicine - high tech medicine - that for decades has only been concerned with progress and it has notched up fantastic achievements .
but it has completely forgotten that death also stands , lurks , at the end of all these strivings .
making this taboo can be very unpleasant for the patient .
many people have the experience that death can be dreadful with high-tech medicine .
it can be something as simple as a feeding probe for an old person in a nursing-care home . is n't it also partly a problem that the hospice system and palliative medicine is n't sufficient in germany ? that is a very important factor .
but even if we had such good palliative medicine and hospice provision as there is in scandinavia - where they have provision for 20 percent of people against our 4 percent - then there would still be a very small minority who , if they got certain illnesses , would want to be able to determine the time when they die - and if they ca n't with the help of a doctor .
there are still illnesses that palliative medicine ca n't help , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis . there are certain preconditions that you have to fulfill to be eligible for assisted suicide .
what are they ? you need to have a terminal illness or a serious illness that you ca n't live with anymore , one that handicaps you so strongly that you can no longer lead a dignified life .
in other words , if you 're lovelorn or you 're suffering from an acute depression , then you wo n't be able to ask for assisted suicide . why are you trying to create a legal precedent here in germany ?

and it corresponds to the numbers going to other assisted suicide organizations , in switzerland and in oregon . the number of people who decide to end their lives in this way has remained steady . why is assisted suicide such a pressing social need ? the majority of people - 82 percent of the germans and the same numbers in england , in france , the us and canada - are in favor of legalizing assisted suicide .
in oregon it was made legal , but many other american cities want it .
and i think germany should have it .
it is a big country and the patients have big problems with this topic . is it partly a problem that was created by modern medicine ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under european law , it is up to individual states to decide on right-to-die legislation it is exclusively a problem of medicine - high tech medicine - that for decades has only been concerned with progress and it has notched up fantastic achievements .
but it has completely forgotten that death also stands , lurks , at the end of all these strivings .
making this taboo can be very unpleasant for the patient .
many people have the experience that death can be dreadful with high-tech medicine .
it can be something as simple as a feeding probe for an old person in a nursing-care home . is n't it also partly a problem that the hospice system and palliative medicine is n't sufficient in germany ? that is a very important factor .
but even if we had such good palliative medicine and hospice provision as there is in scandinavia - where they have provision for 20 percent of people against our 4 percent - then there would still be a very small minority who , if they got certain illnesses , would want to be able to determine the time when they die - and if they ca n't with the help of a doctor .
there are still illnesses that palliative medicine ca n't help , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis . there are certain preconditions that you have to fulfill to be eligible for assisted suicide .
what are they ? you need to have a terminal illness or a serious illness that you ca n't live with anymore , one that handicaps you so strongly that you can no longer lead a dignified life .
in other words , if you 're lovelorn or you 're suffering from an acute depression , then you wo n't be able to ask for assisted suicide . why are you trying to create a legal precedent here in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands is the only country where mercy killing is legal we are looking to set a test case because it is not clear whether a person can be prosecuted if they do not go to the aid of a person who is dying .
there are judgments and a statement from the ministry of justice that confirms that you can do it under certain conditions , if the person has made the decision freely and that the will of the patient should be placed above the duty to preserve life . is it possible to protect this area from abuse ? in other countries , in the united states and , as far as i know , in the uk , things are more advanced .
there are ethical committees that meet and when there is an 86-year-old and he has a serious illness and he is due for a big operation , then they will discuss whether he should be operated on or given palliative medicine .
a lot more is done to spare people from this hyper-medicine .
that should be done more in germany , too .
it should be considered when there are cases where death might be the better solution .
you do n't have to kill them .
you can just leave them .
this can be entrusted in the hands of doctors .
of course , it is open to abuse .
but this argument is not a good one .
every area in life is open to abuse .
abuse can always happen with or without assisted suicide . you referred to ethical committees .
do you want to make assisted suicide into something that the state is involved in and remove it from the private sector ? that is the sense of our campaign that we get a sensible assisted-suicide policy in germany .
it should n't be the case that this only can be carried out in private .
it should be possible in accordance with certain regulations as in switzerland .
in switzerland , a doctor visits a patient after long and thorough preparation .
you ca n't ring me and say , " doctor , will you give me a lethal injection tomorrow . "
that 's out of the question .
this topic is much too serious and much too sensitive for that . the chief accusation that has been leveled at dignitas is that it is trying to profit from people .
and that dignitas demands three times as much money as exit , another swiss-based right-to-die group .
what would you say to that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muscular-dystrophy sufferer piergiorgio welby battled in italy for his respirator to be switched off exit has 50 million members and it carried out a constant number of assisted suicides a year , 35 , 40 or 50 in a year .
they have a certain price .
for long-term members it is free and for those who have just recently joined , they take around 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,950 -rrb- .
i ca n't tell you exactly , but they take a fee and it is lower than dignitas .
from their swiss members dignitas takes 2,000 euros .
only for those coming from abroad , they take more because they have cremation costs , counseling costs that are much higher than for people in switzerland , who can just go to their local doctor .
and then fees have to be paid to the swiss authorities because costs are incurred by the foreigners .
this is n't about making money .
dignitas has a large office and , unlike exit , which works with volunteers , it works consciously with professionals . do you think you will be successful with your demands ? something will happen .
there has been so much media attention .
i think that if we make a test case , then we will see how they react .
only two things can happen .
either people will accept it , as with abortion in germany .
or we will get a reactionary solution and fall back into the middle ages .
but i 'm hopeful .
because of the churches and the medical association , abortion was also completely taboo here for years , and nowadays we can perform abortion here just like in england and other countries . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to dignitate 's deputy director . a few weeks ago , dignitas hit the headlines for helping two germans to die in a car park in switzerland .
the apparently undignified circumstances of their deaths sparked renewed criticism of the controversial organization , which has been accused of treating assisted suicide as a money-making enterprise . while assisted suicide is legal in switzerland , german law is much less clear-cut .
uwe-christian arnold , the deputy director of dignitate , the german branch of dignitas , and himself a doctor , says his group wants to set a legal precedent by carrying out an assisted suicide here in germany . the head of the german doctors ' chamber has called for dignitate to be banned . dw-world.de : why do you think your plan has created such an uproar in germany ? uwe-christian arnold : the reason that certain circles get so worked up about this topic is because it was completely taboo for decades .
it was linked to euthanasia and the nazis .
anyone who concerned themselves with this subject was lumped together with the nazis .
no one differentiated between the fact , for example , that no one asked the people who were killed then whether they wanted to die or not .
someone else decided that they should die .
that is completely different from what we 're planning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill mnd sufferer diane pretty lost her battle to change britain 's laws on assisted suicide the precondition is that the patient wants to die and that they have legitimate reason to want to end their life .
this is quite different from what the nazis did .
doctors tend to be conservative and the german medical association is particularly conservative because it was closely involved with the nazis .
they have not dealt with this past over the last 60 years .
on the occasions they did , it was always very uncomfortable . i do n't want to reproach them for the fact that they want to avoid the topic of assisted suicide , but we have to deal with this topic .
it is a pressing social need . have significant numbers of germans been traveling to switzerland to take up the services of dignitas ? no , the numbers are not very significant .

" the existing deal is signed and final and there is no need to change it , " said steinbrück after meeting with the chairman of the center of organizations of holocaust survivors in israel , noah flug .
flug said that although the reparation agreement with germany would not be amended , if there were " specific problems " germany would try to solve them .
" we did n't ask for money , we spoke of the responsibility of the german government , " added flug .
complaints that germany 's reparations fail to compensate in any reasonable way for the trauma of the holocaust are ongoing .
but the israeli holocaust survivors who met with steinbrück on thursday , nov .
23 , to request improvements to the reparations arrangement specifically argued that the original agreement failed to take into account today 's longer life expectancy or the tens of thousands of survivors who immigrated to israel after the fall of the soviet union .
according to news agency dpa , steinbrück did agree that germany would try to help needy survivors via the claims committee , the international organization that coordinates compensation payments to survivors .
an unofficial request ?
earlier this month , an israeli paper published comments by israel 's pensioners affairs minister rafael eytan saying israel was keen to reopen the deal , but he later said he was misquoted and only wished to examine with germany ways to support survivors given the ' holes ' in the original agreement .
on thursday , a spokeswomen for the israeli finance ministry confirmed that israel has never officially requested germany revise the reparations deal .
the luxembourg agreement between the two countries stipulated that germany would pay israel reparations , and israel would look after the survivors , who would not be permitted to sue germany directly .
since the 1950s , germany has paid 26 billion euros -lrb- $ 38 billion -rrb- in compensation .
around 1.7 billion of this went to israel , the rest to german claimants .
israel takes responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 240,000 holocaust survivors live in israel others say that israel 's reliance on germany is unreasonable and that the country should look after its elderly holocaust survivors itself .
after a recent storm of protest by holocaust survivors who accused the government of abandoning them , prime minister ehud olmert announced that for the first time in its history , the israeli government would pay monthly allowances from its own budget to holocaust survivors and refugees .
the state agreed to give israelis who survived nazi ghettos and concentration camps a monthly stipend of nearly $ 300 -lrb- $ 200 -rrb- , in addition to tax discounts and other breaks .
it also approved monthly payments ranging from $ 40 to $ 125 for 80,000 israelis , most from the former soviet union , who became refugees as the nazis conquered europe but never lived under nazi occupation .

this comes seven years after danes firmly rejected the european single currency . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen also wants voters to decide whether they are still in favor of opting out of eu policy in three other areas related to joint defense , justice and home affairs .
" the time is approaching , " rasmussen told a news conference .
" it is the government 's view that the people in this parliamentary term should have the opportunity to take a stance on the danish eu opt-outs . "
rasmussen , who is a staunch supporter of the european union , said the exemptions harmed danish interests .
he did not say when the vote might be held .
but it should happen some time within the newly elected center-right government 's four-year mandate period .
government push for more integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danish prime minister is treating his re-election as a mandate to forge more eu integration he also said he wanted the recently agreed eu treaty to be quickly ratified , but did not say if this would require its own referendum .
the danes had scheduled a vote on an earlier proposed eu constitution in september 2005 , but called it off after french and dutch voters rejected the treaty .
only two of the eight parties in the danish parliament , together representing about 17 percent of the vote in last week 's election , are opposed to the eu and further co-operation .
analysts predict that , if denmark were to join the single currency , the practical economic impact would be limited because the danish krone tracks the euro .
" it will change nothing , " said danske bank chief economist steen bocian .
" the danish economy is acting as if it were a full member of the union .
there will be a limited effect on the currency but not much because it 's been extremely stable for a long period . "
polls show eu rising in popularity among danes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen is hoping that the danes will say " yes " this time around danes rejected the euro in 2000 .
the other opt-outs were secured in 1993 after the country initially rejected the maastricht treaty .
recently they seem to have warmed a little to the european bloc .
according to a poll published last month , 51 percent of nearly 1,000 danes surveyed said they were in favor of getting rid of the exemption on the euro , while 40 percent said they were opposed to the move .
the poll also indicated a majority of danes were in favor of lifting the exemptions on joint defense and judiciary cooperation , but that 73 percent wanted to maintain the exemption on european citizenship .
in the nordic region , only finland has joined the 13-member euro zone .
neighboring sweden has , like denmark , maintained its krona currency despite its eu membership , while norway and iceland have rejected even joining the eu . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he resigned in march 2007 to focus on his interests in alternative energy and climate change .
in october 2007 , the 39-year-old founded project better place , a company that 's working on a green transportation infrastructure based on electric cars as an alternative to fossil fuel technology . dw-tv : what will things be like in 2030 ? shai agassi : my belief is that you will not see cars going on oil .
we take oil out of the ground and look how hard it is to find oil today .
there are now oil-rigs that go 12,000 feet -lrb- 3,650 meters -rrb- into water and then another 6,000 feet into the ground - to find oil .
it is a technological marvel .
but why would you do this ?
if we can find cheaper , easier ways to drive our cars , to energize our cars we are probably going to do that . i think you are also going to have a different experience with water : we do not think about it today .
but there is a growing population of people that do not have drinking water .
yet in most of the western world , we use water to flush our sewage .
why would you take clean water and use it for sewage .
it makes absolutely no sense .
there was an economy of abundance and we are going to shift into an economy of constraints .
and when you shift into the economy of constraints , you have to come in with technological improvements to change the way we do things . we are going to need energy , we are going to need water and we are going to need food .
those three fundamentals will get a lot more attention , for example , than medicine today .
we will run out of clean water , we 've already run out of easy energy .
and we will run out of food . what is your favourite technological , futuristic gimmick ? i would say that energy is probably the biggest problem that we are facing today .
if we do not solve the energy crisis , the lack of energy , all the other good things will not happen .
we are going to get wars .
the biggest wars in the world were either started or ended as result of energy issues .
if i look at the fundamental things that are happening right now , they are all geared towards creating materials or engineering materials that will solve energy problems .
and i think that is the most exiting part of the world right now in technology . what is driving you personally to shape the future ? i think two things .
one : you wake up in the morning , you see the eyes of your kids and you have a huge responsibility to the next generation to do something with the power you are given .
all young global leaders have been tremendously lucky .
we have been fortunate to get education at a young age , we have been fortunate to be successful and we have been fortunate to be able to take risk .
some of us have been fortunate to face adversity in a way that has actually made us grow .
what do you do with it ?
if you worry about your personal wealth or personal benefits you are wasting this gift - that you are here .
so what i am mostly worried about is : how do i give back ?
i am getting to 40 , what do you give back in he next 40 years ?
it is a huge responsibility .
if you do not take it as an opportunity to serve and an opportunity to give , you are really wasting god 's gift .

" the existing deal is signed and final and there is no need to change it , " said steinbrück after meeting with the chairman of the center of organizations of holocaust survivors in israel , noah flug .
flug said that although the reparation agreement with germany would not be amended , if there were " specific problems " germany would try to solve them .
" we did n't ask for money , we spoke of the responsibility of the german government , " added flug .
complaints that germany 's reparations fail to compensate in any reasonable way for the trauma of the holocaust are ongoing .
but the israeli holocaust survivors who met with steinbrück on thursday , nov .
23 , to request improvements to the reparations arrangement specifically argued that the original agreement failed to take into account today 's longer life expectancy or the tens of thousands of survivors who immigrated to israel after the fall of the soviet union .
according to news agency dpa , steinbrück did agree that germany would try to help needy survivors via the claims committee , the international organization that coordinates compensation payments to survivors .
an unofficial request ?
earlier this month , an israeli paper published comments by israel 's pensioners affairs minister rafael eytan saying israel was keen to reopen the deal , but he later said he was misquoted and only wished to examine with germany ways to support survivors given the ' holes ' in the original agreement .
on thursday , a spokeswomen for the israeli finance ministry confirmed that israel has never officially requested germany revise the reparations deal .
the luxembourg agreement between the two countries stipulated that germany would pay israel reparations , and israel would look after the survivors , who would not be permitted to sue germany directly .
since the 1950s , germany has paid 26 billion euros -lrb- $ 38 billion -rrb- in compensation .
around 1.7 billion of this went to israel , the rest to german claimants .
israel takes responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 240,000 holocaust survivors live in israel others say that israel 's reliance on germany is unreasonable and that the country should look after its elderly holocaust survivors itself .
after a recent storm of protest by holocaust survivors who accused the government of abandoning them , prime minister ehud olmert announced that for the first time in its history , the israeli government would pay monthly allowances from its own budget to holocaust survivors and refugees .
the state agreed to give israelis who survived nazi ghettos and concentration camps a monthly stipend of nearly $ 300 -lrb- $ 200 -rrb- , in addition to tax discounts and other breaks .
it also approved monthly payments ranging from $ 40 to $ 125 for 80,000 israelis , most from the former soviet union , who became refugees as the nazis conquered europe but never lived under nazi occupation .

but why would you do this ?
if we can find cheaper , easier ways to drive our cars , to energize our cars we are probably going to do that . i think you are also going to have a different experience with water : we do not think about it today .

why would you take clean water and use it for sewage .
it makes absolutely no sense .
there was an economy of abundance and we are going to shift into an economy of constraints .

23 , that warsaw was sticking by the previous government 's decision not to adopt the eu charter of fundamental rights . before snap elections in october , tusk 's civic platform party -lrb- po -rrb- had pledged to review the policy decision .
but president lech kaczynski , the twin brother of the former prime minister , threatened to vote down the new european treaty in the event of a reversal .
the kaczynskis and their ultra-conservative allies regard the charter as being too morally liberal .
" in civic platform 's opinion , the charter would be a positive act , but a safe ratification of the treaty is the most important issue , " said tusk in his first address to parliament after his civic platform party won the elections in october .
the new government needs the kaczynskis ' support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his success at the snap elections , tusk still needs the opposition tusk 's center-right coalition with the centrist peasants ' party coalition does not have a two-thirds majority so it is reliant on opposition support to ratify the eu treaty .
the former polish government under jaroslaw kaczynski only agreed to support the treaty on condition that the country could opt-out of the charter .
in particular , the rightist coalition argued that the charter would limit warsaw 's ability to maintain a traditional roman catholic family policy and enable the european court of justice to force poland to grant new rights to homosexuals .
the law and justice party also warned that the charter could spur legal claims by germans who lost property after the polish-german border was redrawn after world war ii .
tusk sets course for the euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new polish pm will have to get along with the polish president until 2010 during the unveiling of his new government 's program , the new prime minister also pledged to pursue a more european-oriented policy than his euroskeptic predecessor and push towards the adoption of the euro as quickly as possible .
he also reiterated his earlier pledges to pull troops out of iraq in 2008 .
" this government will do everything to make sure poland and the poles are quickly ready for the euro , " tusk said .
he also confirmed his cabinet would lower taxes , cut the budget deficit and speed up privatization to keep up economic growth rates while pursuing its euro-zone entry .
tusk , however , did not announce a timeframe for the joining plans .
" we want to nearly balance the budget in a few years , so our road to entry is safe , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 23.11.2007 no more holocaust reparations , says german finance minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück pays his respects at the yad vashem memorial finance minister peer steinbrück said in jerusalem thursday that germany had no plans to renegotiate a holocaust reparations deal signed with israel in 1952 . " the existing deal is signed and final and there is no need to change it , " said steinbrück after meeting with the chairman of the center of organizations of holocaust survivors in israel , noah flug .
flug said that although the reparation agreement with germany would not be amended , if there were " specific problems " germany would try to solve them .
" we did n't ask for money , we spoke of the responsibility of the german government , " added flug .
complaints that germany 's reparations fail to compensate in any reasonable way for the trauma of the holocaust are ongoing .
but the israeli holocaust survivors who met with steinbrück on thursday , nov .
23 , to request improvements to the reparations arrangement specifically argued that the original agreement failed to take into account today 's longer life expectancy or the tens of thousands of survivors who immigrated to israel after the fall of the soviet union .
according to news agency dpa , steinbrück did agree that germany would try to help needy survivors via the claims committee , the international organization that coordinates compensation payments to survivors .
an unofficial request ?
earlier this month , an israeli paper published comments by israel 's pensioners affairs minister rafael eytan saying israel was keen to reopen the deal , but he later said he was misquoted and only wished to examine with germany ways to support survivors given the ' holes ' in the original agreement .
on thursday , a spokeswomen for the israeli finance ministry confirmed that israel has never officially requested germany revise the reparations deal .
the luxembourg agreement between the two countries stipulated that germany would pay israel reparations , and israel would look after the survivors , who would not be permitted to sue germany directly .
since the 1950s , germany has paid 26 billion euros -lrb- $ 38 billion -rrb- in compensation .
around 1.7 billion of this went to israel , the rest to german claimants .
israel takes responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 240,000 holocaust survivors live in israel others say that israel 's reliance on germany is unreasonable and that the country should look after its elderly holocaust survivors itself .
after a recent storm of protest by holocaust survivors who accused the government of abandoning them , prime minister ehud olmert announced that for the first time in its history , the israeli government would pay monthly allowances from its own budget to holocaust survivors and refugees .
the state agreed to give israelis who survived nazi ghettos and concentration camps a monthly stipend of nearly $ 300 -lrb- $ 200 -rrb- , in addition to tax discounts and other breaks .

" the existing deal is signed and final and there is no need to change it , " said steinbrück after meeting with the chairman of the center of organizations of holocaust survivors in israel , noah flug .
flug said that although the reparation agreement with germany would not be amended , if there were " specific problems " germany would try to solve them .
" we did n't ask for money , we spoke of the responsibility of the german government , " added flug .
complaints that germany 's reparations fail to compensate in any reasonable way for the trauma of the holocaust are ongoing .
but the israeli holocaust survivors who met with steinbrück on thursday , nov .
23 , to request improvements to the reparations arrangement specifically argued that the original agreement failed to take into account today 's longer life expectancy or the tens of thousands of survivors who immigrated to israel after the fall of the soviet union .
according to news agency dpa , steinbrück did agree that germany would try to help needy survivors via the claims committee , the international organization that coordinates compensation payments to survivors .
an unofficial request ?
earlier this month , an israeli paper published comments by israel 's pensioners affairs minister rafael eytan saying israel was keen to reopen the deal , but he later said he was misquoted and only wished to examine with germany ways to support survivors given the ' holes ' in the original agreement .
on thursday , a spokeswomen for the israeli finance ministry confirmed that israel has never officially requested germany revise the reparations deal .
the luxembourg agreement between the two countries stipulated that germany would pay israel reparations , and israel would look after the survivors , who would not be permitted to sue germany directly .
since the 1950s , germany has paid 26 billion euros -lrb- $ 38 billion -rrb- in compensation .
around 1.7 billion of this went to israel , the rest to german claimants .
israel takes responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 240,000 holocaust survivors live in israel others say that israel 's reliance on germany is unreasonable and that the country should look after its elderly holocaust survivors itself .
after a recent storm of protest by holocaust survivors who accused the government of abandoning them , prime minister ehud olmert announced that for the first time in its history , the israeli government would pay monthly allowances from its own budget to holocaust survivors and refugees .
the state agreed to give israelis who survived nazi ghettos and concentration camps a monthly stipend of nearly $ 300 -lrb- $ 200 -rrb- , in addition to tax discounts and other breaks .

with more than 1 million articles in english , wikipedia has become one of the largest collaboratively edited reference projects in the world and one of the 15 most visited web sites on the internet .
today , wales is seen as a champion of internet-enabled egalitarianism .
he is also founder of the for-profit company wikia , inc .
in may 2006 , he was named one of time magazine 's 100 most influential people . dw-tv : what will education be like in 2030 ? jimmy wales : i think that a lot of trends that we see happening right now are going to continue .
there is an increased importance of education as technology is constantly changing .
it is really important for lots of different people to have more education than they did in the past .
if you think about computer science , the field is changing so rapidly that your college degree may be valuable in the sense of providing some real background knowledge .
but in day-to-day work it is a constant process of educating yourself on techniques and new software , new programming languages .
i think that kind of change is going to happen in more and more fields .
it will require people to learn lots of new things all the time . what kind of invention would you like to see by 2030 ? a lot of what i am frustrated with in terms of technology right now has to do with technology that has already been invented , but that just does not work as well as it should .
i think everybody has had trouble with the internet .
sometimes it is slow , sometimes it is not working .
i like the idea of the internet being available everywhere .
that is coming , but it will take a while - 10 or 20 years . some of the more exiting technologies that are a lot more visionary would be things like nano-technology , where we are inventing new kinds of materials that are going to give rise to new kinds of products , to new kind of medical cures .
those things are really going to be very important in the future . what drives you ? for me it is really my daughter and thinking about the future of the world from her perspective : what kind of planet are we building , what kind of planet are we going to leave to the next generation and what are the things that we can do today that are productive and useful and will lay down a framework , so that the next generation coming along can inherit a good planet , prosperity , health , fairness and justice and all those things .
that is the kind of thing that inspires me - to think about my own daughter .
maybe it is corny but it is true . interview : michael wetzel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she died on tuesday , nov .
20 , after being admitted to a hospital in schwerin , weighing just over seven kilos -lrb- 15 pounds -rrb- - three times less than an average child her age .
her death has prompted calls from politicians for more thorough preemptive controls .
" i am a vehement advocate of making preventative medical check-ups compulsory , " kerstin griese , the social democratic chairwoman of the german parliament 's family affairs committee told the daily berliner zeitung on friday .
" this would provide a fundamental building block for child protection . "
but wolfram hartmann , president of the pediatricians association , told dpa that gaps between such visits are too long to make them effective .
" it would be wrong to think that compulsory health checks could prevent cases of child neglect , " he said .
instead , hartmann argued for greater cooperation between health officials and social workers .
opposition parties agree that the problem is a result of authorities failing to do their job .
" given that cuts have been made in youth-protection offices for years , it should come as no surprise that these cases happen , " said jörn wunderlich from the left party .
effects of cost-cutting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors need to be attuned to signs of possible abuse every time such stories make the headlines in germany , the nation is left wondering how these families can fall through the net .
fingers are invariably pointed at the child-protection services .
when a two-year old died in bremen last year , many blamed the local welfare office which had left the boy in the care of his drug-addicted foster father despite repeated warnings .
the authorities in schwerin have also come in for criticism .
hermann junghans , head of schwerin social services , insists that welfare officers did their job properly but has admitted that the two social workers who visited the family a fortnight ago after an anonymous tip-off had " found nothing amiss . "
neighbors , meanwhile , said the two social workers never actually entered the apartment .
according to newspaper reports , heike seifert , head of schwerin 's youth welfare office , complained to the local council earlier this year that financial cuts were hampering the work of the office .
on friday , schwerin 's mayor , norbert claussen , acknowledged flaws in the welfare system .
lea-sophie 's death " showed that adequate mechanisms are not in place , " he said in a statement .
heike seifert , meanwhile , was quoted in the daily taz as saying that this was by no means the first time that children had been admitted with symptoms of malnutrition to hospitals in schwerin .
the number of child endangerment cases has been increasing in the town , confirmed junghans at a press conference this week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 23.11.2007 authorities under fire after infant death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many cases slip through the net the death by starvation of a five-year-old in the eastern german town of schwerin has triggered calls from politicians and social workers to introduce compulsory preventative medical check-ups . the parents of lea-sophie were arrested this week on charges of neglect after allegedly failing to adequately feed their daughter for months on end .
she died on tuesday , nov .
20 , after being admitted to a hospital in schwerin , weighing just over seven kilos -lrb- 15 pounds -rrb- - three times less than an average child her age .
her death has prompted calls from politicians for more thorough preemptive controls .
" i am a vehement advocate of making preventative medical check-ups compulsory , " kerstin griese , the social democratic chairwoman of the german parliament 's family affairs committee told the daily berliner zeitung on friday .
" this would provide a fundamental building block for child protection . "
but wolfram hartmann , president of the pediatricians association , told dpa that gaps between such visits are too long to make them effective .
" it would be wrong to think that compulsory health checks could prevent cases of child neglect , " he said .
instead , hartmann argued for greater cooperation between health officials and social workers .
opposition parties agree that the problem is a result of authorities failing to do their job .
" given that cuts have been made in youth-protection offices for years , it should come as no surprise that these cases happen , " said jörn wunderlich from the left party .
effects of cost-cutting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors need to be attuned to signs of possible abuse every time such stories make the headlines in germany , the nation is left wondering how these families can fall through the net .
fingers are invariably pointed at the child-protection services .
when a two-year old died in bremen last year , many blamed the local welfare office which had left the boy in the care of his drug-addicted foster father despite repeated warnings .
the authorities in schwerin have also come in for criticism .
hermann junghans , head of schwerin social services , insists that welfare officers did their job properly but has admitted that the two social workers who visited the family a fortnight ago after an anonymous tip-off had " found nothing amiss . "
neighbors , meanwhile , said the two social workers never actually entered the apartment .
according to newspaper reports , heike seifert , head of schwerin 's youth welfare office , complained to the local council earlier this year that financial cuts were hampering the work of the office .
on friday , schwerin 's mayor , norbert claussen , acknowledged flaws in the welfare system .
lea-sophie 's death " showed that adequate mechanisms are not in place , " he said in a statement .
heike seifert , meanwhile , was quoted in the daily taz as saying that this was by no means the first time that children had been admitted with symptoms of malnutrition to hospitals in schwerin .
the number of child endangerment cases has been increasing in the town , confirmed junghans at a press conference this week .
eighty-six cases were registered in the first six months of 2007 .
in 2006 , the figure was 133 , compared to just 42 in 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there is an increased importance of education as technology is constantly changing .
it is really important for lots of different people to have more education than they did in the past .
if you think about computer science , the field is changing so rapidly that your college degree may be valuable in the sense of providing some real background knowledge .
but in day-to-day work it is a constant process of educating yourself on techniques and new software , new programming languages .
i think that kind of change is going to happen in more and more fields .
it will require people to learn lots of new things all the time . what kind of invention would you like to see by 2030 ? a lot of what i am frustrated with in terms of technology right now has to do with technology that has already been invented , but that just does not work as well as it should .
i think everybody has had trouble with the internet .
sometimes it is slow , sometimes it is not working .
i like the idea of the internet being available everywhere .
that is coming , but it will take a while - 10 or 20 years . some of the more exiting technologies that are a lot more visionary would be things like nano-technology , where we are inventing new kinds of materials that are going to give rise to new kinds of products , to new kind of medical cures .
those things are really going to be very important in the future . what drives you ? for me it is really my daughter and thinking about the future of the world from her perspective : what kind of planet are we building , what kind of planet are we going to leave to the next generation and what are the things that we can do today that are productive and useful and will lay down a framework , so that the next generation coming along can inherit a good planet , prosperity , health , fairness and justice and all those things .

she died on tuesday , nov .
20 , after being admitted to a hospital in schwerin , weighing just over seven kilos -lrb- 15 pounds -rrb- - three times less than an average child her age .
her death has prompted calls from politicians for more thorough preemptive controls .
" i am a vehement advocate of making preventative medical check-ups compulsory , " kerstin griese , the social democratic chairwoman of the german parliament 's family affairs committee told the daily berliner zeitung on friday .
" this would provide a fundamental building block for child protection . "
but wolfram hartmann , president of the pediatricians association , told dpa that gaps between such visits are too long to make them effective .
" it would be wrong to think that compulsory health checks could prevent cases of child neglect , " he said .
instead , hartmann argued for greater cooperation between health officials and social workers .
opposition parties agree that the problem is a result of authorities failing to do their job .
" given that cuts have been made in youth-protection offices for years , it should come as no surprise that these cases happen , " said jörn wunderlich from the left party .
effects of cost-cutting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors need to be attuned to signs of possible abuse every time such stories make the headlines in germany , the nation is left wondering how these families can fall through the net .
fingers are invariably pointed at the child-protection services .
when a two-year old died in bremen last year , many blamed the local welfare office which had left the boy in the care of his drug-addicted foster father despite repeated warnings .
the authorities in schwerin have also come in for criticism .
hermann junghans , head of schwerin social services , insists that welfare officers did their job properly but has admitted that the two social workers who visited the family a fortnight ago after an anonymous tip-off had " found nothing amiss . "
neighbors , meanwhile , said the two social workers never actually entered the apartment .
according to newspaper reports , heike seifert , head of schwerin 's youth welfare office , complained to the local council earlier this year that financial cuts were hampering the work of the office .
on friday , schwerin 's mayor , norbert claussen , acknowledged flaws in the welfare system .
lea-sophie 's death " showed that adequate mechanisms are not in place , " he said in a statement .
heike seifert , meanwhile , was quoted in the daily taz as saying that this was by no means the first time that children had been admitted with symptoms of malnutrition to hospitals in schwerin .
the number of child endangerment cases has been increasing in the town , confirmed junghans at a press conference this week .
eighty-six cases were registered in the first six months of 2007 .

23 , that warsaw was sticking by the previous government 's decision not to adopt the eu charter of fundamental rights . before snap elections in october , tusk 's civic platform party -lrb- po -rrb- had pledged to review the policy decision .
but president lech kaczynski , the twin brother of the former prime minister , threatened to vote down the new european treaty in the event of a reversal .
the kaczynskis and their ultra-conservative allies regard the charter as being too morally liberal .
" in civic platform 's opinion , the charter would be a positive act , but a safe ratification of the treaty is the most important issue , " said tusk in his first address to parliament after his civic platform party won the elections in october .
the new government needs the kaczynskis ' support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his success at the snap elections , tusk still needs the opposition tusk 's center-right coalition with the centrist peasants ' party coalition does not have a two-thirds majority so it is reliant on opposition support to ratify the eu treaty .
the former polish government under jaroslaw kaczynski only agreed to support the treaty on condition that the country could opt-out of the charter .
in particular , the rightist coalition argued that the charter would limit warsaw 's ability to maintain a traditional roman catholic family policy and enable the european court of justice to force poland to grant new rights to homosexuals .
the law and justice party also warned that the charter could spur legal claims by germans who lost property after the polish-german border was redrawn after world war ii .
tusk sets course for the euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new polish pm will have to get along with the polish president until 2010 during the unveiling of his new government 's program , the new prime minister also pledged to pursue a more european-oriented policy than his euroskeptic predecessor and push towards the adoption of the euro as quickly as possible .
he also reiterated his earlier pledges to pull troops out of iraq in 2008 .
" this government will do everything to make sure poland and the poles are quickly ready for the euro , " tusk said .
he also confirmed his cabinet would lower taxes , cut the budget deficit and speed up privatization to keep up economic growth rates while pursuing its euro-zone entry .
tusk , however , did not announce a timeframe for the joining plans .
" we want to nearly balance the budget in a few years , so our road to entry is safe , " he said .

23 , that warsaw was sticking by the previous government 's decision not to adopt the eu charter of fundamental rights . before snap elections in october , tusk 's civic platform party -lrb- po -rrb- had pledged to review the policy decision .
but president lech kaczynski , the twin brother of the former prime minister , threatened to vote down the new european treaty in the event of a reversal .
the kaczynskis and their ultra-conservative allies regard the charter as being too morally liberal .
" in civic platform 's opinion , the charter would be a positive act , but a safe ratification of the treaty is the most important issue , " said tusk in his first address to parliament after his civic platform party won the elections in october .
the new government needs the kaczynskis ' support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his success at the snap elections , tusk still needs the opposition tusk 's center-right coalition with the centrist peasants ' party coalition does not have a two-thirds majority so it is reliant on opposition support to ratify the eu treaty .
the former polish government under jaroslaw kaczynski only agreed to support the treaty on condition that the country could opt-out of the charter .
in particular , the rightist coalition argued that the charter would limit warsaw 's ability to maintain a traditional roman catholic family policy and enable the european court of justice to force poland to grant new rights to homosexuals .
the law and justice party also warned that the charter could spur legal claims by germans who lost property after the polish-german border was redrawn after world war ii .
tusk sets course for the euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new polish pm will have to get along with the polish president until 2010 during the unveiling of his new government 's program , the new prime minister also pledged to pursue a more european-oriented policy than his euroskeptic predecessor and push towards the adoption of the euro as quickly as possible .
he also reiterated his earlier pledges to pull troops out of iraq in 2008 .
" this government will do everything to make sure poland and the poles are quickly ready for the euro , " tusk said .
he also confirmed his cabinet would lower taxes , cut the budget deficit and speed up privatization to keep up economic growth rates while pursuing its euro-zone entry .
tusk , however , did not announce a timeframe for the joining plans .
" we want to nearly balance the budget in a few years , so our road to entry is safe , " he said .

with more than 1 million articles in english , wikipedia has become one of the largest collaboratively edited reference projects in the world and one of the 15 most visited web sites on the internet .
today , wales is seen as a champion of internet-enabled egalitarianism .
he is also founder of the for-profit company wikia , inc .
in may 2006 , he was named one of time magazine 's 100 most influential people . dw-tv : what will education be like in 2030 ? jimmy wales : i think that a lot of trends that we see happening right now are going to continue .
there is an increased importance of education as technology is constantly changing .
it is really important for lots of different people to have more education than they did in the past .
if you think about computer science , the field is changing so rapidly that your college degree may be valuable in the sense of providing some real background knowledge .
but in day-to-day work it is a constant process of educating yourself on techniques and new software , new programming languages .
i think that kind of change is going to happen in more and more fields .
it will require people to learn lots of new things all the time . what kind of invention would you like to see by 2030 ? a lot of what i am frustrated with in terms of technology right now has to do with technology that has already been invented , but that just does not work as well as it should .
i think everybody has had trouble with the internet .
sometimes it is slow , sometimes it is not working .
i like the idea of the internet being available everywhere .
that is coming , but it will take a while - 10 or 20 years . some of the more exiting technologies that are a lot more visionary would be things like nano-technology , where we are inventing new kinds of materials that are going to give rise to new kinds of products , to new kind of medical cures .
those things are really going to be very important in the future . what drives you ? for me it is really my daughter and thinking about the future of the world from her perspective : what kind of planet are we building , what kind of planet are we going to leave to the next generation and what are the things that we can do today that are productive and useful and will lay down a framework , so that the next generation coming along can inherit a good planet , prosperity , health , fairness and justice and all those things .
that is the kind of thing that inspires me - to think about my own daughter .
maybe it is corny but it is true . interview : michael wetzel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there is an increased importance of education as technology is constantly changing .
it is really important for lots of different people to have more education than they did in the past .
if you think about computer science , the field is changing so rapidly that your college degree may be valuable in the sense of providing some real background knowledge .
but in day-to-day work it is a constant process of educating yourself on techniques and new software , new programming languages .
i think that kind of change is going to happen in more and more fields .
it will require people to learn lots of new things all the time . what kind of invention would you like to see by 2030 ? a lot of what i am frustrated with in terms of technology right now has to do with technology that has already been invented , but that just does not work as well as it should .
i think everybody has had trouble with the internet .
sometimes it is slow , sometimes it is not working .
i like the idea of the internet being available everywhere .
that is coming , but it will take a while - 10 or 20 years . some of the more exiting technologies that are a lot more visionary would be things like nano-technology , where we are inventing new kinds of materials that are going to give rise to new kinds of products , to new kind of medical cures .
those things are really going to be very important in the future . what drives you ? for me it is really my daughter and thinking about the future of the world from her perspective : what kind of planet are we building , what kind of planet are we going to leave to the next generation and what are the things that we can do today that are productive and useful and will lay down a framework , so that the next generation coming along can inherit a good planet , prosperity , health , fairness and justice and all those things .

dhar also sits on the executive board of the " connect the world " initiative of the international telecommunications union of the united nations . dw-tv : what will have changed in terms of education in 2030 ? the global economies will be moving more towards services and away from farming and manufacturing .
however , these service jobs will be more specialised , they will have a higher technology component , because technology is touching everything .
then there is another trend : more and more companies are going to become global - not just in terms of their supply-chain , but also in their markets . how does that effect education ?
i think that there is a higher need of private-public collaboration - a higher participation of private enterprises in education processes and education systems .
i am not saying that private people , private companies should be running the education .
but i think they should be participating a lot more .
in an industry like mine , it is clear that we have a stake in the education process of india and many other countries that we are operating in .
so companies like ours could be easy starting-points of private enterprise participation in the education process . the changes also have some effect on the education that we have to do for seniors in our work force .
if you look at the developed world today , in many parts of the world today , the work-force age is going up .
and things are changing so fast .
so there is a whole need for re-education of the older work force to take the new jobs that are emerging . what invention would you like to see become reality by 2030 ? it would be great if a 12-year-old pupil in school would get exposed to at least two different countries he has never been to .
he would actually learn the culture , actually learn a certain business process that exists in that country which is quite different from the way it is in his home country .
a very simple example could be banking .
banking looks the same everywhere , but it is not .
it is very important for kids to appreciate that and to be aware that there are other worlds , which might look very different .
they should know that there are people in this world who are very different , yet they are perfectly all right . what is driving you ? as a part of my job , i travel a lot across the world .
whenever i get a chance to go out , i see a lot of similarity in simple things like social interaction .
and i yet see very different approaches in different countries .
now , it is one thing to not be aware of the problems at all .
you stay in one place and you are not aware of what is going on in the world .
and therefore you are not doing much about it .
it is quite another thing to actually travel and see what is going on , see the problems and see the solutions which exist in different parts of the world and not do anything about it .
i just feel that it is impossible for me to ignore the calling of connecting people in different parts of the world , who are trying to solve the same problem in different ways .
that is really what drives me . interview : michael wetzel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dhar also sits on the executive board of the " connect the world " initiative of the international telecommunications union of the united nations . dw-tv : what will have changed in terms of education in 2030 ? the global economies will be moving more towards services and away from farming and manufacturing .
however , these service jobs will be more specialised , they will have a higher technology component , because technology is touching everything .
then there is another trend : more and more companies are going to become global - not just in terms of their supply-chain , but also in their markets . how does that effect education ?
i think that there is a higher need of private-public collaboration - a higher participation of private enterprises in education processes and education systems .
i am not saying that private people , private companies should be running the education .
but i think they should be participating a lot more .
in an industry like mine , it is clear that we have a stake in the education process of india and many other countries that we are operating in .
so companies like ours could be easy starting-points of private enterprise participation in the education process . the changes also have some effect on the education that we have to do for seniors in our work force .
if you look at the developed world today , in many parts of the world today , the work-force age is going up .
and things are changing so fast .
so there is a whole need for re-education of the older work force to take the new jobs that are emerging . what invention would you like to see become reality by 2030 ? it would be great if a 12-year-old pupil in school would get exposed to at least two different countries he has never been to .
he would actually learn the culture , actually learn a certain business process that exists in that country which is quite different from the way it is in his home country .
a very simple example could be banking .
banking looks the same everywhere , but it is not .
it is very important for kids to appreciate that and to be aware that there are other worlds , which might look very different .
they should know that there are people in this world who are very different , yet they are perfectly all right . what is driving you ? as a part of my job , i travel a lot across the world .
whenever i get a chance to go out , i see a lot of similarity in simple things like social interaction .
and i yet see very different approaches in different countries .
now , it is one thing to not be aware of the problems at all .
you stay in one place and you are not aware of what is going on in the world .
and therefore you are not doing much about it .
it is quite another thing to actually travel and see what is going on , see the problems and see the solutions which exist in different parts of the world and not do anything about it .
i just feel that it is impossible for me to ignore the calling of connecting people in different parts of the world , who are trying to solve the same problem in different ways .
that is really what drives me . interview : michael wetzel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he resigned in march 2007 to focus on his interests in alternative energy and climate change .
in october 2007 , the 39-year-old founded project better place , a company that 's working on a green transportation infrastructure based on electric cars as an alternative to fossil fuel technology . dw-tv : what will things be like in 2030 ? shai agassi : my belief is that you will not see cars going on oil .
we take oil out of the ground and look how hard it is to find oil today .
there are now oil-rigs that go 12,000 feet -lrb- 3,650 meters -rrb- into water and then another 6,000 feet into the ground - to find oil .
it is a technological marvel .
but why would you do this ?
if we can find cheaper , easier ways to drive our cars , to energize our cars we are probably going to do that . i think you are also going to have a different experience with water : we do not think about it today .
but there is a growing population of people that do not have drinking water .
yet in most of the western world , we use water to flush our sewage .
why would you take clean water and use it for sewage .
it makes absolutely no sense .
there was an economy of abundance and we are going to shift into an economy of constraints .
and when you shift into the economy of constraints , you have to come in with technological improvements to change the way we do things . we are going to need energy , we are going to need water and we are going to need food .
those three fundamentals will get a lot more attention , for example , than medicine today .
we will run out of clean water , we 've already run out of easy energy .
and we will run out of food . what is your favourite technological , futuristic gimmick ? i would say that energy is probably the biggest problem that we are facing today .
if we do not solve the energy crisis , the lack of energy , all the other good things will not happen .
we are going to get wars .
the biggest wars in the world were either started or ended as result of energy issues .
if i look at the fundamental things that are happening right now , they are all geared towards creating materials or engineering materials that will solve energy problems .
and i think that is the most exiting part of the world right now in technology . what is driving you personally to shape the future ? i think two things .
one : you wake up in the morning , you see the eyes of your kids and you have a huge responsibility to the next generation to do something with the power you are given .
all young global leaders have been tremendously lucky .
we have been fortunate to get education at a young age , we have been fortunate to be successful and we have been fortunate to be able to take risk .
some of us have been fortunate to face adversity in a way that has actually made us grow .
what do you do with it ?
if you worry about your personal wealth or personal benefits you are wasting this gift - that you are here .
so what i am mostly worried about is : how do i give back ?
i am getting to 40 , what do you give back in he next 40 years ?
it is a huge responsibility .
if you do not take it as an opportunity to serve and an opportunity to give , you are really wasting god 's gift .

with more than 1 million articles in english , wikipedia has become one of the largest collaboratively edited reference projects in the world and one of the 15 most visited web sites on the internet .
today , wales is seen as a champion of internet-enabled egalitarianism .
he is also founder of the for-profit company wikia , inc .
in may 2006 , he was named one of time magazine 's 100 most influential people . dw-tv : what will education be like in 2030 ? jimmy wales : i think that a lot of trends that we see happening right now are going to continue .
there is an increased importance of education as technology is constantly changing .
it is really important for lots of different people to have more education than they did in the past .
if you think about computer science , the field is changing so rapidly that your college degree may be valuable in the sense of providing some real background knowledge .
but in day-to-day work it is a constant process of educating yourself on techniques and new software , new programming languages .
i think that kind of change is going to happen in more and more fields .
it will require people to learn lots of new things all the time . what kind of invention would you like to see by 2030 ? a lot of what i am frustrated with in terms of technology right now has to do with technology that has already been invented , but that just does not work as well as it should .
i think everybody has had trouble with the internet .
sometimes it is slow , sometimes it is not working .
i like the idea of the internet being available everywhere .
that is coming , but it will take a while - 10 or 20 years . some of the more exiting technologies that are a lot more visionary would be things like nano-technology , where we are inventing new kinds of materials that are going to give rise to new kinds of products , to new kind of medical cures .
those things are really going to be very important in the future . what drives you ? for me it is really my daughter and thinking about the future of the world from her perspective : what kind of planet are we building , what kind of planet are we going to leave to the next generation and what are the things that we can do today that are productive and useful and will lay down a framework , so that the next generation coming along can inherit a good planet , prosperity , health , fairness and justice and all those things .
that is the kind of thing that inspires me - to think about my own daughter .

he resigned in march 2007 to focus on his interests in alternative energy and climate change .
in october 2007 , the 39-year-old founded project better place , a company that 's working on a green transportation infrastructure based on electric cars as an alternative to fossil fuel technology . dw-tv : what will things be like in 2030 ? shai agassi : my belief is that you will not see cars going on oil .
we take oil out of the ground and look how hard it is to find oil today .
there are now oil-rigs that go 12,000 feet -lrb- 3,650 meters -rrb- into water and then another 6,000 feet into the ground - to find oil .
it is a technological marvel .
but why would you do this ?
if we can find cheaper , easier ways to drive our cars , to energize our cars we are probably going to do that . i think you are also going to have a different experience with water : we do not think about it today .
but there is a growing population of people that do not have drinking water .
yet in most of the western world , we use water to flush our sewage .
why would you take clean water and use it for sewage .
it makes absolutely no sense .
there was an economy of abundance and we are going to shift into an economy of constraints .
and when you shift into the economy of constraints , you have to come in with technological improvements to change the way we do things . we are going to need energy , we are going to need water and we are going to need food .
those three fundamentals will get a lot more attention , for example , than medicine today .
we will run out of clean water , we 've already run out of easy energy .
and we will run out of food . what is your favourite technological , futuristic gimmick ? i would say that energy is probably the biggest problem that we are facing today .
if we do not solve the energy crisis , the lack of energy , all the other good things will not happen .
we are going to get wars .
the biggest wars in the world were either started or ended as result of energy issues .
if i look at the fundamental things that are happening right now , they are all geared towards creating materials or engineering materials that will solve energy problems .
and i think that is the most exiting part of the world right now in technology . what is driving you personally to shape the future ? i think two things .
one : you wake up in the morning , you see the eyes of your kids and you have a huge responsibility to the next generation to do something with the power you are given .
all young global leaders have been tremendously lucky .
we have been fortunate to get education at a young age , we have been fortunate to be successful and we have been fortunate to be able to take risk .
some of us have been fortunate to face adversity in a way that has actually made us grow .
what do you do with it ?
if you worry about your personal wealth or personal benefits you are wasting this gift - that you are here .
so what i am mostly worried about is : how do i give back ?
i am getting to 40 , what do you give back in he next 40 years ?
it is a huge responsibility .
if you do not take it as an opportunity to serve and an opportunity to give , you are really wasting god 's gift .

23 , that warsaw was sticking by the previous government 's decision not to adopt the eu charter of fundamental rights . before snap elections in october , tusk 's civic platform party -lrb- po -rrb- had pledged to review the policy decision .
but president lech kaczynski , the twin brother of the former prime minister , threatened to vote down the new european treaty in the event of a reversal .
the kaczynskis and their ultra-conservative allies regard the charter as being too morally liberal .
" in civic platform 's opinion , the charter would be a positive act , but a safe ratification of the treaty is the most important issue , " said tusk in his first address to parliament after his civic platform party won the elections in october .
the new government needs the kaczynskis ' support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his success at the snap elections , tusk still needs the opposition tusk 's center-right coalition with the centrist peasants ' party coalition does not have a two-thirds majority so it is reliant on opposition support to ratify the eu treaty .
the former polish government under jaroslaw kaczynski only agreed to support the treaty on condition that the country could opt-out of the charter .
in particular , the rightist coalition argued that the charter would limit warsaw 's ability to maintain a traditional roman catholic family policy and enable the european court of justice to force poland to grant new rights to homosexuals .
the law and justice party also warned that the charter could spur legal claims by germans who lost property after the polish-german border was redrawn after world war ii .
tusk sets course for the euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new polish pm will have to get along with the polish president until 2010 during the unveiling of his new government 's program , the new prime minister also pledged to pursue a more european-oriented policy than his euroskeptic predecessor and push towards the adoption of the euro as quickly as possible .
he also reiterated his earlier pledges to pull troops out of iraq in 2008 .
" this government will do everything to make sure poland and the poles are quickly ready for the euro , " tusk said .
he also confirmed his cabinet would lower taxes , cut the budget deficit and speed up privatization to keep up economic growth rates while pursuing its euro-zone entry .
tusk , however , did not announce a timeframe for the joining plans .
" we want to nearly balance the budget in a few years , so our road to entry is safe , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 23.11.2007 german right-to-die group plans assisted-suicide test case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversy has led to criticism of germany 's low hospice provision the german branch of a swiss right-to-die organization has unleashed a storm of protest by saying it is planning to carry out an assisted suicide in germany .
dw-world.de spoke to dignitate 's deputy director . a few weeks ago , dignitas hit the headlines for helping two germans to die in a car park in switzerland .
the apparently undignified circumstances of their deaths sparked renewed criticism of the controversial organization , which has been accused of treating assisted suicide as a money-making enterprise . while assisted suicide is legal in switzerland , german law is much less clear-cut .
uwe-christian arnold , the deputy director of dignitate , the german branch of dignitas , and himself a doctor , says his group wants to set a legal precedent by carrying out an assisted suicide here in germany . the head of the german doctors ' chamber has called for dignitate to be banned . dw-world.de : why do you think your plan has created such an uproar in germany ? uwe-christian arnold : the reason that certain circles get so worked up about this topic is because it was completely taboo for decades .
it was linked to euthanasia and the nazis .
anyone who concerned themselves with this subject was lumped together with the nazis .
no one differentiated between the fact , for example , that no one asked the people who were killed then whether they wanted to die or not .
someone else decided that they should die .
that is completely different from what we 're planning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill mnd sufferer diane pretty lost her battle to change britain 's laws on assisted suicide the precondition is that the patient wants to die and that they have legitimate reason to want to end their life .
this is quite different from what the nazis did .
doctors tend to be conservative and the german medical association is particularly conservative because it was closely involved with the nazis .
they have not dealt with this past over the last 60 years .
on the occasions they did , it was always very uncomfortable . i do n't want to reproach them for the fact that they want to avoid the topic of assisted suicide , but we have to deal with this topic .
it is a pressing social need . have significant numbers of germans been traveling to switzerland to take up the services of dignitas ? no , the numbers are not very significant .
last year , there were 176 or so assisted suicides in total , 120 of those were germans .
that is a bit of an increase in the numbers of germans , but it roughly corresponds to that of previous years .
and it corresponds to the numbers going to other assisted suicide organizations , in switzerland and in oregon . the number of people who decide to end their lives in this way has remained steady . why is assisted suicide such a pressing social need ? the majority of people - 82 percent of the germans and the same numbers in england , in france , the us and canada - are in favor of legalizing assisted suicide .
in oregon it was made legal , but many other american cities want it .
and i think germany should have it .
it is a big country and the patients have big problems with this topic . is it partly a problem that was created by modern medicine ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under european law , it is up to individual states to decide on right-to-die legislation it is exclusively a problem of medicine - high tech medicine - that for decades has only been concerned with progress and it has notched up fantastic achievements .
but it has completely forgotten that death also stands , lurks , at the end of all these strivings .
making this taboo can be very unpleasant for the patient .
many people have the experience that death can be dreadful with high-tech medicine .
it can be something as simple as a feeding probe for an old person in a nursing-care home . is n't it also partly a problem that the hospice system and palliative medicine is n't sufficient in germany ? that is a very important factor .
but even if we had such good palliative medicine and hospice provision as there is in scandinavia - where they have provision for 20 percent of people against our 4 percent - then there would still be a very small minority who , if they got certain illnesses , would want to be able to determine the time when they die - and if they ca n't with the help of a doctor .
there are still illnesses that palliative medicine ca n't help , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis . there are certain preconditions that you have to fulfill to be eligible for assisted suicide .
what are they ? you need to have a terminal illness or a serious illness that you ca n't live with anymore , one that handicaps you so strongly that you can no longer lead a dignified life .
in other words , if you 're lovelorn or you 're suffering from an acute depression , then you wo n't be able to ask for assisted suicide . why are you trying to create a legal precedent here in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands is the only country where mercy killing is legal we are looking to set a test case because it is not clear whether a person can be prosecuted if they do not go to the aid of a person who is dying .
there are judgments and a statement from the ministry of justice that confirms that you can do it under certain conditions , if the person has made the decision freely and that the will of the patient should be placed above the duty to preserve life . is it possible to protect this area from abuse ? in other countries , in the united states and , as far as i know , in the uk , things are more advanced .
there are ethical committees that meet and when there is an 86-year-old and he has a serious illness and he is due for a big operation , then they will discuss whether he should be operated on or given palliative medicine .
a lot more is done to spare people from this hyper-medicine .
that should be done more in germany , too .
it should be considered when there are cases where death might be the better solution .
you do n't have to kill them .
you can just leave them .
this can be entrusted in the hands of doctors .
of course , it is open to abuse .
but this argument is not a good one .
every area in life is open to abuse .
abuse can always happen with or without assisted suicide . you referred to ethical committees .
do you want to make assisted suicide into something that the state is involved in and remove it from the private sector ? that is the sense of our campaign that we get a sensible assisted-suicide policy in germany .
it should n't be the case that this only can be carried out in private .
it should be possible in accordance with certain regulations as in switzerland .
in switzerland , a doctor visits a patient after long and thorough preparation .
you ca n't ring me and say , " doctor , will you give me a lethal injection tomorrow . "
that 's out of the question .
this topic is much too serious and much too sensitive for that . the chief accusation that has been leveled at dignitas is that it is trying to profit from people .
and that dignitas demands three times as much money as exit , another swiss-based right-to-die group .
what would you say to that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muscular-dystrophy sufferer piergiorgio welby battled in italy for his respirator to be switched off exit has 50 million members and it carried out a constant number of assisted suicides a year , 35 , 40 or 50 in a year .
they have a certain price .
for long-term members it is free and for those who have just recently joined , they take around 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,950 -rrb- .
i ca n't tell you exactly , but they take a fee and it is lower than dignitas .
from their swiss members dignitas takes 2,000 euros .
only for those coming from abroad , they take more because they have cremation costs , counseling costs that are much higher than for people in switzerland , who can just go to their local doctor .
and then fees have to be paid to the swiss authorities because costs are incurred by the foreigners .
this is n't about making money .
dignitas has a large office and , unlike exit , which works with volunteers , it works consciously with professionals . do you think you will be successful with your demands ? something will happen .
there has been so much media attention .
i think that if we make a test case , then we will see how they react .
only two things can happen .
either people will accept it , as with abortion in germany .
or we will get a reactionary solution and fall back into the middle ages .
but i 'm hopeful .
because of the churches and the medical association , abortion was also completely taboo here for years , and nowadays we can perform abortion here just like in england and other countries . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to dignitate 's deputy director . a few weeks ago , dignitas hit the headlines for helping two germans to die in a car park in switzerland .
the apparently undignified circumstances of their deaths sparked renewed criticism of the controversial organization , which has been accused of treating assisted suicide as a money-making enterprise . while assisted suicide is legal in switzerland , german law is much less clear-cut .
uwe-christian arnold , the deputy director of dignitate , the german branch of dignitas , and himself a doctor , says his group wants to set a legal precedent by carrying out an assisted suicide here in germany . the head of the german doctors ' chamber has called for dignitate to be banned . dw-world.de : why do you think your plan has created such an uproar in germany ? uwe-christian arnold : the reason that certain circles get so worked up about this topic is because it was completely taboo for decades .
it was linked to euthanasia and the nazis .
anyone who concerned themselves with this subject was lumped together with the nazis .
no one differentiated between the fact , for example , that no one asked the people who were killed then whether they wanted to die or not .
someone else decided that they should die .
that is completely different from what we 're planning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill mnd sufferer diane pretty lost her battle to change britain 's laws on assisted suicide the precondition is that the patient wants to die and that they have legitimate reason to want to end their life .
this is quite different from what the nazis did .
doctors tend to be conservative and the german medical association is particularly conservative because it was closely involved with the nazis .
they have not dealt with this past over the last 60 years .
on the occasions they did , it was always very uncomfortable . i do n't want to reproach them for the fact that they want to avoid the topic of assisted suicide , but we have to deal with this topic .
it is a pressing social need . have significant numbers of germans been traveling to switzerland to take up the services of dignitas ? no , the numbers are not very significant .
last year , there were 176 or so assisted suicides in total , 120 of those were germans .
that is a bit of an increase in the numbers of germans , but it roughly corresponds to that of previous years .
and it corresponds to the numbers going to other assisted suicide organizations , in switzerland and in oregon . the number of people who decide to end their lives in this way has remained steady . why is assisted suicide such a pressing social need ? the majority of people - 82 percent of the germans and the same numbers in england , in france , the us and canada - are in favor of legalizing assisted suicide .
in oregon it was made legal , but many other american cities want it .
and i think germany should have it .
it is a big country and the patients have big problems with this topic . is it partly a problem that was created by modern medicine ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under european law , it is up to individual states to decide on right-to-die legislation it is exclusively a problem of medicine - high tech medicine - that for decades has only been concerned with progress and it has notched up fantastic achievements .
but it has completely forgotten that death also stands , lurks , at the end of all these strivings .
making this taboo can be very unpleasant for the patient .
many people have the experience that death can be dreadful with high-tech medicine .
it can be something as simple as a feeding probe for an old person in a nursing-care home . is n't it also partly a problem that the hospice system and palliative medicine is n't sufficient in germany ? that is a very important factor .
but even if we had such good palliative medicine and hospice provision as there is in scandinavia - where they have provision for 20 percent of people against our 4 percent - then there would still be a very small minority who , if they got certain illnesses , would want to be able to determine the time when they die - and if they ca n't with the help of a doctor .
there are still illnesses that palliative medicine ca n't help , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis . there are certain preconditions that you have to fulfill to be eligible for assisted suicide .
what are they ? you need to have a terminal illness or a serious illness that you ca n't live with anymore , one that handicaps you so strongly that you can no longer lead a dignified life .
in other words , if you 're lovelorn or you 're suffering from an acute depression , then you wo n't be able to ask for assisted suicide . why are you trying to create a legal precedent here in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands is the only country where mercy killing is legal we are looking to set a test case because it is not clear whether a person can be prosecuted if they do not go to the aid of a person who is dying .
there are judgments and a statement from the ministry of justice that confirms that you can do it under certain conditions , if the person has made the decision freely and that the will of the patient should be placed above the duty to preserve life . is it possible to protect this area from abuse ? in other countries , in the united states and , as far as i know , in the uk , things are more advanced .
there are ethical committees that meet and when there is an 86-year-old and he has a serious illness and he is due for a big operation , then they will discuss whether he should be operated on or given palliative medicine .
a lot more is done to spare people from this hyper-medicine .
that should be done more in germany , too .
it should be considered when there are cases where death might be the better solution .
you do n't have to kill them .
you can just leave them .
this can be entrusted in the hands of doctors .
of course , it is open to abuse .
but this argument is not a good one .
every area in life is open to abuse .
abuse can always happen with or without assisted suicide . you referred to ethical committees .
do you want to make assisted suicide into something that the state is involved in and remove it from the private sector ? that is the sense of our campaign that we get a sensible assisted-suicide policy in germany .
it should n't be the case that this only can be carried out in private .
it should be possible in accordance with certain regulations as in switzerland .
in switzerland , a doctor visits a patient after long and thorough preparation .
you ca n't ring me and say , " doctor , will you give me a lethal injection tomorrow . "
that 's out of the question .
this topic is much too serious and much too sensitive for that . the chief accusation that has been leveled at dignitas is that it is trying to profit from people .
and that dignitas demands three times as much money as exit , another swiss-based right-to-die group .
what would you say to that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muscular-dystrophy sufferer piergiorgio welby battled in italy for his respirator to be switched off exit has 50 million members and it carried out a constant number of assisted suicides a year , 35 , 40 or 50 in a year .

that 's out of the question .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 23.11.2007 german right-to-die group plans assisted-suicide test case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversy has led to criticism of germany 's low hospice provision the german branch of a swiss right-to-die organization has unleashed a storm of protest by saying it is planning to carry out an assisted suicide in germany .
dw-world.de spoke to dignitate 's deputy director . a few weeks ago , dignitas hit the headlines for helping two germans to die in a car park in switzerland .
the apparently undignified circumstances of their deaths sparked renewed criticism of the controversial organization , which has been accused of treating assisted suicide as a money-making enterprise . while assisted suicide is legal in switzerland , german law is much less clear-cut .
uwe-christian arnold , the deputy director of dignitate , the german branch of dignitas , and himself a doctor , says his group wants to set a legal precedent by carrying out an assisted suicide here in germany . the head of the german doctors ' chamber has called for dignitate to be banned . dw-world.de : why do you think your plan has created such an uproar in germany ? uwe-christian arnold : the reason that certain circles get so worked up about this topic is because it was completely taboo for decades .
it was linked to euthanasia and the nazis .
anyone who concerned themselves with this subject was lumped together with the nazis .
no one differentiated between the fact , for example , that no one asked the people who were killed then whether they wanted to die or not .
someone else decided that they should die .
that is completely different from what we 're planning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill mnd sufferer diane pretty lost her battle to change britain 's laws on assisted suicide the precondition is that the patient wants to die and that they have legitimate reason to want to end their life .
this is quite different from what the nazis did .
doctors tend to be conservative and the german medical association is particularly conservative because it was closely involved with the nazis .
they have not dealt with this past over the last 60 years .
on the occasions they did , it was always very uncomfortable . i do n't want to reproach them for the fact that they want to avoid the topic of assisted suicide , but we have to deal with this topic .
it is a pressing social need . have significant numbers of germans been traveling to switzerland to take up the services of dignitas ? no , the numbers are not very significant .
last year , there were 176 or so assisted suicides in total , 120 of those were germans .
that is a bit of an increase in the numbers of germans , but it roughly corresponds to that of previous years .
and it corresponds to the numbers going to other assisted suicide organizations , in switzerland and in oregon . the number of people who decide to end their lives in this way has remained steady . why is assisted suicide such a pressing social need ? the majority of people - 82 percent of the germans and the same numbers in england , in france , the us and canada - are in favor of legalizing assisted suicide .
in oregon it was made legal , but many other american cities want it .
and i think germany should have it .
it is a big country and the patients have big problems with this topic . is it partly a problem that was created by modern medicine ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under european law , it is up to individual states to decide on right-to-die legislation it is exclusively a problem of medicine - high tech medicine - that for decades has only been concerned with progress and it has notched up fantastic achievements .
but it has completely forgotten that death also stands , lurks , at the end of all these strivings .
making this taboo can be very unpleasant for the patient .
many people have the experience that death can be dreadful with high-tech medicine .
it can be something as simple as a feeding probe for an old person in a nursing-care home . is n't it also partly a problem that the hospice system and palliative medicine is n't sufficient in germany ? that is a very important factor .
but even if we had such good palliative medicine and hospice provision as there is in scandinavia - where they have provision for 20 percent of people against our 4 percent - then there would still be a very small minority who , if they got certain illnesses , would want to be able to determine the time when they die - and if they ca n't with the help of a doctor .
there are still illnesses that palliative medicine ca n't help , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis . there are certain preconditions that you have to fulfill to be eligible for assisted suicide .
what are they ? you need to have a terminal illness or a serious illness that you ca n't live with anymore , one that handicaps you so strongly that you can no longer lead a dignified life .
in other words , if you 're lovelorn or you 're suffering from an acute depression , then you wo n't be able to ask for assisted suicide . why are you trying to create a legal precedent here in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands is the only country where mercy killing is legal we are looking to set a test case because it is not clear whether a person can be prosecuted if they do not go to the aid of a person who is dying .

this comes seven years after danes firmly rejected the european single currency . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen also wants voters to decide whether they are still in favor of opting out of eu policy in three other areas related to joint defense , justice and home affairs .
" the time is approaching , " rasmussen told a news conference .
" it is the government 's view that the people in this parliamentary term should have the opportunity to take a stance on the danish eu opt-outs . "
rasmussen , who is a staunch supporter of the european union , said the exemptions harmed danish interests .
he did not say when the vote might be held .
but it should happen some time within the newly elected center-right government 's four-year mandate period .
government push for more integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danish prime minister is treating his re-election as a mandate to forge more eu integration he also said he wanted the recently agreed eu treaty to be quickly ratified , but did not say if this would require its own referendum .
the danes had scheduled a vote on an earlier proposed eu constitution in september 2005 , but called it off after french and dutch voters rejected the treaty .
only two of the eight parties in the danish parliament , together representing about 17 percent of the vote in last week 's election , are opposed to the eu and further co-operation .
analysts predict that , if denmark were to join the single currency , the practical economic impact would be limited because the danish krone tracks the euro .
" it will change nothing , " said danske bank chief economist steen bocian .
" the danish economy is acting as if it were a full member of the union .
there will be a limited effect on the currency but not much because it 's been extremely stable for a long period . "
polls show eu rising in popularity among danes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen is hoping that the danes will say " yes " this time around danes rejected the euro in 2000 .
the other opt-outs were secured in 1993 after the country initially rejected the maastricht treaty .
recently they seem to have warmed a little to the european bloc .
according to a poll published last month , 51 percent of nearly 1,000 danes surveyed said they were in favor of getting rid of the exemption on the euro , while 40 percent said they were opposed to the move .
the poll also indicated a majority of danes were in favor of lifting the exemptions on joint defense and judiciary cooperation , but that 73 percent wanted to maintain the exemption on european citizenship .
in the nordic region , only finland has joined the 13-member euro zone .
neighboring sweden has , like denmark , maintained its krona currency despite its eu membership , while norway and iceland have rejected even joining the eu . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes seven years after danes firmly rejected the european single currency . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen also wants voters to decide whether they are still in favor of opting out of eu policy in three other areas related to joint defense , justice and home affairs .
" the time is approaching , " rasmussen told a news conference .
" it is the government 's view that the people in this parliamentary term should have the opportunity to take a stance on the danish eu opt-outs . "
rasmussen , who is a staunch supporter of the european union , said the exemptions harmed danish interests .
he did not say when the vote might be held .
but it should happen some time within the newly elected center-right government 's four-year mandate period .
government push for more integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danish prime minister is treating his re-election as a mandate to forge more eu integration he also said he wanted the recently agreed eu treaty to be quickly ratified , but did not say if this would require its own referendum .
the danes had scheduled a vote on an earlier proposed eu constitution in september 2005 , but called it off after french and dutch voters rejected the treaty .
only two of the eight parties in the danish parliament , together representing about 17 percent of the vote in last week 's election , are opposed to the eu and further co-operation .
analysts predict that , if denmark were to join the single currency , the practical economic impact would be limited because the danish krone tracks the euro .
" it will change nothing , " said danske bank chief economist steen bocian .
" the danish economy is acting as if it were a full member of the union .
there will be a limited effect on the currency but not much because it 's been extremely stable for a long period . "
polls show eu rising in popularity among danes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen is hoping that the danes will say " yes " this time around danes rejected the euro in 2000 .
the other opt-outs were secured in 1993 after the country initially rejected the maastricht treaty .
recently they seem to have warmed a little to the european bloc .
according to a poll published last month , 51 percent of nearly 1,000 danes surveyed said they were in favor of getting rid of the exemption on the euro , while 40 percent said they were opposed to the move .
the poll also indicated a majority of danes were in favor of lifting the exemptions on joint defense and judiciary cooperation , but that 73 percent wanted to maintain the exemption on european citizenship .
in the nordic region , only finland has joined the 13-member euro zone .
neighboring sweden has , like denmark , maintained its krona currency despite its eu membership , while norway and iceland have rejected even joining the eu . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

flug said that although the reparation agreement with germany would not be amended , if there were " specific problems " germany would try to solve them .
" we did n't ask for money , we spoke of the responsibility of the german government , " added flug .
complaints that germany 's reparations fail to compensate in any reasonable way for the trauma of the holocaust are ongoing .

after a recent storm of protest by holocaust survivors who accused the government of abandoning them , prime minister ehud olmert announced that for the first time in its history , the israeli government would pay monthly allowances from its own budget to holocaust survivors and refugees .
the state agreed to give israelis who survived nazi ghettos and concentration camps a monthly stipend of nearly $ 300 -lrb- $ 200 -rrb- , in addition to tax discounts and other breaks .
it also approved monthly payments ranging from $ 40 to $ 125 for 80,000 israelis , most from the former soviet union , who became refugees as the nazis conquered europe but never lived under nazi occupation .

she died on tuesday , nov .

her death has prompted calls from politicians for more thorough preemptive controls .

" this would provide a fundamental building block for child protection . "
but wolfram hartmann , president of the pediatricians association , told dpa that gaps between such visits are too long to make them effective .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 23.11.2007 authorities under fire after infant death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many cases slip through the net the death by starvation of a five-year-old in the eastern german town of schwerin has triggered calls from politicians and social workers to introduce compulsory preventative medical check-ups . the parents of lea-sophie were arrested this week on charges of neglect after allegedly failing to adequately feed their daughter for months on end .
she died on tuesday , nov .
20 , after being admitted to a hospital in schwerin , weighing just over seven kilos -lrb- 15 pounds -rrb- - three times less than an average child her age .
her death has prompted calls from politicians for more thorough preemptive controls .
" i am a vehement advocate of making preventative medical check-ups compulsory , " kerstin griese , the social democratic chairwoman of the german parliament 's family affairs committee told the daily berliner zeitung on friday .
" this would provide a fundamental building block for child protection . "
but wolfram hartmann , president of the pediatricians association , told dpa that gaps between such visits are too long to make them effective .
" it would be wrong to think that compulsory health checks could prevent cases of child neglect , " he said .
instead , hartmann argued for greater cooperation between health officials and social workers .
opposition parties agree that the problem is a result of authorities failing to do their job .
" given that cuts have been made in youth-protection offices for years , it should come as no surprise that these cases happen , " said jörn wunderlich from the left party .
effects of cost-cutting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors need to be attuned to signs of possible abuse every time such stories make the headlines in germany , the nation is left wondering how these families can fall through the net .
fingers are invariably pointed at the child-protection services .
when a two-year old died in bremen last year , many blamed the local welfare office which had left the boy in the care of his drug-addicted foster father despite repeated warnings .
the authorities in schwerin have also come in for criticism .
hermann junghans , head of schwerin social services , insists that welfare officers did their job properly but has admitted that the two social workers who visited the family a fortnight ago after an anonymous tip-off had " found nothing amiss . "
neighbors , meanwhile , said the two social workers never actually entered the apartment .
according to newspaper reports , heike seifert , head of schwerin 's youth welfare office , complained to the local council earlier this year that financial cuts were hampering the work of the office .
on friday , schwerin 's mayor , norbert claussen , acknowledged flaws in the welfare system .
lea-sophie 's death " showed that adequate mechanisms are not in place , " he said in a statement .
heike seifert , meanwhile , was quoted in the daily taz as saying that this was by no means the first time that children had been admitted with symptoms of malnutrition to hospitals in schwerin .
the number of child endangerment cases has been increasing in the town , confirmed junghans at a press conference this week .
eighty-six cases were registered in the first six months of 2007 .

" the existing deal is signed and final and there is no need to change it , " said steinbrück after meeting with the chairman of the center of organizations of holocaust survivors in israel , noah flug .
flug said that although the reparation agreement with germany would not be amended , if there were " specific problems " germany would try to solve them .
" we did n't ask for money , we spoke of the responsibility of the german government , " added flug .
complaints that germany 's reparations fail to compensate in any reasonable way for the trauma of the holocaust are ongoing .
but the israeli holocaust survivors who met with steinbrück on thursday , nov .
23 , to request improvements to the reparations arrangement specifically argued that the original agreement failed to take into account today 's longer life expectancy or the tens of thousands of survivors who immigrated to israel after the fall of the soviet union .
according to news agency dpa , steinbrück did agree that germany would try to help needy survivors via the claims committee , the international organization that coordinates compensation payments to survivors .
an unofficial request ?
earlier this month , an israeli paper published comments by israel 's pensioners affairs minister rafael eytan saying israel was keen to reopen the deal , but he later said he was misquoted and only wished to examine with germany ways to support survivors given the ' holes ' in the original agreement .
on thursday , a spokeswomen for the israeli finance ministry confirmed that israel has never officially requested germany revise the reparations deal .
the luxembourg agreement between the two countries stipulated that germany would pay israel reparations , and israel would look after the survivors , who would not be permitted to sue germany directly .
since the 1950s , germany has paid 26 billion euros -lrb- $ 38 billion -rrb- in compensation .
around 1.7 billion of this went to israel , the rest to german claimants .
israel takes responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 240,000 holocaust survivors live in israel others say that israel 's reliance on germany is unreasonable and that the country should look after its elderly holocaust survivors itself .
after a recent storm of protest by holocaust survivors who accused the government of abandoning them , prime minister ehud olmert announced that for the first time in its history , the israeli government would pay monthly allowances from its own budget to holocaust survivors and refugees .
the state agreed to give israelis who survived nazi ghettos and concentration camps a monthly stipend of nearly $ 300 -lrb- $ 200 -rrb- , in addition to tax discounts and other breaks .
it also approved monthly payments ranging from $ 40 to $ 125 for 80,000 israelis , most from the former soviet union , who became refugees as the nazis conquered europe but never lived under nazi occupation .
one-third of pensioners in israel are holocaust survivors .
nearly a third of them live below the poverty line , recent welfare reports have shown . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 23.11.2007 german right-to-die group plans assisted-suicide test case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversy has led to criticism of germany 's low hospice provision the german branch of a swiss right-to-die organization has unleashed a storm of protest by saying it is planning to carry out an assisted suicide in germany .
dw-world.de spoke to dignitate 's deputy director . a few weeks ago , dignitas hit the headlines for helping two germans to die in a car park in switzerland .
the apparently undignified circumstances of their deaths sparked renewed criticism of the controversial organization , which has been accused of treating assisted suicide as a money-making enterprise . while assisted suicide is legal in switzerland , german law is much less clear-cut .
uwe-christian arnold , the deputy director of dignitate , the german branch of dignitas , and himself a doctor , says his group wants to set a legal precedent by carrying out an assisted suicide here in germany . the head of the german doctors ' chamber has called for dignitate to be banned . dw-world.de : why do you think your plan has created such an uproar in germany ? uwe-christian arnold : the reason that certain circles get so worked up about this topic is because it was completely taboo for decades .
it was linked to euthanasia and the nazis .
anyone who concerned themselves with this subject was lumped together with the nazis .
no one differentiated between the fact , for example , that no one asked the people who were killed then whether they wanted to die or not .
someone else decided that they should die .
that is completely different from what we 're planning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill mnd sufferer diane pretty lost her battle to change britain 's laws on assisted suicide the precondition is that the patient wants to die and that they have legitimate reason to want to end their life .
this is quite different from what the nazis did .
doctors tend to be conservative and the german medical association is particularly conservative because it was closely involved with the nazis .
they have not dealt with this past over the last 60 years .
on the occasions they did , it was always very uncomfortable . i do n't want to reproach them for the fact that they want to avoid the topic of assisted suicide , but we have to deal with this topic .
it is a pressing social need . have significant numbers of germans been traveling to switzerland to take up the services of dignitas ? no , the numbers are not very significant .
last year , there were 176 or so assisted suicides in total , 120 of those were germans .
that is a bit of an increase in the numbers of germans , but it roughly corresponds to that of previous years .
and it corresponds to the numbers going to other assisted suicide organizations , in switzerland and in oregon . the number of people who decide to end their lives in this way has remained steady . why is assisted suicide such a pressing social need ? the majority of people - 82 percent of the germans and the same numbers in england , in france , the us and canada - are in favor of legalizing assisted suicide .
in oregon it was made legal , but many other american cities want it .
and i think germany should have it .
it is a big country and the patients have big problems with this topic . is it partly a problem that was created by modern medicine ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under european law , it is up to individual states to decide on right-to-die legislation it is exclusively a problem of medicine - high tech medicine - that for decades has only been concerned with progress and it has notched up fantastic achievements .
but it has completely forgotten that death also stands , lurks , at the end of all these strivings .
making this taboo can be very unpleasant for the patient .
many people have the experience that death can be dreadful with high-tech medicine .
it can be something as simple as a feeding probe for an old person in a nursing-care home . is n't it also partly a problem that the hospice system and palliative medicine is n't sufficient in germany ? that is a very important factor .
but even if we had such good palliative medicine and hospice provision as there is in scandinavia - where they have provision for 20 percent of people against our 4 percent - then there would still be a very small minority who , if they got certain illnesses , would want to be able to determine the time when they die - and if they ca n't with the help of a doctor .
there are still illnesses that palliative medicine ca n't help , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis . there are certain preconditions that you have to fulfill to be eligible for assisted suicide .
what are they ? you need to have a terminal illness or a serious illness that you ca n't live with anymore , one that handicaps you so strongly that you can no longer lead a dignified life .
in other words , if you 're lovelorn or you 're suffering from an acute depression , then you wo n't be able to ask for assisted suicide . why are you trying to create a legal precedent here in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands is the only country where mercy killing is legal we are looking to set a test case because it is not clear whether a person can be prosecuted if they do not go to the aid of a person who is dying .
there are judgments and a statement from the ministry of justice that confirms that you can do it under certain conditions , if the person has made the decision freely and that the will of the patient should be placed above the duty to preserve life . is it possible to protect this area from abuse ? in other countries , in the united states and , as far as i know , in the uk , things are more advanced .
there are ethical committees that meet and when there is an 86-year-old and he has a serious illness and he is due for a big operation , then they will discuss whether he should be operated on or given palliative medicine .
a lot more is done to spare people from this hyper-medicine .
that should be done more in germany , too .
it should be considered when there are cases where death might be the better solution .
you do n't have to kill them .
you can just leave them .
this can be entrusted in the hands of doctors .
of course , it is open to abuse .
but this argument is not a good one .
every area in life is open to abuse .
abuse can always happen with or without assisted suicide . you referred to ethical committees .
do you want to make assisted suicide into something that the state is involved in and remove it from the private sector ? that is the sense of our campaign that we get a sensible assisted-suicide policy in germany .
it should n't be the case that this only can be carried out in private .
it should be possible in accordance with certain regulations as in switzerland .
in switzerland , a doctor visits a patient after long and thorough preparation .
you ca n't ring me and say , " doctor , will you give me a lethal injection tomorrow . "
that 's out of the question .
this topic is much too serious and much too sensitive for that . the chief accusation that has been leveled at dignitas is that it is trying to profit from people .
and that dignitas demands three times as much money as exit , another swiss-based right-to-die group .
what would you say to that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muscular-dystrophy sufferer piergiorgio welby battled in italy for his respirator to be switched off exit has 50 million members and it carried out a constant number of assisted suicides a year , 35 , 40 or 50 in a year .
they have a certain price .
for long-term members it is free and for those who have just recently joined , they take around 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,950 -rrb- .
i ca n't tell you exactly , but they take a fee and it is lower than dignitas .
from their swiss members dignitas takes 2,000 euros .
only for those coming from abroad , they take more because they have cremation costs , counseling costs that are much higher than for people in switzerland , who can just go to their local doctor .
and then fees have to be paid to the swiss authorities because costs are incurred by the foreigners .
this is n't about making money .
dignitas has a large office and , unlike exit , which works with volunteers , it works consciously with professionals . do you think you will be successful with your demands ? something will happen .
there has been so much media attention .
i think that if we make a test case , then we will see how they react .
only two things can happen .
either people will accept it , as with abortion in germany .
or we will get a reactionary solution and fall back into the middle ages .
but i 'm hopeful .
because of the churches and the medical association , abortion was also completely taboo here for years , and nowadays we can perform abortion here just like in england and other countries . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is a pressing social need . have significant numbers of germans been traveling to switzerland to take up the services of dignitas ? no , the numbers are not very significant .
last year , there were 176 or so assisted suicides in total , 120 of those were germans .
that is a bit of an increase in the numbers of germans , but it roughly corresponds to that of previous years .
and it corresponds to the numbers going to other assisted suicide organizations , in switzerland and in oregon . the number of people who decide to end their lives in this way has remained steady . why is assisted suicide such a pressing social need ? the majority of people - 82 percent of the germans and the same numbers in england , in france , the us and canada - are in favor of legalizing assisted suicide .
in oregon it was made legal , but many other american cities want it .
and i think germany should have it .
it is a big country and the patients have big problems with this topic . is it partly a problem that was created by modern medicine ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under european law , it is up to individual states to decide on right-to-die legislation it is exclusively a problem of medicine - high tech medicine - that for decades has only been concerned with progress and it has notched up fantastic achievements .
but it has completely forgotten that death also stands , lurks , at the end of all these strivings .
making this taboo can be very unpleasant for the patient .
many people have the experience that death can be dreadful with high-tech medicine .
it can be something as simple as a feeding probe for an old person in a nursing-care home . is n't it also partly a problem that the hospice system and palliative medicine is n't sufficient in germany ? that is a very important factor .
but even if we had such good palliative medicine and hospice provision as there is in scandinavia - where they have provision for 20 percent of people against our 4 percent - then there would still be a very small minority who , if they got certain illnesses , would want to be able to determine the time when they die - and if they ca n't with the help of a doctor .
there are still illnesses that palliative medicine ca n't help , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis . there are certain preconditions that you have to fulfill to be eligible for assisted suicide .
what are they ? you need to have a terminal illness or a serious illness that you ca n't live with anymore , one that handicaps you so strongly that you can no longer lead a dignified life .
in other words , if you 're lovelorn or you 're suffering from an acute depression , then you wo n't be able to ask for assisted suicide . why are you trying to create a legal precedent here in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands is the only country where mercy killing is legal we are looking to set a test case because it is not clear whether a person can be prosecuted if they do not go to the aid of a person who is dying .
there are judgments and a statement from the ministry of justice that confirms that you can do it under certain conditions , if the person has made the decision freely and that the will of the patient should be placed above the duty to preserve life . is it possible to protect this area from abuse ? in other countries , in the united states and , as far as i know , in the uk , things are more advanced .
there are ethical committees that meet and when there is an 86-year-old and he has a serious illness and he is due for a big operation , then they will discuss whether he should be operated on or given palliative medicine .
a lot more is done to spare people from this hyper-medicine .
that should be done more in germany , too .
it should be considered when there are cases where death might be the better solution .
you do n't have to kill them .
you can just leave them .
this can be entrusted in the hands of doctors .
of course , it is open to abuse .
but this argument is not a good one .
every area in life is open to abuse .
abuse can always happen with or without assisted suicide . you referred to ethical committees .
do you want to make assisted suicide into something that the state is involved in and remove it from the private sector ? that is the sense of our campaign that we get a sensible assisted-suicide policy in germany .
it should n't be the case that this only can be carried out in private .
it should be possible in accordance with certain regulations as in switzerland .
in switzerland , a doctor visits a patient after long and thorough preparation .
you ca n't ring me and say , " doctor , will you give me a lethal injection tomorrow . "
that 's out of the question .
this topic is much too serious and much too sensitive for that . the chief accusation that has been leveled at dignitas is that it is trying to profit from people .
and that dignitas demands three times as much money as exit , another swiss-based right-to-die group .
what would you say to that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muscular-dystrophy sufferer piergiorgio welby battled in italy for his respirator to be switched off exit has 50 million members and it carried out a constant number of assisted suicides a year , 35 , 40 or 50 in a year .
they have a certain price .
for long-term members it is free and for those who have just recently joined , they take around 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,950 -rrb- .
i ca n't tell you exactly , but they take a fee and it is lower than dignitas .
from their swiss members dignitas takes 2,000 euros .
only for those coming from abroad , they take more because they have cremation costs , counseling costs that are much higher than for people in switzerland , who can just go to their local doctor .
and then fees have to be paid to the swiss authorities because costs are incurred by the foreigners .
this is n't about making money .
dignitas has a large office and , unlike exit , which works with volunteers , it works consciously with professionals . do you think you will be successful with your demands ? something will happen .
there has been so much media attention .
i think that if we make a test case , then we will see how they react .
only two things can happen .
either people will accept it , as with abortion in germany .
or we will get a reactionary solution and fall back into the middle ages .
but i 'm hopeful .
because of the churches and the medical association , abortion was also completely taboo here for years , and nowadays we can perform abortion here just like in england and other countries . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to dignitate 's deputy director . a few weeks ago , dignitas hit the headlines for helping two germans to die in a car park in switzerland .
the apparently undignified circumstances of their deaths sparked renewed criticism of the controversial organization , which has been accused of treating assisted suicide as a money-making enterprise . while assisted suicide is legal in switzerland , german law is much less clear-cut .
uwe-christian arnold , the deputy director of dignitate , the german branch of dignitas , and himself a doctor , says his group wants to set a legal precedent by carrying out an assisted suicide here in germany . the head of the german doctors ' chamber has called for dignitate to be banned . dw-world.de : why do you think your plan has created such an uproar in germany ? uwe-christian arnold : the reason that certain circles get so worked up about this topic is because it was completely taboo for decades .
it was linked to euthanasia and the nazis .
anyone who concerned themselves with this subject was lumped together with the nazis .
no one differentiated between the fact , for example , that no one asked the people who were killed then whether they wanted to die or not .
someone else decided that they should die .
that is completely different from what we 're planning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill mnd sufferer diane pretty lost her battle to change britain 's laws on assisted suicide the precondition is that the patient wants to die and that they have legitimate reason to want to end their life .
this is quite different from what the nazis did .
doctors tend to be conservative and the german medical association is particularly conservative because it was closely involved with the nazis .

the kaczynskis and their ultra-conservative allies regard the charter as being too morally liberal .
" in civic platform 's opinion , the charter would be a positive act , but a safe ratification of the treaty is the most important issue , " said tusk in his first address to parliament after his civic platform party won the elections in october .
the new government needs the kaczynskis ' support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his success at the snap elections , tusk still needs the opposition tusk 's center-right coalition with the centrist peasants ' party coalition does not have a two-thirds majority so it is reliant on opposition support to ratify the eu treaty .
the former polish government under jaroslaw kaczynski only agreed to support the treaty on condition that the country could opt-out of the charter .
in particular , the rightist coalition argued that the charter would limit warsaw 's ability to maintain a traditional roman catholic family policy and enable the european court of justice to force poland to grant new rights to homosexuals .
the law and justice party also warned that the charter could spur legal claims by germans who lost property after the polish-german border was redrawn after world war ii .
tusk sets course for the euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new polish pm will have to get along with the polish president until 2010 during the unveiling of his new government 's program , the new prime minister also pledged to pursue a more european-oriented policy than his euroskeptic predecessor and push towards the adoption of the euro as quickly as possible .
he also reiterated his earlier pledges to pull troops out of iraq in 2008 .
" this government will do everything to make sure poland and the poles are quickly ready for the euro , " tusk said .
he also confirmed his cabinet would lower taxes , cut the budget deficit and speed up privatization to keep up economic growth rates while pursuing its euro-zone entry .
tusk , however , did not announce a timeframe for the joining plans .
" we want to nearly balance the budget in a few years , so our road to entry is safe , " he said .
poland 's current deficit is around the target of three percent of gross domestic product . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 23.11.2007 german right-to-die group plans assisted-suicide test case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversy has led to criticism of germany 's low hospice provision the german branch of a swiss right-to-die organization has unleashed a storm of protest by saying it is planning to carry out an assisted suicide in germany .
dw-world.de spoke to dignitate 's deputy director . a few weeks ago , dignitas hit the headlines for helping two germans to die in a car park in switzerland .
the apparently undignified circumstances of their deaths sparked renewed criticism of the controversial organization , which has been accused of treating assisted suicide as a money-making enterprise . while assisted suicide is legal in switzerland , german law is much less clear-cut .
uwe-christian arnold , the deputy director of dignitate , the german branch of dignitas , and himself a doctor , says his group wants to set a legal precedent by carrying out an assisted suicide here in germany . the head of the german doctors ' chamber has called for dignitate to be banned . dw-world.de : why do you think your plan has created such an uproar in germany ? uwe-christian arnold : the reason that certain circles get so worked up about this topic is because it was completely taboo for decades .
it was linked to euthanasia and the nazis .
anyone who concerned themselves with this subject was lumped together with the nazis .
no one differentiated between the fact , for example , that no one asked the people who were killed then whether they wanted to die or not .
someone else decided that they should die .
that is completely different from what we 're planning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill mnd sufferer diane pretty lost her battle to change britain 's laws on assisted suicide the precondition is that the patient wants to die and that they have legitimate reason to want to end their life .
this is quite different from what the nazis did .
doctors tend to be conservative and the german medical association is particularly conservative because it was closely involved with the nazis .
they have not dealt with this past over the last 60 years .
on the occasions they did , it was always very uncomfortable . i do n't want to reproach them for the fact that they want to avoid the topic of assisted suicide , but we have to deal with this topic .
it is a pressing social need . have significant numbers of germans been traveling to switzerland to take up the services of dignitas ? no , the numbers are not very significant .
last year , there were 176 or so assisted suicides in total , 120 of those were germans .
that is a bit of an increase in the numbers of germans , but it roughly corresponds to that of previous years .
and it corresponds to the numbers going to other assisted suicide organizations , in switzerland and in oregon . the number of people who decide to end their lives in this way has remained steady . why is assisted suicide such a pressing social need ? the majority of people - 82 percent of the germans and the same numbers in england , in france , the us and canada - are in favor of legalizing assisted suicide .
in oregon it was made legal , but many other american cities want it .
and i think germany should have it .
it is a big country and the patients have big problems with this topic . is it partly a problem that was created by modern medicine ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under european law , it is up to individual states to decide on right-to-die legislation it is exclusively a problem of medicine - high tech medicine - that for decades has only been concerned with progress and it has notched up fantastic achievements .
but it has completely forgotten that death also stands , lurks , at the end of all these strivings .
making this taboo can be very unpleasant for the patient .
many people have the experience that death can be dreadful with high-tech medicine .
it can be something as simple as a feeding probe for an old person in a nursing-care home . is n't it also partly a problem that the hospice system and palliative medicine is n't sufficient in germany ? that is a very important factor .
but even if we had such good palliative medicine and hospice provision as there is in scandinavia - where they have provision for 20 percent of people against our 4 percent - then there would still be a very small minority who , if they got certain illnesses , would want to be able to determine the time when they die - and if they ca n't with the help of a doctor .
there are still illnesses that palliative medicine ca n't help , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis . there are certain preconditions that you have to fulfill to be eligible for assisted suicide .
what are they ? you need to have a terminal illness or a serious illness that you ca n't live with anymore , one that handicaps you so strongly that you can no longer lead a dignified life .
in other words , if you 're lovelorn or you 're suffering from an acute depression , then you wo n't be able to ask for assisted suicide . why are you trying to create a legal precedent here in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands is the only country where mercy killing is legal we are looking to set a test case because it is not clear whether a person can be prosecuted if they do not go to the aid of a person who is dying .
there are judgments and a statement from the ministry of justice that confirms that you can do it under certain conditions , if the person has made the decision freely and that the will of the patient should be placed above the duty to preserve life . is it possible to protect this area from abuse ? in other countries , in the united states and , as far as i know , in the uk , things are more advanced .
there are ethical committees that meet and when there is an 86-year-old and he has a serious illness and he is due for a big operation , then they will discuss whether he should be operated on or given palliative medicine .
a lot more is done to spare people from this hyper-medicine .
that should be done more in germany , too .
it should be considered when there are cases where death might be the better solution .
you do n't have to kill them .
you can just leave them .
this can be entrusted in the hands of doctors .
of course , it is open to abuse .
but this argument is not a good one .
every area in life is open to abuse .
abuse can always happen with or without assisted suicide . you referred to ethical committees .
do you want to make assisted suicide into something that the state is involved in and remove it from the private sector ? that is the sense of our campaign that we get a sensible assisted-suicide policy in germany .
it should n't be the case that this only can be carried out in private .
it should be possible in accordance with certain regulations as in switzerland .
in switzerland , a doctor visits a patient after long and thorough preparation .
you ca n't ring me and say , " doctor , will you give me a lethal injection tomorrow . "
that 's out of the question .
this topic is much too serious and much too sensitive for that . the chief accusation that has been leveled at dignitas is that it is trying to profit from people .
and that dignitas demands three times as much money as exit , another swiss-based right-to-die group .
what would you say to that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muscular-dystrophy sufferer piergiorgio welby battled in italy for his respirator to be switched off exit has 50 million members and it carried out a constant number of assisted suicides a year , 35 , 40 or 50 in a year .
they have a certain price .
for long-term members it is free and for those who have just recently joined , they take around 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,950 -rrb- .
i ca n't tell you exactly , but they take a fee and it is lower than dignitas .
from their swiss members dignitas takes 2,000 euros .
only for those coming from abroad , they take more because they have cremation costs , counseling costs that are much higher than for people in switzerland , who can just go to their local doctor .
and then fees have to be paid to the swiss authorities because costs are incurred by the foreigners .
this is n't about making money .
dignitas has a large office and , unlike exit , which works with volunteers , it works consciously with professionals . do you think you will be successful with your demands ? something will happen .
there has been so much media attention .
i think that if we make a test case , then we will see how they react .
only two things can happen .
either people will accept it , as with abortion in germany .
or we will get a reactionary solution and fall back into the middle ages .
but i 'm hopeful .
because of the churches and the medical association , abortion was also completely taboo here for years , and nowadays we can perform abortion here just like in england and other countries . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes seven years after danes firmly rejected the european single currency . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen also wants voters to decide whether they are still in favor of opting out of eu policy in three other areas related to joint defense , justice and home affairs .
" the time is approaching , " rasmussen told a news conference .
" it is the government 's view that the people in this parliamentary term should have the opportunity to take a stance on the danish eu opt-outs . "
rasmussen , who is a staunch supporter of the european union , said the exemptions harmed danish interests .
he did not say when the vote might be held .
but it should happen some time within the newly elected center-right government 's four-year mandate period .
government push for more integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danish prime minister is treating his re-election as a mandate to forge more eu integration he also said he wanted the recently agreed eu treaty to be quickly ratified , but did not say if this would require its own referendum .
the danes had scheduled a vote on an earlier proposed eu constitution in september 2005 , but called it off after french and dutch voters rejected the treaty .
only two of the eight parties in the danish parliament , together representing about 17 percent of the vote in last week 's election , are opposed to the eu and further co-operation .
analysts predict that , if denmark were to join the single currency , the practical economic impact would be limited because the danish krone tracks the euro .
" it will change nothing , " said danske bank chief economist steen bocian .
" the danish economy is acting as if it were a full member of the union .
there will be a limited effect on the currency but not much because it 's been extremely stable for a long period . "
polls show eu rising in popularity among danes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen is hoping that the danes will say " yes " this time around danes rejected the euro in 2000 .
the other opt-outs were secured in 1993 after the country initially rejected the maastricht treaty .
recently they seem to have warmed a little to the european bloc .
according to a poll published last month , 51 percent of nearly 1,000 danes surveyed said they were in favor of getting rid of the exemption on the euro , while 40 percent said they were opposed to the move .
the poll also indicated a majority of danes were in favor of lifting the exemptions on joint defense and judiciary cooperation , but that 73 percent wanted to maintain the exemption on european citizenship .

this comes seven years after danes firmly rejected the european single currency . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen also wants voters to decide whether they are still in favor of opting out of eu policy in three other areas related to joint defense , justice and home affairs .
" the time is approaching , " rasmussen told a news conference .
" it is the government 's view that the people in this parliamentary term should have the opportunity to take a stance on the danish eu opt-outs . "
rasmussen , who is a staunch supporter of the european union , said the exemptions harmed danish interests .
he did not say when the vote might be held .
but it should happen some time within the newly elected center-right government 's four-year mandate period .
government push for more integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danish prime minister is treating his re-election as a mandate to forge more eu integration he also said he wanted the recently agreed eu treaty to be quickly ratified , but did not say if this would require its own referendum .
the danes had scheduled a vote on an earlier proposed eu constitution in september 2005 , but called it off after french and dutch voters rejected the treaty .
only two of the eight parties in the danish parliament , together representing about 17 percent of the vote in last week 's election , are opposed to the eu and further co-operation .
analysts predict that , if denmark were to join the single currency , the practical economic impact would be limited because the danish krone tracks the euro .
" it will change nothing , " said danske bank chief economist steen bocian .
" the danish economy is acting as if it were a full member of the union .
there will be a limited effect on the currency but not much because it 's been extremely stable for a long period . "
polls show eu rising in popularity among danes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen is hoping that the danes will say " yes " this time around danes rejected the euro in 2000 .
the other opt-outs were secured in 1993 after the country initially rejected the maastricht treaty .
recently they seem to have warmed a little to the european bloc .
according to a poll published last month , 51 percent of nearly 1,000 danes surveyed said they were in favor of getting rid of the exemption on the euro , while 40 percent said they were opposed to the move .
the poll also indicated a majority of danes were in favor of lifting the exemptions on joint defense and judiciary cooperation , but that 73 percent wanted to maintain the exemption on european citizenship .
in the nordic region , only finland has joined the 13-member euro zone .
neighboring sweden has , like denmark , maintained its krona currency despite its eu membership , while norway and iceland have rejected even joining the eu . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

flug said that although the reparation agreement with germany would not be amended , if there were " specific problems " germany would try to solve them .
" we did n't ask for money , we spoke of the responsibility of the german government , " added flug .
complaints that germany 's reparations fail to compensate in any reasonable way for the trauma of the holocaust are ongoing .
but the israeli holocaust survivors who met with steinbrück on thursday , nov .
23 , to request improvements to the reparations arrangement specifically argued that the original agreement failed to take into account today 's longer life expectancy or the tens of thousands of survivors who immigrated to israel after the fall of the soviet union .

on thursday , a spokeswomen for the israeli finance ministry confirmed that israel has never officially requested germany revise the reparations deal .
the luxembourg agreement between the two countries stipulated that germany would pay israel reparations , and israel would look after the survivors , who would not be permitted to sue germany directly .

" the existing deal is signed and final and there is no need to change it , " said steinbrück after meeting with the chairman of the center of organizations of holocaust survivors in israel , noah flug .
flug said that although the reparation agreement with germany would not be amended , if there were " specific problems " germany would try to solve them .
" we did n't ask for money , we spoke of the responsibility of the german government , " added flug .
complaints that germany 's reparations fail to compensate in any reasonable way for the trauma of the holocaust are ongoing .
but the israeli holocaust survivors who met with steinbrück on thursday , nov .
23 , to request improvements to the reparations arrangement specifically argued that the original agreement failed to take into account today 's longer life expectancy or the tens of thousands of survivors who immigrated to israel after the fall of the soviet union .
according to news agency dpa , steinbrück did agree that germany would try to help needy survivors via the claims committee , the international organization that coordinates compensation payments to survivors .
an unofficial request ?
earlier this month , an israeli paper published comments by israel 's pensioners affairs minister rafael eytan saying israel was keen to reopen the deal , but he later said he was misquoted and only wished to examine with germany ways to support survivors given the ' holes ' in the original agreement .
on thursday , a spokeswomen for the israeli finance ministry confirmed that israel has never officially requested germany revise the reparations deal .
the luxembourg agreement between the two countries stipulated that germany would pay israel reparations , and israel would look after the survivors , who would not be permitted to sue germany directly .
since the 1950s , germany has paid 26 billion euros -lrb- $ 38 billion -rrb- in compensation .
around 1.7 billion of this went to israel , the rest to german claimants .
israel takes responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 240,000 holocaust survivors live in israel others say that israel 's reliance on germany is unreasonable and that the country should look after its elderly holocaust survivors itself .
after a recent storm of protest by holocaust survivors who accused the government of abandoning them , prime minister ehud olmert announced that for the first time in its history , the israeli government would pay monthly allowances from its own budget to holocaust survivors and refugees .
the state agreed to give israelis who survived nazi ghettos and concentration camps a monthly stipend of nearly $ 300 -lrb- $ 200 -rrb- , in addition to tax discounts and other breaks .
it also approved monthly payments ranging from $ 40 to $ 125 for 80,000 israelis , most from the former soviet union , who became refugees as the nazis conquered europe but never lived under nazi occupation .
one-third of pensioners in israel are holocaust survivors .
nearly a third of them live below the poverty line , recent welfare reports have shown . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

passport controls are being scrapped under the schengen system . under the plans , around 1,850 officers will be withdrawn from the area when germany 's borders with poland and the czech republic are completely opened on dec .
21 .
on that day , six other former communist countries in eastern europe as well as malta will also join the european union 's schengen system , which does away with passport controls at the borders of participating states .
many germans in the border region have expressed fears that opening the borders could lead to an influx of petty criminals , such as shoplifters , burglars and car thieves .

the head of the police union gdp , konrad freiberg , said in a radio interview that the opening of the border was " premature " in terms of security .
he said important communication systems were not yet in place .
schäuble rejected the claims .
" on the contrary , switching from stationary border controls to mobile border surveillance will lead to a growth in freedom and an increase in security , " he said after meeting his counterpart grzegorz schetyna in the baltic resort of heringsdorf .
schäuble stressed that the worries of the population were being taken seriously and that the move had been prepared carefully in partnership with germany 's eastern neighbors .
he said joint patrols would be intensified on both sides of the border .
a german-polish center is planned in the polish town of swiecko for customs and security officials .
police unprepared ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much closer cooperation is envisaged between germany and its eastern neighbors gdp head freiberg also said the eastern european states did not have the same security standards as germany and had problems with corruption , equipment and police cooperation .
in contrast , the head of german police union dpoig , rainer wendt , criticized the state of the german force 's equipment .
he said there were no computers in german patrol cars and no digital radios to facilitate carrying out mobile checks , and no real deployment strategy .

passport control at airports are to remain in place until the end of march 2008 .
named after a small village in luxembourg where it was signed in 1985 , the schengen agreement abolishes internal border controls among participating states .

she died on tuesday , nov .
20 , after being admitted to a hospital in schwerin , weighing just over seven kilos -lrb- 15 pounds -rrb- - three times less than an average child her age .
her death has prompted calls from politicians for more thorough preemptive controls .
" i am a vehement advocate of making preventative medical check-ups compulsory , " kerstin griese , the social democratic chairwoman of the german parliament 's family affairs committee told the daily berliner zeitung on friday .
" this would provide a fundamental building block for child protection . "
but wolfram hartmann , president of the pediatricians association , told dpa that gaps between such visits are too long to make them effective .
" it would be wrong to think that compulsory health checks could prevent cases of child neglect , " he said .
instead , hartmann argued for greater cooperation between health officials and social workers .
opposition parties agree that the problem is a result of authorities failing to do their job .
" given that cuts have been made in youth-protection offices for years , it should come as no surprise that these cases happen , " said jörn wunderlich from the left party .
effects of cost-cutting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors need to be attuned to signs of possible abuse every time such stories make the headlines in germany , the nation is left wondering how these families can fall through the net .
fingers are invariably pointed at the child-protection services .
when a two-year old died in bremen last year , many blamed the local welfare office which had left the boy in the care of his drug-addicted foster father despite repeated warnings .
the authorities in schwerin have also come in for criticism .
hermann junghans , head of schwerin social services , insists that welfare officers did their job properly but has admitted that the two social workers who visited the family a fortnight ago after an anonymous tip-off had " found nothing amiss . "
neighbors , meanwhile , said the two social workers never actually entered the apartment .
according to newspaper reports , heike seifert , head of schwerin 's youth welfare office , complained to the local council earlier this year that financial cuts were hampering the work of the office .
on friday , schwerin 's mayor , norbert claussen , acknowledged flaws in the welfare system .
lea-sophie 's death " showed that adequate mechanisms are not in place , " he said in a statement .
heike seifert , meanwhile , was quoted in the daily taz as saying that this was by no means the first time that children had been admitted with symptoms of malnutrition to hospitals in schwerin .
the number of child endangerment cases has been increasing in the town , confirmed junghans at a press conference this week .

she died on tuesday , nov .
20 , after being admitted to a hospital in schwerin , weighing just over seven kilos -lrb- 15 pounds -rrb- - three times less than an average child her age .
her death has prompted calls from politicians for more thorough preemptive controls .
" i am a vehement advocate of making preventative medical check-ups compulsory , " kerstin griese , the social democratic chairwoman of the german parliament 's family affairs committee told the daily berliner zeitung on friday .
" this would provide a fundamental building block for child protection . "
but wolfram hartmann , president of the pediatricians association , told dpa that gaps between such visits are too long to make them effective .
" it would be wrong to think that compulsory health checks could prevent cases of child neglect , " he said .
instead , hartmann argued for greater cooperation between health officials and social workers .
opposition parties agree that the problem is a result of authorities failing to do their job .
" given that cuts have been made in youth-protection offices for years , it should come as no surprise that these cases happen , " said jörn wunderlich from the left party .
effects of cost-cutting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors need to be attuned to signs of possible abuse every time such stories make the headlines in germany , the nation is left wondering how these families can fall through the net .
fingers are invariably pointed at the child-protection services .
when a two-year old died in bremen last year , many blamed the local welfare office which had left the boy in the care of his drug-addicted foster father despite repeated warnings .
the authorities in schwerin have also come in for criticism .
hermann junghans , head of schwerin social services , insists that welfare officers did their job properly but has admitted that the two social workers who visited the family a fortnight ago after an anonymous tip-off had " found nothing amiss . "
neighbors , meanwhile , said the two social workers never actually entered the apartment .
according to newspaper reports , heike seifert , head of schwerin 's youth welfare office , complained to the local council earlier this year that financial cuts were hampering the work of the office .
on friday , schwerin 's mayor , norbert claussen , acknowledged flaws in the welfare system .
lea-sophie 's death " showed that adequate mechanisms are not in place , " he said in a statement .
heike seifert , meanwhile , was quoted in the daily taz as saying that this was by no means the first time that children had been admitted with symptoms of malnutrition to hospitals in schwerin .
the number of child endangerment cases has been increasing in the town , confirmed junghans at a press conference this week .
eighty-six cases were registered in the first six months of 2007 .
in 2006 , the figure was 133 , compared to just 42 in 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that is coming , but it will take a while - 10 or 20 years . some of the more exiting technologies that are a lot more visionary would be things like nano-technology , where we are inventing new kinds of materials that are going to give rise to new kinds of products , to new kind of medical cures .
those things are really going to be very important in the future . what drives you ? for me it is really my daughter and thinking about the future of the world from her perspective : what kind of planet are we building , what kind of planet are we going to leave to the next generation and what are the things that we can do today that are productive and useful and will lay down a framework , so that the next generation coming along can inherit a good planet , prosperity , health , fairness and justice and all those things .

there is an increased importance of education as technology is constantly changing .
it is really important for lots of different people to have more education than they did in the past .
if you think about computer science , the field is changing so rapidly that your college degree may be valuable in the sense of providing some real background knowledge .
but in day-to-day work it is a constant process of educating yourself on techniques and new software , new programming languages .
i think that kind of change is going to happen in more and more fields .
it will require people to learn lots of new things all the time . what kind of invention would you like to see by 2030 ? a lot of what i am frustrated with in terms of technology right now has to do with technology that has already been invented , but that just does not work as well as it should .

fate is driven by the belief that young people are able to directly address the high rates of unemployment and poverty in their country .
the goal is to foster the establishment and growth of more than 5,000 businesses by 2015 , which are expected to generate employment for at least 50,000 nigerians . dw-tv : what would you like the world in 2030 to be like ? osayi oruene : i would want opportunity for growth in terms of work and businesses .
i am talking about the kind of opportunities that people do not have right now .
we have strong businesses in nigeria .
they have very strong , good ideas , good businesses , but there is no avenue for them to be able to show it to the next person in the next community . what invention would you like to see in 2030 ? if i could just sleep tonight and wake up in nigeria tomorrow morning without getting on the plane , that would be perfect .
i do not like flying and i hate jet lag . what 's driving you ? i am very passionate , first of all , about nigeria .
i always loved my country , loved the people .
we have so many resources : people , capital , things that i believe can change the country and take it to the right direction .
i also believe that there can be change .
if i can just see one person walk into my office and leave my office smiling , that is enough for me .
because i can believe that this is tomorrow .
and there is a better tomorrow for nigeria , for other africans , for the world .
i think that is what pushes me . interview : michael wetzel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dhar also sits on the executive board of the " connect the world " initiative of the international telecommunications union of the united nations . dw-tv : what will have changed in terms of education in 2030 ? the global economies will be moving more towards services and away from farming and manufacturing .
however , these service jobs will be more specialised , they will have a higher technology component , because technology is touching everything .
then there is another trend : more and more companies are going to become global - not just in terms of their supply-chain , but also in their markets . how does that effect education ?
i think that there is a higher need of private-public collaboration - a higher participation of private enterprises in education processes and education systems .
i am not saying that private people , private companies should be running the education .
but i think they should be participating a lot more .
in an industry like mine , it is clear that we have a stake in the education process of india and many other countries that we are operating in .
so companies like ours could be easy starting-points of private enterprise participation in the education process . the changes also have some effect on the education that we have to do for seniors in our work force .
if you look at the developed world today , in many parts of the world today , the work-force age is going up .
and things are changing so fast .
so there is a whole need for re-education of the older work force to take the new jobs that are emerging . what invention would you like to see become reality by 2030 ? it would be great if a 12-year-old pupil in school would get exposed to at least two different countries he has never been to .
he would actually learn the culture , actually learn a certain business process that exists in that country which is quite different from the way it is in his home country .
a very simple example could be banking .
banking looks the same everywhere , but it is not .
it is very important for kids to appreciate that and to be aware that there are other worlds , which might look very different .
they should know that there are people in this world who are very different , yet they are perfectly all right . what is driving you ? as a part of my job , i travel a lot across the world .
whenever i get a chance to go out , i see a lot of similarity in simple things like social interaction .
and i yet see very different approaches in different countries .
now , it is one thing to not be aware of the problems at all .
you stay in one place and you are not aware of what is going on in the world .
and therefore you are not doing much about it .
it is quite another thing to actually travel and see what is going on , see the problems and see the solutions which exist in different parts of the world and not do anything about it .
i just feel that it is impossible for me to ignore the calling of connecting people in different parts of the world , who are trying to solve the same problem in different ways .
that is really what drives me . interview : michael wetzel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he resigned in march 2007 to focus on his interests in alternative energy and climate change .
in october 2007 , the 39-year-old founded project better place , a company that 's working on a green transportation infrastructure based on electric cars as an alternative to fossil fuel technology . dw-tv : what will things be like in 2030 ? shai agassi : my belief is that you will not see cars going on oil .
we take oil out of the ground and look how hard it is to find oil today .
there are now oil-rigs that go 12,000 feet -lrb- 3,650 meters -rrb- into water and then another 6,000 feet into the ground - to find oil .
it is a technological marvel .
but why would you do this ?
if we can find cheaper , easier ways to drive our cars , to energize our cars we are probably going to do that . i think you are also going to have a different experience with water : we do not think about it today .
but there is a growing population of people that do not have drinking water .
yet in most of the western world , we use water to flush our sewage .
why would you take clean water and use it for sewage .
it makes absolutely no sense .
there was an economy of abundance and we are going to shift into an economy of constraints .
and when you shift into the economy of constraints , you have to come in with technological improvements to change the way we do things . we are going to need energy , we are going to need water and we are going to need food .
those three fundamentals will get a lot more attention , for example , than medicine today .
we will run out of clean water , we 've already run out of easy energy .
and we will run out of food . what is your favourite technological , futuristic gimmick ? i would say that energy is probably the biggest problem that we are facing today .
if we do not solve the energy crisis , the lack of energy , all the other good things will not happen .
we are going to get wars .
the biggest wars in the world were either started or ended as result of energy issues .
if i look at the fundamental things that are happening right now , they are all geared towards creating materials or engineering materials that will solve energy problems .
and i think that is the most exiting part of the world right now in technology . what is driving you personally to shape the future ? i think two things .
one : you wake up in the morning , you see the eyes of your kids and you have a huge responsibility to the next generation to do something with the power you are given .
all young global leaders have been tremendously lucky .
we have been fortunate to get education at a young age , we have been fortunate to be successful and we have been fortunate to be able to take risk .
some of us have been fortunate to face adversity in a way that has actually made us grow .
what do you do with it ?
if you worry about your personal wealth or personal benefits you are wasting this gift - that you are here .
so what i am mostly worried about is : how do i give back ?
i am getting to 40 , what do you give back in he next 40 years ?
it is a huge responsibility .
if you do not take it as an opportunity to serve and an opportunity to give , you are really wasting god 's gift .
i think that motivates me to wake up in the morning and go to try to solve the biggest problem that i can solve in a successful way . interview : michael wetzel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he resigned in march 2007 to focus on his interests in alternative energy and climate change .
in october 2007 , the 39-year-old founded project better place , a company that 's working on a green transportation infrastructure based on electric cars as an alternative to fossil fuel technology . dw-tv : what will things be like in 2030 ? shai agassi : my belief is that you will not see cars going on oil .
we take oil out of the ground and look how hard it is to find oil today .
there are now oil-rigs that go 12,000 feet -lrb- 3,650 meters -rrb- into water and then another 6,000 feet into the ground - to find oil .
it is a technological marvel .
but why would you do this ?
if we can find cheaper , easier ways to drive our cars , to energize our cars we are probably going to do that . i think you are also going to have a different experience with water : we do not think about it today .
but there is a growing population of people that do not have drinking water .
yet in most of the western world , we use water to flush our sewage .
why would you take clean water and use it for sewage .
it makes absolutely no sense .
there was an economy of abundance and we are going to shift into an economy of constraints .
and when you shift into the economy of constraints , you have to come in with technological improvements to change the way we do things . we are going to need energy , we are going to need water and we are going to need food .
those three fundamentals will get a lot more attention , for example , than medicine today .
we will run out of clean water , we 've already run out of easy energy .
and we will run out of food . what is your favourite technological , futuristic gimmick ? i would say that energy is probably the biggest problem that we are facing today .
if we do not solve the energy crisis , the lack of energy , all the other good things will not happen .
we are going to get wars .
the biggest wars in the world were either started or ended as result of energy issues .
if i look at the fundamental things that are happening right now , they are all geared towards creating materials or engineering materials that will solve energy problems .
and i think that is the most exiting part of the world right now in technology . what is driving you personally to shape the future ? i think two things .
one : you wake up in the morning , you see the eyes of your kids and you have a huge responsibility to the next generation to do something with the power you are given .
all young global leaders have been tremendously lucky .
we have been fortunate to get education at a young age , we have been fortunate to be successful and we have been fortunate to be able to take risk .
some of us have been fortunate to face adversity in a way that has actually made us grow .
what do you do with it ?
if you worry about your personal wealth or personal benefits you are wasting this gift - that you are here .
so what i am mostly worried about is : how do i give back ?
i am getting to 40 , what do you give back in he next 40 years ?
it is a huge responsibility .
if you do not take it as an opportunity to serve and an opportunity to give , you are really wasting god 's gift .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 23.11.2007 german right-to-die group plans assisted-suicide test case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversy has led to criticism of germany 's low hospice provision the german branch of a swiss right-to-die organization has unleashed a storm of protest by saying it is planning to carry out an assisted suicide in germany .
dw-world.de spoke to dignitate 's deputy director . a few weeks ago , dignitas hit the headlines for helping two germans to die in a car park in switzerland .
the apparently undignified circumstances of their deaths sparked renewed criticism of the controversial organization , which has been accused of treating assisted suicide as a money-making enterprise . while assisted suicide is legal in switzerland , german law is much less clear-cut .
uwe-christian arnold , the deputy director of dignitate , the german branch of dignitas , and himself a doctor , says his group wants to set a legal precedent by carrying out an assisted suicide here in germany . the head of the german doctors ' chamber has called for dignitate to be banned . dw-world.de : why do you think your plan has created such an uproar in germany ? uwe-christian arnold : the reason that certain circles get so worked up about this topic is because it was completely taboo for decades .
it was linked to euthanasia and the nazis .
anyone who concerned themselves with this subject was lumped together with the nazis .
no one differentiated between the fact , for example , that no one asked the people who were killed then whether they wanted to die or not .
someone else decided that they should die .
that is completely different from what we 're planning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill mnd sufferer diane pretty lost her battle to change britain 's laws on assisted suicide the precondition is that the patient wants to die and that they have legitimate reason to want to end their life .
this is quite different from what the nazis did .
doctors tend to be conservative and the german medical association is particularly conservative because it was closely involved with the nazis .
they have not dealt with this past over the last 60 years .
on the occasions they did , it was always very uncomfortable . i do n't want to reproach them for the fact that they want to avoid the topic of assisted suicide , but we have to deal with this topic .
it is a pressing social need . have significant numbers of germans been traveling to switzerland to take up the services of dignitas ? no , the numbers are not very significant .
last year , there were 176 or so assisted suicides in total , 120 of those were germans .
that is a bit of an increase in the numbers of germans , but it roughly corresponds to that of previous years .
and it corresponds to the numbers going to other assisted suicide organizations , in switzerland and in oregon . the number of people who decide to end their lives in this way has remained steady . why is assisted suicide such a pressing social need ? the majority of people - 82 percent of the germans and the same numbers in england , in france , the us and canada - are in favor of legalizing assisted suicide .
in oregon it was made legal , but many other american cities want it .
and i think germany should have it .
it is a big country and the patients have big problems with this topic . is it partly a problem that was created by modern medicine ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under european law , it is up to individual states to decide on right-to-die legislation it is exclusively a problem of medicine - high tech medicine - that for decades has only been concerned with progress and it has notched up fantastic achievements .
but it has completely forgotten that death also stands , lurks , at the end of all these strivings .
making this taboo can be very unpleasant for the patient .
many people have the experience that death can be dreadful with high-tech medicine .
it can be something as simple as a feeding probe for an old person in a nursing-care home . is n't it also partly a problem that the hospice system and palliative medicine is n't sufficient in germany ? that is a very important factor .
but even if we had such good palliative medicine and hospice provision as there is in scandinavia - where they have provision for 20 percent of people against our 4 percent - then there would still be a very small minority who , if they got certain illnesses , would want to be able to determine the time when they die - and if they ca n't with the help of a doctor .
there are still illnesses that palliative medicine ca n't help , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis . there are certain preconditions that you have to fulfill to be eligible for assisted suicide .
what are they ? you need to have a terminal illness or a serious illness that you ca n't live with anymore , one that handicaps you so strongly that you can no longer lead a dignified life .
in other words , if you 're lovelorn or you 're suffering from an acute depression , then you wo n't be able to ask for assisted suicide . why are you trying to create a legal precedent here in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands is the only country where mercy killing is legal we are looking to set a test case because it is not clear whether a person can be prosecuted if they do not go to the aid of a person who is dying .
there are judgments and a statement from the ministry of justice that confirms that you can do it under certain conditions , if the person has made the decision freely and that the will of the patient should be placed above the duty to preserve life . is it possible to protect this area from abuse ? in other countries , in the united states and , as far as i know , in the uk , things are more advanced .
there are ethical committees that meet and when there is an 86-year-old and he has a serious illness and he is due for a big operation , then they will discuss whether he should be operated on or given palliative medicine .
a lot more is done to spare people from this hyper-medicine .
that should be done more in germany , too .
it should be considered when there are cases where death might be the better solution .
you do n't have to kill them .
you can just leave them .
this can be entrusted in the hands of doctors .
of course , it is open to abuse .
but this argument is not a good one .
every area in life is open to abuse .
abuse can always happen with or without assisted suicide . you referred to ethical committees .
do you want to make assisted suicide into something that the state is involved in and remove it from the private sector ? that is the sense of our campaign that we get a sensible assisted-suicide policy in germany .
it should n't be the case that this only can be carried out in private .
it should be possible in accordance with certain regulations as in switzerland .
in switzerland , a doctor visits a patient after long and thorough preparation .
you ca n't ring me and say , " doctor , will you give me a lethal injection tomorrow . "
that 's out of the question .
this topic is much too serious and much too sensitive for that . the chief accusation that has been leveled at dignitas is that it is trying to profit from people .
and that dignitas demands three times as much money as exit , another swiss-based right-to-die group .
what would you say to that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muscular-dystrophy sufferer piergiorgio welby battled in italy for his respirator to be switched off exit has 50 million members and it carried out a constant number of assisted suicides a year , 35 , 40 or 50 in a year .
they have a certain price .
for long-term members it is free and for those who have just recently joined , they take around 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,950 -rrb- .
i ca n't tell you exactly , but they take a fee and it is lower than dignitas .
from their swiss members dignitas takes 2,000 euros .
only for those coming from abroad , they take more because they have cremation costs , counseling costs that are much higher than for people in switzerland , who can just go to their local doctor .
and then fees have to be paid to the swiss authorities because costs are incurred by the foreigners .
this is n't about making money .
dignitas has a large office and , unlike exit , which works with volunteers , it works consciously with professionals . do you think you will be successful with your demands ? something will happen .
there has been so much media attention .
i think that if we make a test case , then we will see how they react .
only two things can happen .
either people will accept it , as with abortion in germany .
or we will get a reactionary solution and fall back into the middle ages .
but i 'm hopeful .
because of the churches and the medical association , abortion was also completely taboo here for years , and nowadays we can perform abortion here just like in england and other countries . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say security is threatened .
passport controls are being scrapped under the schengen system . under the plans , around 1,850 officers will be withdrawn from the area when germany 's borders with poland and the czech republic are completely opened on dec .
21 .
on that day , six other former communist countries in eastern europe as well as malta will also join the european union 's schengen system , which does away with passport controls at the borders of participating states .
many germans in the border region have expressed fears that opening the borders could lead to an influx of petty criminals , such as shoplifters , burglars and car thieves .
reforms criticized for coming too soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the emphasis will switch to joint mobile police patrols german police carried banners saying : " yes to europe , no to hasty reforms , " on their march on thursday , nov .
22 , from the border to the venue of a meeting attended by interior minister wolfgang schäuble .
the head of the police union gdp , konrad freiberg , said in a radio interview that the opening of the border was " premature " in terms of security .
he said important communication systems were not yet in place .
schäuble rejected the claims .
" on the contrary , switching from stationary border controls to mobile border surveillance will lead to a growth in freedom and an increase in security , " he said after meeting his counterpart grzegorz schetyna in the baltic resort of heringsdorf .
schäuble stressed that the worries of the population were being taken seriously and that the move had been prepared carefully in partnership with germany 's eastern neighbors .
he said joint patrols would be intensified on both sides of the border .
a german-polish center is planned in the polish town of swiecko for customs and security officials .
police unprepared ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much closer cooperation is envisaged between germany and its eastern neighbors gdp head freiberg also said the eastern european states did not have the same security standards as germany and had problems with corruption , equipment and police cooperation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 23.11.2007 authorities under fire after infant death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many cases slip through the net the death by starvation of a five-year-old in the eastern german town of schwerin has triggered calls from politicians and social workers to introduce compulsory preventative medical check-ups . the parents of lea-sophie were arrested this week on charges of neglect after allegedly failing to adequately feed their daughter for months on end .
she died on tuesday , nov .
20 , after being admitted to a hospital in schwerin , weighing just over seven kilos -lrb- 15 pounds -rrb- - three times less than an average child her age .
her death has prompted calls from politicians for more thorough preemptive controls .
" i am a vehement advocate of making preventative medical check-ups compulsory , " kerstin griese , the social democratic chairwoman of the german parliament 's family affairs committee told the daily berliner zeitung on friday .
" this would provide a fundamental building block for child protection . "
but wolfram hartmann , president of the pediatricians association , told dpa that gaps between such visits are too long to make them effective .
" it would be wrong to think that compulsory health checks could prevent cases of child neglect , " he said .
instead , hartmann argued for greater cooperation between health officials and social workers .
opposition parties agree that the problem is a result of authorities failing to do their job .
" given that cuts have been made in youth-protection offices for years , it should come as no surprise that these cases happen , " said jörn wunderlich from the left party .
effects of cost-cutting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors need to be attuned to signs of possible abuse every time such stories make the headlines in germany , the nation is left wondering how these families can fall through the net .
fingers are invariably pointed at the child-protection services .
when a two-year old died in bremen last year , many blamed the local welfare office which had left the boy in the care of his drug-addicted foster father despite repeated warnings .
the authorities in schwerin have also come in for criticism .
hermann junghans , head of schwerin social services , insists that welfare officers did their job properly but has admitted that the two social workers who visited the family a fortnight ago after an anonymous tip-off had " found nothing amiss . "
neighbors , meanwhile , said the two social workers never actually entered the apartment .
according to newspaper reports , heike seifert , head of schwerin 's youth welfare office , complained to the local council earlier this year that financial cuts were hampering the work of the office .
on friday , schwerin 's mayor , norbert claussen , acknowledged flaws in the welfare system .
lea-sophie 's death " showed that adequate mechanisms are not in place , " he said in a statement .
heike seifert , meanwhile , was quoted in the daily taz as saying that this was by no means the first time that children had been admitted with symptoms of malnutrition to hospitals in schwerin .
the number of child endangerment cases has been increasing in the town , confirmed junghans at a press conference this week .
eighty-six cases were registered in the first six months of 2007 .
in 2006 , the figure was 133 , compared to just 42 in 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes seven years after danes firmly rejected the european single currency . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen also wants voters to decide whether they are still in favor of opting out of eu policy in three other areas related to joint defense , justice and home affairs .
" the time is approaching , " rasmussen told a news conference .
" it is the government 's view that the people in this parliamentary term should have the opportunity to take a stance on the danish eu opt-outs . "
rasmussen , who is a staunch supporter of the european union , said the exemptions harmed danish interests .
he did not say when the vote might be held .
but it should happen some time within the newly elected center-right government 's four-year mandate period .
government push for more integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danish prime minister is treating his re-election as a mandate to forge more eu integration he also said he wanted the recently agreed eu treaty to be quickly ratified , but did not say if this would require its own referendum .
the danes had scheduled a vote on an earlier proposed eu constitution in september 2005 , but called it off after french and dutch voters rejected the treaty .
only two of the eight parties in the danish parliament , together representing about 17 percent of the vote in last week 's election , are opposed to the eu and further co-operation .
analysts predict that , if denmark were to join the single currency , the practical economic impact would be limited because the danish krone tracks the euro .
" it will change nothing , " said danske bank chief economist steen bocian .
" the danish economy is acting as if it were a full member of the union .
there will be a limited effect on the currency but not much because it 's been extremely stable for a long period . "
polls show eu rising in popularity among danes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen is hoping that the danes will say " yes " this time around danes rejected the euro in 2000 .
the other opt-outs were secured in 1993 after the country initially rejected the maastricht treaty .
recently they seem to have warmed a little to the european bloc .
according to a poll published last month , 51 percent of nearly 1,000 danes surveyed said they were in favor of getting rid of the exemption on the euro , while 40 percent said they were opposed to the move .
the poll also indicated a majority of danes were in favor of lifting the exemptions on joint defense and judiciary cooperation , but that 73 percent wanted to maintain the exemption on european citizenship .
in the nordic region , only finland has joined the 13-member euro zone .
neighboring sweden has , like denmark , maintained its krona currency despite its eu membership , while norway and iceland have rejected even joining the eu . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes seven years after danes firmly rejected the european single currency . danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen also wants voters to decide whether they are still in favor of opting out of eu policy in three other areas related to joint defense , justice and home affairs .
" the time is approaching , " rasmussen told a news conference .
" it is the government 's view that the people in this parliamentary term should have the opportunity to take a stance on the danish eu opt-outs . "
rasmussen , who is a staunch supporter of the european union , said the exemptions harmed danish interests .
he did not say when the vote might be held .
but it should happen some time within the newly elected center-right government 's four-year mandate period .
government push for more integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the danish prime minister is treating his re-election as a mandate to forge more eu integration he also said he wanted the recently agreed eu treaty to be quickly ratified , but did not say if this would require its own referendum .
the danes had scheduled a vote on an earlier proposed eu constitution in september 2005 , but called it off after french and dutch voters rejected the treaty .
only two of the eight parties in the danish parliament , together representing about 17 percent of the vote in last week 's election , are opposed to the eu and further co-operation .
analysts predict that , if denmark were to join the single currency , the practical economic impact would be limited because the danish krone tracks the euro .
" it will change nothing , " said danske bank chief economist steen bocian .
" the danish economy is acting as if it were a full member of the union .
there will be a limited effect on the currency but not much because it 's been extremely stable for a long period . "

she died on tuesday , nov .
20 , after being admitted to a hospital in schwerin , weighing just over seven kilos -lrb- 15 pounds -rrb- - three times less than an average child her age .
her death has prompted calls from politicians for more thorough preemptive controls .
" i am a vehement advocate of making preventative medical check-ups compulsory , " kerstin griese , the social democratic chairwoman of the german parliament 's family affairs committee told the daily berliner zeitung on friday .
" this would provide a fundamental building block for child protection . "
but wolfram hartmann , president of the pediatricians association , told dpa that gaps between such visits are too long to make them effective .
" it would be wrong to think that compulsory health checks could prevent cases of child neglect , " he said .
instead , hartmann argued for greater cooperation between health officials and social workers .
opposition parties agree that the problem is a result of authorities failing to do their job .

when a two-year old died in bremen last year , many blamed the local welfare office which had left the boy in the care of his drug-addicted foster father despite repeated warnings .
the authorities in schwerin have also come in for criticism .
hermann junghans , head of schwerin social services , insists that welfare officers did their job properly but has admitted that the two social workers who visited the family a fortnight ago after an anonymous tip-off had " found nothing amiss . "
neighbors , meanwhile , said the two social workers never actually entered the apartment .
according to newspaper reports , heike seifert , head of schwerin 's youth welfare office , complained to the local council earlier this year that financial cuts were hampering the work of the office .
on friday , schwerin 's mayor , norbert claussen , acknowledged flaws in the welfare system .
lea-sophie 's death " showed that adequate mechanisms are not in place , " he said in a statement .
heike seifert , meanwhile , was quoted in the daily taz as saying that this was by no means the first time that children had been admitted with symptoms of malnutrition to hospitals in schwerin .
the number of child endangerment cases has been increasing in the town , confirmed junghans at a press conference this week .

flug said that although the reparation agreement with germany would not be amended , if there were " specific problems " germany would try to solve them .
" we did n't ask for money , we spoke of the responsibility of the german government , " added flug .
complaints that germany 's reparations fail to compensate in any reasonable way for the trauma of the holocaust are ongoing .

after a recent storm of protest by holocaust survivors who accused the government of abandoning them , prime minister ehud olmert announced that for the first time in its history , the israeli government would pay monthly allowances from its own budget to holocaust survivors and refugees .
the state agreed to give israelis who survived nazi ghettos and concentration camps a monthly stipend of nearly $ 300 -lrb- $ 200 -rrb- , in addition to tax discounts and other breaks .
it also approved monthly payments ranging from $ 40 to $ 125 for 80,000 israelis , most from the former soviet union , who became refugees as the nazis conquered europe but never lived under nazi occupation .

he resigned in march 2007 to focus on his interests in alternative energy and climate change .
in october 2007 , the 39-year-old founded project better place , a company that 's working on a green transportation infrastructure based on electric cars as an alternative to fossil fuel technology . dw-tv : what will things be like in 2030 ? shai agassi : my belief is that you will not see cars going on oil .
we take oil out of the ground and look how hard it is to find oil today .
there are now oil-rigs that go 12,000 feet -lrb- 3,650 meters -rrb- into water and then another 6,000 feet into the ground - to find oil .
it is a technological marvel .
but why would you do this ?
if we can find cheaper , easier ways to drive our cars , to energize our cars we are probably going to do that . i think you are also going to have a different experience with water : we do not think about it today .
but there is a growing population of people that do not have drinking water .
yet in most of the western world , we use water to flush our sewage .
why would you take clean water and use it for sewage .
it makes absolutely no sense .
there was an economy of abundance and we are going to shift into an economy of constraints .
and when you shift into the economy of constraints , you have to come in with technological improvements to change the way we do things . we are going to need energy , we are going to need water and we are going to need food .
those three fundamentals will get a lot more attention , for example , than medicine today .
we will run out of clean water , we 've already run out of easy energy .
and we will run out of food . what is your favourite technological , futuristic gimmick ? i would say that energy is probably the biggest problem that we are facing today .
if we do not solve the energy crisis , the lack of energy , all the other good things will not happen .
we are going to get wars .
the biggest wars in the world were either started or ended as result of energy issues .
if i look at the fundamental things that are happening right now , they are all geared towards creating materials or engineering materials that will solve energy problems .
and i think that is the most exiting part of the world right now in technology . what is driving you personally to shape the future ? i think two things .
one : you wake up in the morning , you see the eyes of your kids and you have a huge responsibility to the next generation to do something with the power you are given .
all young global leaders have been tremendously lucky .
we have been fortunate to get education at a young age , we have been fortunate to be successful and we have been fortunate to be able to take risk .
some of us have been fortunate to face adversity in a way that has actually made us grow .
what do you do with it ?
if you worry about your personal wealth or personal benefits you are wasting this gift - that you are here .
so what i am mostly worried about is : how do i give back ?
i am getting to 40 , what do you give back in he next 40 years ?
it is a huge responsibility .
if you do not take it as an opportunity to serve and an opportunity to give , you are really wasting god 's gift .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 23.11.2007 no more holocaust reparations , says german finance minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück pays his respects at the yad vashem memorial finance minister peer steinbrück said in jerusalem thursday that germany had no plans to renegotiate a holocaust reparations deal signed with israel in 1952 . " the existing deal is signed and final and there is no need to change it , " said steinbrück after meeting with the chairman of the center of organizations of holocaust survivors in israel , noah flug .
flug said that although the reparation agreement with germany would not be amended , if there were " specific problems " germany would try to solve them .
" we did n't ask for money , we spoke of the responsibility of the german government , " added flug .
complaints that germany 's reparations fail to compensate in any reasonable way for the trauma of the holocaust are ongoing .
but the israeli holocaust survivors who met with steinbrück on thursday , nov .
23 , to request improvements to the reparations arrangement specifically argued that the original agreement failed to take into account today 's longer life expectancy or the tens of thousands of survivors who immigrated to israel after the fall of the soviet union .
according to news agency dpa , steinbrück did agree that germany would try to help needy survivors via the claims committee , the international organization that coordinates compensation payments to survivors .
an unofficial request ?
earlier this month , an israeli paper published comments by israel 's pensioners affairs minister rafael eytan saying israel was keen to reopen the deal , but he later said he was misquoted and only wished to examine with germany ways to support survivors given the ' holes ' in the original agreement .
on thursday , a spokeswomen for the israeli finance ministry confirmed that israel has never officially requested germany revise the reparations deal .
the luxembourg agreement between the two countries stipulated that germany would pay israel reparations , and israel would look after the survivors , who would not be permitted to sue germany directly .
since the 1950s , germany has paid 26 billion euros -lrb- $ 38 billion -rrb- in compensation .
around 1.7 billion of this went to israel , the rest to german claimants .
israel takes responsibility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 240,000 holocaust survivors live in israel others say that israel 's reliance on germany is unreasonable and that the country should look after its elderly holocaust survivors itself .
after a recent storm of protest by holocaust survivors who accused the government of abandoning them , prime minister ehud olmert announced that for the first time in its history , the israeli government would pay monthly allowances from its own budget to holocaust survivors and refugees .
the state agreed to give israelis who survived nazi ghettos and concentration camps a monthly stipend of nearly $ 300 -lrb- $ 200 -rrb- , in addition to tax discounts and other breaks .
it also approved monthly payments ranging from $ 40 to $ 125 for 80,000 israelis , most from the former soviet union , who became refugees as the nazis conquered europe but never lived under nazi occupation .

there is an increased importance of education as technology is constantly changing .

if you think about computer science , the field is changing so rapidly that your college degree may be valuable in the sense of providing some real background knowledge .

23 , that warsaw was sticking by the previous government 's decision not to adopt the eu charter of fundamental rights . before snap elections in october , tusk 's civic platform party -lrb- po -rrb- had pledged to review the policy decision .
but president lech kaczynski , the twin brother of the former prime minister , threatened to vote down the new european treaty in the event of a reversal .
the kaczynskis and their ultra-conservative allies regard the charter as being too morally liberal .
" in civic platform 's opinion , the charter would be a positive act , but a safe ratification of the treaty is the most important issue , " said tusk in his first address to parliament after his civic platform party won the elections in october .
the new government needs the kaczynskis ' support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his success at the snap elections , tusk still needs the opposition tusk 's center-right coalition with the centrist peasants ' party coalition does not have a two-thirds majority so it is reliant on opposition support to ratify the eu treaty .
the former polish government under jaroslaw kaczynski only agreed to support the treaty on condition that the country could opt-out of the charter .
in particular , the rightist coalition argued that the charter would limit warsaw 's ability to maintain a traditional roman catholic family policy and enable the european court of justice to force poland to grant new rights to homosexuals .
the law and justice party also warned that the charter could spur legal claims by germans who lost property after the polish-german border was redrawn after world war ii .
tusk sets course for the euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new polish pm will have to get along with the polish president until 2010 during the unveiling of his new government 's program , the new prime minister also pledged to pursue a more european-oriented policy than his euroskeptic predecessor and push towards the adoption of the euro as quickly as possible .
he also reiterated his earlier pledges to pull troops out of iraq in 2008 .
" this government will do everything to make sure poland and the poles are quickly ready for the euro , " tusk said .
he also confirmed his cabinet would lower taxes , cut the budget deficit and speed up privatization to keep up economic growth rates while pursuing its euro-zone entry .
tusk , however , did not announce a timeframe for the joining plans .
" we want to nearly balance the budget in a few years , so our road to entry is safe , " he said .

23 , that warsaw was sticking by the previous government 's decision not to adopt the eu charter of fundamental rights . before snap elections in october , tusk 's civic platform party -lrb- po -rrb- had pledged to review the policy decision .
but president lech kaczynski , the twin brother of the former prime minister , threatened to vote down the new european treaty in the event of a reversal .
the kaczynskis and their ultra-conservative allies regard the charter as being too morally liberal .
" in civic platform 's opinion , the charter would be a positive act , but a safe ratification of the treaty is the most important issue , " said tusk in his first address to parliament after his civic platform party won the elections in october .
the new government needs the kaczynskis ' support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his success at the snap elections , tusk still needs the opposition tusk 's center-right coalition with the centrist peasants ' party coalition does not have a two-thirds majority so it is reliant on opposition support to ratify the eu treaty .
the former polish government under jaroslaw kaczynski only agreed to support the treaty on condition that the country could opt-out of the charter .
in particular , the rightist coalition argued that the charter would limit warsaw 's ability to maintain a traditional roman catholic family policy and enable the european court of justice to force poland to grant new rights to homosexuals .
the law and justice party also warned that the charter could spur legal claims by germans who lost property after the polish-german border was redrawn after world war ii .
tusk sets course for the euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new polish pm will have to get along with the polish president until 2010 during the unveiling of his new government 's program , the new prime minister also pledged to pursue a more european-oriented policy than his euroskeptic predecessor and push towards the adoption of the euro as quickly as possible .
he also reiterated his earlier pledges to pull troops out of iraq in 2008 .
" this government will do everything to make sure poland and the poles are quickly ready for the euro , " tusk said .
he also confirmed his cabinet would lower taxes , cut the budget deficit and speed up privatization to keep up economic growth rates while pursuing its euro-zone entry .
tusk , however , did not announce a timeframe for the joining plans .
" we want to nearly balance the budget in a few years , so our road to entry is safe , " he said .
poland 's current deficit is around the target of three percent of gross domestic product . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 23.11.2007 german right-to-die group plans assisted-suicide test case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversy has led to criticism of germany 's low hospice provision the german branch of a swiss right-to-die organization has unleashed a storm of protest by saying it is planning to carry out an assisted suicide in germany .
dw-world.de spoke to dignitate 's deputy director . a few weeks ago , dignitas hit the headlines for helping two germans to die in a car park in switzerland .
the apparently undignified circumstances of their deaths sparked renewed criticism of the controversial organization , which has been accused of treating assisted suicide as a money-making enterprise . while assisted suicide is legal in switzerland , german law is much less clear-cut .
uwe-christian arnold , the deputy director of dignitate , the german branch of dignitas , and himself a doctor , says his group wants to set a legal precedent by carrying out an assisted suicide here in germany . the head of the german doctors ' chamber has called for dignitate to be banned . dw-world.de : why do you think your plan has created such an uproar in germany ? uwe-christian arnold : the reason that certain circles get so worked up about this topic is because it was completely taboo for decades .
it was linked to euthanasia and the nazis .
anyone who concerned themselves with this subject was lumped together with the nazis .
no one differentiated between the fact , for example , that no one asked the people who were killed then whether they wanted to die or not .
someone else decided that they should die .
that is completely different from what we 're planning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill mnd sufferer diane pretty lost her battle to change britain 's laws on assisted suicide the precondition is that the patient wants to die and that they have legitimate reason to want to end their life .
this is quite different from what the nazis did .
doctors tend to be conservative and the german medical association is particularly conservative because it was closely involved with the nazis .
they have not dealt with this past over the last 60 years .
on the occasions they did , it was always very uncomfortable . i do n't want to reproach them for the fact that they want to avoid the topic of assisted suicide , but we have to deal with this topic .
it is a pressing social need . have significant numbers of germans been traveling to switzerland to take up the services of dignitas ? no , the numbers are not very significant .
last year , there were 176 or so assisted suicides in total , 120 of those were germans .
that is a bit of an increase in the numbers of germans , but it roughly corresponds to that of previous years .
and it corresponds to the numbers going to other assisted suicide organizations , in switzerland and in oregon . the number of people who decide to end their lives in this way has remained steady . why is assisted suicide such a pressing social need ? the majority of people - 82 percent of the germans and the same numbers in england , in france , the us and canada - are in favor of legalizing assisted suicide .
in oregon it was made legal , but many other american cities want it .
and i think germany should have it .
it is a big country and the patients have big problems with this topic . is it partly a problem that was created by modern medicine ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under european law , it is up to individual states to decide on right-to-die legislation it is exclusively a problem of medicine - high tech medicine - that for decades has only been concerned with progress and it has notched up fantastic achievements .
but it has completely forgotten that death also stands , lurks , at the end of all these strivings .
making this taboo can be very unpleasant for the patient .
many people have the experience that death can be dreadful with high-tech medicine .
it can be something as simple as a feeding probe for an old person in a nursing-care home . is n't it also partly a problem that the hospice system and palliative medicine is n't sufficient in germany ? that is a very important factor .
but even if we had such good palliative medicine and hospice provision as there is in scandinavia - where they have provision for 20 percent of people against our 4 percent - then there would still be a very small minority who , if they got certain illnesses , would want to be able to determine the time when they die - and if they ca n't with the help of a doctor .
there are still illnesses that palliative medicine ca n't help , such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis . there are certain preconditions that you have to fulfill to be eligible for assisted suicide .
what are they ? you need to have a terminal illness or a serious illness that you ca n't live with anymore , one that handicaps you so strongly that you can no longer lead a dignified life .
in other words , if you 're lovelorn or you 're suffering from an acute depression , then you wo n't be able to ask for assisted suicide . why are you trying to create a legal precedent here in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the netherlands is the only country where mercy killing is legal we are looking to set a test case because it is not clear whether a person can be prosecuted if they do not go to the aid of a person who is dying .
there are judgments and a statement from the ministry of justice that confirms that you can do it under certain conditions , if the person has made the decision freely and that the will of the patient should be placed above the duty to preserve life . is it possible to protect this area from abuse ? in other countries , in the united states and , as far as i know , in the uk , things are more advanced .
there are ethical committees that meet and when there is an 86-year-old and he has a serious illness and he is due for a big operation , then they will discuss whether he should be operated on or given palliative medicine .
a lot more is done to spare people from this hyper-medicine .
that should be done more in germany , too .
it should be considered when there are cases where death might be the better solution .
you do n't have to kill them .
you can just leave them .
this can be entrusted in the hands of doctors .
of course , it is open to abuse .
but this argument is not a good one .
every area in life is open to abuse .
abuse can always happen with or without assisted suicide . you referred to ethical committees .
do you want to make assisted suicide into something that the state is involved in and remove it from the private sector ? that is the sense of our campaign that we get a sensible assisted-suicide policy in germany .
it should n't be the case that this only can be carried out in private .
it should be possible in accordance with certain regulations as in switzerland .
in switzerland , a doctor visits a patient after long and thorough preparation .
you ca n't ring me and say , " doctor , will you give me a lethal injection tomorrow . "
that 's out of the question .
this topic is much too serious and much too sensitive for that . the chief accusation that has been leveled at dignitas is that it is trying to profit from people .
and that dignitas demands three times as much money as exit , another swiss-based right-to-die group .
what would you say to that ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muscular-dystrophy sufferer piergiorgio welby battled in italy for his respirator to be switched off exit has 50 million members and it carried out a constant number of assisted suicides a year , 35 , 40 or 50 in a year .
they have a certain price .
for long-term members it is free and for those who have just recently joined , they take around 2,000 euros -lrb- $ 2,950 -rrb- .
i ca n't tell you exactly , but they take a fee and it is lower than dignitas .
from their swiss members dignitas takes 2,000 euros .
only for those coming from abroad , they take more because they have cremation costs , counseling costs that are much higher than for people in switzerland , who can just go to their local doctor .
and then fees have to be paid to the swiss authorities because costs are incurred by the foreigners .
this is n't about making money .
dignitas has a large office and , unlike exit , which works with volunteers , it works consciously with professionals . do you think you will be successful with your demands ? something will happen .
there has been so much media attention .
i think that if we make a test case , then we will see how they react .
only two things can happen .
either people will accept it , as with abortion in germany .
or we will get a reactionary solution and fall back into the middle ages .
but i 'm hopeful .
because of the churches and the medical association , abortion was also completely taboo here for years , and nowadays we can perform abortion here just like in england and other countries . interview : julie gregson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to dignitate 's deputy director . a few weeks ago , dignitas hit the headlines for helping two germans to die in a car park in switzerland .
the apparently undignified circumstances of their deaths sparked renewed criticism of the controversial organization , which has been accused of treating assisted suicide as a money-making enterprise . while assisted suicide is legal in switzerland , german law is much less clear-cut .
uwe-christian arnold , the deputy director of dignitate , the german branch of dignitas , and himself a doctor , says his group wants to set a legal precedent by carrying out an assisted suicide here in germany . the head of the german doctors ' chamber has called for dignitate to be banned . dw-world.de : why do you think your plan has created such an uproar in germany ? uwe-christian arnold : the reason that certain circles get so worked up about this topic is because it was completely taboo for decades .
it was linked to euthanasia and the nazis .
anyone who concerned themselves with this subject was lumped together with the nazis .
no one differentiated between the fact , for example , that no one asked the people who were killed then whether they wanted to die or not .
someone else decided that they should die .
that is completely different from what we 're planning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill mnd sufferer diane pretty lost her battle to change britain 's laws on assisted suicide the precondition is that the patient wants to die and that they have legitimate reason to want to end their life .
this is quite different from what the nazis did .
doctors tend to be conservative and the german medical association is particularly conservative because it was closely involved with the nazis .
they have not dealt with this past over the last 60 years .
on the occasions they did , it was always very uncomfortable . i do n't want to reproach them for the fact that they want to avoid the topic of assisted suicide , but we have to deal with this topic .
it is a pressing social need . have significant numbers of germans been traveling to switzerland to take up the services of dignitas ? no , the numbers are not very significant .

program guide programs made in germany video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home / : made in germany young global leaders -pipe- 23.11.2007 shai agassi : energy is our biggest problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agassi left his job at sap to fight for climate protection born in israel , shai agassi was a member of the executive board of germany-based sap , the world 's largest business software company .
he resigned in march 2007 to focus on his interests in alternative energy and climate change .
in october 2007 , the 39-year-old founded project better place , a company that 's working on a green transportation infrastructure based on electric cars as an alternative to fossil fuel technology . dw-tv : what will things be like in 2030 ? shai agassi : my belief is that you will not see cars going on oil .
we take oil out of the ground and look how hard it is to find oil today .
there are now oil-rigs that go 12,000 feet -lrb- 3,650 meters -rrb- into water and then another 6,000 feet into the ground - to find oil .
it is a technological marvel .
but why would you do this ?
if we can find cheaper , easier ways to drive our cars , to energize our cars we are probably going to do that . i think you are also going to have a different experience with water : we do not think about it today .
but there is a growing population of people that do not have drinking water .
yet in most of the western world , we use water to flush our sewage .
why would you take clean water and use it for sewage .
it makes absolutely no sense .
there was an economy of abundance and we are going to shift into an economy of constraints .
and when you shift into the economy of constraints , you have to come in with technological improvements to change the way we do things . we are going to need energy , we are going to need water and we are going to need food .
those three fundamentals will get a lot more attention , for example , than medicine today .
we will run out of clean water , we 've already run out of easy energy .
and we will run out of food . what is your favourite technological , futuristic gimmick ? i would say that energy is probably the biggest problem that we are facing today .
if we do not solve the energy crisis , the lack of energy , all the other good things will not happen .
we are going to get wars .
the biggest wars in the world were either started or ended as result of energy issues .
if i look at the fundamental things that are happening right now , they are all geared towards creating materials or engineering materials that will solve energy problems .
and i think that is the most exiting part of the world right now in technology . what is driving you personally to shape the future ? i think two things .
one : you wake up in the morning , you see the eyes of your kids and you have a huge responsibility to the next generation to do something with the power you are given .
all young global leaders have been tremendously lucky .
we have been fortunate to get education at a young age , we have been fortunate to be successful and we have been fortunate to be able to take risk .
some of us have been fortunate to face adversity in a way that has actually made us grow .
what do you do with it ?
if you worry about your personal wealth or personal benefits you are wasting this gift - that you are here .
so what i am mostly worried about is : how do i give back ?
i am getting to 40 , what do you give back in he next 40 years ?
it is a huge responsibility .
if you do not take it as an opportunity to serve and an opportunity to give , you are really wasting god 's gift .
i think that motivates me to wake up in the morning and go to try to solve the biggest problem that i can solve in a successful way . interview : michael wetzel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will crawford and peter brewin 's design will go into production at their new plant near pontypridd next summer .
it is made by adding water , pumping it into shape and waiting for it to dry .

" we originally came up with the idea when were entering loads of design competitions to fund our way through college , " said mr crawford .

the shelter is delivered in a bag , which is ripped open and water added .
the material soaks up the moisture , activating the concrete .
but the cloth remains flexible and is inflated by a battery-operated pump .
after 12 hours , the shelter becomes completely solid , and can even withstand being shot at with handguns .
" one of the competitions we entered helped to fund us to go out to uganda for five weeks where we spoke with aid agencies and non-government organisations on the ground , " said mr crawford .
" that really encouraged us to pursue the idea of the shelters . "
the two inventors were so confident in their product they showcased it on the bbc 's dragon 's den , where entrepreneurs bid for funding from real-life millionaires .
" the ' dragons ' actually offered us the money we wanted , which was around £ 85,000 , " said inventor mr crawford .
" but they wanted 40 % of the company for that investment , and that was simply too much for us , so we walked away . "
however , the shelter idea did not go unnoticed and the pair won development funding from the department of trade and industry , and a regional assistance grant from the welsh assembly government .
it has led to them setting up their production base at treforest , near pontypridd , with full-scale production starting in eight months .
the entrepreneurs have already sold a shelter to the us military to be assessed , and they will fly to america in the new year to give a demonstration to the us naval construction force and federal emergency planners .

" the concrete cloth is inspired by the material used to make plaster casts in hospital , but we had to come up with a completely different way of making it work with concrete . "
the " dragons " actually offered us the money we wanted , which was around £ 85,000 will crawford , concrete canvas along with his friend from imperial college london , mr brewin , the two 28-year-olds turned the concrete cloth idea into a way of putting up cheap , long-lasting emergency shelters .
the shelter is delivered in a bag , which is ripped open and water added .
the material soaks up the moisture , activating the concrete .
but the cloth remains flexible and is inflated by a battery-operated pump .
after 12 hours , the shelter becomes completely solid , and can even withstand being shot at with handguns .
" one of the competitions we entered helped to fund us to go out to uganda for five weeks where we spoke with aid agencies and non-government organisations on the ground , " said mr crawford .
" that really encouraged us to pursue the idea of the shelters . "
the two inventors were so confident in their product they showcased it on the bbc 's dragon 's den , where entrepreneurs bid for funding from real-life millionaires .
" the ' dragons ' actually offered us the money we wanted , which was around £ 85,000 , " said inventor mr crawford .
" but they wanted 40 % of the company for that investment , and that was simply too much for us , so we walked away . "
however , the shelter idea did not go unnoticed and the pair won development funding from the department of trade and industry , and a regional assistance grant from the welsh assembly government .
it has led to them setting up their production base at treforest , near pontypridd , with full-scale production starting in eight months .
the entrepreneurs have already sold a shelter to the us military to be assessed , and they will fly to america in the new year to give a demonstration to the us naval construction force and federal emergency planners .

the smoking ban has a greater impact on pubs in winter because smokers are reluctant to go outside .
" although it is still too early to definitively discern the true impact of the smoking ban , we approach the winter with cautious optimism and 90 % of our pubs have a specific provision for smokers , " fuller 's said .
the ban on smoking in enclosed public areas was introduced in england in july 2007 having already started in wales in april and scotland in march 2006 .

in the darjeeling limited , anderson follows the spiritual journey of three estranged brothers across india , still grieving for their dead father and in search of their mother .
anderson , still best known for his oscar-nominated film the royal tenenbaums , concedes it is a topic he finds hard to get away from .
" we made a rule we were n't going to have anything to do with parents with this movie .
" but by the end , we 'd finished the script and it 's about how these guys react to the death of their father and finding their mother , " he says .
' great adventure ' he admits it 's " personal " to him but says he does n't know why , although he is one of three brothers himself and his parents divorced when he was eight .
whatever the reasons , it is clear anderson does not like to work on his own .
he never writes alone and is something of an auteur , getting involved with every aspect of film-making , and is also renowned for working with familiar actors and crew .
wilson 's character francis -lrb- r -rrb- is desperate for the brothers to bond old friends owen wilson - who reportedly attempted suicide earlier this year - and jason schwartzman play two of the brothers , and are joined by a newcomer to anderson 's " set " , oscar-winning actor adrien brody .
did brody find it hard to fit in with the familiar clique ?
" adrien is very accustomed to showing up on a movie set , figuring out the dynamic .
he 's very good at adapting to that , " explains anderson .
the darjeeling limited was written by anderson , schwartzman and another good friend , roman coppola , son of film director francis ford coppola .
it is a process which anderson says he enjoys .
' spare and elliptical ' " i like working with collaborators .
i 've always worked with my closest friends , we had a great adventure writing this one .
we kind of work together like we 're brothers . "
the three travelled to india to write the film , with much of the action shot on a real train .
as with all anderson 's films , the attention to detail is striking , with the camera lingering languidly on the diverse landscape and the often confused faces of its protagonists , all of whom display anderson 's trademark deadpan black humour .
bill murray makes a mysterious appearance but the film leaves many fundamental questions unanswered - namely why their mother -lrb- angelica houston -rrb- leaves for india without a forwarding address after her husband dies .
and what what becomes of jack 's -lrb- schwartzman 's -rrb- former girlfriend , played by natalie portman in a short film titled hotel chevalier , which plays ahead of the main feature ?
anderson explains it was his intention to leave the audience puzzled .
" any time we could avoid explaining something , we just took it out - we wanted the movie to be spare and elliptical and to leave these mysteries open , " he says .
bill murray , a veteran of anderson 's movies , opens the film as he tries in vain to catch a train .
the viewer assumes he must be a leading character but murray is not seen in the film again .
wes anderson 's films bottle rocket -lrb- 1994 -rrb- rushmore -lrb- 1998 -rrb- the royal tenenbaums -lrb- 2001 -rrb- the life aquatic with steve zissou hotel chevalier -lrb- 2007 -rrb- the darjeeling limited -lrb- 2007 -rrb- " people ask me , ' who 's bill murray ? '
i like that people have different interpretations of who he is , " anderson explains .
it may be frustrating for the audience , but does anderson usually feel satisfied with his end product ?
" that 's the difficult thing about making movies , you never really know what you 've got .
and then the first time you show it to an audience , you suddenly learn some things , " he says .
his next project is unchartered territory - his first animation , an adaptation of roald dahl 's fantastic mr fox , but remains unfazed by the challenge .
" most of my job is similar to what it is on any movie .
the animators themselves are almost like actors because they 're trying to take these puppets and make them seem like they 're alive . "
the director says he tries not to become too concerned with reviews of his films .
" it 's hard to learn much from critics because everyone has a different reaction .
you 've just got to do your own thing . "

" but by the end , we 'd finished the script and it 's about how these guys react to the death of their father and finding their mother , " he says .
' great adventure ' he admits it 's " personal " to him but says he does n't know why , although he is one of three brothers himself and his parents divorced when he was eight .
whatever the reasons , it is clear anderson does not like to work on his own .
he never writes alone and is something of an auteur , getting involved with every aspect of film-making , and is also renowned for working with familiar actors and crew .
wilson 's character francis -lrb- r -rrb- is desperate for the brothers to bond old friends owen wilson - who reportedly attempted suicide earlier this year - and jason schwartzman play two of the brothers , and are joined by a newcomer to anderson 's " set " , oscar-winning actor adrien brody .
did brody find it hard to fit in with the familiar clique ?
" adrien is very accustomed to showing up on a movie set , figuring out the dynamic .
he 's very good at adapting to that , " explains anderson .
the darjeeling limited was written by anderson , schwartzman and another good friend , roman coppola , son of film director francis ford coppola .
it is a process which anderson says he enjoys .
' spare and elliptical ' " i like working with collaborators .
i 've always worked with my closest friends , we had a great adventure writing this one .
we kind of work together like we 're brothers . "
the three travelled to india to write the film , with much of the action shot on a real train .
as with all anderson 's films , the attention to detail is striking , with the camera lingering languidly on the diverse landscape and the often confused faces of its protagonists , all of whom display anderson 's trademark deadpan black humour .
bill murray makes a mysterious appearance but the film leaves many fundamental questions unanswered - namely why their mother -lrb- angelica houston -rrb- leaves for india without a forwarding address after her husband dies .
and what what becomes of jack 's -lrb- schwartzman 's -rrb- former girlfriend , played by natalie portman in a short film titled hotel chevalier , which plays ahead of the main feature ?
anderson explains it was his intention to leave the audience puzzled .
" any time we could avoid explaining something , we just took it out - we wanted the movie to be spare and elliptical and to leave these mysteries open , " he says .
bill murray , a veteran of anderson 's movies , opens the film as he tries in vain to catch a train .
the viewer assumes he must be a leading character but murray is not seen in the film again .

old friends owen wilson - who reportedly attempted suicide earlier this year - and jason schwartzman play two of the brothers , and are joined by a newcomer to anderson 's " set " , oscar-winning actor adrien brody .
did brody find it hard to fit in with the familiar clique ?
" adrien is very accustomed to showing up on a movie set , figuring out the dynamic .
he 's very good at adapting to that , " explains anderson .
the darjeeling limited was written by anderson , schwartzman and another good friend , roman coppola , son of film director francis ford coppola .
it is a process which anderson says he enjoys .
' spare and elliptical ' " i like working with collaborators .
i 've always worked with my closest friends , we had a great adventure writing this one .
we kind of work together like we 're brothers . "
the three travelled to india to write the film , with much of the action shot on a real train .
as with all anderson 's films , the attention to detail is striking , with the camera lingering languidly on the diverse landscape and the often confused faces of its protagonists , all of whom display anderson 's trademark deadpan black humour .
but the film leaves many fundamental questions unanswered - namely why their mother -lrb- angelica houston -rrb- leaves for india without a forwarding address after her husband dies .
and what what becomes of jack 's -lrb- schwartzman 's -rrb- former girlfriend , played by natalie portman in a short film titled hotel chevalier , which plays ahead of the main feature ?
anderson explains it was his intention to leave the audience puzzled .
" any time we could avoid explaining something , we just took it out - we wanted the movie to be spare and elliptical and to leave these mysteries open , " he says .
bill murray , a veteran of anderson 's movies , opens the film as he tries in vain to catch a train .
the viewer assumes he must be a leading character but murray is not seen in the film again .
wes anderson 's films bottle rocket -lrb- 1994 -rrb- rushmore -lrb- 1998 -rrb- the royal tenenbaums -lrb- 2001 -rrb- the life aquatic with steve zissou hotel chevalier -lrb- 2007 -rrb- the darjeeling limited -lrb- 2007 -rrb- " people ask me , ' who 's bill murray ? '
i like that people have different interpretations of who he is , " anderson explains .
it may be frustrating for the audience , but does anderson usually feel satisfied with his end product ?
" that 's the difficult thing about making movies , you never really know what you 've got .
and then the first time you show it to an audience , you suddenly learn some things , " he says .
his next project is unchartered territory - his first animation , an adaptation of roald dahl 's fantastic mr fox , but remains unfazed by the challenge .
" most of my job is similar to what it is on any movie .
the animators themselves are almost like actors because they 're trying to take these puppets and make them seem like they 're alive . "
the director says he tries not to become too concerned with reviews of his films .
" it 's hard to learn much from critics because everyone has a different reaction .
you 've just got to do your own thing . "
the darjeeling limited is released in the uk on 23 november .

" tackling drug and alcohol misuse continues to be a priority with the delivery of a new welsh strategy being backed by an extra £ 9.6m over the next three years , " said the spokesman .

he said this was only the second time these statistics have been released in this way .
he said improvements in both data collection methods and the quality of the data meant the figures published this year should not be compared directly to last year 's .

the warning from a national audit office -lrb- nao -rrb- official was sent 16 days before the information went missing .
it is one of a string of e-mails released by ministers as they seek to prove top officials did not sanction the sending of sensitive data .
another e-mail reveals concerns about the cost of removing bank details .
the government has been under fire since it was revealed the two discs went missing after they had been sent by unregistered internal post .
see sequence of events in the lost cds scandal the conservatives say the crisis is down to " systemic " errors at hmrc - but the government insists it was the fault of low level civil servants .
ministers released the e-mail exchanges , from march and october this year , in a bid to prove their case .
one of them was sent by an nao official on 2 october , 16 days before the data went missing .
it said : " please could you ensure that the cds are delivered to nao as safely as possible due to their content . "
the same e-mail also asked the recipient to ring the nao when the cds had been received so that the relevant passwords could be passed on .
another message , dated 13 march from an nao official , with all names blanked out , says : " i do not need the address , bank or parent details in this download - are these removable to make the file smaller ? "
the e-mail is marked : " urgent extract from compliance scan , " its importance is listed as " high " and its sensitivity " confidential " .
cost implications but another e-mail from the same day , from an hmrc official , appears to suggest officials were concerned about the cost implications of stripping sensitive data from the files .
it says : " i must stress we must make use of data we hold and not over burden the business by asking them to run additional data scans / filters that may incur a cost to the department " . "
what about our privacy and our rights ?
no mention is made of them " bbc political editor nick robinson read nick 's blog and those e-mails but the hmrc has stressed that although one of its senior officials was copied in to the e-mail exchanges from 13 march , there is no evidence that he or she made the decision to release the data .
caroline mawhood , the nao 's assistant auditor general at the nao , says in a covering letter to hmrc acting chairman dave hartnett : " the email was sent by a junior hmrc manager .
it refers to a reluctance to provide data in the filtered form the nao had requested .
" we also agreed that our own nao audit director was aware of this position , and that we have no evidence that the process owner for child benefit made the decision to release the data .
the nao is not making any issue of this . "
a national audit office letter also reveals child benefit files were sent to accountancy firm kpmg .
the firm says the files were returned " by hand " to the nao and that any information on its own system has been deleted .
' serious questions ' shadow chancellor george osborne said far from clearing senior officials of blame the e-mails released by the government were evidence of " systemic failure " at the hmrc .
missing data includes national insurance number name , address and birth date partner 's details names , sex and age of children bank / savings account details he said chancellor alistair darling now faced " serious questions about the version of events he gave earlier this week that this was some lone figure sitting by themselves at a computer .
that is not what these e-mails reveal " .
in a separate development , the government is seeking to reassure people that their personal details have not fallen into criminal hands .
in a letter being sent to seven million families , hmrc apologises for losing the data but says it is still " likely to still be on government property " .
it says police are continuing to search for the discs but " there is no evidence that it is in the possession of anyone else " .
the metropolitan police refused to comment on the claim that the discs were probably still on government property .
a met spokesman said they were continuing to search the hmrc 's offices in tyne and wear and the nao offices in london .
data checks on wednesday , prime minister gordon brown apologised for the data loss but said it was down to officials not following the rules rather than " systemic " failures at hmrc caused by budget cuts .
he has ordered security checks on all government departments to ensure data is properly protected .
hmrc is protecting the identity of the official blamed for sending the two discs containing the details of 25m people by courier from the child benefit office in washington , tyne and wear , to the nao in london on 18 october .
the official , who the bbc understands is a 23-year-old man , has reportedly been suspended pending disciplinary action .
two further discs , containing national insurance numbers , but not bank details , are also reported to have gone missing from hmrc 's offices .
her majesty 's revenue and customs has set up a child benefit helpline on 0845 302 1444 for customers who want more details .

by julian joyce bbc news buy nothing day - an annual moratorium on shopping - has made little impression over the years .
but campaigners marking this year 's day of inaction , on saturday , sense the tide is starting to turn .
the mere thought is almost enough to bring maryann poole out in a cold sweat - a day dedicated to not shopping .
the psychology of shopping explained maryann , a freelance journalist from west london , says she " genuinely enjoys " shopping .
" i admire things .
i like looking at the difference between products .
i like going into shops and choosing things .
having a good long talk with the shop assistant - so long as they know their stuff .
" and then getting home and taking whatever it is out of the nice packaging , " it 's " a lot to do with who i am - the whole process gives me real pleasure " .
maryann is a retailer 's dream .
but she is also the worst nightmare of the buy nothing day campaign , dedicated as it is to curbing consumerism .
she is a walking embodiment of the fact that huge numbers of people have come to enjoy shopping for its own sake .
they get a thrill not for the difference that the products can make to their lives - but out of the process itself .
there is no getting away from the fact we live in a world of diminishing resources and increasing waste pat thomas , the ecologist this " shopping as sport " phenomenon has , some say , helped to drive a wave of consumerism unprecedented in history .
never before has the world spent so much , consumed so much , and thrown so much away .
and with the biggest shopping bonanza of them all , christmas , just a month off , the shops will be thronging with people .
yet campaigners behind buy nothing day say its time may have come .
some thinkers are pointing to growing trends towards environmental awareness and old-fashioned thrift .
these , they predict , foreshadow the end of consumerism as a national obsession .
greedy , wasteful ?
among the campaign 's most enthusiastic supporters is pat thomas , editor of the ecologist magazine .
for many , shopping is about enjoyment rather than necessity " there is no getting away from the fact that we now live in a world of diminishing resources and increasing waste , " says ms thomas .
" the answer is always : consume less . "
yet labels such as " greedy " and " wasteful " which anti-shoppers brandish at spendthrifts are increasingly seen as over-simplistic .
instead , scientific methods are shedding light on the stimuli behind the " shopping thrill " .
and once we understand that , say scientists , we might be able to harness that knowledge to lead a wiser and less wasteful lifestyle .
two months ago researcher dr david lewis strapped video glasses to his subjects , wired them up to machines that measured their brain patterns , heart rate and skin moisture levels and let them loose in a london store in search of bargains .
he and his team discovered that when his shoppers found a desirable product at a low price , their bodies exhibited real physical signs .
" chemicals that create feelings of well-being - like serotonin and adrenalin - were being released into the brain , " he says .
" the brainwaves changed and rising skin moisture levels indicated that people were getting aroused .
their heartbeats also speeded up .
fundamentally what this proved to us was that shopping is above all an ' emotional ' process . "
aspiring for ourselves and for our children to have a better quality of life is what we have always striven for richard dodd , british retail consortium he is careful to make a distinction between " doing the shopping " - buying necessities like bin-bags and toilet paper - and " going shopping " , which he describes as an emotional adventure .
" when we go shopping , we shop according to our emotional state , " says dr lewis , of the mind lab consultancy .
" we 'll buy things that make us feel good - and it is only after that we construct a narrative to justify our choices .
" in a way , our conscious rationality is like a company 's pr department , explaining why certain actions have been taken after the event . "
national pastime the good news for environmentalists is that scientists now believe they can use this knowledge to transform our consumption patterns - even to the extent of making non-consumption " sexy " .
happiest in 1975 ?
margaret thatcher becomes conservative leader bbc shows first six episodes of fawlty towers west indies win first cricket world cup economist andrew oswald from warwick university has identified a consumer cycle , which he says is moving from strong materialism to a concern for the environment , and wider issues around wellbeing .
" we know that in the industrialised countries there has been no rise in general levels of happiness - as measured in surveys on job satisfaction and figures on mental health - since about 1975 , " says mr oswald .
people in the developed west are beginning to realise that more material goods does not equal more happiness , he says .
" politicians like conservative leader david cameron in the uk and governor arnold schwarzenegger in california have caught on to this trend .
the language is now more about happiness and well-being - and there 's much less concentration on the language of pure economic growth . "
scientists believe we shop with our emotions - not our brains it 's a controversial theory , and one that 's fiercely contested by those with the most to lose - shopkeepers .
" i do n't believe this for a moment , " says richard dodd from the british retail consortium .
" our figures show a steady year-on-year growth in consumer spending .
those people -lsb- cameron and schwarzenegger -rsb- are in the privileged position of being able to spend less .
poorer people do n't have those choices .
" i think the economy will continue to grow as it has always grown .
aspiring for ourselves and for our children to have a better quality of life is what we have always striven for .
that wo n't change . "
but those who believe consumerism is on the wane remain optimistic .
" i predict that it will no longer be seen as smart to have too much bling .
and because we buy things on an unconscious level we will invent a narrative to explain our thrift , " says dr lewis .
" it will become just as satisfactory to buy something green - or not to consume at all . "
if this is true , then the anti-consumers might be pushing at an open door .
and buy nothing day might be a sign of bigger things to come .
below is a selection of your comments .
before you get so high minded , spare a thought for people who work in shops , helping people obtain their requirements , often locally sourced , or craft shops with handmade clothes or poducing crafts .
shops that you remember , shops that are run with a conviction that they are running a useful service in their towns or villages .
there are many fewer kinds of shop than there used to be , but still small specialised shops here and there which can not be bettered for quality and choice , often using eco-friendly methods and materials .
hammering shopping is likely to damage these smaller businesses and leave us with the conglomerates , with no choice , no variety and no pride in making things well .
sally , stirling people will always have differences in the things that excite them and if someone is excited by shopping , so be it .
many people work hard earning a living and would therefore feel justified in spending money on themselves or others from time to time , even if it is for superficial reasons .
the best way to make people reduce consumption is to limit the amount they are allowed to spend and i do n't believe that is feasible or justified at this point in time .
chris , sheffield unless i 'm out to buy something specifically -lrb- and that is n't often since i 'm strapped for cash -rrb- i hate shopping .
crowded shops , people wandering along at crawling speed , long queues to pay , disinterested staff ...
i could go on and on .
sorry , but my life is too full of interesting things to do to waste it plodding round shopping centres .
helen ooops !
i 'm going to do my xmas shopping on saturday ...
kate , oxford , uk richard dodd says : " aspiring for ourselves and for our children to have a better quality of life is what we have always striven for ... "
but quality of life is not just about having stuff , but about social networks and quality environments - the sorts of things that over-consumption is destroying .
make no mistake , the brc is only interested in profits , not quality of life issues .
tony p , worcester i have always thought that people who get a thrill out of shopping must have a life with really low levels of excitement elsewhere .
i 'm not suggesting everyone should go bungee jumping but surely you can get more of a thrill away from the high street .
mike rodgers , exeter hallelujah , at last it seems we are waking up to reducing consumption ! !
chapter 4 in agenda 21 from the rio earth summit expressed the necessity for reduction in consumption .
it is time for us to stop chasing the ' feel-good ' factor and get to grips with the real issues on this beautiful planet of ours .
dorps , durham i am sick to death of having " being green " rammed down my throat everywhere i turn .
climate change is inevitable - look back over the past million years or so .
the planet will evolve and survive .
it is the human race that may not , but the more i see of it the more i wonder if it is worth saving anyway .

by julian joyce bbc news buy nothing day - an annual moratorium on shopping - has made little impression over the years .
but campaigners marking this year 's day of inaction , on saturday , sense the tide is starting to turn .
the mere thought is almost enough to bring maryann poole out in a cold sweat - a day dedicated to not shopping .
the psychology of shopping explained maryann , a freelance journalist from west london , says she " genuinely enjoys " shopping .
" i admire things .
i like looking at the difference between products .
i like going into shops and choosing things .
having a good long talk with the shop assistant - so long as they know their stuff .
" and then getting home and taking whatever it is out of the nice packaging , " it 's " a lot to do with who i am - the whole process gives me real pleasure " .
maryann is a retailer 's dream .
but she is also the worst nightmare of the buy nothing day campaign , dedicated as it is to curbing consumerism .
she is a walking embodiment of the fact that huge numbers of people have come to enjoy shopping for its own sake .
they get a thrill not for the difference that the products can make to their lives - but out of the process itself .
there is no getting away from the fact we live in a world of diminishing resources and increasing waste pat thomas , the ecologist this " shopping as sport " phenomenon has , some say , helped to drive a wave of consumerism unprecedented in history .
never before has the world spent so much , consumed so much , and thrown so much away .
and with the biggest shopping bonanza of them all , christmas , just a month off , the shops will be thronging with people .
yet campaigners behind buy nothing day say its time may have come .
some thinkers are pointing to growing trends towards environmental awareness and old-fashioned thrift .
these , they predict , foreshadow the end of consumerism as a national obsession .
greedy , wasteful ?
among the campaign 's most enthusiastic supporters is pat thomas , editor of the ecologist magazine .
for many , shopping is about enjoyment rather than necessity " there is no getting away from the fact that we now live in a world of diminishing resources and increasing waste , " says ms thomas .
" the answer is always : consume less . "
yet labels such as " greedy " and " wasteful " which anti-shoppers brandish at spendthrifts are increasingly seen as over-simplistic .
instead , scientific methods are shedding light on the stimuli behind the " shopping thrill " .
and once we understand that , say scientists , we might be able to harness that knowledge to lead a wiser and less wasteful lifestyle .
two months ago researcher dr david lewis strapped video glasses to his subjects , wired them up to machines that measured their brain patterns , heart rate and skin moisture levels and let them loose in a london store in search of bargains .
he and his team discovered that when his shoppers found a desirable product at a low price , their bodies exhibited real physical signs .
" chemicals that create feelings of well-being - like serotonin and adrenalin - were being released into the brain , " he says .
" the brainwaves changed and rising skin moisture levels indicated that people were getting aroused .
their heartbeats also speeded up .
fundamentally what this proved to us was that shopping is above all an ' emotional ' process . "
aspiring for ourselves and for our children to have a better quality of life is what we have always striven for richard dodd , british retail consortium he is careful to make a distinction between " doing the shopping " - buying necessities like bin-bags and toilet paper - and " going shopping " , which he describes as an emotional adventure .
" when we go shopping , we shop according to our emotional state , " says dr lewis , of the mind lab consultancy .
" we 'll buy things that make us feel good - and it is only after that we construct a narrative to justify our choices .
" in a way , our conscious rationality is like a company 's pr department , explaining why certain actions have been taken after the event . "
national pastime the good news for environmentalists is that scientists now believe they can use this knowledge to transform our consumption patterns - even to the extent of making non-consumption " sexy " .
happiest in 1975 ?
margaret thatcher becomes conservative leader bbc shows first six episodes of fawlty towers west indies win first cricket world cup economist andrew oswald from warwick university has identified a consumer cycle , which he says is moving from strong materialism to a concern for the environment , and wider issues around wellbeing .
" we know that in the industrialised countries there has been no rise in general levels of happiness - as measured in surveys on job satisfaction and figures on mental health - since about 1975 , " says mr oswald .
people in the developed west are beginning to realise that more material goods does not equal more happiness , he says .
" politicians like conservative leader david cameron in the uk and governor arnold schwarzenegger in california have caught on to this trend .
the language is now more about happiness and well-being - and there 's much less concentration on the language of pure economic growth . "
scientists believe we shop with our emotions - not our brains it 's a controversial theory , and one that 's fiercely contested by those with the most to lose - shopkeepers .
" i do n't believe this for a moment , " says richard dodd from the british retail consortium .
" our figures show a steady year-on-year growth in consumer spending .
those people -lsb- cameron and schwarzenegger -rsb- are in the privileged position of being able to spend less .
poorer people do n't have those choices .
" i think the economy will continue to grow as it has always grown .
aspiring for ourselves and for our children to have a better quality of life is what we have always striven for .
that wo n't change . "
but those who believe consumerism is on the wane remain optimistic .
" i predict that it will no longer be seen as smart to have too much bling .
and because we buy things on an unconscious level we will invent a narrative to explain our thrift , " says dr lewis .
" it will become just as satisfactory to buy something green - or not to consume at all . "
if this is true , then the anti-consumers might be pushing at an open door .
and buy nothing day might be a sign of bigger things to come .
below is a selection of your comments .
before you get so high minded , spare a thought for people who work in shops , helping people obtain their requirements , often locally sourced , or craft shops with handmade clothes or poducing crafts .
shops that you remember , shops that are run with a conviction that they are running a useful service in their towns or villages .
there are many fewer kinds of shop than there used to be , but still small specialised shops here and there which can not be bettered for quality and choice , often using eco-friendly methods and materials .
hammering shopping is likely to damage these smaller businesses and leave us with the conglomerates , with no choice , no variety and no pride in making things well .
sally , stirling people will always have differences in the things that excite them and if someone is excited by shopping , so be it .
many people work hard earning a living and would therefore feel justified in spending money on themselves or others from time to time , even if it is for superficial reasons .
the best way to make people reduce consumption is to limit the amount they are allowed to spend and i do n't believe that is feasible or justified at this point in time .
chris , sheffield unless i 'm out to buy something specifically -lrb- and that is n't often since i 'm strapped for cash -rrb- i hate shopping .
crowded shops , people wandering along at crawling speed , long queues to pay , disinterested staff ...
i could go on and on .
sorry , but my life is too full of interesting things to do to waste it plodding round shopping centres .
helen ooops !
i 'm going to do my xmas shopping on saturday ...
kate , oxford , uk richard dodd says : " aspiring for ourselves and for our children to have a better quality of life is what we have always striven for ... "
but quality of life is not just about having stuff , but about social networks and quality environments - the sorts of things that over-consumption is destroying .
make no mistake , the brc is only interested in profits , not quality of life issues .
tony p , worcester i have always thought that people who get a thrill out of shopping must have a life with really low levels of excitement elsewhere .
i 'm not suggesting everyone should go bungee jumping but surely you can get more of a thrill away from the high street .
mike rodgers , exeter hallelujah , at last it seems we are waking up to reducing consumption ! !
chapter 4 in agenda 21 from the rio earth summit expressed the necessity for reduction in consumption .
it is time for us to stop chasing the ' feel-good ' factor and get to grips with the real issues on this beautiful planet of ours .
dorps , durham i am sick to death of having " being green " rammed down my throat everywhere i turn .
climate change is inevitable - look back over the past million years or so .
the planet will evolve and survive .
it is the human race that may not , but the more i see of it the more i wonder if it is worth saving anyway .

halo 3 , the orange box and super mario galaxy have all been awarded one of the highest accolades in gaming - a perfect score from edge .
and plenty of other games have been given near perfect scores also - from bioshock to crysis , drake 's fortune and call of duty 4 .
the edge scores are just one of a number of signs that reinforce a growing feeling that videogames are enjoying a golden age .
it is not just that the interactive experiences are getting ever more immersive , or the industry is being taken ever more seriously , but hardware and software sales are up significantly on last year - buoyed by a new generation of consoles and the work of developers who are beginning to exploit the tools they have at their disposal . "
a lot of the games are sequels and i would like to see more innovation " margaret robertson , games consultant " you have to look at the maturity of platforms in part to answer why there are currently so many good games out there , " said tony mott , editor of edge magazine .
" it 's difficult to say across the board that games are getting better .
but we are seeing publishers being more careful about the quality of games that they release .
" and there are so many good games out now that some publishers are holding titles back to next year . "
the industry also looks to have found a way to blend the loose attractions of casual and social gaming with the hardcore experiences beloved by the seasoned player .
games of the year ?
super mario galaxy -lrb- pictured -rrb- - 97.3 % the orange box - 96.1 % bioshock - 95.3 % call of duty 4 - 95.1 % halo 3 - 93.2 % god of war 2 - 93 % mass effect - 93 % crysis - 91 % drake 's fortune - 89 % project gotham racing 4 - 87 % assassin 's creed - 84.5 % gamesrankings.com aggregates review scores margaret robertson , a former editor of edge and now a games consultant , said long-standing gamers were spending more money on games and a whole new audience had been introduced to gaming for the first time .
" there are now more ways than ever to spend money on video games - from consoles to handhelds , supplementary purchases online via live arcade , virtual console and the playstation network to games on your ipod .
" the evidence of what nintendo has done to attract people to games for the first time with the ds and the wii is unmistakably clear . "
this year will be remembered as the year the wii took centre stage as the console of choice for families , the year playstation 3 finally showed its promise in real terms and the xbox 360 hit its stride with the 5th anniversary of online service xbox live .
it is also the year of the handheld with nintendo ds and psp continuing to sell explosively , the year pc gaming began its renaissance and developers got to grips with tools that allowed them to tell stories in new , dynamic ways . "
i have been publicly criticised for saying that we are yet to see a next generation game in terms of gameplay .
and i stand by that " david braben , frontier games developer david amor , creative director of relentless games : " this is the second generation of titles on consoles and speaking as a developer , we are now benefiting from the tools that these machines offer .
david braben , founder of frontier games , agreed : " this new generation of machines is now bedding down with developers .
a crop of quality titles emerging simultaneously is typical at this point in a console 's lifecycle .
" i have been publicly criticised for saying that we are yet to see a next generation game in terms of gameplay .
and i stand by that . "
mr amor added : " i found myself queuing at the local video game store the other day and that has n't happened for a long time .
there is a batch of very good games out at the moment and i 'm finding myself putting tv and movies to one side to play video games .
titles like assassin 's creed and mass effect have also helped raise the profile of games with big budget advertising campaigns , and an emphasis on storyline and production values .
both are expected to join the ranks of million-plus sellers this year .
margaret robertson said the market growth for games this year had been " explosive and phenomenal " .
sales in the us are up 50 % on last year and the christmas figures are still to come .
" on the strength of sales alone 2007 has been the greatest year in gaming - that much is certain , " she said but she said the industry was also showing signs of maturity .
" this year we have had the huge titles like halo 3 , the orange box and super mario galaxy , which have had huge success and deservedly so .
" but it 's almost the next tier down - games like project gotham racing 4 , call of duty 4 , ratchet and clank and god of war 2 - where there has been such ambition and confidence that you can now almost take the quality for granted .
it 's very encouraging . "
she added : " a lot of the games are sequels and i would like to see more innovation . "
mr braben said it was ironic that the games getting all the praise are the least representative of the industry as a whole .
" games like bioshock and halo 3 are made for the hardcore gamer while there is a widening family appeal of games and gaming that is less talked about .
" 2007 will probably be remembered as the year of the wii , " he added .

halo 3 , the orange box and super mario galaxy have all been awarded one of the highest accolades in gaming - a perfect score from edge .
and plenty of other games have been given near perfect scores also - from bioshock to crysis , drake 's fortune and call of duty 4 .
the edge scores are just one of a number of signs that reinforce a growing feeling that videogames are enjoying a golden age .
it is not just that the interactive experiences are getting ever more immersive , or the industry is being taken ever more seriously , but hardware and software sales are up significantly on last year - buoyed by a new generation of consoles and the work of developers who are beginning to exploit the tools they have at their disposal .
a lot of the games are sequels and i would like to see more innovation margaret robertson , games consultant " you have to look at the maturity of platforms in part to answer why there are currently so many good games out there , " said tony mott , editor of edge magazine .
" it 's difficult to say across the board that games are getting better .
but we are seeing publishers being more careful about the quality of games that they release .
" and there are so many good games out now that some publishers are holding titles back to next year . "
the industry also looks to have found a way to blend the loose attractions of casual and social gaming with the hardcore experiences beloved by the seasoned player .
games of the year ?

" there are now more ways than ever to spend money on video games - from consoles to handhelds , supplementary purchases online via live arcade , virtual console and the playstation network to games on your ipod .
" the evidence of what nintendo has done to attract people to games for the first time with the ds and the wii is unmistakably clear . "
this year will be remembered as the year the wii took centre stage as the console of choice for families , the year playstation 3 finally showed its promise in real terms and the xbox 360 hit its stride with the 5th anniversary of online service xbox live .
it is also the year of the handheld with nintendo ds and psp continuing to sell explosively , the year pc gaming began its renaissance and developers got to grips with tools that allowed them to tell stories in new , dynamic ways .
i have been publicly criticised for saying that we are yet to see a next generation game in terms of gameplay .
and i stand by that david braben , frontier games developer david amor , creative director of relentless games : " this is the second generation of titles on consoles and speaking as a developer , we are now benefiting from the tools that these machines offer .

mr amor added : " i found myself queuing at the local video game store the other day and that has n't happened for a long time .
there is a batch of very good games out at the moment and i 'm finding myself putting tv and movies to one side to play video games .
titles like assassin 's creed and mass effect have also helped raise the profile of games with big budget advertising campaigns , and an emphasis on storyline and production values .
both are expected to join the ranks of million-plus sellers this year .
margaret robertson said the market growth for games this year had been " explosive and phenomenal " .
sales in the us are up 50 % on last year and the christmas figures are still to come .
first person shooters like call of duty 4 are ever more realistic " on the strength of sales alone 2007 has been the greatest year in gaming - that much is certain , " she said but she said the industry was also showing signs of maturity .
" this year we have had the huge titles like halo 3 , the orange box and super mario galaxy , which have had huge success and deservedly so .
" but it 's almost the next tier down - games like project gotham racing 4 , call of duty 4 , ratchet and clank and god of war 2 - where there has been such ambition and confidence that you can now almost take the quality for granted .
it 's very encouraging . "
she added : " a lot of the games are sequels and i would like to see more innovation . "
mr braben said it was ironic that the games getting all the praise are the least representative of the industry as a whole .

it is not just that the interactive experiences are getting ever more immersive , or the industry is being taken ever more seriously , but hardware and software sales are up significantly on last year - buoyed by a new generation of consoles and the work of developers who are beginning to exploit the tools they have at their disposal .
a lot of the games are sequels and i would like to see more innovation margaret robertson , games consultant " you have to look at the maturity of platforms in part to answer why there are currently so many good games out there , " said tony mott , editor of edge magazine .

but we are seeing publishers being more careful about the quality of games that they release .
" and there are so many good games out now that some publishers are holding titles back to next year . "

games of the year ?
super mario galaxy -lrb- pictured -rrb- - 97.3 % the orange box - 96.1 % bioshock - 95.3 % call of duty 4 - 95.1 % halo 3 - 93.2 % god of war 2 - 93 % mass effect - 93 % crysis - 91 % drake 's fortune - 89 % project gotham racing 4 - 87 % assassin 's creed - 84.5 % gamesrankings.com aggregates review scores margaret robertson , a former editor of edge and now a games consultant , said long-standing gamers were spending more money on games and a whole new audience had been introduced to gaming for the first time .
" there are now more ways than ever to spend money on video games - from consoles to handhelds , supplementary purchases online via live arcade , virtual console and the playstation network to games on your ipod .
" the evidence of what nintendo has done to attract people to games for the first time with the ds and the wii is unmistakably clear . "
this year will be remembered as the year the wii took centre stage as the console of choice for families , the year playstation 3 finally showed its promise in real terms and the xbox 360 hit its stride with the 5th anniversary of online service xbox live .
it is also the year of the handheld with nintendo ds and psp continuing to sell explosively , the year pc gaming began its renaissance and developers got to grips with tools that allowed them to tell stories in new , dynamic ways .
i have been publicly criticised for saying that we are yet to see a next generation game in terms of gameplay .
and i stand by that david braben , frontier games developer david amor , creative director of relentless games : " this is the second generation of titles on consoles and speaking as a developer , we are now benefiting from the tools that these machines offer .
david braben , founder of frontier games , agreed : " this new generation of machines is now bedding down with developers .
a crop of quality titles emerging simultaneously is typical at this point in a console 's lifecycle .
" i have been publicly criticised for saying that we are yet to see a next generation game in terms of gameplay .
and i stand by that . "
mr amor added : " i found myself queuing at the local video game store the other day and that has n't happened for a long time .
there is a batch of very good games out at the moment and i 'm finding myself putting tv and movies to one side to play video games .
titles like assassin 's creed and mass effect have also helped raise the profile of games with big budget advertising campaigns , and an emphasis on storyline and production values .
both are expected to join the ranks of million-plus sellers this year .
margaret robertson said the market growth for games this year had been " explosive and phenomenal " .
sales in the us are up 50 % on last year and the christmas figures are still to come .
first person shooters like call of duty 4 are ever more realistic " on the strength of sales alone 2007 has been the greatest year in gaming - that much is certain , " she said but she said the industry was also showing signs of maturity .
" this year we have had the huge titles like halo 3 , the orange box and super mario galaxy , which have had huge success and deservedly so .
" but it 's almost the next tier down - games like project gotham racing 4 , call of duty 4 , ratchet and clank and god of war 2 - where there has been such ambition and confidence that you can now almost take the quality for granted .
it 's very encouraging . "
she added : " a lot of the games are sequels and i would like to see more innovation . "
mr braben said it was ironic that the games getting all the praise are the least representative of the industry as a whole .
" games like bioshock and halo 3 are made for the hardcore gamer while there is a widening family appeal of games and gaming that is less talked about .
" 2007 will probably be remembered as the year of the wii , " he added .

the latest version of his cult science-fiction thriller is now in cinemas ahead of a dvd launch in december .
you 've called blade runner your most complete film ...
sir ridley has been up for the best director oscar three times i think it 's my most personal film - blade runner and the duellist .
both those films are very internalised ; i was really functioning like an author on those .
you ca n't share discussions about blade runner .
what am i going to do - talk constantly about why it 's raining , why it 's dark , why it 's this , why it 's that ?
you ca n't .
you 've designed your overall scheme of things in your head and you try to honour that part of your imagination .
i definitely think i pulled it off , for sure .
why do you think it 's stood the test of time ?
mtv started around 1980 , and i used to watch it .
i think in its early days it was more interesting - these little filmlets cooked up by the bands and the director that were four , five minutes of really great entertainment .
i 'd get a lot of ideas off them .
but then i started to notice bits of blade runner in there .
i thought , ' where the hell did they get that ?
my god - someone 's copying me ! '
it was a huge influence in a lot of rock videos : wet streets , smoke , funny people .
there was an evolution occurring .
that generation only really watched mtv , and that would be the generation we 're talking about now .
how do you feel about the future of science-fiction ?
blade runner 's visual aesthetic has been hugely influential everyone and their mother are making science-fiction movies , and for the most part they all really lack story .
the tail is wagging the dog - the special effects , instead of being the means to an end , are the end in itself .
where do all the writers go ?
writing is the single hardest thing to do .
once you get your design on paper , everything else is pretty straightforward .
it 's been suggested you might win an oscar for american gangster .
would you like to receive one ?
of course , it 'd be nice .
i 've been up three times , so of course i mind not winning - but by the time i get to the first party it 's gone .
in fact you 're flooded with relief that you do n't have to give one of those ghastly speeches .
as you leave you feel disgruntled , but by the time you get the first drink in you really do n't care .
sir ridley scott was talking to the bbc 's rebecca jones .

you 've called blade runner your most complete film ...
sir ridley has been up for the best director oscar three times i think it 's my most personal film - blade runner and the duellist .
both those films are very internalised ; i was really functioning like an author on those .

mtv started around 1980 , and i used to watch it .

employees of european plane maker airbus have denied that the weak dollar is threatening the company 's survival , a german newspaper report has said .
the strength of the euro does create a problem but does not threaten the firm 's existence , the firm 's workers ' council told the berliner zeitung .
a separate report said parent company eads may cancel the sale of factories because of the currency woes .
airbus ' chief executive has said the dollar 's decline is " life-threatening " .
' currency pain ' thomas enders said the exchange rate had gone " beyond the pain barrier " .
and he warned that its cost-saving plan would have to cut deeper to counter the impact of the weakening us currency , which has hit new record lows against the euro this week .
because airbus mainly manufacturers its aircraft within the eurozone but sells them in dollars it is highly vulnerable to foreign exchange fluctuations .
the plane maker says this favours it arch-rival , boeing .
airbus is owned by european aerospace and defence group eads .
according to sueddeutcsche zeitung , eads may now not sell three german airbus plants , as well as the parent firm 's own augsburg factory , and instead group them into a new division .
job losses airbus is already shedding about 10,000 jobs and selling plants as part of its power8 restructuring plan after delays to its a380 superjumbo drove the plane maker into a loss last year .
earlier this month airbus warned it may have to deepen its planned restructuring after steeper-than-expected third-quarter losses .
it said a net loss of 776m euros -lrb- $ 1.14bn ; £ 541m -rrb- - as against a loss of 189m euros in 2006 - was down to delays with its a400m military transport aircraft .
and it said full-year earnings would only " roughly break even " .
and back in september , airbus chief operating officer fabrice bregier said a further 1bn euros might have to be added to a savings plan which was originally based on a $ 1.35 euro .

employees of european plane maker airbus have denied that the weak dollar is threatening the company 's survival , a german newspaper report has said .
the strength of the euro does create a problem but does not threaten the firm 's existence , the firm 's workers ' council told the berliner zeitung .
a separate report said parent company eads may cancel the sale of factories because of the currency woes .
airbus ' chief executive has said the dollar 's decline is " life-threatening " .
' currency pain ' thomas enders said the exchange rate had gone " beyond the pain barrier " .
and he warned that its cost-saving plan would have to cut deeper to counter the impact of the weakening us currency , which has hit new record lows against the euro this week .
because airbus mainly manufacturers its aircraft within the eurozone but sells them in dollars it is highly vulnerable to foreign exchange fluctuations .
the plane maker says this favours it arch-rival , boeing .
airbus is owned by european aerospace and defence group eads .
according to sueddeutcsche zeitung , eads may now not sell three german airbus plants , as well as the parent firm 's own augsburg factory , and instead group them into a new division .
job losses airbus is already shedding about 10,000 jobs and selling plants as part of its power8 restructuring plan after delays to its a380 superjumbo drove the plane maker into a loss last year .
earlier this month airbus warned it may have to deepen its planned restructuring after steeper-than-expected third-quarter losses .
it said a net loss of 776m euros -lrb- $ 1.14bn ; £ 541m -rrb- - as against a loss of 189m euros in 2006 - was down to delays with its a400m military transport aircraft .
and it said full-year earnings would only " roughly break even " .
and back in september , airbus chief operating officer fabrice bregier said a further 1bn euros might have to be added to a savings plan which was originally based on a $ 1.35 euro .

what 's that ?
watching euro 2008 unfold in austria and switzerland has suddenly lost its appeal to fans of the home nations .
so what else will there be to do next june ?
at 9.31pm on wednesday , june 2008 looked pretty sorted for england football fans .
barbecues , pub time , nights in front of the telly watching the three lions lose on penalties .
maybe a trip to austria and catch a couple of games before the miserable , dispiriting exit .

as this sad news sinks in , many fans will think the summer is cancelled , but do n't lose heart .
1 .
see england players perform with passion , skill and tactical nous by watching their clubs ' 2007-8 videos , while scottish and northern irish fans reflect on spirited campaigns .
2 .
salute steve mcclaren - the daily mail-christened " wally with the brolly " - by showing off your umbrella at a rain-soaked , murray-laden wimbledon .

join the former england boss on a summer tour promoting his autobiography , mac the life .
the final chapter details his astonishing transformation from fa reject to the saviour of derby county , taking them from the bottom at christmas to their first premiership title as champions .
4 .
go to austria and switzerland anyway on an alpine yodelling trip or sound of music tour .
the home of maria and the von trapps will surely be a better place without england fans playing dam busters in the street .
and if the football happens to be on telly in a bar , cheer a premiership club .
they 're well represented , except for spurs , which has practised the misguided policy of buying english .
5 .
bask in the glow of eurovision song contest glory .
with no football to distract the nation , it 's the chance to unite behind the british entry in belgrade at the end of may .
terry venables has got nothing on and he owes england fans , so maybe he could reprise his famous england crazy , that reached number 46 in 2002 .
or i did it his way ? 6 .

7 .
watch other sports .
who needs euro 2008 when there 's lewis hamilton storming through his second formula one season , a rugby league world cup and an england test series against new zealand ?
the olympics in beijing will be just round the corner , starting with football on 6 august , and the squash world championships in manchester in october will showcase top british talent such as nick matthew and tania bailey .

one by one the best candidates will drop out as their involvement in fa talks is leaked while they 're trying to win 2008 .
10 .
see a european tournament that matters .
there 's the european brass band championships in norway , the euro 2008 handball champs , also in norway , the european figure skating championships in croatia and the european kendo championships in finland .

i 'll start watching at the semi-finals and just pretend england have been knocked out on penalties in the previous round .
tim rose , brighton instead of watching euro 2008 , develop a smug grin and the ability to fill a blazer .
obtain your coaching badges , be ginger and get a job managing a club football team during which time make sure no player except the keeper is playing in his actual position .
upon completing the aforementioned tasks , you will be thrust into the frame for the england manager 's job , say yes to every question they ask at the job interview , pay no heed to the other candidates offered the job before you who have turned it down , accept the job and sit back and wait for the public adoration to roll in .

what 's that ?
watching euro 2008 unfold in austria and switzerland has suddenly lost its appeal to fans of the home nations .

what 's that ?
watching euro 2008 unfold in austria and switzerland has suddenly lost its appeal to fans of the home nations .
so what else will there be to do next june ?
at 9.31pm on wednesday , june 2008 looked pretty sorted for england football fans .
barbecues , pub time , nights in front of the telly watching the three lions lose on penalties .
maybe a trip to austria and catch a couple of games before the miserable , dispiriting exit .
but then mladen petric fired in croatia 's winner from 25 yards and those three summer weeks suddenly screamed " vacant " .
it 's the same for the rest of the british isles , which is providing no team at a major football tournament for the first time since 1984 .
to be reprised at wimbledon ...
as this sad news sinks in , many fans will think the summer is cancelled , but do n't lose heart .
1 .
see england players perform with passion , skill and tactical nous by watching their clubs ' 2007-8 videos , while scottish and northern irish fans reflect on spirited campaigns .
2 .
salute steve mcclaren - the daily mail-christened " wally with the brolly " - by showing off your umbrella at a rain-soaked , murray-laden wimbledon .
3 .
join the former england boss on a summer tour promoting his autobiography , mac the life .
the final chapter details his astonishing transformation from fa reject to the saviour of derby county , taking them from the bottom at christmas to their first premiership title as champions .
4 .
go to austria and switzerland anyway on an alpine yodelling trip or sound of music tour .
the home of maria and the von trapps will surely be a better place without england fans playing dam busters in the street .
and if the football happens to be on telly in a bar , cheer a premiership club .
they 're well represented , except for spurs , which has practised the misguided policy of buying english .
5 .
bask in the glow of eurovision song contest glory .
with no football to distract the nation , it 's the chance to unite behind the british entry in belgrade at the end of may .
terry venables has got nothing on and he owes england fans , so maybe he could reprise his famous england crazy , that reached number 46 in 2002 .
or i did it his way ? 6 .
witness the great migration of the wildebeest across the serengeti .
england fans will be well used to seeing hairy lumps lumbering across bumpy terrain after wednesday 's static display on an uneven wembley pitch .
7 .
watch other sports .
who needs euro 2008 when there 's lewis hamilton storming through his second formula one season , a rugby league world cup and an england test series against new zealand ?
the olympics in beijing will be just round the corner , starting with football on 6 august , and the squash world championships in manchester in october will showcase top british talent such as nick matthew and tania bailey .
-lrb- and 2009 is the big year for sport anyway , with the ashes series at home , the twenty20 world cup and a lions tour to south africa . -rrb- 8 .
get in touch with your inner self in the lost vagueness field at glastonbury .
it has a reputation as the most anarchic and warped place at the festival , so any references to the euro 2008 final happening the same weekend will be few and far between .
stay there long enough and one could be convinced that scotland / wales / northern ireland / england -lrb- delete as applicable -rrb- has won the thing .
9 .

it will still be unfolding eight months from now and remains a fine spectator sport .

10 .

the scottish government said the move followed recent concern over the treatment of veterans .
at present , war veterans are only entitled to priority nhs treatment if they receive a war pension .
now all veterans with a condition associated with military service will get the same access as war pensioners .
the uk government is set to announce similar measures for veterans to be given fast-track treatment on the nhs , and for special centres to be set up for those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder .
scotland 's health secretary nicola sturgeon said : " our service men and women do an outstanding job and it is only right that those who have health problems as a result of serving their country in the armed forces should get priority access to treatment .
" the scottish government fully supports these new measures and plans to implement these in a way that the benefits are fully realised . "
post-traumatic stress allocation of such treatment would still be finally decided by the clinician in charge of an individual 's case , based on their judgement of the clinical need .
priority treatment is currently only available to those who have been pensioned out of the forces with a specific injury .
the change would allow former servicemen and women who suffer physical and mental problems from their time in service to come forward and claim priority treatment .

the scottish government said the move followed recent concern over the treatment of veterans .
at present , war veterans are only entitled to priority nhs treatment if they receive a war pension .
now all veterans with a condition associated with military service will get the same access as war pensioners .
the uk government is set to announce similar measures for veterans to be given fast-track treatment on the nhs , and for special centres to be set up for those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder .
scotland 's health secretary nicola sturgeon said : " our service men and women do an outstanding job and it is only right that those who have health problems as a result of serving their country in the armed forces should get priority access to treatment .
" the scottish government fully supports these new measures and plans to implement these in a way that the benefits are fully realised . "
post-traumatic stress allocation of such treatment would still be finally decided by the clinician in charge of an individual 's case , based on their judgement of the clinical need .
priority treatment is currently only available to those who have been pensioned out of the forces with a specific injury .
the change would allow former servicemen and women who suffer physical and mental problems from their time in service to come forward and claim priority treatment .

the governor of the state of para , where the reported case took place , has promised a full inquiry .
governor ana julia carepa said the age of the woman , put variously at 15 and 20 , was irrelevant as she should not have been jailed with male prisoners .
women 's rights groups in brazil say it is not an isolated case .
according to reports in the brazilian media , the number of men in the cell with the young woman ranged between 20 and more than 30 .
public anger media reports suggested that the girl was placed in a police cell in the town of abaetetuba on suspicion of theft .
but human-rights groups say there is uncertainty about what offence the girl was accused of and she was not formally charged .
whether she was 15 , 20 , or 100 does n't matter .
a woman should never be left in a jail with men governor ana julia carepa brazil 's notorious prisons they say that she was raped relentlessly and forced to have sex in order to obtain food .
the girl 's father has now alleged that he has been threatened by police who tried to force him to provide a birth certificate showing that the girl was 20 years of age - a document which he said did not exist .
the police are said to have believed at one stage that the girl was not under age .
public anger gov carepa said the girl 's age did not matter .
" whether she was 15 , 20 , or 100 does n't matter .
a woman should never be left in a jail with men , " she said .
" i am shocked and indignant , as a woman and as a governor , " gov carepa said , promising that those responsible would face " exemplary punishment " and that such an incident would not be allowed to happen again .
jails in brazil are notorious for overcrowding and appalling conditions , and this is not the first time that there has been a controversy over a female prisoner being detained alongside men .
however , on this occasion , the seriousness of the allegation has caused shock and considerable public anger , the bbc 's gary duffy in sao paulo says .
women 's rights groups in para state quoted by the globo website say there have been at least three cases of women being put in cells with men .

by mark ward technology correspondent , bbc news two computer discs holding the personal details of all families in the uk with a child under 16 have gone missing .
the scandal of the 25 million missing records has highlighted the vulnerability of data .
it is easy to develop a sense of creeping paranoia when you begin to contemplate just how many companies , government departments and other organisations know your personal data .
missing data includes national insurance number name , address and birth date partner 's details names , sex and age of children bank / savings account details enlarge image " the average economically active individual in the developed world is on about 700 databases , " said niamh gallagher , a researcher at think tank demos who has spent six months researching the spread of personal data .
she said it would be naive to think that an encounter with one organisation means one isolated database is queried .
typically data is gathered from many sources before a decision is reached .
for instance the usvisit border system , which is consulted when britons cross from the uk to the us , mines about 30 separate databases as it checks identities .
ms gallagher and colleague peter bradwell will release their report in early december .
" pretty much every organisation you engage with day-to-day - from clicking your oyster card to ordering your take away - means sharing personal information . "
that sharing of data , she said , has become entwined with modern life and it was a mistake to think that sharing information so often only has a downside .
you are not going to get people complying with data protection on the basis of good will niamh gallagher , demos " it 's much harder to live your life without sharing information than it is by sharing , " she said .
anyone that tries to stop their personal data leaking away often find they are denied benefits enjoyed by those that are happier to share .
for instance , paying cash for everything will keep your name off credit checking databases .
however , without the re-assurance of that check banks and credit card companies may refuse to issue a loan or mortgage .
data control and there are a lot of people within companies , government and other organisations that are allowed to use data that can be used to identify you .
according to the 2006/7 annual report from the information commissioner there are more than 287,000 data controllers in the uk who have a responsibility for making sure that personal data is used correctly .
personal data in this sense is information that can be used to identify an individual .
many of those data controllers will oversee many more who actually do the job of maintaining and expanding the databases holding the data .
and it does not stop there .
the web is helping that data take wing and travel farther than ever before .
government departments are increasingly sharing data hi-tech firm garlik , which helps people gain some control over the use of personal data , estimates that personal details about average briton can be found in more than 1,000 places on the web .
what few people realise , said ms gallagher , was that handing over data to one organisation can mean that it reaches many others and becomes an entry on the database they maintain .
" there is no awareness of what happens to that data when you give it away , " said ms gallagher .

many organisations that collect data , such as credit checking agencies , were under commercial pressure to widen the scope of what they collect , said ms gallagher .
no longer are firms just interested in the basic facts about you - now what matters as much as what type of credit card you own is when you go shopping , which stores you visit and what you buy .

dr kirstie ball , a senior lecturer at the open university , said that although many social scientists been studied the subject for years the pervasiveness of that scrutiny was prompting an upsurge of interest .
" that personal data held by every organisation you interact with runs the parameters of your existence , your consumption , your entitlements , " she said .
almost every time you fill in a form the data makes it to a database " we 're all interested in the collection and application of personal data and its consequences for individual rights and social science concepts such as trust and discrimination , " said dr ball .
" it merits study and understanding because its consequences can be tangible , " she said .
for instance , she said , an employee ticking the wrong box when they enter your data into a database could mean a person ends up labelled as a former criminal or credit liability .
it is possible to ask to see the data that companies and organisations hold about you , but a very small number of people take up this opportunity to vet what is known about them .

by mark ward technology correspondent , bbc news two computer discs holding the personal details of all families in the uk with a child under 16 have gone missing .
the scandal of the 25 million missing records has highlighted the vulnerability of data .
it is easy to develop a sense of creeping paranoia when you begin to contemplate just how many companies , government departments and other organisations know your personal data .
missing data includes national insurance number name , address and birth date partner 's details names , sex and age of children bank / savings account details enlarge image " the average economically active individual in the developed world is on about 700 databases , " said niamh gallagher , a researcher at think tank demos who has spent six months researching the spread of personal data .
she said it would be naive to think that an encounter with one organisation means one isolated database is queried .
typically data is gathered from many sources before a decision is reached .
for instance the usvisit border system , which is consulted when britons cross from the uk to the us , mines about 30 separate databases as it checks identities .
ms gallagher and colleague peter bradwell will release their report in early december .
" pretty much every organisation you engage with day-to-day - from clicking your oyster card to ordering your take away - means sharing personal information . "
that sharing of data , she said , has become entwined with modern life and it was a mistake to think that sharing information so often only has a downside .
