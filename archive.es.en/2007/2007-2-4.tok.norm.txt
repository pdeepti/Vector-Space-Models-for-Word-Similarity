now , a unique travel agency aims to improve ties between the neighbors . julia gerstenberg and jacqueline nießer have their work cut out for them . sitting in a little office in frankfurt on the oder river in eastern germany , which should not to be confused with the financial hub frankfurt on the main river in the west , the pair is surround by maps of poland , history books and dictionaries .
the scent of freshly brewed coffee and polish waffles wafts through the air . gerstenberg is trying to decipher an old map , while nießer answers questions on the telephone . researching roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heimatreise 's founders graduated from viadrina university each day , their small agency heimatreise , roughly translated as " trip home , " receives dozens of calls .
gerstenberg and nießer have made it their job to research family histories and organize trips for ethnic germans , and their descendents , who were expelled from poland at the end of world war ii and beyond . eight german and eight polish students attending the city 's europa university viadrina founded the travel agency in 2002 . nießer said heimatreise was established when relations between germany and poland were particularly tense . " we wondered what we in frankfurt / oder , on the german-polish border , could do on a small scale to ease the tensions on a human level , " she said . a look back at the time of heimatreise 's founding , the prussian trust organization , which represents the families of expropriated and resettled germans , had been launching lawsuits in poland for the return of lost property . at the end of world war ii , some 12 million germans were killed or expelled from central europe as the german and polish borders were being redrawn by the allies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 12 million germans were expelled from central europe after wwii some expelled germans and their descendents want poland to admit to wrongdoings at the end of the war , while others want to reclaim their former homes . many poles , for their part , are resentful of the demands in light of the nazi invasion in 1939 and the millions ' of deaths that ensued . bridging the gap that 's where heimatreise 's work comes in : to bridge the gap in a very sensitive area .
all of the agency 's workers volunteer their time and have so far organized around 10 trips to pomerania , the area surrounding lebus and the neumark . some people book trips to celebrate a significant birthday .
sons and daughters often want to treat their parents to a trip " back home " and choose to accompany them . " that 's important because we do n't want to stir up history , but rather , use to as a point of departure to talk about modern poland and its people , " said nießer . detective work heimatreise workers also said they see themselves as travel guides and detectives in one . often they have only a few clues to get started with when trying to track down a family 's history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the war , mainly germans lived in gdansk in northern poland detlef mielke showed up at the agency with just a few yellowed photographs and a vague notion of significant family dates and a few stories he remembered hearing from his father . " i wanted to go and see where my family 's from , " he said .
" everyone wants to know where they come from . " but the meager information turned out to be enough for the agency 's workers and a trip was booked for the 69-year-old to visit his ancestors former home . nießer , however , warns of having high expectations .
reality is not always as colorful as the pictures parents or grandparents may have painted of their origins . across borders and generations dialogue and exchange occur not just between two cultures but also between generations . mielke said he now visits the heimatreise office regularly because it 's like a " shot of energy " for him . he 's also started learning polish and is planning more trips to the other side of the oder . aygül cizmecioglu -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : german-polish summit breaks the ice both germany and poland can be pleased with the thaw in relations as a result of polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's recent visit to berlin , says dw 's hubert wohlan .

gerstenberg and nießer have made it their job to research family histories and organize trips for ethnic germans , and their descendents , who were expelled from poland at the end of world war ii and beyond . eight german and eight polish students attending the city 's europa university viadrina founded the travel agency in 2002 . nießer said heimatreise was established when relations between germany and poland were particularly tense . " we wondered what we in frankfurt / oder , on the german-polish border , could do on a small scale to ease the tensions on a human level , " she said . a look back at the time of heimatreise 's founding , the prussian trust organization , which represents the families of expropriated and resettled germans , had been launching lawsuits in poland for the return of lost property . at the end of world war ii , some 12 million germans were killed or expelled from central europe as the german and polish borders were being redrawn by the allies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 12 million germans were expelled from central europe after wwii some expelled germans and their descendents want poland to admit to wrongdoings at the end of the war , while others want to reclaim their former homes . many poles , for their part , are resentful of the demands in light of the nazi invasion in 1939 and the millions ' of deaths that ensued . bridging the gap that 's where heimatreise 's work comes in : to bridge the gap in a very sensitive area .
all of the agency 's workers volunteer their time and have so far organized around 10 trips to pomerania , the area surrounding lebus and the neumark . some people book trips to celebrate a significant birthday .
sons and daughters often want to treat their parents to a trip " back home " and choose to accompany them . " that 's important because we do n't want to stir up history , but rather , use to as a point of departure to talk about modern poland and its people , " said nießer . detective work heimatreise workers also said they see themselves as travel guides and detectives in one . often they have only a few clues to get started with when trying to track down a family 's history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the war , mainly germans lived in gdansk in northern poland detlef mielke showed up at the agency with just a few yellowed photographs and a vague notion of significant family dates and a few stories he remembered hearing from his father . " i wanted to go and see where my family 's from , " he said .
" everyone wants to know where they come from . " but the meager information turned out to be enough for the agency 's workers and a trip was booked for the 69-year-old to visit his ancestors former home . nießer , however , warns of having high expectations .
reality is not always as colorful as the pictures parents or grandparents may have painted of their origins . across borders and generations dialogue and exchange occur not just between two cultures but also between generations . mielke said he now visits the heimatreise office regularly because it 's like a " shot of energy " for him . he 's also started learning polish and is planning more trips to the other side of the oder . aygül cizmecioglu -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : german-polish summit breaks the ice both germany and poland can be pleased with the thaw in relations as a result of polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's recent visit to berlin , says dw 's hubert wohlan .

but berlin seems to need convincing . uncertainty dominates any discussion about building a toll bridge across the 14-kilometer -lrb- nine-mile -rrb- fehmarn belt , as the strait between germany and southern denmark is called .
the project has been under discussion for 15 years , and one german chancellor after another has found a way to avoid it .
now , however , a decision could be imminent . hopes were high that it would be a subject when chancellor angela merkel and her danish colleague , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , met in december .
but the press was unable to pin her down after the talks .
" our decision must be made on a sound basis , " was all she would say .
symbolic value scandinavia is not short of links to what the nordic countries refer to as europe .
since completion of two major bridges in the last decade , travelers have been able to drive over land and bridges from sweden through denmark to germany .
ferries also shuttle traffic regularly between the countries .
they ply the fehmarn belt , between danish rodby and german puttgarden every half hour , a crossing that takes 45 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are concerned the fehmarn bridge could disturb nesting birds but when the lines get long at the ferry terminals during school vacations , the wait plus the journey can add up to an hour and a half .
and taking the land and bridge route through denmark to germany adds 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- to the journey south . the scandinavians see the bridge as an important connection to europe .
the route would complement the existing links to create a direct north-south highway corridor from oslo and stockholm to hamburg and other economic centers further south .
the european union has pinpointed the route as one of the priorities of its trans-european networks -lrb- ten -rrb- , which aim to bring the bloc 's regions closer together .
if the project comes together the eu could pay a quarter of the costs .
feasibility studies carried out by the german and danish authorities predicted that the traffic would quickly double to 8,000 cars , 1,000 heavy trucks and 4,000 train passengers daily even if the existing ferry lines remained in place , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote recently .
the missing link but the crucial issue is how to finance the project , which is expected to cost around 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- .
merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats decided in their 2005 coalition agreement to use the fehmarn bridge as an international model for a public-private partnership .
the idea favored by the danes and schleswig-holstein is that a danish-german group will finance the project with money earned on capital markets and be backed up by guarantees from the danish and german governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transport minister tiefensee -lrb- l . -rrb- and his danish colleague flemming hansen critics , however , fear that taxpayers will have to foot the bill in the end , according to danish transport expert per homann jespersen of the university of roskilde . " it 's spoken of by -lrb- danish -rrb- politicians as the missing link , " jespersen said .
" they do n't care so much that it 's financially sound . "
one of the models that supporters of the fehmarn project refer to is the highly symbolic oresund bridge , which connects sweden and denmark between the cities of malmo and copenhagen . the construction was initially deemed a financial flop .
fewer cars and trucks traversed the bridge than expected , opting instead to take longer but cheaper routes to cross the water .
" the oresund bridge is not a big success for long-distance traveling .
it 's a regional bridge , " jespersen said , adding that it had worked out in another way , namely by sparking a boom in the area .
regional growth last year around 16,000 vehicles crossed the bridge , twice as many as five years ago .
more than 20,000 passengers took the train across every day , an increase of 40 percent over the previous year . the bridge has made it much easier , and above all faster , for people to commute between the two countries than in the days when ferries connected the cities .
every 20 minutes , the train brings passengers from the danish to the swedish side in just 35 minutes .
swedes are attracted to the higher wages paid in denmark , while significantly lower property rates give many danes a financial incentive to move abroad . the danes are hopeful that a bridge over the fehmarn belt will bring them an economic boom , too .
it 's hard to imagine though that the rural region would replicate the success of the oresund area , where two important scandinavian cities are located .
still , politicians near rodby , a poorer part of denmark , have been lobbying hard for the project , as has the state government of schleswig-holstein , where fehmarn is located . looking ahead the locals are less enthusiastic .
on the german side , people fear that the financial risk is too high .
they 're also concerned that tourism would suffer during construction of the bridge and never recover .
instead , the area could just become a transit route .
in both countries , there are concerns that hundreds of jobs working at the ferry companies could disappear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bridge between sweden and denmark has been a boon to the region germany 's transport ministry is said to be examining the plans and consultations between officials in berlin and copenhagen continue .
the german government is expected to come to a decision in the next month or two .
jespersen was reluctant to speculate on the outcome .
he said he had begun to doubt whether the bridge project 's future would indeed be resolved sooner rather than later .
but he was optimistic about the future . " i 'm sure that in 10 or 20 years we will have decided it , " he said .
" it will be totally up to the germans .

regional growth last year around 16,000 vehicles crossed the bridge , twice as many as five years ago .

swedes are attracted to the higher wages paid in denmark , while significantly lower property rates give many danes a financial incentive to move abroad . the danes are hopeful that a bridge over the fehmarn belt will bring them an economic boom , too .
it 's hard to imagine though that the rural region would replicate the success of the oresund area , where two important scandinavian cities are located .
still , politicians near rodby , a poorer part of denmark , have been lobbying hard for the project , as has the state government of schleswig-holstein , where fehmarn is located . looking ahead the locals are less enthusiastic .
on the german side , people fear that the financial risk is too high .
they 're also concerned that tourism would suffer during construction of the bridge and never recover .

fatah said it had hoped that " the oppressive siege on the palestinian people " would be lifted . firefights across gaza city sporadic gun battles between the rival factions rattled the streets of gaza city for a third straight morning sunday , despite a ceasefire declared by their leaders . however , the fighting was more subdued than in the past three days , when 28 palestinians were killed and around 260 wounded in some of the fiercest internecine bloodletting since the islamist hamas defeated fatah in elections last year . the german chancellor was also expected to discuss the political crisis in lebanon , the surge in sectarian violence in iraq , iran 's nuclear ambitions and efforts to end the four-year-old fighting in sudan 's darfur region . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier : cia arrest warrants wo n't hurt german-us ties warrants issued by a german court for 13 suspected cia operatives linked to the abduction of a german citizen will not harm relations , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was quoted as saying on saturday .

" germany , which currently holds the rotating european union presidency , has said the environment is one of its priorities . yet it opposes a number of recent proposals by the european to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases , including plans to cut carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions from new cars and impose an emissions quota for 2008-2012 . " if germany drags its feet , the rest of europe will do the same , " dimas said .
" and if europe does n't take part , then the world wo n't either .
in that case , we might as well all pack our bags . " nations " hide " behind german inaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a un report this week said much of climate change is man made the commissioner said other european nations , such as britain and sweden , were close to achieving their targets for curbing emissions of greenhouse gases under the kyoto protocol on global warming .
yet " others hide behind germany 's example . " eu proposals to reduce co2 emissions to an average 120 grams per kilometer are not popular in germany , where many of the automobile industry 's best selling luxury cars are among the worst polluters . auto industry on board but bernd gottschalk , president of the german association of the automotive industry , said his organization was interested in investing billions into ways to reduce green house gasses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an auto industry official said carmakers would invest billions in cutting greenhouse gasses " the german automobile industry will significantly and constructively contribute to the process and do it by investing billions , " he wrote in saturday 's stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . slowing down the autobahn ? in a separate interview in the bild am sonntag , german chancellor angela merkel , said she was opposed to a general speed limit being imposed on germany 's highways . " i do n't think the question of a general speed limit arises , " she said .
" lots of highways have limits and lane controls .
these contribute to the fight against global warming . " the idea of imposing speed limits has been raised recently by the german environment agency , which called for a renewed debate on speed limits on germany 's autobahns .
though some have restrictions , many have no top speed limit .
cutting car speed would reduce emissions . on friday , dimas called for fresh international talks on a comprehensive new global agreement on tackling climate change , following the publication of a stark report on global warming from united nations scientists . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- - the un 's paramount authority on global warming - said fossil fuel pollution would raise temperatures this century , worsen floods , droughts and hurricanes , melt polar ice and damage the climate system for a thousand years to come . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany boosts investment in climate change research the un climate panel has issued its strongest ever warning about global warning .

now , a unique travel agency aims to improve ties between the neighbors . julia gerstenberg and jacqueline nießer have their work cut out for them . sitting in a little office in frankfurt on the oder river in eastern germany , which should not to be confused with the financial hub frankfurt on the main river in the west , the pair is surround by maps of poland , history books and dictionaries .
the scent of freshly brewed coffee and polish waffles wafts through the air . gerstenberg is trying to decipher an old map , while nießer answers questions on the telephone . researching roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heimatreise 's founders graduated from viadrina university each day , their small agency heimatreise , roughly translated as " trip home , " receives dozens of calls .
gerstenberg and nießer have made it their job to research family histories and organize trips for ethnic germans , and their descendents , who were expelled from poland at the end of world war ii and beyond . eight german and eight polish students attending the city 's europa university viadrina founded the travel agency in 2002 . nießer said heimatreise was established when relations between germany and poland were particularly tense . " we wondered what we in frankfurt / oder , on the german-polish border , could do on a small scale to ease the tensions on a human level , " she said . a look back at the time of heimatreise 's founding , the prussian trust organization , which represents the families of expropriated and resettled germans , had been launching lawsuits in poland for the return of lost property . at the end of world war ii , some 12 million germans were killed or expelled from central europe as the german and polish borders were being redrawn by the allies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 12 million germans were expelled from central europe after wwii some expelled germans and their descendents want poland to admit to wrongdoings at the end of the war , while others want to reclaim their former homes . many poles , for their part , are resentful of the demands in light of the nazi invasion in 1939 and the millions ' of deaths that ensued . bridging the gap that 's where heimatreise 's work comes in : to bridge the gap in a very sensitive area .
all of the agency 's workers volunteer their time and have so far organized around 10 trips to pomerania , the area surrounding lebus and the neumark . some people book trips to celebrate a significant birthday .
sons and daughters often want to treat their parents to a trip " back home " and choose to accompany them . " that 's important because we do n't want to stir up history , but rather , use to as a point of departure to talk about modern poland and its people , " said nießer . detective work heimatreise workers also said they see themselves as travel guides and detectives in one . often they have only a few clues to get started with when trying to track down a family 's history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the war , mainly germans lived in gdansk in northern poland detlef mielke showed up at the agency with just a few yellowed photographs and a vague notion of significant family dates and a few stories he remembered hearing from his father . " i wanted to go and see where my family 's from , " he said .
" everyone wants to know where they come from . " but the meager information turned out to be enough for the agency 's workers and a trip was booked for the 69-year-old to visit his ancestors former home . nießer , however , warns of having high expectations .
reality is not always as colorful as the pictures parents or grandparents may have painted of their origins . across borders and generations dialogue and exchange occur not just between two cultures but also between generations . mielke said he now visits the heimatreise office regularly because it 's like a " shot of energy " for him . he 's also started learning polish and is planning more trips to the other side of the oder . aygül cizmecioglu -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : german-polish summit breaks the ice both germany and poland can be pleased with the thaw in relations as a result of polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's recent visit to berlin , says dw 's hubert wohlan .

" germany , which currently holds the rotating european union presidency , has said the environment is one of its priorities . yet it opposes a number of recent proposals by the european to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases , including plans to cut carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions from new cars and impose an emissions quota for 2008-2012 . " if germany drags its feet , the rest of europe will do the same , " dimas said .
" and if europe does n't take part , then the world wo n't either .
in that case , we might as well all pack our bags . " nations " hide " behind german inaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a un report this week said much of climate change is man made the commissioner said other european nations , such as britain and sweden , were close to achieving their targets for curbing emissions of greenhouse gases under the kyoto protocol on global warming .
yet " others hide behind germany 's example . " eu proposals to reduce co2 emissions to an average 120 grams per kilometer are not popular in germany , where many of the automobile industry 's best selling luxury cars are among the worst polluters . auto industry on board but bernd gottschalk , president of the german association of the automotive industry , said his organization was interested in investing billions into ways to reduce green house gasses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an auto industry official said carmakers would invest billions in cutting greenhouse gasses " the german automobile industry will significantly and constructively contribute to the process and do it by investing billions , " he wrote in saturday 's stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . slowing down the autobahn ? in a separate interview in the bild am sonntag , german chancellor angela merkel , said she was opposed to a general speed limit being imposed on germany 's highways . " i do n't think the question of a general speed limit arises , " she said .
" lots of highways have limits and lane controls .
these contribute to the fight against global warming . " the idea of imposing speed limits has been raised recently by the german environment agency , which called for a renewed debate on speed limits on germany 's autobahns .
though some have restrictions , many have no top speed limit .
cutting car speed would reduce emissions . on friday , dimas called for fresh international talks on a comprehensive new global agreement on tackling climate change , following the publication of a stark report on global warming from united nations scientists . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- - the un 's paramount authority on global warming - said fossil fuel pollution would raise temperatures this century , worsen floods , droughts and hurricanes , melt polar ice and damage the climate system for a thousand years to come . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany boosts investment in climate change research the un climate panel has issued its strongest ever warning about global warning .

" germany , which currently holds the rotating european union presidency , has said the environment is one of its priorities . yet it opposes a number of recent proposals by the european to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases , including plans to cut carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions from new cars and impose an emissions quota for 2008-2012 . " if germany drags its feet , the rest of europe will do the same , " dimas said .
" and if europe does n't take part , then the world wo n't either .
in that case , we might as well all pack our bags . " nations " hide " behind german inaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a un report this week said much of climate change is man made the commissioner said other european nations , such as britain and sweden , were close to achieving their targets for curbing emissions of greenhouse gases under the kyoto protocol on global warming .
yet " others hide behind germany 's example . " eu proposals to reduce co2 emissions to an average 120 grams per kilometer are not popular in germany , where many of the automobile industry 's best selling luxury cars are among the worst polluters . auto industry on board but bernd gottschalk , president of the german association of the automotive industry , said his organization was interested in investing billions into ways to reduce green house gasses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an auto industry official said carmakers would invest billions in cutting greenhouse gasses " the german automobile industry will significantly and constructively contribute to the process and do it by investing billions , " he wrote in saturday 's stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . slowing down the autobahn ? in a separate interview in the bild am sonntag , german chancellor angela merkel , said she was opposed to a general speed limit being imposed on germany 's highways . " i do n't think the question of a general speed limit arises , " she said .
" lots of highways have limits and lane controls .
these contribute to the fight against global warming . " the idea of imposing speed limits has been raised recently by the german environment agency , which called for a renewed debate on speed limits on germany 's autobahns .
though some have restrictions , many have no top speed limit .
cutting car speed would reduce emissions . on friday , dimas called for fresh international talks on a comprehensive new global agreement on tackling climate change , following the publication of a stark report on global warming from united nations scientists . the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- - the un 's paramount authority on global warming - said fossil fuel pollution would raise temperatures this century , worsen floods , droughts and hurricanes , melt polar ice and damage the climate system for a thousand years to come . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany boosts investment in climate change research the un climate panel has issued its strongest ever warning about global warning .

" there should not be different signals coming from different continents , " merkel told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while in egypt , merkel called for an end to violence in gaza a german official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said mussa " urged the europeans to play a big role in solving the middle east conflict , especially by pushing the americans to increase their involvement in the quartet . " the so-called quartet of major players - which includes russia , the united nations and the united states , as well as the european union - convened friday to revive their roadmap peace plan , which has made next to no progress since its launch nearly four years ago . mubarak : palestinian unity government forming during her meeting saturday with mubarak , merkel stressed the importance of an end to the violence between the palestinian governing movement hamas and the rival fatah party of abbas . mubarak announced that the formation of a unity government acceptable to western donors should be imminent . " we are working toward a national unity government , " he told reporters after the meeting .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest in gaza has overshadowed recent peace efforts egypt is the chief mediator in the palestinian crisis but has so far failed to clinch a deal for a unity cabinet , seen as a key step towards resuming international aid to the cash-strapped palestinians , who have not received western aid donations since march . conditions to lifting aid freeze merkel , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the european union , reiterated the west 's conditions for lifting the financial boycott . hamas has to recognize israel 's right to exist , renounce violence and accept past agreements with the jewish state , she said . hamas accused western countries of taking " decisions that ignore reality . "
fatah said it had hoped that " the oppressive siege on the palestinian people " would be lifted . firefights across gaza city sporadic gun battles between the rival factions rattled the streets of gaza city for a third straight morning sunday , despite a ceasefire declared by their leaders . however , the fighting was more subdued than in the past three days , when 28 palestinians were killed and around 260 wounded in some of the fiercest internecine bloodletting since the islamist hamas defeated fatah in elections last year . the german chancellor was also expected to discuss the political crisis in lebanon , the surge in sectarian violence in iraq , iran 's nuclear ambitions and efforts to end the four-year-old fighting in sudan 's darfur region . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier : cia arrest warrants wo n't hurt german-us ties warrants issued by a german court for 13 suspected cia operatives linked to the abduction of a german citizen will not harm relations , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was quoted as saying on saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 04.02.2007 germany stalls prestigious bridge project with denmark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandinavia is anxious to see what berlin will decide the danish , swedish , norwegian governments and the european union say a bridge should connect the strait that separates germany and denmark near kiel .
but berlin seems to need convincing . uncertainty dominates any discussion about building a toll bridge across the 14-kilometer -lrb- nine-mile -rrb- fehmarn belt , as the strait between germany and southern denmark is called .
the project has been under discussion for 15 years , and one german chancellor after another has found a way to avoid it .
now , however , a decision could be imminent . hopes were high that it would be a subject when chancellor angela merkel and her danish colleague , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , met in december .
but the press was unable to pin her down after the talks .
" our decision must be made on a sound basis , " was all she would say .
symbolic value scandinavia is not short of links to what the nordic countries refer to as europe .
since completion of two major bridges in the last decade , travelers have been able to drive over land and bridges from sweden through denmark to germany .
ferries also shuttle traffic regularly between the countries .
they ply the fehmarn belt , between danish rodby and german puttgarden every half hour , a crossing that takes 45 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are concerned the fehmarn bridge could disturb nesting birds but when the lines get long at the ferry terminals during school vacations , the wait plus the journey can add up to an hour and a half .
and taking the land and bridge route through denmark to germany adds 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- to the journey south . the scandinavians see the bridge as an important connection to europe .
the route would complement the existing links to create a direct north-south highway corridor from oslo and stockholm to hamburg and other economic centers further south .
the european union has pinpointed the route as one of the priorities of its trans-european networks -lrb- ten -rrb- , which aim to bring the bloc 's regions closer together .
if the project comes together the eu could pay a quarter of the costs .
feasibility studies carried out by the german and danish authorities predicted that the traffic would quickly double to 8,000 cars , 1,000 heavy trucks and 4,000 train passengers daily even if the existing ferry lines remained in place , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote recently .
the missing link but the crucial issue is how to finance the project , which is expected to cost around 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- .
merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats decided in their 2005 coalition agreement to use the fehmarn bridge as an international model for a public-private partnership .
the idea favored by the danes and schleswig-holstein is that a danish-german group will finance the project with money earned on capital markets and be backed up by guarantees from the danish and german governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transport minister tiefensee -lrb- l . -rrb- and his danish colleague flemming hansen critics , however , fear that taxpayers will have to foot the bill in the end , according to danish transport expert per homann jespersen of the university of roskilde . " it 's spoken of by -lrb- danish -rrb- politicians as the missing link , " jespersen said .
" they do n't care so much that it 's financially sound . "
one of the models that supporters of the fehmarn project refer to is the highly symbolic oresund bridge , which connects sweden and denmark between the cities of malmo and copenhagen . the construction was initially deemed a financial flop .
fewer cars and trucks traversed the bridge than expected , opting instead to take longer but cheaper routes to cross the water .
" the oresund bridge is not a big success for long-distance traveling .
it 's a regional bridge , " jespersen said , adding that it had worked out in another way , namely by sparking a boom in the area .
regional growth last year around 16,000 vehicles crossed the bridge , twice as many as five years ago .
more than 20,000 passengers took the train across every day , an increase of 40 percent over the previous year . the bridge has made it much easier , and above all faster , for people to commute between the two countries than in the days when ferries connected the cities .
every 20 minutes , the train brings passengers from the danish to the swedish side in just 35 minutes .
swedes are attracted to the higher wages paid in denmark , while significantly lower property rates give many danes a financial incentive to move abroad . the danes are hopeful that a bridge over the fehmarn belt will bring them an economic boom , too .
it 's hard to imagine though that the rural region would replicate the success of the oresund area , where two important scandinavian cities are located .
still , politicians near rodby , a poorer part of denmark , have been lobbying hard for the project , as has the state government of schleswig-holstein , where fehmarn is located . looking ahead the locals are less enthusiastic .
on the german side , people fear that the financial risk is too high .
they 're also concerned that tourism would suffer during construction of the bridge and never recover .
instead , the area could just become a transit route .
in both countries , there are concerns that hundreds of jobs working at the ferry companies could disappear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bridge between sweden and denmark has been a boon to the region germany 's transport ministry is said to be examining the plans and consultations between officials in berlin and copenhagen continue .
the german government is expected to come to a decision in the next month or two .
jespersen was reluctant to speculate on the outcome .
he said he had begun to doubt whether the bridge project 's future would indeed be resolved sooner rather than later .
but he was optimistic about the future . " i 'm sure that in 10 or 20 years we will have decided it , " he said .
" it will be totally up to the germans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 04.02.2007 germany stalls prestigious bridge project with denmark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandinavia is anxious to see what berlin will decide the danish , swedish , norwegian governments and the european union say a bridge should connect the strait that separates germany and denmark near kiel .
but berlin seems to need convincing . uncertainty dominates any discussion about building a toll bridge across the 14-kilometer -lrb- nine-mile -rrb- fehmarn belt , as the strait between germany and southern denmark is called .
the project has been under discussion for 15 years , and one german chancellor after another has found a way to avoid it .
now , however , a decision could be imminent . hopes were high that it would be a subject when chancellor angela merkel and her danish colleague , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , met in december .
but the press was unable to pin her down after the talks .
" our decision must be made on a sound basis , " was all she would say .
symbolic value scandinavia is not short of links to what the nordic countries refer to as europe .
since completion of two major bridges in the last decade , travelers have been able to drive over land and bridges from sweden through denmark to germany .
ferries also shuttle traffic regularly between the countries .
they ply the fehmarn belt , between danish rodby and german puttgarden every half hour , a crossing that takes 45 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are concerned the fehmarn bridge could disturb nesting birds but when the lines get long at the ferry terminals during school vacations , the wait plus the journey can add up to an hour and a half .
and taking the land and bridge route through denmark to germany adds 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- to the journey south . the scandinavians see the bridge as an important connection to europe .
the route would complement the existing links to create a direct north-south highway corridor from oslo and stockholm to hamburg and other economic centers further south .
the european union has pinpointed the route as one of the priorities of its trans-european networks -lrb- ten -rrb- , which aim to bring the bloc 's regions closer together .
if the project comes together the eu could pay a quarter of the costs .
feasibility studies carried out by the german and danish authorities predicted that the traffic would quickly double to 8,000 cars , 1,000 heavy trucks and 4,000 train passengers daily even if the existing ferry lines remained in place , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote recently .
the missing link but the crucial issue is how to finance the project , which is expected to cost around 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- .
merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats decided in their 2005 coalition agreement to use the fehmarn bridge as an international model for a public-private partnership .
the idea favored by the danes and schleswig-holstein is that a danish-german group will finance the project with money earned on capital markets and be backed up by guarantees from the danish and german governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transport minister tiefensee -lrb- l . -rrb- and his danish colleague flemming hansen critics , however , fear that taxpayers will have to foot the bill in the end , according to danish transport expert per homann jespersen of the university of roskilde . " it 's spoken of by -lrb- danish -rrb- politicians as the missing link , " jespersen said .
" they do n't care so much that it 's financially sound . "
one of the models that supporters of the fehmarn project refer to is the highly symbolic oresund bridge , which connects sweden and denmark between the cities of malmo and copenhagen . the construction was initially deemed a financial flop .
fewer cars and trucks traversed the bridge than expected , opting instead to take longer but cheaper routes to cross the water .
" the oresund bridge is not a big success for long-distance traveling .
it 's a regional bridge , " jespersen said , adding that it had worked out in another way , namely by sparking a boom in the area .
regional growth last year around 16,000 vehicles crossed the bridge , twice as many as five years ago .
more than 20,000 passengers took the train across every day , an increase of 40 percent over the previous year . the bridge has made it much easier , and above all faster , for people to commute between the two countries than in the days when ferries connected the cities .
every 20 minutes , the train brings passengers from the danish to the swedish side in just 35 minutes .
swedes are attracted to the higher wages paid in denmark , while significantly lower property rates give many danes a financial incentive to move abroad . the danes are hopeful that a bridge over the fehmarn belt will bring them an economic boom , too .
it 's hard to imagine though that the rural region would replicate the success of the oresund area , where two important scandinavian cities are located .
still , politicians near rodby , a poorer part of denmark , have been lobbying hard for the project , as has the state government of schleswig-holstein , where fehmarn is located . looking ahead the locals are less enthusiastic .
on the german side , people fear that the financial risk is too high .
they 're also concerned that tourism would suffer during construction of the bridge and never recover .
instead , the area could just become a transit route .
in both countries , there are concerns that hundreds of jobs working at the ferry companies could disappear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bridge between sweden and denmark has been a boon to the region germany 's transport ministry is said to be examining the plans and consultations between officials in berlin and copenhagen continue .
the german government is expected to come to a decision in the next month or two .
jespersen was reluctant to speculate on the outcome .
he said he had begun to doubt whether the bridge project 's future would indeed be resolved sooner rather than later .
but he was optimistic about the future . " i 'm sure that in 10 or 20 years we will have decided it , " he said .
" it will be totally up to the germans .

the idea favored by the danes and schleswig-holstein is that a danish-german group will finance the project with money earned on capital markets and be backed up by guarantees from the danish and german governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transport minister tiefensee -lrb- l . -rrb- and his danish colleague flemming hansen critics , however , fear that taxpayers will have to foot the bill in the end , according to danish transport expert per homann jespersen of the university of roskilde . " it 's spoken of by -lrb- danish -rrb- politicians as the missing link , " jespersen said .
" they do n't care so much that it 's financially sound . "
one of the models that supporters of the fehmarn project refer to is the highly symbolic oresund bridge , which connects sweden and denmark between the cities of malmo and copenhagen . the construction was initially deemed a financial flop .
fewer cars and trucks traversed the bridge than expected , opting instead to take longer but cheaper routes to cross the water .
" the oresund bridge is not a big success for long-distance traveling .
it 's a regional bridge , " jespersen said , adding that it had worked out in another way , namely by sparking a boom in the area .
regional growth last year around 16,000 vehicles crossed the bridge , twice as many as five years ago .
more than 20,000 passengers took the train across every day , an increase of 40 percent over the previous year . the bridge has made it much easier , and above all faster , for people to commute between the two countries than in the days when ferries connected the cities .
every 20 minutes , the train brings passengers from the danish to the swedish side in just 35 minutes .
swedes are attracted to the higher wages paid in denmark , while significantly lower property rates give many danes a financial incentive to move abroad . the danes are hopeful that a bridge over the fehmarn belt will bring them an economic boom , too .
it 's hard to imagine though that the rural region would replicate the success of the oresund area , where two important scandinavian cities are located .
still , politicians near rodby , a poorer part of denmark , have been lobbying hard for the project , as has the state government of schleswig-holstein , where fehmarn is located . looking ahead the locals are less enthusiastic .
on the german side , people fear that the financial risk is too high .
they 're also concerned that tourism would suffer during construction of the bridge and never recover .
instead , the area could just become a transit route .
in both countries , there are concerns that hundreds of jobs working at the ferry companies could disappear .

jespersen was reluctant to speculate on the outcome .

but berlin seems to need convincing . uncertainty dominates any discussion about building a toll bridge across the 14-kilometer -lrb- nine-mile -rrb- fehmarn belt , as the strait between germany and southern denmark is called .
the project has been under discussion for 15 years , and one german chancellor after another has found a way to avoid it .
now , however , a decision could be imminent . hopes were high that it would be a subject when chancellor angela merkel and her danish colleague , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , met in december .
but the press was unable to pin her down after the talks .
" our decision must be made on a sound basis , " was all she would say .
symbolic value scandinavia is not short of links to what the nordic countries refer to as europe .
since completion of two major bridges in the last decade , travelers have been able to drive over land and bridges from sweden through denmark to germany .
ferries also shuttle traffic regularly between the countries .
they ply the fehmarn belt , between danish rodby and german puttgarden every half hour , a crossing that takes 45 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are concerned the fehmarn bridge could disturb nesting birds but when the lines get long at the ferry terminals during school vacations , the wait plus the journey can add up to an hour and a half .
and taking the land and bridge route through denmark to germany adds 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- to the journey south . the scandinavians see the bridge as an important connection to europe .
the route would complement the existing links to create a direct north-south highway corridor from oslo and stockholm to hamburg and other economic centers further south .
the european union has pinpointed the route as one of the priorities of its trans-european networks -lrb- ten -rrb- , which aim to bring the bloc 's regions closer together .
if the project comes together the eu could pay a quarter of the costs .
feasibility studies carried out by the german and danish authorities predicted that the traffic would quickly double to 8,000 cars , 1,000 heavy trucks and 4,000 train passengers daily even if the existing ferry lines remained in place , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote recently .
the missing link but the crucial issue is how to finance the project , which is expected to cost around 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- .
merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats decided in their 2005 coalition agreement to use the fehmarn bridge as an international model for a public-private partnership .

" there should not be different signals coming from different continents , " merkel told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while in egypt , merkel called for an end to violence in gaza a german official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said mussa " urged the europeans to play a big role in solving the middle east conflict , especially by pushing the americans to increase their involvement in the quartet . " the so-called quartet of major players - which includes russia , the united nations and the united states , as well as the european union - convened friday to revive their roadmap peace plan , which has made next to no progress since its launch nearly four years ago . mubarak : palestinian unity government forming during her meeting saturday with mubarak , merkel stressed the importance of an end to the violence between the palestinian governing movement hamas and the rival fatah party of abbas . mubarak announced that the formation of a unity government acceptable to western donors should be imminent .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest in gaza has overshadowed recent peace efforts egypt is the chief mediator in the palestinian crisis but has so far failed to clinch a deal for a unity cabinet , seen as a key step towards resuming international aid to the cash-strapped palestinians , who have not received western aid donations since march . conditions to lifting aid freeze merkel , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the european union , reiterated the west 's conditions for lifting the financial boycott . hamas has to recognize israel 's right to exist , renounce violence and accept past agreements with the jewish state , she said . hamas accused western countries of taking " decisions that ignore reality . "
fatah said it had hoped that " the oppressive siege on the palestinian people " would be lifted . firefights across gaza city sporadic gun battles between the rival factions rattled the streets of gaza city for a third straight morning sunday , despite a ceasefire declared by their leaders . however , the fighting was more subdued than in the past three days , when 28 palestinians were killed and around 260 wounded in some of the fiercest internecine bloodletting since the islamist hamas defeated fatah in elections last year . the german chancellor was also expected to discuss the political crisis in lebanon , the surge in sectarian violence in iraq , iran 's nuclear ambitions and efforts to end the four-year-old fighting in sudan 's darfur region . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier : cia arrest warrants wo n't hurt german-us ties warrants issued by a german court for 13 suspected cia operatives linked to the abduction of a german citizen will not harm relations , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was quoted as saying on saturday .

" there should not be different signals coming from different continents , " merkel told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while in egypt , merkel called for an end to violence in gaza a german official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said mussa " urged the europeans to play a big role in solving the middle east conflict , especially by pushing the americans to increase their involvement in the quartet . " the so-called quartet of major players - which includes russia , the united nations and the united states , as well as the european union - convened friday to revive their roadmap peace plan , which has made next to no progress since its launch nearly four years ago . mubarak : palestinian unity government forming during her meeting saturday with mubarak , merkel stressed the importance of an end to the violence between the palestinian governing movement hamas and the rival fatah party of abbas . mubarak announced that the formation of a unity government acceptable to western donors should be imminent .

" it is about to be finished , unless there are any surprises . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest in gaza has overshadowed recent peace efforts egypt is the chief mediator in the palestinian crisis but has so far failed to clinch a deal for a unity cabinet , seen as a key step towards resuming international aid to the cash-strapped palestinians , who have not received western aid donations since march . conditions to lifting aid freeze merkel , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the european union , reiterated the west 's conditions for lifting the financial boycott . hamas has to recognize israel 's right to exist , renounce violence and accept past agreements with the jewish state , she said . hamas accused western countries of taking " decisions that ignore reality . "
fatah said it had hoped that " the oppressive siege on the palestinian people " would be lifted . firefights across gaza city sporadic gun battles between the rival factions rattled the streets of gaza city for a third straight morning sunday , despite a ceasefire declared by their leaders . however , the fighting was more subdued than in the past three days , when 28 palestinians were killed and around 260 wounded in some of the fiercest internecine bloodletting since the islamist hamas defeated fatah in elections last year . the german chancellor was also expected to discuss the political crisis in lebanon , the surge in sectarian violence in iraq , iran 's nuclear ambitions and efforts to end the four-year-old fighting in sudan 's darfur region . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier : cia arrest warrants wo n't hurt german-us ties warrants issued by a german court for 13 suspected cia operatives linked to the abduction of a german citizen will not harm relations , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was quoted as saying on saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 04.02.2007 germany stalls prestigious bridge project with denmark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandinavia is anxious to see what berlin will decide the danish , swedish , norwegian governments and the european union say a bridge should connect the strait that separates germany and denmark near kiel .
but berlin seems to need convincing . uncertainty dominates any discussion about building a toll bridge across the 14-kilometer -lrb- nine-mile -rrb- fehmarn belt , as the strait between germany and southern denmark is called .
the project has been under discussion for 15 years , and one german chancellor after another has found a way to avoid it .
now , however , a decision could be imminent . hopes were high that it would be a subject when chancellor angela merkel and her danish colleague , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , met in december .
but the press was unable to pin her down after the talks .
" our decision must be made on a sound basis , " was all she would say .
symbolic value scandinavia is not short of links to what the nordic countries refer to as europe .
since completion of two major bridges in the last decade , travelers have been able to drive over land and bridges from sweden through denmark to germany .
ferries also shuttle traffic regularly between the countries .
they ply the fehmarn belt , between danish rodby and german puttgarden every half hour , a crossing that takes 45 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are concerned the fehmarn bridge could disturb nesting birds but when the lines get long at the ferry terminals during school vacations , the wait plus the journey can add up to an hour and a half .
and taking the land and bridge route through denmark to germany adds 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- to the journey south . the scandinavians see the bridge as an important connection to europe .
the route would complement the existing links to create a direct north-south highway corridor from oslo and stockholm to hamburg and other economic centers further south .
the european union has pinpointed the route as one of the priorities of its trans-european networks -lrb- ten -rrb- , which aim to bring the bloc 's regions closer together .
if the project comes together the eu could pay a quarter of the costs .
feasibility studies carried out by the german and danish authorities predicted that the traffic would quickly double to 8,000 cars , 1,000 heavy trucks and 4,000 train passengers daily even if the existing ferry lines remained in place , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote recently .
the missing link but the crucial issue is how to finance the project , which is expected to cost around 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- .
merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats decided in their 2005 coalition agreement to use the fehmarn bridge as an international model for a public-private partnership .
the idea favored by the danes and schleswig-holstein is that a danish-german group will finance the project with money earned on capital markets and be backed up by guarantees from the danish and german governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transport minister tiefensee -lrb- l . -rrb- and his danish colleague flemming hansen critics , however , fear that taxpayers will have to foot the bill in the end , according to danish transport expert per homann jespersen of the university of roskilde . " it 's spoken of by -lrb- danish -rrb- politicians as the missing link , " jespersen said .
" they do n't care so much that it 's financially sound . "
one of the models that supporters of the fehmarn project refer to is the highly symbolic oresund bridge , which connects sweden and denmark between the cities of malmo and copenhagen . the construction was initially deemed a financial flop .
fewer cars and trucks traversed the bridge than expected , opting instead to take longer but cheaper routes to cross the water .
" the oresund bridge is not a big success for long-distance traveling .
it 's a regional bridge , " jespersen said , adding that it had worked out in another way , namely by sparking a boom in the area .
regional growth last year around 16,000 vehicles crossed the bridge , twice as many as five years ago .
more than 20,000 passengers took the train across every day , an increase of 40 percent over the previous year . the bridge has made it much easier , and above all faster , for people to commute between the two countries than in the days when ferries connected the cities .
every 20 minutes , the train brings passengers from the danish to the swedish side in just 35 minutes .
swedes are attracted to the higher wages paid in denmark , while significantly lower property rates give many danes a financial incentive to move abroad . the danes are hopeful that a bridge over the fehmarn belt will bring them an economic boom , too .
it 's hard to imagine though that the rural region would replicate the success of the oresund area , where two important scandinavian cities are located .
still , politicians near rodby , a poorer part of denmark , have been lobbying hard for the project , as has the state government of schleswig-holstein , where fehmarn is located . looking ahead the locals are less enthusiastic .
on the german side , people fear that the financial risk is too high .
they 're also concerned that tourism would suffer during construction of the bridge and never recover .
instead , the area could just become a transit route .
in both countries , there are concerns that hundreds of jobs working at the ferry companies could disappear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bridge between sweden and denmark has been a boon to the region germany 's transport ministry is said to be examining the plans and consultations between officials in berlin and copenhagen continue .
the german government is expected to come to a decision in the next month or two .
jespersen was reluctant to speculate on the outcome .
he said he had begun to doubt whether the bridge project 's future would indeed be resolved sooner rather than later .
but he was optimistic about the future . " i 'm sure that in 10 or 20 years we will have decided it , " he said .
" it will be totally up to the germans .

but berlin seems to need convincing . uncertainty dominates any discussion about building a toll bridge across the 14-kilometer -lrb- nine-mile -rrb- fehmarn belt , as the strait between germany and southern denmark is called .
the project has been under discussion for 15 years , and one german chancellor after another has found a way to avoid it .
now , however , a decision could be imminent . hopes were high that it would be a subject when chancellor angela merkel and her danish colleague , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , met in december .
but the press was unable to pin her down after the talks .
" our decision must be made on a sound basis , " was all she would say .
symbolic value scandinavia is not short of links to what the nordic countries refer to as europe .
since completion of two major bridges in the last decade , travelers have been able to drive over land and bridges from sweden through denmark to germany .
ferries also shuttle traffic regularly between the countries .
they ply the fehmarn belt , between danish rodby and german puttgarden every half hour , a crossing that takes 45 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are concerned the fehmarn bridge could disturb nesting birds but when the lines get long at the ferry terminals during school vacations , the wait plus the journey can add up to an hour and a half .
and taking the land and bridge route through denmark to germany adds 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- to the journey south . the scandinavians see the bridge as an important connection to europe .
the route would complement the existing links to create a direct north-south highway corridor from oslo and stockholm to hamburg and other economic centers further south .
the european union has pinpointed the route as one of the priorities of its trans-european networks -lrb- ten -rrb- , which aim to bring the bloc 's regions closer together .
if the project comes together the eu could pay a quarter of the costs .
feasibility studies carried out by the german and danish authorities predicted that the traffic would quickly double to 8,000 cars , 1,000 heavy trucks and 4,000 train passengers daily even if the existing ferry lines remained in place , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote recently .
the missing link but the crucial issue is how to finance the project , which is expected to cost around 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- .
merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats decided in their 2005 coalition agreement to use the fehmarn bridge as an international model for a public-private partnership .
the idea favored by the danes and schleswig-holstein is that a danish-german group will finance the project with money earned on capital markets and be backed up by guarantees from the danish and german governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transport minister tiefensee -lrb- l . -rrb- and his danish colleague flemming hansen critics , however , fear that taxpayers will have to foot the bill in the end , according to danish transport expert per homann jespersen of the university of roskilde . " it 's spoken of by -lrb- danish -rrb- politicians as the missing link , " jespersen said .
" they do n't care so much that it 's financially sound . "
one of the models that supporters of the fehmarn project refer to is the highly symbolic oresund bridge , which connects sweden and denmark between the cities of malmo and copenhagen . the construction was initially deemed a financial flop .
fewer cars and trucks traversed the bridge than expected , opting instead to take longer but cheaper routes to cross the water .
" the oresund bridge is not a big success for long-distance traveling .
it 's a regional bridge , " jespersen said , adding that it had worked out in another way , namely by sparking a boom in the area .
regional growth last year around 16,000 vehicles crossed the bridge , twice as many as five years ago .
more than 20,000 passengers took the train across every day , an increase of 40 percent over the previous year . the bridge has made it much easier , and above all faster , for people to commute between the two countries than in the days when ferries connected the cities .
every 20 minutes , the train brings passengers from the danish to the swedish side in just 35 minutes .
swedes are attracted to the higher wages paid in denmark , while significantly lower property rates give many danes a financial incentive to move abroad . the danes are hopeful that a bridge over the fehmarn belt will bring them an economic boom , too .
it 's hard to imagine though that the rural region would replicate the success of the oresund area , where two important scandinavian cities are located .
still , politicians near rodby , a poorer part of denmark , have been lobbying hard for the project , as has the state government of schleswig-holstein , where fehmarn is located . looking ahead the locals are less enthusiastic .
on the german side , people fear that the financial risk is too high .
they 're also concerned that tourism would suffer during construction of the bridge and never recover .
instead , the area could just become a transit route .
in both countries , there are concerns that hundreds of jobs working at the ferry companies could disappear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bridge between sweden and denmark has been a boon to the region germany 's transport ministry is said to be examining the plans and consultations between officials in berlin and copenhagen continue .
the german government is expected to come to a decision in the next month or two .
jespersen was reluctant to speculate on the outcome .
he said he had begun to doubt whether the bridge project 's future would indeed be resolved sooner rather than later .
but he was optimistic about the future . " i 'm sure that in 10 or 20 years we will have decided it , " he said .
" it will be totally up to the germans .

now , a unique travel agency aims to improve ties between the neighbors . julia gerstenberg and jacqueline nießer have their work cut out for them . sitting in a little office in frankfurt on the oder river in eastern germany , which should not to be confused with the financial hub frankfurt on the main river in the west , the pair is surround by maps of poland , history books and dictionaries .
the scent of freshly brewed coffee and polish waffles wafts through the air . gerstenberg is trying to decipher an old map , while nießer answers questions on the telephone . researching roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heimatreise 's founders graduated from viadrina university each day , their small agency heimatreise , roughly translated as " trip home , " receives dozens of calls .
gerstenberg and nießer have made it their job to research family histories and organize trips for ethnic germans , and their descendents , who were expelled from poland at the end of world war ii and beyond . eight german and eight polish students attending the city 's europa university viadrina founded the travel agency in 2002 . nießer said heimatreise was established when relations between germany and poland were particularly tense . " we wondered what we in frankfurt / oder , on the german-polish border , could do on a small scale to ease the tensions on a human level , " she said . a look back at the time of heimatreise 's founding , the prussian trust organization , which represents the families of expropriated and resettled germans , had been launching lawsuits in poland for the return of lost property . at the end of world war ii , some 12 million germans were killed or expelled from central europe as the german and polish borders were being redrawn by the allies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 12 million germans were expelled from central europe after wwii some expelled germans and their descendents want poland to admit to wrongdoings at the end of the war , while others want to reclaim their former homes . many poles , for their part , are resentful of the demands in light of the nazi invasion in 1939 and the millions ' of deaths that ensued . bridging the gap that 's where heimatreise 's work comes in : to bridge the gap in a very sensitive area .
all of the agency 's workers volunteer their time and have so far organized around 10 trips to pomerania , the area surrounding lebus and the neumark . some people book trips to celebrate a significant birthday .
sons and daughters often want to treat their parents to a trip " back home " and choose to accompany them . " that 's important because we do n't want to stir up history , but rather , use to as a point of departure to talk about modern poland and its people , " said nießer . detective work heimatreise workers also said they see themselves as travel guides and detectives in one . often they have only a few clues to get started with when trying to track down a family 's history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the war , mainly germans lived in gdansk in northern poland detlef mielke showed up at the agency with just a few yellowed photographs and a vague notion of significant family dates and a few stories he remembered hearing from his father . " i wanted to go and see where my family 's from , " he said .
" everyone wants to know where they come from . " but the meager information turned out to be enough for the agency 's workers and a trip was booked for the 69-year-old to visit his ancestors former home . nießer , however , warns of having high expectations .
reality is not always as colorful as the pictures parents or grandparents may have painted of their origins . across borders and generations dialogue and exchange occur not just between two cultures but also between generations . mielke said he now visits the heimatreise office regularly because it 's like a " shot of energy " for him . he 's also started learning polish and is planning more trips to the other side of the oder . aygül cizmecioglu -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : german-polish summit breaks the ice both germany and poland can be pleased with the thaw in relations as a result of polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's recent visit to berlin , says dw 's hubert wohlan .

" there should not be different signals coming from different continents , " merkel told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while in egypt , merkel called for an end to violence in gaza a german official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said mussa " urged the europeans to play a big role in solving the middle east conflict , especially by pushing the americans to increase their involvement in the quartet . " the so-called quartet of major players - which includes russia , the united nations and the united states , as well as the european union - convened friday to revive their roadmap peace plan , which has made next to no progress since its launch nearly four years ago . mubarak : palestinian unity government forming during her meeting saturday with mubarak , merkel stressed the importance of an end to the violence between the palestinian governing movement hamas and the rival fatah party of abbas . mubarak announced that the formation of a unity government acceptable to western donors should be imminent .

" there should not be different signals coming from different continents , " merkel told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while in egypt , merkel called for an end to violence in gaza a german official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said mussa " urged the europeans to play a big role in solving the middle east conflict , especially by pushing the americans to increase their involvement in the quartet . " the so-called quartet of major players - which includes russia , the united nations and the united states , as well as the european union - convened friday to revive their roadmap peace plan , which has made next to no progress since its launch nearly four years ago . mubarak : palestinian unity government forming during her meeting saturday with mubarak , merkel stressed the importance of an end to the violence between the palestinian governing movement hamas and the rival fatah party of abbas . mubarak announced that the formation of a unity government acceptable to western donors should be imminent . " we are working toward a national unity government , " he told reporters after the meeting .
" it is about to be finished , unless there are any surprises . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest in gaza has overshadowed recent peace efforts egypt is the chief mediator in the palestinian crisis but has so far failed to clinch a deal for a unity cabinet , seen as a key step towards resuming international aid to the cash-strapped palestinians , who have not received western aid donations since march . conditions to lifting aid freeze merkel , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the european union , reiterated the west 's conditions for lifting the financial boycott . hamas has to recognize israel 's right to exist , renounce violence and accept past agreements with the jewish state , she said . hamas accused western countries of taking " decisions that ignore reality . "
fatah said it had hoped that " the oppressive siege on the palestinian people " would be lifted . firefights across gaza city sporadic gun battles between the rival factions rattled the streets of gaza city for a third straight morning sunday , despite a ceasefire declared by their leaders . however , the fighting was more subdued than in the past three days , when 28 palestinians were killed and around 260 wounded in some of the fiercest internecine bloodletting since the islamist hamas defeated fatah in elections last year . the german chancellor was also expected to discuss the political crisis in lebanon , the surge in sectarian violence in iraq , iran 's nuclear ambitions and efforts to end the four-year-old fighting in sudan 's darfur region . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier : cia arrest warrants wo n't hurt german-us ties warrants issued by a german court for 13 suspected cia operatives linked to the abduction of a german citizen will not harm relations , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was quoted as saying on saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 04.02.2007 germany stalls prestigious bridge project with denmark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandinavia is anxious to see what berlin will decide the danish , swedish , norwegian governments and the european union say a bridge should connect the strait that separates germany and denmark near kiel .
but berlin seems to need convincing . uncertainty dominates any discussion about building a toll bridge across the 14-kilometer -lrb- nine-mile -rrb- fehmarn belt , as the strait between germany and southern denmark is called .
the project has been under discussion for 15 years , and one german chancellor after another has found a way to avoid it .
now , however , a decision could be imminent . hopes were high that it would be a subject when chancellor angela merkel and her danish colleague , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , met in december .
but the press was unable to pin her down after the talks .
" our decision must be made on a sound basis , " was all she would say .
symbolic value scandinavia is not short of links to what the nordic countries refer to as europe .
since completion of two major bridges in the last decade , travelers have been able to drive over land and bridges from sweden through denmark to germany .
ferries also shuttle traffic regularly between the countries .
they ply the fehmarn belt , between danish rodby and german puttgarden every half hour , a crossing that takes 45 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are concerned the fehmarn bridge could disturb nesting birds but when the lines get long at the ferry terminals during school vacations , the wait plus the journey can add up to an hour and a half .
and taking the land and bridge route through denmark to germany adds 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- to the journey south . the scandinavians see the bridge as an important connection to europe .
the route would complement the existing links to create a direct north-south highway corridor from oslo and stockholm to hamburg and other economic centers further south .
the european union has pinpointed the route as one of the priorities of its trans-european networks -lrb- ten -rrb- , which aim to bring the bloc 's regions closer together .
if the project comes together the eu could pay a quarter of the costs .
feasibility studies carried out by the german and danish authorities predicted that the traffic would quickly double to 8,000 cars , 1,000 heavy trucks and 4,000 train passengers daily even if the existing ferry lines remained in place , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote recently .
the missing link but the crucial issue is how to finance the project , which is expected to cost around 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- .
merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats decided in their 2005 coalition agreement to use the fehmarn bridge as an international model for a public-private partnership .
the idea favored by the danes and schleswig-holstein is that a danish-german group will finance the project with money earned on capital markets and be backed up by guarantees from the danish and german governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transport minister tiefensee -lrb- l . -rrb- and his danish colleague flemming hansen critics , however , fear that taxpayers will have to foot the bill in the end , according to danish transport expert per homann jespersen of the university of roskilde . " it 's spoken of by -lrb- danish -rrb- politicians as the missing link , " jespersen said .
" they do n't care so much that it 's financially sound . "
one of the models that supporters of the fehmarn project refer to is the highly symbolic oresund bridge , which connects sweden and denmark between the cities of malmo and copenhagen . the construction was initially deemed a financial flop .
fewer cars and trucks traversed the bridge than expected , opting instead to take longer but cheaper routes to cross the water .
" the oresund bridge is not a big success for long-distance traveling .
it 's a regional bridge , " jespersen said , adding that it had worked out in another way , namely by sparking a boom in the area .
regional growth last year around 16,000 vehicles crossed the bridge , twice as many as five years ago .
more than 20,000 passengers took the train across every day , an increase of 40 percent over the previous year . the bridge has made it much easier , and above all faster , for people to commute between the two countries than in the days when ferries connected the cities .
every 20 minutes , the train brings passengers from the danish to the swedish side in just 35 minutes .
swedes are attracted to the higher wages paid in denmark , while significantly lower property rates give many danes a financial incentive to move abroad . the danes are hopeful that a bridge over the fehmarn belt will bring them an economic boom , too .
it 's hard to imagine though that the rural region would replicate the success of the oresund area , where two important scandinavian cities are located .
still , politicians near rodby , a poorer part of denmark , have been lobbying hard for the project , as has the state government of schleswig-holstein , where fehmarn is located . looking ahead the locals are less enthusiastic .
on the german side , people fear that the financial risk is too high .
they 're also concerned that tourism would suffer during construction of the bridge and never recover .
instead , the area could just become a transit route .
in both countries , there are concerns that hundreds of jobs working at the ferry companies could disappear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bridge between sweden and denmark has been a boon to the region germany 's transport ministry is said to be examining the plans and consultations between officials in berlin and copenhagen continue .
the german government is expected to come to a decision in the next month or two .
jespersen was reluctant to speculate on the outcome .
he said he had begun to doubt whether the bridge project 's future would indeed be resolved sooner rather than later .
but he was optimistic about the future . " i 'm sure that in 10 or 20 years we will have decided it , " he said .
" it will be totally up to the germans .

now , a unique travel agency aims to improve ties between the neighbors . julia gerstenberg and jacqueline nießer have their work cut out for them . sitting in a little office in frankfurt on the oder river in eastern germany , which should not to be confused with the financial hub frankfurt on the main river in the west , the pair is surround by maps of poland , history books and dictionaries .
the scent of freshly brewed coffee and polish waffles wafts through the air . gerstenberg is trying to decipher an old map , while nießer answers questions on the telephone . researching roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heimatreise 's founders graduated from viadrina university each day , their small agency heimatreise , roughly translated as " trip home , " receives dozens of calls .
gerstenberg and nießer have made it their job to research family histories and organize trips for ethnic germans , and their descendents , who were expelled from poland at the end of world war ii and beyond . eight german and eight polish students attending the city 's europa university viadrina founded the travel agency in 2002 . nießer said heimatreise was established when relations between germany and poland were particularly tense . " we wondered what we in frankfurt / oder , on the german-polish border , could do on a small scale to ease the tensions on a human level , " she said . a look back at the time of heimatreise 's founding , the prussian trust organization , which represents the families of expropriated and resettled germans , had been launching lawsuits in poland for the return of lost property . at the end of world war ii , some 12 million germans were killed or expelled from central europe as the german and polish borders were being redrawn by the allies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 12 million germans were expelled from central europe after wwii some expelled germans and their descendents want poland to admit to wrongdoings at the end of the war , while others want to reclaim their former homes . many poles , for their part , are resentful of the demands in light of the nazi invasion in 1939 and the millions ' of deaths that ensued . bridging the gap that 's where heimatreise 's work comes in : to bridge the gap in a very sensitive area .

now , a unique travel agency aims to improve ties between the neighbors . julia gerstenberg and jacqueline nießer have their work cut out for them . sitting in a little office in frankfurt on the oder river in eastern germany , which should not to be confused with the financial hub frankfurt on the main river in the west , the pair is surround by maps of poland , history books and dictionaries .
the scent of freshly brewed coffee and polish waffles wafts through the air . gerstenberg is trying to decipher an old map , while nießer answers questions on the telephone . researching roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heimatreise 's founders graduated from viadrina university each day , their small agency heimatreise , roughly translated as " trip home , " receives dozens of calls .
gerstenberg and nießer have made it their job to research family histories and organize trips for ethnic germans , and their descendents , who were expelled from poland at the end of world war ii and beyond . eight german and eight polish students attending the city 's europa university viadrina founded the travel agency in 2002 . nießer said heimatreise was established when relations between germany and poland were particularly tense . " we wondered what we in frankfurt / oder , on the german-polish border , could do on a small scale to ease the tensions on a human level , " she said . a look back at the time of heimatreise 's founding , the prussian trust organization , which represents the families of expropriated and resettled germans , had been launching lawsuits in poland for the return of lost property . at the end of world war ii , some 12 million germans were killed or expelled from central europe as the german and polish borders were being redrawn by the allies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 12 million germans were expelled from central europe after wwii some expelled germans and their descendents want poland to admit to wrongdoings at the end of the war , while others want to reclaim their former homes . many poles , for their part , are resentful of the demands in light of the nazi invasion in 1939 and the millions ' of deaths that ensued . bridging the gap that 's where heimatreise 's work comes in : to bridge the gap in a very sensitive area .
all of the agency 's workers volunteer their time and have so far organized around 10 trips to pomerania , the area surrounding lebus and the neumark . some people book trips to celebrate a significant birthday .
sons and daughters often want to treat their parents to a trip " back home " and choose to accompany them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 04.02.2007 germany stalls prestigious bridge project with denmark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandinavia is anxious to see what berlin will decide the danish , swedish , norwegian governments and the european union say a bridge should connect the strait that separates germany and denmark near kiel .
but berlin seems to need convincing . uncertainty dominates any discussion about building a toll bridge across the 14-kilometer -lrb- nine-mile -rrb- fehmarn belt , as the strait between germany and southern denmark is called .
the project has been under discussion for 15 years , and one german chancellor after another has found a way to avoid it .
now , however , a decision could be imminent . hopes were high that it would be a subject when chancellor angela merkel and her danish colleague , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , met in december .
but the press was unable to pin her down after the talks .
" our decision must be made on a sound basis , " was all she would say .
symbolic value scandinavia is not short of links to what the nordic countries refer to as europe .
since completion of two major bridges in the last decade , travelers have been able to drive over land and bridges from sweden through denmark to germany .
ferries also shuttle traffic regularly between the countries .
they ply the fehmarn belt , between danish rodby and german puttgarden every half hour , a crossing that takes 45 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are concerned the fehmarn bridge could disturb nesting birds but when the lines get long at the ferry terminals during school vacations , the wait plus the journey can add up to an hour and a half .
and taking the land and bridge route through denmark to germany adds 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- to the journey south . the scandinavians see the bridge as an important connection to europe .
the route would complement the existing links to create a direct north-south highway corridor from oslo and stockholm to hamburg and other economic centers further south .
the european union has pinpointed the route as one of the priorities of its trans-european networks -lrb- ten -rrb- , which aim to bring the bloc 's regions closer together .
if the project comes together the eu could pay a quarter of the costs .
feasibility studies carried out by the german and danish authorities predicted that the traffic would quickly double to 8,000 cars , 1,000 heavy trucks and 4,000 train passengers daily even if the existing ferry lines remained in place , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote recently .
the missing link but the crucial issue is how to finance the project , which is expected to cost around 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- .
merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats decided in their 2005 coalition agreement to use the fehmarn bridge as an international model for a public-private partnership .
the idea favored by the danes and schleswig-holstein is that a danish-german group will finance the project with money earned on capital markets and be backed up by guarantees from the danish and german governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transport minister tiefensee -lrb- l . -rrb- and his danish colleague flemming hansen critics , however , fear that taxpayers will have to foot the bill in the end , according to danish transport expert per homann jespersen of the university of roskilde . " it 's spoken of by -lrb- danish -rrb- politicians as the missing link , " jespersen said .
" they do n't care so much that it 's financially sound . "
one of the models that supporters of the fehmarn project refer to is the highly symbolic oresund bridge , which connects sweden and denmark between the cities of malmo and copenhagen . the construction was initially deemed a financial flop .
fewer cars and trucks traversed the bridge than expected , opting instead to take longer but cheaper routes to cross the water .
" the oresund bridge is not a big success for long-distance traveling .
it 's a regional bridge , " jespersen said , adding that it had worked out in another way , namely by sparking a boom in the area .
regional growth last year around 16,000 vehicles crossed the bridge , twice as many as five years ago .
more than 20,000 passengers took the train across every day , an increase of 40 percent over the previous year . the bridge has made it much easier , and above all faster , for people to commute between the two countries than in the days when ferries connected the cities .
every 20 minutes , the train brings passengers from the danish to the swedish side in just 35 minutes .
swedes are attracted to the higher wages paid in denmark , while significantly lower property rates give many danes a financial incentive to move abroad . the danes are hopeful that a bridge over the fehmarn belt will bring them an economic boom , too .
it 's hard to imagine though that the rural region would replicate the success of the oresund area , where two important scandinavian cities are located .
still , politicians near rodby , a poorer part of denmark , have been lobbying hard for the project , as has the state government of schleswig-holstein , where fehmarn is located . looking ahead the locals are less enthusiastic .
on the german side , people fear that the financial risk is too high .
they 're also concerned that tourism would suffer during construction of the bridge and never recover .
instead , the area could just become a transit route .
in both countries , there are concerns that hundreds of jobs working at the ferry companies could disappear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bridge between sweden and denmark has been a boon to the region germany 's transport ministry is said to be examining the plans and consultations between officials in berlin and copenhagen continue .
the german government is expected to come to a decision in the next month or two .
jespersen was reluctant to speculate on the outcome .
he said he had begun to doubt whether the bridge project 's future would indeed be resolved sooner rather than later .
but he was optimistic about the future . " i 'm sure that in 10 or 20 years we will have decided it , " he said .
" it will be totally up to the germans .

the missing link but the crucial issue is how to finance the project , which is expected to cost around 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- .
merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats decided in their 2005 coalition agreement to use the fehmarn bridge as an international model for a public-private partnership .
the idea favored by the danes and schleswig-holstein is that a danish-german group will finance the project with money earned on capital markets and be backed up by guarantees from the danish and german governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transport minister tiefensee -lrb- l . -rrb- and his danish colleague flemming hansen critics , however , fear that taxpayers will have to foot the bill in the end , according to danish transport expert per homann jespersen of the university of roskilde . " it 's spoken of by -lrb- danish -rrb- politicians as the missing link , " jespersen said .
" they do n't care so much that it 's financially sound . "
one of the models that supporters of the fehmarn project refer to is the highly symbolic oresund bridge , which connects sweden and denmark between the cities of malmo and copenhagen . the construction was initially deemed a financial flop .
fewer cars and trucks traversed the bridge than expected , opting instead to take longer but cheaper routes to cross the water .
" the oresund bridge is not a big success for long-distance traveling .
it 's a regional bridge , " jespersen said , adding that it had worked out in another way , namely by sparking a boom in the area .
regional growth last year around 16,000 vehicles crossed the bridge , twice as many as five years ago .
more than 20,000 passengers took the train across every day , an increase of 40 percent over the previous year . the bridge has made it much easier , and above all faster , for people to commute between the two countries than in the days when ferries connected the cities .
every 20 minutes , the train brings passengers from the danish to the swedish side in just 35 minutes .
swedes are attracted to the higher wages paid in denmark , while significantly lower property rates give many danes a financial incentive to move abroad . the danes are hopeful that a bridge over the fehmarn belt will bring them an economic boom , too .
it 's hard to imagine though that the rural region would replicate the success of the oresund area , where two important scandinavian cities are located .
still , politicians near rodby , a poorer part of denmark , have been lobbying hard for the project , as has the state government of schleswig-holstein , where fehmarn is located . looking ahead the locals are less enthusiastic .
on the german side , people fear that the financial risk is too high .
they 're also concerned that tourism would suffer during construction of the bridge and never recover .
instead , the area could just become a transit route .
in both countries , there are concerns that hundreds of jobs working at the ferry companies could disappear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bridge between sweden and denmark has been a boon to the region germany 's transport ministry is said to be examining the plans and consultations between officials in berlin and copenhagen continue .
the german government is expected to come to a decision in the next month or two .
jespersen was reluctant to speculate on the outcome .
he said he had begun to doubt whether the bridge project 's future would indeed be resolved sooner rather than later .
but he was optimistic about the future . " i 'm sure that in 10 or 20 years we will have decided it , " he said .

but berlin seems to need convincing . uncertainty dominates any discussion about building a toll bridge across the 14-kilometer -lrb- nine-mile -rrb- fehmarn belt , as the strait between germany and southern denmark is called .
the project has been under discussion for 15 years , and one german chancellor after another has found a way to avoid it .
now , however , a decision could be imminent . hopes were high that it would be a subject when chancellor angela merkel and her danish colleague , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , met in december .
but the press was unable to pin her down after the talks .
" our decision must be made on a sound basis , " was all she would say .
symbolic value scandinavia is not short of links to what the nordic countries refer to as europe .
since completion of two major bridges in the last decade , travelers have been able to drive over land and bridges from sweden through denmark to germany .
ferries also shuttle traffic regularly between the countries .
they ply the fehmarn belt , between danish rodby and german puttgarden every half hour , a crossing that takes 45 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are concerned the fehmarn bridge could disturb nesting birds but when the lines get long at the ferry terminals during school vacations , the wait plus the journey can add up to an hour and a half .
and taking the land and bridge route through denmark to germany adds 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- to the journey south . the scandinavians see the bridge as an important connection to europe .
the route would complement the existing links to create a direct north-south highway corridor from oslo and stockholm to hamburg and other economic centers further south .
the european union has pinpointed the route as one of the priorities of its trans-european networks -lrb- ten -rrb- , which aim to bring the bloc 's regions closer together .
if the project comes together the eu could pay a quarter of the costs .
feasibility studies carried out by the german and danish authorities predicted that the traffic would quickly double to 8,000 cars , 1,000 heavy trucks and 4,000 train passengers daily even if the existing ferry lines remained in place , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote recently .

" germany , which currently holds the rotating european union presidency , has said the environment is one of its priorities . yet it opposes a number of recent proposals by the european to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases , including plans to cut carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions from new cars and impose an emissions quota for 2008-2012 . " if germany drags its feet , the rest of europe will do the same , " dimas said .
" and if europe does n't take part , then the world wo n't either .
in that case , we might as well all pack our bags . " nations " hide " behind german inaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a un report this week said much of climate change is man made the commissioner said other european nations , such as britain and sweden , were close to achieving their targets for curbing emissions of greenhouse gases under the kyoto protocol on global warming .
yet " others hide behind germany 's example . " eu proposals to reduce co2 emissions to an average 120 grams per kilometer are not popular in germany , where many of the automobile industry 's best selling luxury cars are among the worst polluters . auto industry on board but bernd gottschalk , president of the german association of the automotive industry , said his organization was interested in investing billions into ways to reduce green house gasses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an auto industry official said carmakers would invest billions in cutting greenhouse gasses " the german automobile industry will significantly and constructively contribute to the process and do it by investing billions , " he wrote in saturday 's stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . slowing down the autobahn ? in a separate interview in the bild am sonntag , german chancellor angela merkel , said she was opposed to a general speed limit being imposed on germany 's highways . " i do n't think the question of a general speed limit arises , " she said .
" lots of highways have limits and lane controls .
these contribute to the fight against global warming . " the idea of imposing speed limits has been raised recently by the german environment agency , which called for a renewed debate on speed limits on germany 's autobahns .
though some have restrictions , many have no top speed limit .

" there should not be different signals coming from different continents , " merkel told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while in egypt , merkel called for an end to violence in gaza a german official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said mussa " urged the europeans to play a big role in solving the middle east conflict , especially by pushing the americans to increase their involvement in the quartet . " the so-called quartet of major players - which includes russia , the united nations and the united states , as well as the european union - convened friday to revive their roadmap peace plan , which has made next to no progress since its launch nearly four years ago . mubarak : palestinian unity government forming during her meeting saturday with mubarak , merkel stressed the importance of an end to the violence between the palestinian governing movement hamas and the rival fatah party of abbas . mubarak announced that the formation of a unity government acceptable to western donors should be imminent . " we are working toward a national unity government , " he told reporters after the meeting .
" it is about to be finished , unless there are any surprises . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unrest in gaza has overshadowed recent peace efforts egypt is the chief mediator in the palestinian crisis but has so far failed to clinch a deal for a unity cabinet , seen as a key step towards resuming international aid to the cash-strapped palestinians , who have not received western aid donations since march . conditions to lifting aid freeze merkel , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the european union , reiterated the west 's conditions for lifting the financial boycott . hamas has to recognize israel 's right to exist , renounce violence and accept past agreements with the jewish state , she said . hamas accused western countries of taking " decisions that ignore reality . "
fatah said it had hoped that " the oppressive siege on the palestinian people " would be lifted . firefights across gaza city sporadic gun battles between the rival factions rattled the streets of gaza city for a third straight morning sunday , despite a ceasefire declared by their leaders . however , the fighting was more subdued than in the past three days , when 28 palestinians were killed and around 260 wounded in some of the fiercest internecine bloodletting since the islamist hamas defeated fatah in elections last year . the german chancellor was also expected to discuss the political crisis in lebanon , the surge in sectarian violence in iraq , iran 's nuclear ambitions and efforts to end the four-year-old fighting in sudan 's darfur region . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier : cia arrest warrants wo n't hurt german-us ties warrants issued by a german court for 13 suspected cia operatives linked to the abduction of a german citizen will not harm relations , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was quoted as saying on saturday .

now , a unique travel agency aims to improve ties between the neighbors . julia gerstenberg and jacqueline nießer have their work cut out for them . sitting in a little office in frankfurt on the oder river in eastern germany , which should not to be confused with the financial hub frankfurt on the main river in the west , the pair is surround by maps of poland , history books and dictionaries .
the scent of freshly brewed coffee and polish waffles wafts through the air . gerstenberg is trying to decipher an old map , while nießer answers questions on the telephone . researching roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heimatreise 's founders graduated from viadrina university each day , their small agency heimatreise , roughly translated as " trip home , " receives dozens of calls .
gerstenberg and nießer have made it their job to research family histories and organize trips for ethnic germans , and their descendents , who were expelled from poland at the end of world war ii and beyond . eight german and eight polish students attending the city 's europa university viadrina founded the travel agency in 2002 . nießer said heimatreise was established when relations between germany and poland were particularly tense . " we wondered what we in frankfurt / oder , on the german-polish border , could do on a small scale to ease the tensions on a human level , " she said . a look back at the time of heimatreise 's founding , the prussian trust organization , which represents the families of expropriated and resettled germans , had been launching lawsuits in poland for the return of lost property . at the end of world war ii , some 12 million germans were killed or expelled from central europe as the german and polish borders were being redrawn by the allies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 12 million germans were expelled from central europe after wwii some expelled germans and their descendents want poland to admit to wrongdoings at the end of the war , while others want to reclaim their former homes . many poles , for their part , are resentful of the demands in light of the nazi invasion in 1939 and the millions ' of deaths that ensued . bridging the gap that 's where heimatreise 's work comes in : to bridge the gap in a very sensitive area .
all of the agency 's workers volunteer their time and have so far organized around 10 trips to pomerania , the area surrounding lebus and the neumark . some people book trips to celebrate a significant birthday .
sons and daughters often want to treat their parents to a trip " back home " and choose to accompany them . " that 's important because we do n't want to stir up history , but rather , use to as a point of departure to talk about modern poland and its people , " said nießer . detective work heimatreise workers also said they see themselves as travel guides and detectives in one . often they have only a few clues to get started with when trying to track down a family 's history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the war , mainly germans lived in gdansk in northern poland detlef mielke showed up at the agency with just a few yellowed photographs and a vague notion of significant family dates and a few stories he remembered hearing from his father . " i wanted to go and see where my family 's from , " he said .
" everyone wants to know where they come from . " but the meager information turned out to be enough for the agency 's workers and a trip was booked for the 69-year-old to visit his ancestors former home . nießer , however , warns of having high expectations .
reality is not always as colorful as the pictures parents or grandparents may have painted of their origins . across borders and generations dialogue and exchange occur not just between two cultures but also between generations . mielke said he now visits the heimatreise office regularly because it 's like a " shot of energy " for him . he 's also started learning polish and is planning more trips to the other side of the oder . aygül cizmecioglu -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : german-polish summit breaks the ice both germany and poland can be pleased with the thaw in relations as a result of polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's recent visit to berlin , says dw 's hubert wohlan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 04.02.2007 germany stalls prestigious bridge project with denmark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandinavia is anxious to see what berlin will decide the danish , swedish , norwegian governments and the european union say a bridge should connect the strait that separates germany and denmark near kiel .
but berlin seems to need convincing . uncertainty dominates any discussion about building a toll bridge across the 14-kilometer -lrb- nine-mile -rrb- fehmarn belt , as the strait between germany and southern denmark is called .
the project has been under discussion for 15 years , and one german chancellor after another has found a way to avoid it .
now , however , a decision could be imminent . hopes were high that it would be a subject when chancellor angela merkel and her danish colleague , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , met in december .
but the press was unable to pin her down after the talks .
" our decision must be made on a sound basis , " was all she would say .
symbolic value scandinavia is not short of links to what the nordic countries refer to as europe .
since completion of two major bridges in the last decade , travelers have been able to drive over land and bridges from sweden through denmark to germany .
ferries also shuttle traffic regularly between the countries .
they ply the fehmarn belt , between danish rodby and german puttgarden every half hour , a crossing that takes 45 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are concerned the fehmarn bridge could disturb nesting birds but when the lines get long at the ferry terminals during school vacations , the wait plus the journey can add up to an hour and a half .
and taking the land and bridge route through denmark to germany adds 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- to the journey south . the scandinavians see the bridge as an important connection to europe .
the route would complement the existing links to create a direct north-south highway corridor from oslo and stockholm to hamburg and other economic centers further south .
the european union has pinpointed the route as one of the priorities of its trans-european networks -lrb- ten -rrb- , which aim to bring the bloc 's regions closer together .
if the project comes together the eu could pay a quarter of the costs .
feasibility studies carried out by the german and danish authorities predicted that the traffic would quickly double to 8,000 cars , 1,000 heavy trucks and 4,000 train passengers daily even if the existing ferry lines remained in place , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote recently .
the missing link but the crucial issue is how to finance the project , which is expected to cost around 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- .
merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats decided in their 2005 coalition agreement to use the fehmarn bridge as an international model for a public-private partnership .
the idea favored by the danes and schleswig-holstein is that a danish-german group will finance the project with money earned on capital markets and be backed up by guarantees from the danish and german governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transport minister tiefensee -lrb- l . -rrb- and his danish colleague flemming hansen critics , however , fear that taxpayers will have to foot the bill in the end , according to danish transport expert per homann jespersen of the university of roskilde . " it 's spoken of by -lrb- danish -rrb- politicians as the missing link , " jespersen said .
" they do n't care so much that it 's financially sound . "
one of the models that supporters of the fehmarn project refer to is the highly symbolic oresund bridge , which connects sweden and denmark between the cities of malmo and copenhagen . the construction was initially deemed a financial flop .
fewer cars and trucks traversed the bridge than expected , opting instead to take longer but cheaper routes to cross the water .
" the oresund bridge is not a big success for long-distance traveling .
it 's a regional bridge , " jespersen said , adding that it had worked out in another way , namely by sparking a boom in the area .
regional growth last year around 16,000 vehicles crossed the bridge , twice as many as five years ago .
more than 20,000 passengers took the train across every day , an increase of 40 percent over the previous year . the bridge has made it much easier , and above all faster , for people to commute between the two countries than in the days when ferries connected the cities .
every 20 minutes , the train brings passengers from the danish to the swedish side in just 35 minutes .
swedes are attracted to the higher wages paid in denmark , while significantly lower property rates give many danes a financial incentive to move abroad . the danes are hopeful that a bridge over the fehmarn belt will bring them an economic boom , too .
it 's hard to imagine though that the rural region would replicate the success of the oresund area , where two important scandinavian cities are located .
still , politicians near rodby , a poorer part of denmark , have been lobbying hard for the project , as has the state government of schleswig-holstein , where fehmarn is located . looking ahead the locals are less enthusiastic .
on the german side , people fear that the financial risk is too high .
they 're also concerned that tourism would suffer during construction of the bridge and never recover .
instead , the area could just become a transit route .
in both countries , there are concerns that hundreds of jobs working at the ferry companies could disappear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bridge between sweden and denmark has been a boon to the region germany 's transport ministry is said to be examining the plans and consultations between officials in berlin and copenhagen continue .
the german government is expected to come to a decision in the next month or two .
jespersen was reluctant to speculate on the outcome .
he said he had begun to doubt whether the bridge project 's future would indeed be resolved sooner rather than later .
but he was optimistic about the future . " i 'm sure that in 10 or 20 years we will have decided it , " he said .
" it will be totally up to the germans .

they ply the fehmarn belt , between danish rodby and german puttgarden every half hour , a crossing that takes 45 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are concerned the fehmarn bridge could disturb nesting birds but when the lines get long at the ferry terminals during school vacations , the wait plus the journey can add up to an hour and a half .
and taking the land and bridge route through denmark to germany adds 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- to the journey south . the scandinavians see the bridge as an important connection to europe .
the route would complement the existing links to create a direct north-south highway corridor from oslo and stockholm to hamburg and other economic centers further south .
the european union has pinpointed the route as one of the priorities of its trans-european networks -lrb- ten -rrb- , which aim to bring the bloc 's regions closer together .
if the project comes together the eu could pay a quarter of the costs .
feasibility studies carried out by the german and danish authorities predicted that the traffic would quickly double to 8,000 cars , 1,000 heavy trucks and 4,000 train passengers daily even if the existing ferry lines remained in place , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote recently .
the missing link but the crucial issue is how to finance the project , which is expected to cost around 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- .
merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats decided in their 2005 coalition agreement to use the fehmarn bridge as an international model for a public-private partnership .
the idea favored by the danes and schleswig-holstein is that a danish-german group will finance the project with money earned on capital markets and be backed up by guarantees from the danish and german governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transport minister tiefensee -lrb- l . -rrb- and his danish colleague flemming hansen critics , however , fear that taxpayers will have to foot the bill in the end , according to danish transport expert per homann jespersen of the university of roskilde . " it 's spoken of by -lrb- danish -rrb- politicians as the missing link , " jespersen said .
" they do n't care so much that it 's financially sound . "
one of the models that supporters of the fehmarn project refer to is the highly symbolic oresund bridge , which connects sweden and denmark between the cities of malmo and copenhagen . the construction was initially deemed a financial flop .
fewer cars and trucks traversed the bridge than expected , opting instead to take longer but cheaper routes to cross the water .
" the oresund bridge is not a big success for long-distance traveling .
it 's a regional bridge , " jespersen said , adding that it had worked out in another way , namely by sparking a boom in the area .
regional growth last year around 16,000 vehicles crossed the bridge , twice as many as five years ago .
more than 20,000 passengers took the train across every day , an increase of 40 percent over the previous year . the bridge has made it much easier , and above all faster , for people to commute between the two countries than in the days when ferries connected the cities .
every 20 minutes , the train brings passengers from the danish to the swedish side in just 35 minutes .
swedes are attracted to the higher wages paid in denmark , while significantly lower property rates give many danes a financial incentive to move abroad . the danes are hopeful that a bridge over the fehmarn belt will bring them an economic boom , too .
it 's hard to imagine though that the rural region would replicate the success of the oresund area , where two important scandinavian cities are located .
still , politicians near rodby , a poorer part of denmark , have been lobbying hard for the project , as has the state government of schleswig-holstein , where fehmarn is located . looking ahead the locals are less enthusiastic .
on the german side , people fear that the financial risk is too high .
they 're also concerned that tourism would suffer during construction of the bridge and never recover .
instead , the area could just become a transit route .
in both countries , there are concerns that hundreds of jobs working at the ferry companies could disappear .

jespersen was reluctant to speculate on the outcome .
he said he had begun to doubt whether the bridge project 's future would indeed be resolved sooner rather than later .

the project has been under discussion for 15 years , and one german chancellor after another has found a way to avoid it .
now , however , a decision could be imminent . hopes were high that it would be a subject when chancellor angela merkel and her danish colleague , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , met in december .

now , a unique travel agency aims to improve ties between the neighbors . julia gerstenberg and jacqueline nießer have their work cut out for them . sitting in a little office in frankfurt on the oder river in eastern germany , which should not to be confused with the financial hub frankfurt on the main river in the west , the pair is surround by maps of poland , history books and dictionaries .
the scent of freshly brewed coffee and polish waffles wafts through the air . gerstenberg is trying to decipher an old map , while nießer answers questions on the telephone . researching roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heimatreise 's founders graduated from viadrina university each day , their small agency heimatreise , roughly translated as " trip home , " receives dozens of calls .
gerstenberg and nießer have made it their job to research family histories and organize trips for ethnic germans , and their descendents , who were expelled from poland at the end of world war ii and beyond . eight german and eight polish students attending the city 's europa university viadrina founded the travel agency in 2002 . nießer said heimatreise was established when relations between germany and poland were particularly tense . " we wondered what we in frankfurt / oder , on the german-polish border , could do on a small scale to ease the tensions on a human level , " she said . a look back at the time of heimatreise 's founding , the prussian trust organization , which represents the families of expropriated and resettled germans , had been launching lawsuits in poland for the return of lost property . at the end of world war ii , some 12 million germans were killed or expelled from central europe as the german and polish borders were being redrawn by the allies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 12 million germans were expelled from central europe after wwii some expelled germans and their descendents want poland to admit to wrongdoings at the end of the war , while others want to reclaim their former homes . many poles , for their part , are resentful of the demands in light of the nazi invasion in 1939 and the millions ' of deaths that ensued . bridging the gap that 's where heimatreise 's work comes in : to bridge the gap in a very sensitive area .
all of the agency 's workers volunteer their time and have so far organized around 10 trips to pomerania , the area surrounding lebus and the neumark . some people book trips to celebrate a significant birthday .
sons and daughters often want to treat their parents to a trip " back home " and choose to accompany them . " that 's important because we do n't want to stir up history , but rather , use to as a point of departure to talk about modern poland and its people , " said nießer . detective work heimatreise workers also said they see themselves as travel guides and detectives in one . often they have only a few clues to get started with when trying to track down a family 's history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the war , mainly germans lived in gdansk in northern poland detlef mielke showed up at the agency with just a few yellowed photographs and a vague notion of significant family dates and a few stories he remembered hearing from his father . " i wanted to go and see where my family 's from , " he said .
" everyone wants to know where they come from . " but the meager information turned out to be enough for the agency 's workers and a trip was booked for the 69-year-old to visit his ancestors former home . nießer , however , warns of having high expectations .
reality is not always as colorful as the pictures parents or grandparents may have painted of their origins . across borders and generations dialogue and exchange occur not just between two cultures but also between generations . mielke said he now visits the heimatreise office regularly because it 's like a " shot of energy " for him . he 's also started learning polish and is planning more trips to the other side of the oder . aygül cizmecioglu -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : german-polish summit breaks the ice both germany and poland can be pleased with the thaw in relations as a result of polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's recent visit to berlin , says dw 's hubert wohlan .

but berlin seems to need convincing . uncertainty dominates any discussion about building a toll bridge across the 14-kilometer -lrb- nine-mile -rrb- fehmarn belt , as the strait between germany and southern denmark is called .
the project has been under discussion for 15 years , and one german chancellor after another has found a way to avoid it .
now , however , a decision could be imminent . hopes were high that it would be a subject when chancellor angela merkel and her danish colleague , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , met in december .
but the press was unable to pin her down after the talks .
" our decision must be made on a sound basis , " was all she would say .
symbolic value scandinavia is not short of links to what the nordic countries refer to as europe .
since completion of two major bridges in the last decade , travelers have been able to drive over land and bridges from sweden through denmark to germany .
ferries also shuttle traffic regularly between the countries .
they ply the fehmarn belt , between danish rodby and german puttgarden every half hour , a crossing that takes 45 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are concerned the fehmarn bridge could disturb nesting birds but when the lines get long at the ferry terminals during school vacations , the wait plus the journey can add up to an hour and a half .
and taking the land and bridge route through denmark to germany adds 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- to the journey south . the scandinavians see the bridge as an important connection to europe .
the route would complement the existing links to create a direct north-south highway corridor from oslo and stockholm to hamburg and other economic centers further south .
the european union has pinpointed the route as one of the priorities of its trans-european networks -lrb- ten -rrb- , which aim to bring the bloc 's regions closer together .
if the project comes together the eu could pay a quarter of the costs .
feasibility studies carried out by the german and danish authorities predicted that the traffic would quickly double to 8,000 cars , 1,000 heavy trucks and 4,000 train passengers daily even if the existing ferry lines remained in place , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote recently .
the missing link but the crucial issue is how to finance the project , which is expected to cost around 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- .
merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats decided in their 2005 coalition agreement to use the fehmarn bridge as an international model for a public-private partnership .
the idea favored by the danes and schleswig-holstein is that a danish-german group will finance the project with money earned on capital markets and be backed up by guarantees from the danish and german governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transport minister tiefensee -lrb- l . -rrb- and his danish colleague flemming hansen critics , however , fear that taxpayers will have to foot the bill in the end , according to danish transport expert per homann jespersen of the university of roskilde . " it 's spoken of by -lrb- danish -rrb- politicians as the missing link , " jespersen said .
" they do n't care so much that it 's financially sound . "
one of the models that supporters of the fehmarn project refer to is the highly symbolic oresund bridge , which connects sweden and denmark between the cities of malmo and copenhagen . the construction was initially deemed a financial flop .
fewer cars and trucks traversed the bridge than expected , opting instead to take longer but cheaper routes to cross the water .
" the oresund bridge is not a big success for long-distance traveling .
it 's a regional bridge , " jespersen said , adding that it had worked out in another way , namely by sparking a boom in the area .
regional growth last year around 16,000 vehicles crossed the bridge , twice as many as five years ago .
more than 20,000 passengers took the train across every day , an increase of 40 percent over the previous year . the bridge has made it much easier , and above all faster , for people to commute between the two countries than in the days when ferries connected the cities .
every 20 minutes , the train brings passengers from the danish to the swedish side in just 35 minutes .
swedes are attracted to the higher wages paid in denmark , while significantly lower property rates give many danes a financial incentive to move abroad . the danes are hopeful that a bridge over the fehmarn belt will bring them an economic boom , too .
it 's hard to imagine though that the rural region would replicate the success of the oresund area , where two important scandinavian cities are located .
still , politicians near rodby , a poorer part of denmark , have been lobbying hard for the project , as has the state government of schleswig-holstein , where fehmarn is located . looking ahead the locals are less enthusiastic .
on the german side , people fear that the financial risk is too high .
they 're also concerned that tourism would suffer during construction of the bridge and never recover .
instead , the area could just become a transit route .
in both countries , there are concerns that hundreds of jobs working at the ferry companies could disappear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bridge between sweden and denmark has been a boon to the region germany 's transport ministry is said to be examining the plans and consultations between officials in berlin and copenhagen continue .
the german government is expected to come to a decision in the next month or two .
jespersen was reluctant to speculate on the outcome .
he said he had begun to doubt whether the bridge project 's future would indeed be resolved sooner rather than later .
but he was optimistic about the future . " i 'm sure that in 10 or 20 years we will have decided it , " he said .
" it will be totally up to the germans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 04.02.2007 germany stalls prestigious bridge project with denmark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandinavia is anxious to see what berlin will decide the danish , swedish , norwegian governments and the european union say a bridge should connect the strait that separates germany and denmark near kiel .
but berlin seems to need convincing . uncertainty dominates any discussion about building a toll bridge across the 14-kilometer -lrb- nine-mile -rrb- fehmarn belt , as the strait between germany and southern denmark is called .
the project has been under discussion for 15 years , and one german chancellor after another has found a way to avoid it .
now , however , a decision could be imminent . hopes were high that it would be a subject when chancellor angela merkel and her danish colleague , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , met in december .
but the press was unable to pin her down after the talks .
" our decision must be made on a sound basis , " was all she would say .
symbolic value scandinavia is not short of links to what the nordic countries refer to as europe .
since completion of two major bridges in the last decade , travelers have been able to drive over land and bridges from sweden through denmark to germany .
ferries also shuttle traffic regularly between the countries .
they ply the fehmarn belt , between danish rodby and german puttgarden every half hour , a crossing that takes 45 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are concerned the fehmarn bridge could disturb nesting birds but when the lines get long at the ferry terminals during school vacations , the wait plus the journey can add up to an hour and a half .
and taking the land and bridge route through denmark to germany adds 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- to the journey south . the scandinavians see the bridge as an important connection to europe .
the route would complement the existing links to create a direct north-south highway corridor from oslo and stockholm to hamburg and other economic centers further south .
the european union has pinpointed the route as one of the priorities of its trans-european networks -lrb- ten -rrb- , which aim to bring the bloc 's regions closer together .
if the project comes together the eu could pay a quarter of the costs .
feasibility studies carried out by the german and danish authorities predicted that the traffic would quickly double to 8,000 cars , 1,000 heavy trucks and 4,000 train passengers daily even if the existing ferry lines remained in place , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote recently .
the missing link but the crucial issue is how to finance the project , which is expected to cost around 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- .
merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats decided in their 2005 coalition agreement to use the fehmarn bridge as an international model for a public-private partnership .
the idea favored by the danes and schleswig-holstein is that a danish-german group will finance the project with money earned on capital markets and be backed up by guarantees from the danish and german governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transport minister tiefensee -lrb- l . -rrb- and his danish colleague flemming hansen critics , however , fear that taxpayers will have to foot the bill in the end , according to danish transport expert per homann jespersen of the university of roskilde . " it 's spoken of by -lrb- danish -rrb- politicians as the missing link , " jespersen said .
" they do n't care so much that it 's financially sound . "
one of the models that supporters of the fehmarn project refer to is the highly symbolic oresund bridge , which connects sweden and denmark between the cities of malmo and copenhagen . the construction was initially deemed a financial flop .
fewer cars and trucks traversed the bridge than expected , opting instead to take longer but cheaper routes to cross the water .
" the oresund bridge is not a big success for long-distance traveling .
it 's a regional bridge , " jespersen said , adding that it had worked out in another way , namely by sparking a boom in the area .
regional growth last year around 16,000 vehicles crossed the bridge , twice as many as five years ago .
more than 20,000 passengers took the train across every day , an increase of 40 percent over the previous year . the bridge has made it much easier , and above all faster , for people to commute between the two countries than in the days when ferries connected the cities .
every 20 minutes , the train brings passengers from the danish to the swedish side in just 35 minutes .
swedes are attracted to the higher wages paid in denmark , while significantly lower property rates give many danes a financial incentive to move abroad . the danes are hopeful that a bridge over the fehmarn belt will bring them an economic boom , too .
it 's hard to imagine though that the rural region would replicate the success of the oresund area , where two important scandinavian cities are located .
still , politicians near rodby , a poorer part of denmark , have been lobbying hard for the project , as has the state government of schleswig-holstein , where fehmarn is located . looking ahead the locals are less enthusiastic .
on the german side , people fear that the financial risk is too high .
they 're also concerned that tourism would suffer during construction of the bridge and never recover .
instead , the area could just become a transit route .
in both countries , there are concerns that hundreds of jobs working at the ferry companies could disappear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bridge between sweden and denmark has been a boon to the region germany 's transport ministry is said to be examining the plans and consultations between officials in berlin and copenhagen continue .
the german government is expected to come to a decision in the next month or two .
jespersen was reluctant to speculate on the outcome .
he said he had begun to doubt whether the bridge project 's future would indeed be resolved sooner rather than later .
but he was optimistic about the future . " i 'm sure that in 10 or 20 years we will have decided it , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 04.02.2007 germany stalls prestigious bridge project with denmark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scandinavia is anxious to see what berlin will decide the danish , swedish , norwegian governments and the european union say a bridge should connect the strait that separates germany and denmark near kiel .
but berlin seems to need convincing . uncertainty dominates any discussion about building a toll bridge across the 14-kilometer -lrb- nine-mile -rrb- fehmarn belt , as the strait between germany and southern denmark is called .
the project has been under discussion for 15 years , and one german chancellor after another has found a way to avoid it .
now , however , a decision could be imminent . hopes were high that it would be a subject when chancellor angela merkel and her danish colleague , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , met in december .
but the press was unable to pin her down after the talks .
" our decision must be made on a sound basis , " was all she would say .
symbolic value scandinavia is not short of links to what the nordic countries refer to as europe .
since completion of two major bridges in the last decade , travelers have been able to drive over land and bridges from sweden through denmark to germany .
ferries also shuttle traffic regularly between the countries .
they ply the fehmarn belt , between danish rodby and german puttgarden every half hour , a crossing that takes 45 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are concerned the fehmarn bridge could disturb nesting birds but when the lines get long at the ferry terminals during school vacations , the wait plus the journey can add up to an hour and a half .
and taking the land and bridge route through denmark to germany adds 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- to the journey south . the scandinavians see the bridge as an important connection to europe .
the route would complement the existing links to create a direct north-south highway corridor from oslo and stockholm to hamburg and other economic centers further south .
the european union has pinpointed the route as one of the priorities of its trans-european networks -lrb- ten -rrb- , which aim to bring the bloc 's regions closer together .

merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats decided in their 2005 coalition agreement to use the fehmarn bridge as an international model for a public-private partnership .

" they do n't care so much that it 's financially sound . "
one of the models that supporters of the fehmarn project refer to is the highly symbolic oresund bridge , which connects sweden and denmark between the cities of malmo and copenhagen . the construction was initially deemed a financial flop .
fewer cars and trucks traversed the bridge than expected , opting instead to take longer but cheaper routes to cross the water .
" the oresund bridge is not a big success for long-distance traveling .
it 's a regional bridge , " jespersen said , adding that it had worked out in another way , namely by sparking a boom in the area .
regional growth last year around 16,000 vehicles crossed the bridge , twice as many as five years ago .
more than 20,000 passengers took the train across every day , an increase of 40 percent over the previous year . the bridge has made it much easier , and above all faster , for people to commute between the two countries than in the days when ferries connected the cities .
every 20 minutes , the train brings passengers from the danish to the swedish side in just 35 minutes .
swedes are attracted to the higher wages paid in denmark , while significantly lower property rates give many danes a financial incentive to move abroad . the danes are hopeful that a bridge over the fehmarn belt will bring them an economic boom , too .
it 's hard to imagine though that the rural region would replicate the success of the oresund area , where two important scandinavian cities are located .
still , politicians near rodby , a poorer part of denmark , have been lobbying hard for the project , as has the state government of schleswig-holstein , where fehmarn is located . looking ahead the locals are less enthusiastic .
on the german side , people fear that the financial risk is too high .
they 're also concerned that tourism would suffer during construction of the bridge and never recover .
instead , the area could just become a transit route .
in both countries , there are concerns that hundreds of jobs working at the ferry companies could disappear .

jespersen was reluctant to speculate on the outcome .

now , a unique travel agency aims to improve ties between the neighbors . julia gerstenberg and jacqueline nießer have their work cut out for them . sitting in a little office in frankfurt on the oder river in eastern germany , which should not to be confused with the financial hub frankfurt on the main river in the west , the pair is surround by maps of poland , history books and dictionaries .
the scent of freshly brewed coffee and polish waffles wafts through the air . gerstenberg is trying to decipher an old map , while nießer answers questions on the telephone . researching roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heimatreise 's founders graduated from viadrina university each day , their small agency heimatreise , roughly translated as " trip home , " receives dozens of calls .
gerstenberg and nießer have made it their job to research family histories and organize trips for ethnic germans , and their descendents , who were expelled from poland at the end of world war ii and beyond . eight german and eight polish students attending the city 's europa university viadrina founded the travel agency in 2002 . nießer said heimatreise was established when relations between germany and poland were particularly tense . " we wondered what we in frankfurt / oder , on the german-polish border , could do on a small scale to ease the tensions on a human level , " she said . a look back at the time of heimatreise 's founding , the prussian trust organization , which represents the families of expropriated and resettled germans , had been launching lawsuits in poland for the return of lost property . at the end of world war ii , some 12 million germans were killed or expelled from central europe as the german and polish borders were being redrawn by the allies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 12 million germans were expelled from central europe after wwii some expelled germans and their descendents want poland to admit to wrongdoings at the end of the war , while others want to reclaim their former homes . many poles , for their part , are resentful of the demands in light of the nazi invasion in 1939 and the millions ' of deaths that ensued . bridging the gap that 's where heimatreise 's work comes in : to bridge the gap in a very sensitive area .
all of the agency 's workers volunteer their time and have so far organized around 10 trips to pomerania , the area surrounding lebus and the neumark . some people book trips to celebrate a significant birthday .
sons and daughters often want to treat their parents to a trip " back home " and choose to accompany them . " that 's important because we do n't want to stir up history , but rather , use to as a point of departure to talk about modern poland and its people , " said nießer . detective work heimatreise workers also said they see themselves as travel guides and detectives in one . often they have only a few clues to get started with when trying to track down a family 's history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before the war , mainly germans lived in gdansk in northern poland detlef mielke showed up at the agency with just a few yellowed photographs and a vague notion of significant family dates and a few stories he remembered hearing from his father . " i wanted to go and see where my family 's from , " he said .
" everyone wants to know where they come from . " but the meager information turned out to be enough for the agency 's workers and a trip was booked for the 69-year-old to visit his ancestors former home . nießer , however , warns of having high expectations .
reality is not always as colorful as the pictures parents or grandparents may have painted of their origins . across borders and generations dialogue and exchange occur not just between two cultures but also between generations . mielke said he now visits the heimatreise office regularly because it 's like a " shot of energy " for him . he 's also started learning polish and is planning more trips to the other side of the oder . aygül cizmecioglu -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : german-polish summit breaks the ice both germany and poland can be pleased with the thaw in relations as a result of polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski 's recent visit to berlin , says dw 's hubert wohlan .

but berlin seems to need convincing . uncertainty dominates any discussion about building a toll bridge across the 14-kilometer -lrb- nine-mile -rrb- fehmarn belt , as the strait between germany and southern denmark is called .
the project has been under discussion for 15 years , and one german chancellor after another has found a way to avoid it .
now , however , a decision could be imminent . hopes were high that it would be a subject when chancellor angela merkel and her danish colleague , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , met in december .
but the press was unable to pin her down after the talks .
" our decision must be made on a sound basis , " was all she would say .
symbolic value scandinavia is not short of links to what the nordic countries refer to as europe .
since completion of two major bridges in the last decade , travelers have been able to drive over land and bridges from sweden through denmark to germany .
ferries also shuttle traffic regularly between the countries .
they ply the fehmarn belt , between danish rodby and german puttgarden every half hour , a crossing that takes 45 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are concerned the fehmarn bridge could disturb nesting birds but when the lines get long at the ferry terminals during school vacations , the wait plus the journey can add up to an hour and a half .
and taking the land and bridge route through denmark to germany adds 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- to the journey south . the scandinavians see the bridge as an important connection to europe .
the route would complement the existing links to create a direct north-south highway corridor from oslo and stockholm to hamburg and other economic centers further south .
the european union has pinpointed the route as one of the priorities of its trans-european networks -lrb- ten -rrb- , which aim to bring the bloc 's regions closer together .
if the project comes together the eu could pay a quarter of the costs .
feasibility studies carried out by the german and danish authorities predicted that the traffic would quickly double to 8,000 cars , 1,000 heavy trucks and 4,000 train passengers daily even if the existing ferry lines remained in place , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote recently .

but berlin seems to need convincing . uncertainty dominates any discussion about building a toll bridge across the 14-kilometer -lrb- nine-mile -rrb- fehmarn belt , as the strait between germany and southern denmark is called .
the project has been under discussion for 15 years , and one german chancellor after another has found a way to avoid it .
now , however , a decision could be imminent . hopes were high that it would be a subject when chancellor angela merkel and her danish colleague , prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , met in december .
but the press was unable to pin her down after the talks .
" our decision must be made on a sound basis , " was all she would say .
symbolic value scandinavia is not short of links to what the nordic countries refer to as europe .
since completion of two major bridges in the last decade , travelers have been able to drive over land and bridges from sweden through denmark to germany .
ferries also shuttle traffic regularly between the countries .
they ply the fehmarn belt , between danish rodby and german puttgarden every half hour , a crossing that takes 45 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists are concerned the fehmarn bridge could disturb nesting birds but when the lines get long at the ferry terminals during school vacations , the wait plus the journey can add up to an hour and a half .
and taking the land and bridge route through denmark to germany adds 100 kilometers -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- to the journey south . the scandinavians see the bridge as an important connection to europe .
the route would complement the existing links to create a direct north-south highway corridor from oslo and stockholm to hamburg and other economic centers further south .
the european union has pinpointed the route as one of the priorities of its trans-european networks -lrb- ten -rrb- , which aim to bring the bloc 's regions closer together .
if the project comes together the eu could pay a quarter of the costs .
feasibility studies carried out by the german and danish authorities predicted that the traffic would quickly double to 8,000 cars , 1,000 heavy trucks and 4,000 train passengers daily even if the existing ferry lines remained in place , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote recently .
the missing link but the crucial issue is how to finance the project , which is expected to cost around 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- .
merkel 's christian democrats and the social democrats decided in their 2005 coalition agreement to use the fehmarn bridge as an international model for a public-private partnership .
the idea favored by the danes and schleswig-holstein is that a danish-german group will finance the project with money earned on capital markets and be backed up by guarantees from the danish and german governments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transport minister tiefensee -lrb- l . -rrb- and his danish colleague flemming hansen critics , however , fear that taxpayers will have to foot the bill in the end , according to danish transport expert per homann jespersen of the university of roskilde . " it 's spoken of by -lrb- danish -rrb- politicians as the missing link , " jespersen said .
" they do n't care so much that it 's financially sound . "
one of the models that supporters of the fehmarn project refer to is the highly symbolic oresund bridge , which connects sweden and denmark between the cities of malmo and copenhagen . the construction was initially deemed a financial flop .
fewer cars and trucks traversed the bridge than expected , opting instead to take longer but cheaper routes to cross the water .
" the oresund bridge is not a big success for long-distance traveling .
it 's a regional bridge , " jespersen said , adding that it had worked out in another way , namely by sparking a boom in the area .
regional growth last year around 16,000 vehicles crossed the bridge , twice as many as five years ago .
more than 20,000 passengers took the train across every day , an increase of 40 percent over the previous year . the bridge has made it much easier , and above all faster , for people to commute between the two countries than in the days when ferries connected the cities .
every 20 minutes , the train brings passengers from the danish to the swedish side in just 35 minutes .
swedes are attracted to the higher wages paid in denmark , while significantly lower property rates give many danes a financial incentive to move abroad . the danes are hopeful that a bridge over the fehmarn belt will bring them an economic boom , too .
it 's hard to imagine though that the rural region would replicate the success of the oresund area , where two important scandinavian cities are located .
still , politicians near rodby , a poorer part of denmark , have been lobbying hard for the project , as has the state government of schleswig-holstein , where fehmarn is located . looking ahead the locals are less enthusiastic .
on the german side , people fear that the financial risk is too high .
they 're also concerned that tourism would suffer during construction of the bridge and never recover .
instead , the area could just become a transit route .
in both countries , there are concerns that hundreds of jobs working at the ferry companies could disappear .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bridge between sweden and denmark has been a boon to the region germany 's transport ministry is said to be examining the plans and consultations between officials in berlin and copenhagen continue .
the german government is expected to come to a decision in the next month or two .
jespersen was reluctant to speculate on the outcome .
he said he had begun to doubt whether the bridge project 's future would indeed be resolved sooner rather than later .
but he was optimistic about the future . " i 'm sure that in 10 or 20 years we will have decided it , " he said .

" try it " urges firms to bring in a ban on smoking in public places for an hour , a day , or even permanently .
but while one powys hotelier said a ban before the official date could be a " death knell , " a llanelli cafe said it had already been good for business .
the launch coincides with wales ' first six nations game against ireland , which introduced its own smoking ban in 2004 .
we sell more food , slightly less coffee in the morning , but we 're a food-driven business taliesin einon , restaurant owner last week , ams voted to go ahead with a ban on 2 april , despite attempts by one conservative and two labour ams to delay it by three months to bring wales in line with the date of england 's legislation .
clwyd south labour am karen sinclair had claimed an april date could mean pubs in border areas would suffer financially if smokers crossed to england .
bob davies , of the kilverts hotel in hay-on-wye , powys , agreed a smoking ban could be detrimental to business .
mr davies , a non-smoker , said there had been a ban at the hotel when they took it over three months ago .
but if the ban had not been imminent he would " definitely " have reconsidered the hotel 's policy , as an early smoking ban could be a " death knell " , he claimed .
there are people who would have liked to come to this place for an evening and they 've decided to go to other bars in the area because they allow smoking bob davies , kilverts hotel , hay-on-wye " it 's certainly affected this business , " he said .
" most definitely , there are people who would have liked to come to this place for an evening and they 've decided to go to other bars in the area because they allow smoking . "
mr davies said he would not recommend other businesses bring in a ban before the official date , but after april they would all be " in the same boat " .
however , the owner of italian café / restaurant altalia in llanelli said its smoking ban had been beneficial .
taliesin einon said he had brought in the ban two years ago due to public demand , and he would recommend others do so .
" we sell more food , slightly less coffee in the morning , but we 're a food-driven business , " said mr einon .
" it gives us the edge in this area , because everywhere else is smoky .
i 'm hoping we 've gathered a market that will stick with us -lrb- when the ban comes in -rrb- , " he added .
denbighshire council is among those backing the campaign .
councillor eryl williams , the council cabinet lead member for the environment , said : " with the ban on smoking in enclosed public spaces in wales fast approaching we would like to encourage as many denbighshire companies as possible to try being smoke-free as soon as possible . "

" try it " urges firms to bring in a ban on smoking in public places for an hour , a day , or even permanently .
but while one powys hotelier said a ban before the official date could be a " death knell , " a llanelli cafe said it had already been good for business .
the launch coincides with wales ' first six nations game against ireland , which introduced its own smoking ban in 2004 .
we sell more food , slightly less coffee in the morning , but we 're a food-driven business taliesin einon , restaurant owner last week , ams voted to go ahead with a ban on 2 april , despite attempts by one conservative and two labour ams to delay it by three months to bring wales in line with the date of england 's legislation .
clwyd south labour am karen sinclair had claimed an april date could mean pubs in border areas would suffer financially if smokers crossed to england .
bob davies , of the kilverts hotel in hay-on-wye , powys , agreed a smoking ban could be detrimental to business .
mr davies , a non-smoker , said there had been a ban at the hotel when they took it over three months ago .
but if the ban had not been imminent he would " definitely " have reconsidered the hotel 's policy , as an early smoking ban could be a " death knell " , he claimed .
there are people who would have liked to come to this place for an evening and they 've decided to go to other bars in the area because they allow smoking bob davies , kilverts hotel , hay-on-wye " it 's certainly affected this business , " he said .
" most definitely , there are people who would have liked to come to this place for an evening and they 've decided to go to other bars in the area because they allow smoking . "
mr davies said he would not recommend other businesses bring in a ban before the official date , but after april they would all be " in the same boat " .
however , the owner of italian café / restaurant altalia in llanelli said its smoking ban had been beneficial .
taliesin einon said he had brought in the ban two years ago due to public demand , and he would recommend others do so .
" we sell more food , slightly less coffee in the morning , but we 're a food-driven business , " said mr einon .
" it gives us the edge in this area , because everywhere else is smoky .
i 'm hoping we 've gathered a market that will stick with us -lrb- when the ban comes in -rrb- , " he added .
denbighshire council is among those backing the campaign .
councillor eryl williams , the council cabinet lead member for the environment , said : " with the ban on smoking in enclosed public spaces in wales fast approaching we would like to encourage as many denbighshire companies as possible to try being smoke-free as soon as possible . "

mr clarke , who was sacked last may over a failure to deport foreign criminals , told sky news he disagreed with his successor , john reid .
" i think he 's wrong , " he said , adding that it could make the problems worse .
mr reid wants to split the home office into two departments , dealing with security issues and justice .
mr reid said parts of the home office were " not fit for purpose " , when he took over last summer . "
i think dividing the home office would make those problems far worse " charles clarke it has continued to hit the headlines with stories ranging from a lack of prison places to britons who had committed crimes abroad but whose case files were not entered on the police computer .
in an interview on sunday , mr clarke said that mr reid 's recent decisions to write to judges to remind them of sentencing guidelines , and to suggest splitting up the home office , were both mistakes .
" i think the problem with the department is a lack of co-ordination between its various elements , " he said .
" between immigration and asylum on the one hand , police , prisons and probation , there simply is n't enough co-ordination between them .
" i think dividing the home office would make those problems far worse " .
balanced government another former labour home secretary , david blunket , has said the split would not be good for balanced government as it would leave only two powerful figures in cabinet - the prime minister and the chancellor .
but jack straw , who was labour home secretary from 1997 to 2001 , has said he had not backed such a plan then , but terrorism had since become an " overwhelming " issue and he now thought it was a good idea .
and mr reid has said : " we have to look at all of the options that are available to us with a view to protecting the nation , protecting the public , ensuring national security and putting the public interests first in everything we do . "
since he took over he has been reviewing the way the home office works and its structure , but says it will take two and a half years to fix .
under mr reid 's recommendations the security department would be responsible for anti-terrorism policy , immigration and the security services .
the ministry of justice would have control of probation , prisons and stopping re-offending .
the conservatives have called the plan an " admission of failure " and say breaking up the home office will " compound existing problems " and create new ones .

mr clarke , who was sacked last may over a failure to deport foreign criminals , told sky news he disagreed with his successor , john reid .
" i think he 's wrong , " he said , adding that it could make the problems worse .
mr reid wants to split the home office into two departments , dealing with security issues and justice .
mr reid said parts of the home office were " not fit for purpose " , when he took over last summer .
i think dividing the home office would make those problems far worse charles clarke it has continued to hit the headlines with stories ranging from a lack of prison places to britons who had committed crimes abroad but whose case files were not entered on the police computer .
in an interview on sunday , mr clarke said that mr reid 's recent decisions to write to judges to remind them of sentencing guidelines , and to suggest splitting up the home office , were both mistakes .
" i think the problem with the department is a lack of co-ordination between its various elements , " he said .

the east of england regional assembly -lrb- eera -rrb- voiced " extreme disappointment " at a lack of infrastructure funding .
it developed the plan for the government but has objected to a further 30,000 homes and their impact on the " quality of life " in the region .
a more detailed response by eera will be considered on 8 march .
' precious environment ' assembly chairman councillor sue sida-lockett said : " the assembly is united in rejecting the need for 30,000 more homes , a second runway at stansted airport and more jobs and houses without much needed funding to support infrastructure . "
in a resolution following a meeting at county hall in norwich eera passed a resolution re-stating the assembly 's suspension of its support for the plan .
this included opposition to the government 's decision not to allow the regional planning process to reconsider the principle of a second runway at stansted .
eera had suggested an increase in housing numbers to 478,000 but this was raised to 508,000 by the government .
this has led to accusations that such an increase did not adequately take into account its impact on local communities , infrastructure capacity including the trasnsport network and the environment .
deputy chair chris white said : " the region 's quality of life and precious environment will be at risk if the government does not listen to the views of local communities . "
the government 's proposed changes are now subject to a public consultation period running until 9 march 2007 with the final east of england plan set for publication in the middle of the year .

the east of england regional assembly -lrb- eera -rrb- voiced " extreme disappointment " at a lack of infrastructure funding .
it developed the plan for the government but has objected to a further 30,000 homes and their impact on the " quality of life " in the region .
a more detailed response by eera will be considered on 8 march .
' precious environment ' assembly chairman councillor sue sida-lockett said : " the assembly is united in rejecting the need for 30,000 more homes , a second runway at stansted airport and more jobs and houses without much needed funding to support infrastructure . "
in a resolution following a meeting at county hall in norwich eera passed a resolution re-stating the assembly 's suspension of its support for the plan .
this included opposition to the government 's decision not to allow the regional planning process to reconsider the principle of a second runway at stansted .
eera had suggested an increase in housing numbers to 478,000 but this was raised to 508,000 by the government .
this has led to accusations that such an increase did not adequately take into account its impact on local communities , infrastructure capacity including the trasnsport network and the environment .
deputy chair chris white said : " the region 's quality of life and precious environment will be at risk if the government does not listen to the views of local communities . "
the government 's proposed changes are now subject to a public consultation period running until 9 march 2007 with the final east of england plan set for publication in the middle of the year .
