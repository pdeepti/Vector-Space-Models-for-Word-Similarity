" we are aware of individual cases where employees in afghan prisons committed actions that , according to international law , certainly do not meet our expectations , " german gen. egon ramms told deutsche welle on wednesday , nov .
14 . the general added that the situation was not widespread and that the alliance wanted to prevent additional cases by allowing nato 's military leaders on the ground to decide if prisoners were transferred to afghan authorities . the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- was accused by amnesty international on tuesday of exposing detainees to abuse by handing them over to afghan security authorities who tortured the detainees . the human rights group called for prisoner transfers to stop " until effective safeguards against torture and other ill-treatment are introduced in the afghan detention system .

" the business of monitoring prisoners who have been handed over by isaf is the responsibility of individual nations . " ramms , however , said nato was aware of indications that transferred detainees were being abused by afghan authorities .
he said canadian troops in the kandahar province stopped handing over prisoners until their safety and human rights could be guaranteed . the general added that isaf rules of engagement agreed to by the nato council required soldiers to convey prisoners to the afghan security officials within 96 hours . " i now expect politicians to become active and influence the afghan government to change things , " ramms told deutsche welle .
" if we obey the rules agreed on and given to us , it is terrible for the soldiers to be the ones accused of acting inappropriately . " investigation to begin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soldiers are not to blame for applying the rules given to them , ramms said afghan president hamid karzai 's government announced on wednesday that it will investigate amnesty 's claims . " an authorized commission appointed by the president will seriously investigate the issue , " the afghan foreign ministry said in a statement .
" afghanistan is against any physical and mental torture and is committed to all international human rights standards which are also stated in the afghan constitution . " isaf has 40,000 troops in afghanistan from 37 countries .

13 , german deputy chancellor and labor minister franz müntefering said he was stepping down because of his wife 's serious illness .
dw 's peter stützle takes a look back at his career . franz müntefering is retiring at the age of 67 , were it not for the tragic circumstances of his wife 's struggle against cancer , one would be tempted to say that it 's fitting .
müntefering was the one who suggested raising the retirement age in germany from 65 to 67 . that was a bold step for a social democrat , drawing a huge outcry from labor unions and giving a central issue to the newly formed rival left party .
previously , as part of the spd-led government under gerhard schröder , müntefering had also been a major advocate of the agenda 2010 reforms , which cut back the social welfare state . but müntefering was anything but a neo-liberal capitalist .
he was also the one who accused investors of snapping up profits and destroying jobs like a plague of locusts .
müntefering was an old-school social democrat who only pushed for painful cuts to ensure that social welfare programs remained affordable . recently , müntefering had to swallow a number of political defeats .
two weeks ago , at the spd party conference , his rival kurt beck convinced social democrats to back reforms to müntefering 's agenda 2010 , and on monday , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition dismissed his idea for a minimum wage for mail deliverers . those defeats did n't mean he had to retire .
the spd may have voted against him on one issue , but the party still celebrated him as a hero , and merkel has never tired in her praise for müntefering as a stabilizing factor within the governing coalition . but even if there is no reason to doubt that müntefering 's decision to step down was a personal , and not a political one , he chose an apt juncture to do so .
germany is halfway through the current legislative period , and his successors will have enough time to make names for themselves .
moreover , party leader kurt beck will have a free hand to prepare the spd for the next election . if he is to avoid an electoral debacle in 2009 , beck will have to check the rise of the left party and free the spd from merkel 's shadow .
his most recent initiatives were aimed at doing both . but beck will have to tread carefully to avoid endangering the grand coalition .
that 's why he appointed olaf scholz as labor minister - scholz is a non-ideological technocrat who wo n't disrupt the management of government with any wild escapades . the spd under beck will now enter a new phase in the struggle for political power , while franz müntefering will enter retirement - at the age of 67 . peter stützle heads dw-radio 's capital bureau in berlin -lrb- jc -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , german deputy chancellor and labor minister franz müntefering said he was stepping down because of his wife 's serious illness .
dw 's peter stützle takes a look back at his career . franz müntefering is retiring at the age of 67 , were it not for the tragic circumstances of his wife 's struggle against cancer , one would be tempted to say that it 's fitting .
müntefering was the one who suggested raising the retirement age in germany from 65 to 67 . that was a bold step for a social democrat , drawing a huge outcry from labor unions and giving a central issue to the newly formed rival left party .
previously , as part of the spd-led government under gerhard schröder , müntefering had also been a major advocate of the agenda 2010 reforms , which cut back the social welfare state . but müntefering was anything but a neo-liberal capitalist .
he was also the one who accused investors of snapping up profits and destroying jobs like a plague of locusts .
müntefering was an old-school social democrat who only pushed for painful cuts to ensure that social welfare programs remained affordable . recently , müntefering had to swallow a number of political defeats .
two weeks ago , at the spd party conference , his rival kurt beck convinced social democrats to back reforms to müntefering 's agenda 2010 , and on monday , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition dismissed his idea for a minimum wage for mail deliverers . those defeats did n't mean he had to retire .
the spd may have voted against him on one issue , but the party still celebrated him as a hero , and merkel has never tired in her praise for müntefering as a stabilizing factor within the governing coalition . but even if there is no reason to doubt that müntefering 's decision to step down was a personal , and not a political one , he chose an apt juncture to do so .
germany is halfway through the current legislative period , and his successors will have enough time to make names for themselves .
moreover , party leader kurt beck will have a free hand to prepare the spd for the next election . if he is to avoid an electoral debacle in 2009 , beck will have to check the rise of the left party and free the spd from merkel 's shadow .
his most recent initiatives were aimed at doing both . but beck will have to tread carefully to avoid endangering the grand coalition .
that 's why he appointed olaf scholz as labor minister - scholz is a non-ideological technocrat who wo n't disrupt the management of government with any wild escapades . the spd under beck will now enter a new phase in the struggle for political power , while franz müntefering will enter retirement - at the age of 67 . peter stützle heads dw-radio 's capital bureau in berlin -lrb- jc -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 , retaining its hold on government despite losing parliamentary seats overall . prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's liberal-conservative coalition and its far-right ally , the danish people 's party , won 90 seats in the country 's 179-member parliament , promising voters lower taxes and a strict asylum policy .
the bloc , which now holds the narrowest possible majority , had 94 seats before the elections . the 90th vote for the coalition came from the faroe islands , a danish territory , and was n't counted until early wednesday morning , clinching the coalition 's razor-thin majority . " it 's historic that for the third election in a row the liberals are denmark 's biggest party , " said rasmussen on tuesday after most of the votes had been counted .
the party , which he leads , took 46 seats - six fewer than in the last national elections in 2005 .
their conservative party coalition partners held steady with 18 seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naser khader , center , founded the new alliance this year rasmussen 's opponent , social democratic leader hell thorning-schmidt - who would have become denmark 's first female prime minister - was strong in the polls in the runup to the elections , though the incumbent pulled ahead on tuesday .
thorning-schmidt 's party lost two parliamentary seats , coming in with 45 . pro-immigrant party enters parliament rasmussen is expected to hold talks on whether to include the new alliance , a party founded in may 2007 by syrian-born naser khader .
the new alliance , whose self-declared aim is to break up the governing bloc and reduce the influence of the danish people 's party , entered parliament tuesday with its first five seats . khader 's party has said it would support rasmussen in exchange for , among other things , a milder refugee policy .
this would likely irk the danish people 's party , the country 's third-largest party and a crucial coalition ally . analysts have predicted , however , that positioning such diametrically opposed parties in the government could destabilize the coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen 's coalition has been hard on refugees rasmussen 's minority coalition has maintained power only with the support of the anti-immigrant people 's party , which gained one seat in tuesday 's elections for a total of 25 .
under the influence of the far-right , the governing bloc has drastically reduced the number of refugees coming to denmark from 10,000 in 2001 to fewer than 2,000 last year , reported the afp news agency . rasmussen takes advantage of upswing the danish prime minister pushed out the social democrats to take office in 2001 , pledging tax cuts and more stringent asylum laws .
he was reelected in 2005 with a commitment to support denmark 's extensive social-welfare system . rasmussen had called parliamentary elections 15 months early in what was considered to be an effort to capitalize on the country 's strong economy and 33-year-low unemployment rate ahead of tough public-sector wage talks . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 , retaining its hold on government despite losing parliamentary seats overall . prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's liberal-conservative coalition and its far-right ally , the danish people 's party , won 90 seats in the country 's 179-member parliament , promising voters lower taxes and a strict asylum policy .
the bloc , which now holds the narrowest possible majority , had 94 seats before the elections . the 90th vote for the coalition came from the faroe islands , a danish territory , and was n't counted until early wednesday morning , clinching the coalition 's razor-thin majority . " it 's historic that for the third election in a row the liberals are denmark 's biggest party , " said rasmussen on tuesday after most of the votes had been counted .
the party , which he leads , took 46 seats - six fewer than in the last national elections in 2005 .

this would likely irk the danish people 's party , the country 's third-largest party and a crucial coalition ally . analysts have predicted , however , that positioning such diametrically opposed parties in the government could destabilize the coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen 's coalition has been hard on refugees rasmussen 's minority coalition has maintained power only with the support of the anti-immigrant people 's party , which gained one seat in tuesday 's elections for a total of 25 .
under the influence of the far-right , the governing bloc has drastically reduced the number of refugees coming to denmark from 10,000 in 2001 to fewer than 2,000 last year , reported the afp news agency . rasmussen takes advantage of upswing the danish prime minister pushed out the social democrats to take office in 2001 , pledging tax cuts and more stringent asylum laws .
he was reelected in 2005 with a commitment to support denmark 's extensive social-welfare system . rasmussen had called parliamentary elections 15 months early in what was considered to be an effort to capitalize on the country 's strong economy and 33-year-low unemployment rate ahead of tough public-sector wage talks . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 . new vehicles that emit 100 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer or less will no longer be subject to an annual tax , according to a plan released tuesday by the german government . the car tax proposal is intended to replace the existing law , which charges car owners based on the size of their vehicle .
if approved by germany 's state governments in early december , the tax exemption would apply to vehicles admitted as of jan .
1 , 2009 . car tax coffers are intended to break even by 2013 , with high-emitters covering the lost tax revenue from new more environmentally friendly vehicles . currently , there are very few cars on the market that meet the 100-gram-per-kilometer emission standard .

germany aims to cut this amount to 120 grams by 2012 .
the goal is part of a larger environment package approved by the government in august that also targets pollutant building facilities , electronic equipment and energy plants . measures are in place europe-wide to tighten emissions levels on new vehicles in 2009 and again in 2014 .
the german finance ministry 's bid would allow for an early tax exemption for those cars that already meet the planned 2009 and 2014 standards , both of which foresee a co2 limit of 100 grams per kilometer . an eu law dictating an emissions-based vehicle tax has been on the table , but has come up against resistance from eight member countries .

13 . the 67-year-old müntefering , known for his folksy style and good working relationship with chancellor angela merkel , was a moderate who was seen as playing a stabilizing role in the coalition .
he said he was leaving office to spend more time with his wife , who has been battling cancer for years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering chose to be with his wife , leaving german politics uncertain if müntefering 's departure is not expected to break up the already unwieldy , two-year-old " grand coalition " between merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , then it is certainly likely to increase tensions , observers said . spd leader : " we will pull no punches " cdu member jürgen rüttgers , the premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , praised müntefering in an interview with deutschlandfunk radio on wednesday .
the spd leader always spoke directly and tried " to contribute to the success of the grand coalition , " rüttgers said . many predict that müntefering 's absence will strengthen germany 's belligerent far-left and , indeed , müntefering 's seat was barely cool when spd activists began testing waters with a stronger approach . on wednesday , spd acting vice chairwoman andrea nahles predicted a phase of increased left-right political hostility in germany . we will pull no punches , " she told rbb-inforadio noting that the spd planned to fight especially hard for a minimum wage for postal-delivery workers . minimum wage debate is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering was known for his terse but folksy manner earlier in the week , merkel 's coalition had shot down a müntefering-backed proposal for a postal minimum wage , leading some to speculate that his decision to step down was a political one . nahles insisted that müntefering 's replacements " wo n't be giving anything away " to the cdu . " the union will have to get used to the idea that we will be obdurate in our fight for a minimum wage , " she said .
" i think ms. merkel 's grace period has come to an end .

the spd leader always spoke directly and tried " to contribute to the success of the grand coalition , " rüttgers said . many predict that müntefering 's absence will strengthen germany 's belligerent far-left and , indeed , müntefering 's seat was barely cool when spd activists began testing waters with a stronger approach . on wednesday , spd acting vice chairwoman andrea nahles predicted a phase of increased left-right political hostility in germany . we will pull no punches , " she told rbb-inforadio noting that the spd planned to fight especially hard for a minimum wage for postal-delivery workers . minimum wage debate is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering was known for his terse but folksy manner earlier in the week , merkel 's coalition had shot down a müntefering-backed proposal for a postal minimum wage , leading some to speculate that his decision to step down was a political one . nahles insisted that müntefering 's replacements " wo n't be giving anything away " to the cdu . " the union will have to get used to the idea that we will be obdurate in our fight for a minimum wage , " she said .
" i think ms. merkel 's grace period has come to an end . " parliamentarian olaf scholz , the spd 's former secretary general , will take müntefering 's job as labor minister , and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will become germany 's vice chancellor while retaining his current duties . meanwhile , spd parliamentary group leader peter struck also foresaw difficult battles ahead , noting in an interview with deutschlandfunk that müntefering was " one of the pillars of the coalition . " some foresee stagnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp 's westerwelle expects a stalemate still , officials from both parties have said they have no desire to call early elections before 2009 because neither of the traditional rivals could win a majority with their coalition partner of choice and would likely end up again having to govern together . the leader of the opposition free-market liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , predicted stagnation in berlin . " the coalition is formally still in office , but it has long stopped governing , " he said .
" it is bad for germany because we will now have a months-long , and if we are unlucky two-year-long , general election campaign ahead of us . " a representative of the opposition green party said the cabinet changes indicated that leading government members no longer believe in continuity of the coalition . volker beck , the green party 's secretary general , told the dpa news service that the fact that spd party chief kurt beck decided not to take over the vice chancellor and labor minister positions was a clear sign " that beck does not trust the peace in berlin . " " dramatic challenge " for the coalition if beck were to join in the coalition cabinet , it would undercut his ability to wage a campaign opposing the cdu in the next national elections , the green party politician said . müntefering 's departure " dramatically damaged " the coalition 's situation , giving each party a chance to try and push its own agenda further , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck turned down the cabinet job for his part , cdu parliamentary group leader norbert röttgen told ard public broadcaster that he did n't expect the minimum-wage debate to remain the central point of contention for the next two years . he also cast doubt on the forecasts that government debate would become increasingly hostile . if that were the case , the politicians who step into müntefering 's shoes would be letting him down by turning their back on what meant most to the politician : his conviction that the spd " should be part of the grand coalition , and should be identified with its successes .

he said canadian troops in the kandahar province stopped handing over prisoners until their safety and human rights could be guaranteed . the general added that isaf rules of engagement agreed to by the nato council required soldiers to convey prisoners to the afghan security officials within 96 hours . " i now expect politicians to become active and influence the afghan government to change things , " ramms told deutsche welle .
" if we obey the rules agreed on and given to us , it is terrible for the soldiers to be the ones accused of acting inappropriately . " investigation to begin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soldiers are not to blame for applying the rules given to them , ramms said afghan president hamid karzai 's government announced on wednesday that it will investigate amnesty 's claims . " an authorized commission appointed by the president will seriously investigate the issue , " the afghan foreign ministry said in a statement .
" afghanistan is against any physical and mental torture and is committed to all international human rights standards which are also stated in the afghan constitution . " isaf has 40,000 troops in afghanistan from 37 countries .

14 , retaining its hold on government despite losing parliamentary seats overall . prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's liberal-conservative coalition and its far-right ally , the danish people 's party , won 90 seats in the country 's 179-member parliament , promising voters lower taxes and a strict asylum policy .
the bloc , which now holds the narrowest possible majority , had 94 seats before the elections . the 90th vote for the coalition came from the faroe islands , a danish territory , and was n't counted until early wednesday morning , clinching the coalition 's razor-thin majority . " it 's historic that for the third election in a row the liberals are denmark 's biggest party , " said rasmussen on tuesday after most of the votes had been counted .
the party , which he leads , took 46 seats - six fewer than in the last national elections in 2005 .
their conservative party coalition partners held steady with 18 seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naser khader , center , founded the new alliance this year rasmussen 's opponent , social democratic leader hell thorning-schmidt - who would have become denmark 's first female prime minister - was strong in the polls in the runup to the elections , though the incumbent pulled ahead on tuesday .
thorning-schmidt 's party lost two parliamentary seats , coming in with 45 . pro-immigrant party enters parliament rasmussen is expected to hold talks on whether to include the new alliance , a party founded in may 2007 by syrian-born naser khader .
the new alliance , whose self-declared aim is to break up the governing bloc and reduce the influence of the danish people 's party , entered parliament tuesday with its first five seats . khader 's party has said it would support rasmussen in exchange for , among other things , a milder refugee policy .
this would likely irk the danish people 's party , the country 's third-largest party and a crucial coalition ally . analysts have predicted , however , that positioning such diametrically opposed parties in the government could destabilize the coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen 's coalition has been hard on refugees rasmussen 's minority coalition has maintained power only with the support of the anti-immigrant people 's party , which gained one seat in tuesday 's elections for a total of 25 .
under the influence of the far-right , the governing bloc has drastically reduced the number of refugees coming to denmark from 10,000 in 2001 to fewer than 2,000 last year , reported the afp news agency . rasmussen takes advantage of upswing the danish prime minister pushed out the social democrats to take office in 2001 , pledging tax cuts and more stringent asylum laws .
he was reelected in 2005 with a commitment to support denmark 's extensive social-welfare system . rasmussen had called parliamentary elections 15 months early in what was considered to be an effort to capitalize on the country 's strong economy and 33-year-low unemployment rate ahead of tough public-sector wage talks . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , german deputy chancellor and labor minister franz müntefering said he was stepping down because of his wife 's serious illness .
dw 's peter stützle takes a look back at his career . franz müntefering is retiring at the age of 67 , were it not for the tragic circumstances of his wife 's struggle against cancer , one would be tempted to say that it 's fitting .
müntefering was the one who suggested raising the retirement age in germany from 65 to 67 . that was a bold step for a social democrat , drawing a huge outcry from labor unions and giving a central issue to the newly formed rival left party .
previously , as part of the spd-led government under gerhard schröder , müntefering had also been a major advocate of the agenda 2010 reforms , which cut back the social welfare state . but müntefering was anything but a neo-liberal capitalist .
he was also the one who accused investors of snapping up profits and destroying jobs like a plague of locusts .
müntefering was an old-school social democrat who only pushed for painful cuts to ensure that social welfare programs remained affordable . recently , müntefering had to swallow a number of political defeats .
two weeks ago , at the spd party conference , his rival kurt beck convinced social democrats to back reforms to müntefering 's agenda 2010 , and on monday , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition dismissed his idea for a minimum wage for mail deliverers . those defeats did n't mean he had to retire .
the spd may have voted against him on one issue , but the party still celebrated him as a hero , and merkel has never tired in her praise for müntefering as a stabilizing factor within the governing coalition . but even if there is no reason to doubt that müntefering 's decision to step down was a personal , and not a political one , he chose an apt juncture to do so .
germany is halfway through the current legislative period , and his successors will have enough time to make names for themselves .
moreover , party leader kurt beck will have a free hand to prepare the spd for the next election . if he is to avoid an electoral debacle in 2009 , beck will have to check the rise of the left party and free the spd from merkel 's shadow .
his most recent initiatives were aimed at doing both . but beck will have to tread carefully to avoid endangering the grand coalition .
that 's why he appointed olaf scholz as labor minister - scholz is a non-ideological technocrat who wo n't disrupt the management of government with any wild escapades . the spd under beck will now enter a new phase in the struggle for political power , while franz müntefering will enter retirement - at the age of 67 . peter stützle heads dw-radio 's capital bureau in berlin -lrb- jc -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

paris ' metro was operating around 20 percent of services . meanwhile , labor minister xavier bertrand began a meeting with union leaders to seek a compromise on the pension reform that sparked the strike . the dispute centers on special conditions for public sector employees , which allow them to retire with comparable benefits two and a half years earlier than other people . the so-called " special regimes " were introduced after world war two for workers in particularly arduous jobs .

" i will carry out these reforms right to the end .
nothing will put me off my goal , " he told the european parliament during a visit to strasbourg on tuesday . " the french people approved these reforms .
i told them all about it before the elections so that i would be able to do what was necessary afterwards . " opinion polls suggest sarkozy enjoys broad support from the french public .

he said canadian troops in the kandahar province stopped handing over prisoners until their safety and human rights could be guaranteed . the general added that isaf rules of engagement agreed to by the nato council required soldiers to convey prisoners to the afghan security officials within 96 hours . " i now expect politicians to become active and influence the afghan government to change things , " ramms told deutsche welle .

" investigation to begin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soldiers are not to blame for applying the rules given to them , ramms said afghan president hamid karzai 's government announced on wednesday that it will investigate amnesty 's claims . " an authorized commission appointed by the president will seriously investigate the issue , " the afghan foreign ministry said in a statement .
" afghanistan is against any physical and mental torture and is committed to all international human rights standards which are also stated in the afghan constitution . " isaf has 40,000 troops in afghanistan from 37 countries .

13 , german deputy chancellor and labor minister franz müntefering said he was stepping down because of his wife 's serious illness .
dw 's peter stützle takes a look back at his career . franz müntefering is retiring at the age of 67 , were it not for the tragic circumstances of his wife 's struggle against cancer , one would be tempted to say that it 's fitting .
müntefering was the one who suggested raising the retirement age in germany from 65 to 67 . that was a bold step for a social democrat , drawing a huge outcry from labor unions and giving a central issue to the newly formed rival left party .
previously , as part of the spd-led government under gerhard schröder , müntefering had also been a major advocate of the agenda 2010 reforms , which cut back the social welfare state . but müntefering was anything but a neo-liberal capitalist .
he was also the one who accused investors of snapping up profits and destroying jobs like a plague of locusts .
müntefering was an old-school social democrat who only pushed for painful cuts to ensure that social welfare programs remained affordable . recently , müntefering had to swallow a number of political defeats .
two weeks ago , at the spd party conference , his rival kurt beck convinced social democrats to back reforms to müntefering 's agenda 2010 , and on monday , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition dismissed his idea for a minimum wage for mail deliverers . those defeats did n't mean he had to retire .
the spd may have voted against him on one issue , but the party still celebrated him as a hero , and merkel has never tired in her praise for müntefering as a stabilizing factor within the governing coalition . but even if there is no reason to doubt that müntefering 's decision to step down was a personal , and not a political one , he chose an apt juncture to do so .
germany is halfway through the current legislative period , and his successors will have enough time to make names for themselves .
moreover , party leader kurt beck will have a free hand to prepare the spd for the next election . if he is to avoid an electoral debacle in 2009 , beck will have to check the rise of the left party and free the spd from merkel 's shadow .
his most recent initiatives were aimed at doing both . but beck will have to tread carefully to avoid endangering the grand coalition .
that 's why he appointed olaf scholz as labor minister - scholz is a non-ideological technocrat who wo n't disrupt the management of government with any wild escapades . the spd under beck will now enter a new phase in the struggle for political power , while franz müntefering will enter retirement - at the age of 67 . peter stützle heads dw-radio 's capital bureau in berlin -lrb- jc -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

müntefering was the one who suggested raising the retirement age in germany from 65 to 67 . that was a bold step for a social democrat , drawing a huge outcry from labor unions and giving a central issue to the newly formed rival left party .
previously , as part of the spd-led government under gerhard schröder , müntefering had also been a major advocate of the agenda 2010 reforms , which cut back the social welfare state . but müntefering was anything but a neo-liberal capitalist .
he was also the one who accused investors of snapping up profits and destroying jobs like a plague of locusts .
müntefering was an old-school social democrat who only pushed for painful cuts to ensure that social welfare programs remained affordable . recently , müntefering had to swallow a number of political defeats .
two weeks ago , at the spd party conference , his rival kurt beck convinced social democrats to back reforms to müntefering 's agenda 2010 , and on monday , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition dismissed his idea for a minimum wage for mail deliverers . those defeats did n't mean he had to retire .
the spd may have voted against him on one issue , but the party still celebrated him as a hero , and merkel has never tired in her praise for müntefering as a stabilizing factor within the governing coalition . but even if there is no reason to doubt that müntefering 's decision to step down was a personal , and not a political one , he chose an apt juncture to do so .
germany is halfway through the current legislative period , and his successors will have enough time to make names for themselves .
moreover , party leader kurt beck will have a free hand to prepare the spd for the next election . if he is to avoid an electoral debacle in 2009 , beck will have to check the rise of the left party and free the spd from merkel 's shadow .
his most recent initiatives were aimed at doing both . but beck will have to tread carefully to avoid endangering the grand coalition .
that 's why he appointed olaf scholz as labor minister - scholz is a non-ideological technocrat who wo n't disrupt the management of government with any wild escapades . the spd under beck will now enter a new phase in the struggle for political power , while franz müntefering will enter retirement - at the age of 67 . peter stützle heads dw-radio 's capital bureau in berlin -lrb- jc -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 , retaining its hold on government despite losing parliamentary seats overall . prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's liberal-conservative coalition and its far-right ally , the danish people 's party , won 90 seats in the country 's 179-member parliament , promising voters lower taxes and a strict asylum policy .
the bloc , which now holds the narrowest possible majority , had 94 seats before the elections . the 90th vote for the coalition came from the faroe islands , a danish territory , and was n't counted until early wednesday morning , clinching the coalition 's razor-thin majority . " it 's historic that for the third election in a row the liberals are denmark 's biggest party , " said rasmussen on tuesday after most of the votes had been counted .
the party , which he leads , took 46 seats - six fewer than in the last national elections in 2005 .

the new alliance , whose self-declared aim is to break up the governing bloc and reduce the influence of the danish people 's party , entered parliament tuesday with its first five seats . khader 's party has said it would support rasmussen in exchange for , among other things , a milder refugee policy .
this would likely irk the danish people 's party , the country 's third-largest party and a crucial coalition ally . analysts have predicted , however , that positioning such diametrically opposed parties in the government could destabilize the coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen 's coalition has been hard on refugees rasmussen 's minority coalition has maintained power only with the support of the anti-immigrant people 's party , which gained one seat in tuesday 's elections for a total of 25 .
under the influence of the far-right , the governing bloc has drastically reduced the number of refugees coming to denmark from 10,000 in 2001 to fewer than 2,000 last year , reported the afp news agency . rasmussen takes advantage of upswing the danish prime minister pushed out the social democrats to take office in 2001 , pledging tax cuts and more stringent asylum laws .
he was reelected in 2005 with a commitment to support denmark 's extensive social-welfare system . rasmussen had called parliamentary elections 15 months early in what was considered to be an effort to capitalize on the country 's strong economy and 33-year-low unemployment rate ahead of tough public-sector wage talks . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are aware of individual cases where employees in afghan prisons committed actions that , according to international law , certainly do not meet our expectations , " german gen. egon ramms told deutsche welle on wednesday , nov .
14 . the general added that the situation was not widespread and that the alliance wanted to prevent additional cases by allowing nato 's military leaders on the ground to decide if prisoners were transferred to afghan authorities . the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- was accused by amnesty international on tuesday of exposing detainees to abuse by handing them over to afghan security authorities who tortured the detainees . the human rights group called for prisoner transfers to stop " until effective safeguards against torture and other ill-treatment are introduced in the afghan detention system . " pressure on afghan government needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramms said the isaf soldiers had no choice in giving prisoners to afghan authorities the isaf had previously said it was not aware of any abuse . " nato-isaf has no evidence of systematic mistreatment and torture of detainees who have been handed over to afghan authorities by isaf , " alliance spokesman nicholas lunt told reporters .
" the business of monitoring prisoners who have been handed over by isaf is the responsibility of individual nations . " ramms , however , said nato was aware of indications that transferred detainees were being abused by afghan authorities .
he said canadian troops in the kandahar province stopped handing over prisoners until their safety and human rights could be guaranteed . the general added that isaf rules of engagement agreed to by the nato council required soldiers to convey prisoners to the afghan security officials within 96 hours . " i now expect politicians to become active and influence the afghan government to change things , " ramms told deutsche welle .
" if we obey the rules agreed on and given to us , it is terrible for the soldiers to be the ones accused of acting inappropriately . " investigation to begin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soldiers are not to blame for applying the rules given to them , ramms said afghan president hamid karzai 's government announced on wednesday that it will investigate amnesty 's claims . " an authorized commission appointed by the president will seriously investigate the issue , " the afghan foreign ministry said in a statement .
" afghanistan is against any physical and mental torture and is committed to all international human rights standards which are also stated in the afghan constitution . " isaf has 40,000 troops in afghanistan from 37 countries .

13 . the 67-year-old müntefering , known for his folksy style and good working relationship with chancellor angela merkel , was a moderate who was seen as playing a stabilizing role in the coalition .
he said he was leaving office to spend more time with his wife , who has been battling cancer for years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering chose to be with his wife , leaving german politics uncertain if müntefering 's departure is not expected to break up the already unwieldy , two-year-old " grand coalition " between merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , then it is certainly likely to increase tensions , observers said . spd leader : " we will pull no punches " cdu member jürgen rüttgers , the premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , praised müntefering in an interview with deutschlandfunk radio on wednesday .
the spd leader always spoke directly and tried " to contribute to the success of the grand coalition , " rüttgers said . many predict that müntefering 's absence will strengthen germany 's belligerent far-left and , indeed , müntefering 's seat was barely cool when spd activists began testing waters with a stronger approach . on wednesday , spd acting vice chairwoman andrea nahles predicted a phase of increased left-right political hostility in germany . we will pull no punches , " she told rbb-inforadio noting that the spd planned to fight especially hard for a minimum wage for postal-delivery workers . minimum wage debate is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering was known for his terse but folksy manner earlier in the week , merkel 's coalition had shot down a müntefering-backed proposal for a postal minimum wage , leading some to speculate that his decision to step down was a political one . nahles insisted that müntefering 's replacements " wo n't be giving anything away " to the cdu . " the union will have to get used to the idea that we will be obdurate in our fight for a minimum wage , " she said .

the spd leader always spoke directly and tried " to contribute to the success of the grand coalition , " rüttgers said . many predict that müntefering 's absence will strengthen germany 's belligerent far-left and , indeed , müntefering 's seat was barely cool when spd activists began testing waters with a stronger approach . on wednesday , spd acting vice chairwoman andrea nahles predicted a phase of increased left-right political hostility in germany . we will pull no punches , " she told rbb-inforadio noting that the spd planned to fight especially hard for a minimum wage for postal-delivery workers . minimum wage debate is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering was known for his terse but folksy manner earlier in the week , merkel 's coalition had shot down a müntefering-backed proposal for a postal minimum wage , leading some to speculate that his decision to step down was a political one . nahles insisted that müntefering 's replacements " wo n't be giving anything away " to the cdu . " the union will have to get used to the idea that we will be obdurate in our fight for a minimum wage , " she said .
" i think ms. merkel 's grace period has come to an end . " parliamentarian olaf scholz , the spd 's former secretary general , will take müntefering 's job as labor minister , and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will become germany 's vice chancellor while retaining his current duties . meanwhile , spd parliamentary group leader peter struck also foresaw difficult battles ahead , noting in an interview with deutschlandfunk that müntefering was " one of the pillars of the coalition . " some foresee stagnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp 's westerwelle expects a stalemate still , officials from both parties have said they have no desire to call early elections before 2009 because neither of the traditional rivals could win a majority with their coalition partner of choice and would likely end up again having to govern together . the leader of the opposition free-market liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , predicted stagnation in berlin . " the coalition is formally still in office , but it has long stopped governing , " he said .
" it is bad for germany because we will now have a months-long , and if we are unlucky two-year-long , general election campaign ahead of us . " a representative of the opposition green party said the cabinet changes indicated that leading government members no longer believe in continuity of the coalition . volker beck , the green party 's secretary general , told the dpa news service that the fact that spd party chief kurt beck decided not to take over the vice chancellor and labor minister positions was a clear sign " that beck does not trust the peace in berlin . " " dramatic challenge " for the coalition if beck were to join in the coalition cabinet , it would undercut his ability to wage a campaign opposing the cdu in the next national elections , the green party politician said . müntefering 's departure " dramatically damaged " the coalition 's situation , giving each party a chance to try and push its own agenda further , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck turned down the cabinet job for his part , cdu parliamentary group leader norbert röttgen told ard public broadcaster that he did n't expect the minimum-wage debate to remain the central point of contention for the next two years . he also cast doubt on the forecasts that government debate would become increasingly hostile . if that were the case , the politicians who step into müntefering 's shoes would be letting him down by turning their back on what meant most to the politician : his conviction that the spd " should be part of the grand coalition , and should be identified with its successes .

14 , retaining its hold on government despite losing parliamentary seats overall . prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's liberal-conservative coalition and its far-right ally , the danish people 's party , won 90 seats in the country 's 179-member parliament , promising voters lower taxes and a strict asylum policy .
the bloc , which now holds the narrowest possible majority , had 94 seats before the elections . the 90th vote for the coalition came from the faroe islands , a danish territory , and was n't counted until early wednesday morning , clinching the coalition 's razor-thin majority . " it 's historic that for the third election in a row the liberals are denmark 's biggest party , " said rasmussen on tuesday after most of the votes had been counted .
the party , which he leads , took 46 seats - six fewer than in the last national elections in 2005 .
their conservative party coalition partners held steady with 18 seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naser khader , center , founded the new alliance this year rasmussen 's opponent , social democratic leader hell thorning-schmidt - who would have become denmark 's first female prime minister - was strong in the polls in the runup to the elections , though the incumbent pulled ahead on tuesday .
thorning-schmidt 's party lost two parliamentary seats , coming in with 45 . pro-immigrant party enters parliament rasmussen is expected to hold talks on whether to include the new alliance , a party founded in may 2007 by syrian-born naser khader .
the new alliance , whose self-declared aim is to break up the governing bloc and reduce the influence of the danish people 's party , entered parliament tuesday with its first five seats . khader 's party has said it would support rasmussen in exchange for , among other things , a milder refugee policy .
this would likely irk the danish people 's party , the country 's third-largest party and a crucial coalition ally . analysts have predicted , however , that positioning such diametrically opposed parties in the government could destabilize the coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen 's coalition has been hard on refugees rasmussen 's minority coalition has maintained power only with the support of the anti-immigrant people 's party , which gained one seat in tuesday 's elections for a total of 25 .
under the influence of the far-right , the governing bloc has drastically reduced the number of refugees coming to denmark from 10,000 in 2001 to fewer than 2,000 last year , reported the afp news agency . rasmussen takes advantage of upswing the danish prime minister pushed out the social democrats to take office in 2001 , pledging tax cuts and more stringent asylum laws .
he was reelected in 2005 with a commitment to support denmark 's extensive social-welfare system . rasmussen had called parliamentary elections 15 months early in what was considered to be an effort to capitalize on the country 's strong economy and 33-year-low unemployment rate ahead of tough public-sector wage talks . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 , retaining its hold on government despite losing parliamentary seats overall . prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's liberal-conservative coalition and its far-right ally , the danish people 's party , won 90 seats in the country 's 179-member parliament , promising voters lower taxes and a strict asylum policy .
the bloc , which now holds the narrowest possible majority , had 94 seats before the elections . the 90th vote for the coalition came from the faroe islands , a danish territory , and was n't counted until early wednesday morning , clinching the coalition 's razor-thin majority . " it 's historic that for the third election in a row the liberals are denmark 's biggest party , " said rasmussen on tuesday after most of the votes had been counted .
the party , which he leads , took 46 seats - six fewer than in the last national elections in 2005 .
their conservative party coalition partners held steady with 18 seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naser khader , center , founded the new alliance this year rasmussen 's opponent , social democratic leader hell thorning-schmidt - who would have become denmark 's first female prime minister - was strong in the polls in the runup to the elections , though the incumbent pulled ahead on tuesday .

the new alliance , whose self-declared aim is to break up the governing bloc and reduce the influence of the danish people 's party , entered parliament tuesday with its first five seats . khader 's party has said it would support rasmussen in exchange for , among other things , a milder refugee policy .
this would likely irk the danish people 's party , the country 's third-largest party and a crucial coalition ally . analysts have predicted , however , that positioning such diametrically opposed parties in the government could destabilize the coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen 's coalition has been hard on refugees rasmussen 's minority coalition has maintained power only with the support of the anti-immigrant people 's party , which gained one seat in tuesday 's elections for a total of 25 .
under the influence of the far-right , the governing bloc has drastically reduced the number of refugees coming to denmark from 10,000 in 2001 to fewer than 2,000 last year , reported the afp news agency . rasmussen takes advantage of upswing the danish prime minister pushed out the social democrats to take office in 2001 , pledging tax cuts and more stringent asylum laws .
he was reelected in 2005 with a commitment to support denmark 's extensive social-welfare system . rasmussen had called parliamentary elections 15 months early in what was considered to be an effort to capitalize on the country 's strong economy and 33-year-low unemployment rate ahead of tough public-sector wage talks . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , german deputy chancellor and labor minister franz müntefering said he was stepping down because of his wife 's serious illness .
dw 's peter stützle takes a look back at his career . franz müntefering is retiring at the age of 67 , were it not for the tragic circumstances of his wife 's struggle against cancer , one would be tempted to say that it 's fitting .
müntefering was the one who suggested raising the retirement age in germany from 65 to 67 . that was a bold step for a social democrat , drawing a huge outcry from labor unions and giving a central issue to the newly formed rival left party .
previously , as part of the spd-led government under gerhard schröder , müntefering had also been a major advocate of the agenda 2010 reforms , which cut back the social welfare state . but müntefering was anything but a neo-liberal capitalist .
he was also the one who accused investors of snapping up profits and destroying jobs like a plague of locusts .
müntefering was an old-school social democrat who only pushed for painful cuts to ensure that social welfare programs remained affordable . recently , müntefering had to swallow a number of political defeats .
two weeks ago , at the spd party conference , his rival kurt beck convinced social democrats to back reforms to müntefering 's agenda 2010 , and on monday , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition dismissed his idea for a minimum wage for mail deliverers . those defeats did n't mean he had to retire .
the spd may have voted against him on one issue , but the party still celebrated him as a hero , and merkel has never tired in her praise for müntefering as a stabilizing factor within the governing coalition . but even if there is no reason to doubt that müntefering 's decision to step down was a personal , and not a political one , he chose an apt juncture to do so .
germany is halfway through the current legislative period , and his successors will have enough time to make names for themselves .
moreover , party leader kurt beck will have a free hand to prepare the spd for the next election . if he is to avoid an electoral debacle in 2009 , beck will have to check the rise of the left party and free the spd from merkel 's shadow .
his most recent initiatives were aimed at doing both . but beck will have to tread carefully to avoid endangering the grand coalition .
that 's why he appointed olaf scholz as labor minister - scholz is a non-ideological technocrat who wo n't disrupt the management of government with any wild escapades . the spd under beck will now enter a new phase in the struggle for political power , while franz müntefering will enter retirement - at the age of 67 . peter stützle heads dw-radio 's capital bureau in berlin -lrb- jc -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's peter stützle takes a look back at his career . franz müntefering is retiring at the age of 67 , were it not for the tragic circumstances of his wife 's struggle against cancer , one would be tempted to say that it 's fitting .
müntefering was the one who suggested raising the retirement age in germany from 65 to 67 . that was a bold step for a social democrat , drawing a huge outcry from labor unions and giving a central issue to the newly formed rival left party .
previously , as part of the spd-led government under gerhard schröder , müntefering had also been a major advocate of the agenda 2010 reforms , which cut back the social welfare state . but müntefering was anything but a neo-liberal capitalist .
he was also the one who accused investors of snapping up profits and destroying jobs like a plague of locusts .
müntefering was an old-school social democrat who only pushed for painful cuts to ensure that social welfare programs remained affordable . recently , müntefering had to swallow a number of political defeats .
two weeks ago , at the spd party conference , his rival kurt beck convinced social democrats to back reforms to müntefering 's agenda 2010 , and on monday , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition dismissed his idea for a minimum wage for mail deliverers . those defeats did n't mean he had to retire .
the spd may have voted against him on one issue , but the party still celebrated him as a hero , and merkel has never tired in her praise for müntefering as a stabilizing factor within the governing coalition . but even if there is no reason to doubt that müntefering 's decision to step down was a personal , and not a political one , he chose an apt juncture to do so .
germany is halfway through the current legislative period , and his successors will have enough time to make names for themselves .
moreover , party leader kurt beck will have a free hand to prepare the spd for the next election . if he is to avoid an electoral debacle in 2009 , beck will have to check the rise of the left party and free the spd from merkel 's shadow .
his most recent initiatives were aimed at doing both . but beck will have to tread carefully to avoid endangering the grand coalition .
that 's why he appointed olaf scholz as labor minister - scholz is a non-ideological technocrat who wo n't disrupt the management of government with any wild escapades . the spd under beck will now enter a new phase in the struggle for political power , while franz müntefering will enter retirement - at the age of 67 . peter stützle heads dw-radio 's capital bureau in berlin -lrb- jc -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the spd leader always spoke directly and tried " to contribute to the success of the grand coalition , " rüttgers said . many predict that müntefering 's absence will strengthen germany 's belligerent far-left and , indeed , müntefering 's seat was barely cool when spd activists began testing waters with a stronger approach . on wednesday , spd acting vice chairwoman andrea nahles predicted a phase of increased left-right political hostility in germany . we will pull no punches , " she told rbb-inforadio noting that the spd planned to fight especially hard for a minimum wage for postal-delivery workers . minimum wage debate is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering was known for his terse but folksy manner earlier in the week , merkel 's coalition had shot down a müntefering-backed proposal for a postal minimum wage , leading some to speculate that his decision to step down was a political one . nahles insisted that müntefering 's replacements " wo n't be giving anything away " to the cdu . " the union will have to get used to the idea that we will be obdurate in our fight for a minimum wage , " she said .
" i think ms. merkel 's grace period has come to an end . " parliamentarian olaf scholz , the spd 's former secretary general , will take müntefering 's job as labor minister , and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will become germany 's vice chancellor while retaining his current duties . meanwhile , spd parliamentary group leader peter struck also foresaw difficult battles ahead , noting in an interview with deutschlandfunk that müntefering was " one of the pillars of the coalition . " some foresee stagnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp 's westerwelle expects a stalemate still , officials from both parties have said they have no desire to call early elections before 2009 because neither of the traditional rivals could win a majority with their coalition partner of choice and would likely end up again having to govern together . the leader of the opposition free-market liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , predicted stagnation in berlin . " the coalition is formally still in office , but it has long stopped governing , " he said .
" it is bad for germany because we will now have a months-long , and if we are unlucky two-year-long , general election campaign ahead of us . " a representative of the opposition green party said the cabinet changes indicated that leading government members no longer believe in continuity of the coalition . volker beck , the green party 's secretary general , told the dpa news service that the fact that spd party chief kurt beck decided not to take over the vice chancellor and labor minister positions was a clear sign " that beck does not trust the peace in berlin . " " dramatic challenge " for the coalition if beck were to join in the coalition cabinet , it would undercut his ability to wage a campaign opposing the cdu in the next national elections , the green party politician said . müntefering 's departure " dramatically damaged " the coalition 's situation , giving each party a chance to try and push its own agenda further , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck turned down the cabinet job for his part , cdu parliamentary group leader norbert röttgen told ard public broadcaster that he did n't expect the minimum-wage debate to remain the central point of contention for the next two years . he also cast doubt on the forecasts that government debate would become increasingly hostile . if that were the case , the politicians who step into müntefering 's shoes would be letting him down by turning their back on what meant most to the politician : his conviction that the spd " should be part of the grand coalition , and should be identified with its successes .

" pressure on afghan government needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramms said the isaf soldiers had no choice in giving prisoners to afghan authorities the isaf had previously said it was not aware of any abuse . " nato-isaf has no evidence of systematic mistreatment and torture of detainees who have been handed over to afghan authorities by isaf , " alliance spokesman nicholas lunt told reporters .
" the business of monitoring prisoners who have been handed over by isaf is the responsibility of individual nations . " ramms , however , said nato was aware of indications that transferred detainees were being abused by afghan authorities .
he said canadian troops in the kandahar province stopped handing over prisoners until their safety and human rights could be guaranteed . the general added that isaf rules of engagement agreed to by the nato council required soldiers to convey prisoners to the afghan security officials within 96 hours . " i now expect politicians to become active and influence the afghan government to change things , " ramms told deutsche welle .
" if we obey the rules agreed on and given to us , it is terrible for the soldiers to be the ones accused of acting inappropriately . " investigation to begin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soldiers are not to blame for applying the rules given to them , ramms said afghan president hamid karzai 's government announced on wednesday that it will investigate amnesty 's claims . " an authorized commission appointed by the president will seriously investigate the issue , " the afghan foreign ministry said in a statement .
" afghanistan is against any physical and mental torture and is committed to all international human rights standards which are also stated in the afghan constitution . " isaf has 40,000 troops in afghanistan from 37 countries .

13 . new vehicles that emit 100 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer or less will no longer be subject to an annual tax , according to a plan released tuesday by the german government . the car tax proposal is intended to replace the existing law , which charges car owners based on the size of their vehicle .
if approved by germany 's state governments in early december , the tax exemption would apply to vehicles admitted as of jan .
1 , 2009 . car tax coffers are intended to break even by 2013 , with high-emitters covering the lost tax revenue from new more environmentally friendly vehicles . currently , there are very few cars on the market that meet the 100-gram-per-kilometer emission standard .

the goal is part of a larger environment package approved by the government in august that also targets pollutant building facilities , electronic equipment and energy plants . measures are in place europe-wide to tighten emissions levels on new vehicles in 2009 and again in 2014 .
the german finance ministry 's bid would allow for an early tax exemption for those cars that already meet the planned 2009 and 2014 standards , both of which foresee a co2 limit of 100 grams per kilometer . an eu law dictating an emissions-based vehicle tax has been on the table , but has come up against resistance from eight member countries .

13 , german deputy chancellor and labor minister franz müntefering said he was stepping down because of his wife 's serious illness .
dw 's peter stützle takes a look back at his career . franz müntefering is retiring at the age of 67 , were it not for the tragic circumstances of his wife 's struggle against cancer , one would be tempted to say that it 's fitting .
müntefering was the one who suggested raising the retirement age in germany from 65 to 67 . that was a bold step for a social democrat , drawing a huge outcry from labor unions and giving a central issue to the newly formed rival left party .
previously , as part of the spd-led government under gerhard schröder , müntefering had also been a major advocate of the agenda 2010 reforms , which cut back the social welfare state . but müntefering was anything but a neo-liberal capitalist .
he was also the one who accused investors of snapping up profits and destroying jobs like a plague of locusts .
müntefering was an old-school social democrat who only pushed for painful cuts to ensure that social welfare programs remained affordable . recently , müntefering had to swallow a number of political defeats .
two weeks ago , at the spd party conference , his rival kurt beck convinced social democrats to back reforms to müntefering 's agenda 2010 , and on monday , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition dismissed his idea for a minimum wage for mail deliverers . those defeats did n't mean he had to retire .
the spd may have voted against him on one issue , but the party still celebrated him as a hero , and merkel has never tired in her praise for müntefering as a stabilizing factor within the governing coalition . but even if there is no reason to doubt that müntefering 's decision to step down was a personal , and not a political one , he chose an apt juncture to do so .
germany is halfway through the current legislative period , and his successors will have enough time to make names for themselves .
moreover , party leader kurt beck will have a free hand to prepare the spd for the next election . if he is to avoid an electoral debacle in 2009 , beck will have to check the rise of the left party and free the spd from merkel 's shadow .
his most recent initiatives were aimed at doing both . but beck will have to tread carefully to avoid endangering the grand coalition .
that 's why he appointed olaf scholz as labor minister - scholz is a non-ideological technocrat who wo n't disrupt the management of government with any wild escapades . the spd under beck will now enter a new phase in the struggle for political power , while franz müntefering will enter retirement - at the age of 67 . peter stützle heads dw-radio 's capital bureau in berlin -lrb- jc -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bloc , which now holds the narrowest possible majority , had 94 seats before the elections . the 90th vote for the coalition came from the faroe islands , a danish territory , and was n't counted until early wednesday morning , clinching the coalition 's razor-thin majority .

13 , german deputy chancellor and labor minister franz müntefering said he was stepping down because of his wife 's serious illness .
dw 's peter stützle takes a look back at his career . franz müntefering is retiring at the age of 67 , were it not for the tragic circumstances of his wife 's struggle against cancer , one would be tempted to say that it 's fitting .
müntefering was the one who suggested raising the retirement age in germany from 65 to 67 . that was a bold step for a social democrat , drawing a huge outcry from labor unions and giving a central issue to the newly formed rival left party .
previously , as part of the spd-led government under gerhard schröder , müntefering had also been a major advocate of the agenda 2010 reforms , which cut back the social welfare state . but müntefering was anything but a neo-liberal capitalist .
he was also the one who accused investors of snapping up profits and destroying jobs like a plague of locusts .
müntefering was an old-school social democrat who only pushed for painful cuts to ensure that social welfare programs remained affordable . recently , müntefering had to swallow a number of political defeats .
two weeks ago , at the spd party conference , his rival kurt beck convinced social democrats to back reforms to müntefering 's agenda 2010 , and on monday , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition dismissed his idea for a minimum wage for mail deliverers . those defeats did n't mean he had to retire .
the spd may have voted against him on one issue , but the party still celebrated him as a hero , and merkel has never tired in her praise for müntefering as a stabilizing factor within the governing coalition . but even if there is no reason to doubt that müntefering 's decision to step down was a personal , and not a political one , he chose an apt juncture to do so .
germany is halfway through the current legislative period , and his successors will have enough time to make names for themselves .
moreover , party leader kurt beck will have a free hand to prepare the spd for the next election . if he is to avoid an electoral debacle in 2009 , beck will have to check the rise of the left party and free the spd from merkel 's shadow .
his most recent initiatives were aimed at doing both . but beck will have to tread carefully to avoid endangering the grand coalition .
that 's why he appointed olaf scholz as labor minister - scholz is a non-ideological technocrat who wo n't disrupt the management of government with any wild escapades . the spd under beck will now enter a new phase in the struggle for political power , while franz müntefering will enter retirement - at the age of 67 . peter stützle heads dw-radio 's capital bureau in berlin -lrb- jc -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 . new vehicles that emit 100 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer or less will no longer be subject to an annual tax , according to a plan released tuesday by the german government . the car tax proposal is intended to replace the existing law , which charges car owners based on the size of their vehicle .
if approved by germany 's state governments in early december , the tax exemption would apply to vehicles admitted as of jan .
1 , 2009 . car tax coffers are intended to break even by 2013 , with high-emitters covering the lost tax revenue from new more environmentally friendly vehicles . currently , there are very few cars on the market that meet the 100-gram-per-kilometer emission standard .
starting in 2009 , a sliding tax scale would apply to new vehicles with higher co2 emissions . old vehicles would continue to be charged according to their size , but at higher rates . germany , europe seek gradual co2 reduction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tax plan is intended to influence those in the market for a new car new cars now emit an average of 170 grams of co2 per kilometer .
germany aims to cut this amount to 120 grams by 2012 .
the goal is part of a larger environment package approved by the government in august that also targets pollutant building facilities , electronic equipment and energy plants . measures are in place europe-wide to tighten emissions levels on new vehicles in 2009 and again in 2014 .
the german finance ministry 's bid would allow for an early tax exemption for those cars that already meet the planned 2009 and 2014 standards , both of which foresee a co2 limit of 100 grams per kilometer . an eu law dictating an emissions-based vehicle tax has been on the table , but has come up against resistance from eight member countries .
germany has said it would support the motion from brussels . critics decry proposal 's scope the environmentally-oriented german traffic club -lrb- vcd -rrb- has criticized germany 's new vehicle tax plan for not going far enough . vcd auto expert gerd lottsiepen said that each gram of co2 cost the same amount , gas-guzzling cars would hardly be more expensive than before , news agency dpa reported . the organization has suggested a tax advantage for vehicles with especially high gas mileage as well as low emissions . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 . the 67-year-old müntefering , known for his folksy style and good working relationship with chancellor angela merkel , was a moderate who was seen as playing a stabilizing role in the coalition .
he said he was leaving office to spend more time with his wife , who has been battling cancer for years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering chose to be with his wife , leaving german politics uncertain if müntefering 's departure is not expected to break up the already unwieldy , two-year-old " grand coalition " between merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , then it is certainly likely to increase tensions , observers said . spd leader : " we will pull no punches " cdu member jürgen rüttgers , the premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , praised müntefering in an interview with deutschlandfunk radio on wednesday .
the spd leader always spoke directly and tried " to contribute to the success of the grand coalition , " rüttgers said . many predict that müntefering 's absence will strengthen germany 's belligerent far-left and , indeed , müntefering 's seat was barely cool when spd activists began testing waters with a stronger approach . on wednesday , spd acting vice chairwoman andrea nahles predicted a phase of increased left-right political hostility in germany . we will pull no punches , " she told rbb-inforadio noting that the spd planned to fight especially hard for a minimum wage for postal-delivery workers . minimum wage debate is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering was known for his terse but folksy manner earlier in the week , merkel 's coalition had shot down a müntefering-backed proposal for a postal minimum wage , leading some to speculate that his decision to step down was a political one . nahles insisted that müntefering 's replacements " wo n't be giving anything away " to the cdu . " the union will have to get used to the idea that we will be obdurate in our fight for a minimum wage , " she said .
" i think ms. merkel 's grace period has come to an end . " parliamentarian olaf scholz , the spd 's former secretary general , will take müntefering 's job as labor minister , and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will become germany 's vice chancellor while retaining his current duties . meanwhile , spd parliamentary group leader peter struck also foresaw difficult battles ahead , noting in an interview with deutschlandfunk that müntefering was " one of the pillars of the coalition . " some foresee stagnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp 's westerwelle expects a stalemate still , officials from both parties have said they have no desire to call early elections before 2009 because neither of the traditional rivals could win a majority with their coalition partner of choice and would likely end up again having to govern together . the leader of the opposition free-market liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , predicted stagnation in berlin . " the coalition is formally still in office , but it has long stopped governing , " he said .
" it is bad for germany because we will now have a months-long , and if we are unlucky two-year-long , general election campaign ahead of us . " a representative of the opposition green party said the cabinet changes indicated that leading government members no longer believe in continuity of the coalition . volker beck , the green party 's secretary general , told the dpa news service that the fact that spd party chief kurt beck decided not to take over the vice chancellor and labor minister positions was a clear sign " that beck does not trust the peace in berlin . " " dramatic challenge " for the coalition if beck were to join in the coalition cabinet , it would undercut his ability to wage a campaign opposing the cdu in the next national elections , the green party politician said . müntefering 's departure " dramatically damaged " the coalition 's situation , giving each party a chance to try and push its own agenda further , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck turned down the cabinet job for his part , cdu parliamentary group leader norbert röttgen told ard public broadcaster that he did n't expect the minimum-wage debate to remain the central point of contention for the next two years . he also cast doubt on the forecasts that government debate would become increasingly hostile . if that were the case , the politicians who step into müntefering 's shoes would be letting him down by turning their back on what meant most to the politician : his conviction that the spd " should be part of the grand coalition , and should be identified with its successes .

he said he was leaving office to spend more time with his wife , who has been battling cancer for years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering chose to be with his wife , leaving german politics uncertain if müntefering 's departure is not expected to break up the already unwieldy , two-year-old " grand coalition " between merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , then it is certainly likely to increase tensions , observers said . spd leader : " we will pull no punches " cdu member jürgen rüttgers , the premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , praised müntefering in an interview with deutschlandfunk radio on wednesday .
the spd leader always spoke directly and tried " to contribute to the success of the grand coalition , " rüttgers said . many predict that müntefering 's absence will strengthen germany 's belligerent far-left and , indeed , müntefering 's seat was barely cool when spd activists began testing waters with a stronger approach . on wednesday , spd acting vice chairwoman andrea nahles predicted a phase of increased left-right political hostility in germany . we will pull no punches , " she told rbb-inforadio noting that the spd planned to fight especially hard for a minimum wage for postal-delivery workers . minimum wage debate is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering was known for his terse but folksy manner earlier in the week , merkel 's coalition had shot down a müntefering-backed proposal for a postal minimum wage , leading some to speculate that his decision to step down was a political one . nahles insisted that müntefering 's replacements " wo n't be giving anything away " to the cdu . " the union will have to get used to the idea that we will be obdurate in our fight for a minimum wage , " she said .
" i think ms. merkel 's grace period has come to an end . " parliamentarian olaf scholz , the spd 's former secretary general , will take müntefering 's job as labor minister , and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will become germany 's vice chancellor while retaining his current duties . meanwhile , spd parliamentary group leader peter struck also foresaw difficult battles ahead , noting in an interview with deutschlandfunk that müntefering was " one of the pillars of the coalition . " some foresee stagnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp 's westerwelle expects a stalemate still , officials from both parties have said they have no desire to call early elections before 2009 because neither of the traditional rivals could win a majority with their coalition partner of choice and would likely end up again having to govern together . the leader of the opposition free-market liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , predicted stagnation in berlin . " the coalition is formally still in office , but it has long stopped governing , " he said .
" it is bad for germany because we will now have a months-long , and if we are unlucky two-year-long , general election campaign ahead of us . " a representative of the opposition green party said the cabinet changes indicated that leading government members no longer believe in continuity of the coalition . volker beck , the green party 's secretary general , told the dpa news service that the fact that spd party chief kurt beck decided not to take over the vice chancellor and labor minister positions was a clear sign " that beck does not trust the peace in berlin . " " dramatic challenge " for the coalition if beck were to join in the coalition cabinet , it would undercut his ability to wage a campaign opposing the cdu in the next national elections , the green party politician said . müntefering 's departure " dramatically damaged " the coalition 's situation , giving each party a chance to try and push its own agenda further , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck turned down the cabinet job for his part , cdu parliamentary group leader norbert röttgen told ard public broadcaster that he did n't expect the minimum-wage debate to remain the central point of contention for the next two years . he also cast doubt on the forecasts that government debate would become increasingly hostile . if that were the case , the politicians who step into müntefering 's shoes would be letting him down by turning their back on what meant most to the politician : his conviction that the spd " should be part of the grand coalition , and should be identified with its successes .

14 , retaining its hold on government despite losing parliamentary seats overall . prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's liberal-conservative coalition and its far-right ally , the danish people 's party , won 90 seats in the country 's 179-member parliament , promising voters lower taxes and a strict asylum policy .
the bloc , which now holds the narrowest possible majority , had 94 seats before the elections . the 90th vote for the coalition came from the faroe islands , a danish territory , and was n't counted until early wednesday morning , clinching the coalition 's razor-thin majority . " it 's historic that for the third election in a row the liberals are denmark 's biggest party , " said rasmussen on tuesday after most of the votes had been counted .
the party , which he leads , took 46 seats - six fewer than in the last national elections in 2005 .

he was reelected in 2005 with a commitment to support denmark 's extensive social-welfare system . rasmussen had called parliamentary elections 15 months early in what was considered to be an effort to capitalize on the country 's strong economy and 33-year-low unemployment rate ahead of tough public-sector wage talks . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , german deputy chancellor and labor minister franz müntefering said he was stepping down because of his wife 's serious illness .
dw 's peter stützle takes a look back at his career . franz müntefering is retiring at the age of 67 , were it not for the tragic circumstances of his wife 's struggle against cancer , one would be tempted to say that it 's fitting .
müntefering was the one who suggested raising the retirement age in germany from 65 to 67 . that was a bold step for a social democrat , drawing a huge outcry from labor unions and giving a central issue to the newly formed rival left party .
previously , as part of the spd-led government under gerhard schröder , müntefering had also been a major advocate of the agenda 2010 reforms , which cut back the social welfare state . but müntefering was anything but a neo-liberal capitalist .
he was also the one who accused investors of snapping up profits and destroying jobs like a plague of locusts .
müntefering was an old-school social democrat who only pushed for painful cuts to ensure that social welfare programs remained affordable . recently , müntefering had to swallow a number of political defeats .
two weeks ago , at the spd party conference , his rival kurt beck convinced social democrats to back reforms to müntefering 's agenda 2010 , and on monday , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition dismissed his idea for a minimum wage for mail deliverers . those defeats did n't mean he had to retire .
the spd may have voted against him on one issue , but the party still celebrated him as a hero , and merkel has never tired in her praise for müntefering as a stabilizing factor within the governing coalition . but even if there is no reason to doubt that müntefering 's decision to step down was a personal , and not a political one , he chose an apt juncture to do so .
germany is halfway through the current legislative period , and his successors will have enough time to make names for themselves .
moreover , party leader kurt beck will have a free hand to prepare the spd for the next election . if he is to avoid an electoral debacle in 2009 , beck will have to check the rise of the left party and free the spd from merkel 's shadow .
his most recent initiatives were aimed at doing both . but beck will have to tread carefully to avoid endangering the grand coalition .
that 's why he appointed olaf scholz as labor minister - scholz is a non-ideological technocrat who wo n't disrupt the management of government with any wild escapades . the spd under beck will now enter a new phase in the struggle for political power , while franz müntefering will enter retirement - at the age of 67 . peter stützle heads dw-radio 's capital bureau in berlin -lrb- jc -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 , retaining its hold on government despite losing parliamentary seats overall . prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's liberal-conservative coalition and its far-right ally , the danish people 's party , won 90 seats in the country 's 179-member parliament , promising voters lower taxes and a strict asylum policy .
the bloc , which now holds the narrowest possible majority , had 94 seats before the elections . the 90th vote for the coalition came from the faroe islands , a danish territory , and was n't counted until early wednesday morning , clinching the coalition 's razor-thin majority . " it 's historic that for the third election in a row the liberals are denmark 's biggest party , " said rasmussen on tuesday after most of the votes had been counted .
the party , which he leads , took 46 seats - six fewer than in the last national elections in 2005 .
their conservative party coalition partners held steady with 18 seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naser khader , center , founded the new alliance this year rasmussen 's opponent , social democratic leader hell thorning-schmidt - who would have become denmark 's first female prime minister - was strong in the polls in the runup to the elections , though the incumbent pulled ahead on tuesday .
thorning-schmidt 's party lost two parliamentary seats , coming in with 45 . pro-immigrant party enters parliament rasmussen is expected to hold talks on whether to include the new alliance , a party founded in may 2007 by syrian-born naser khader .
the new alliance , whose self-declared aim is to break up the governing bloc and reduce the influence of the danish people 's party , entered parliament tuesday with its first five seats . khader 's party has said it would support rasmussen in exchange for , among other things , a milder refugee policy .
this would likely irk the danish people 's party , the country 's third-largest party and a crucial coalition ally . analysts have predicted , however , that positioning such diametrically opposed parties in the government could destabilize the coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen 's coalition has been hard on refugees rasmussen 's minority coalition has maintained power only with the support of the anti-immigrant people 's party , which gained one seat in tuesday 's elections for a total of 25 .
under the influence of the far-right , the governing bloc has drastically reduced the number of refugees coming to denmark from 10,000 in 2001 to fewer than 2,000 last year , reported the afp news agency . rasmussen takes advantage of upswing the danish prime minister pushed out the social democrats to take office in 2001 , pledging tax cuts and more stringent asylum laws .
he was reelected in 2005 with a commitment to support denmark 's extensive social-welfare system . rasmussen had called parliamentary elections 15 months early in what was considered to be an effort to capitalize on the country 's strong economy and 33-year-low unemployment rate ahead of tough public-sector wage talks . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

müntefering was the one who suggested raising the retirement age in germany from 65 to 67 . that was a bold step for a social democrat , drawing a huge outcry from labor unions and giving a central issue to the newly formed rival left party .
previously , as part of the spd-led government under gerhard schröder , müntefering had also been a major advocate of the agenda 2010 reforms , which cut back the social welfare state . but müntefering was anything but a neo-liberal capitalist .
he was also the one who accused investors of snapping up profits and destroying jobs like a plague of locusts .
müntefering was an old-school social democrat who only pushed for painful cuts to ensure that social welfare programs remained affordable . recently , müntefering had to swallow a number of political defeats .
two weeks ago , at the spd party conference , his rival kurt beck convinced social democrats to back reforms to müntefering 's agenda 2010 , and on monday , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition dismissed his idea for a minimum wage for mail deliverers . those defeats did n't mean he had to retire .
the spd may have voted against him on one issue , but the party still celebrated him as a hero , and merkel has never tired in her praise for müntefering as a stabilizing factor within the governing coalition . but even if there is no reason to doubt that müntefering 's decision to step down was a personal , and not a political one , he chose an apt juncture to do so .
germany is halfway through the current legislative period , and his successors will have enough time to make names for themselves .
moreover , party leader kurt beck will have a free hand to prepare the spd for the next election . if he is to avoid an electoral debacle in 2009 , beck will have to check the rise of the left party and free the spd from merkel 's shadow .
his most recent initiatives were aimed at doing both . but beck will have to tread carefully to avoid endangering the grand coalition .
that 's why he appointed olaf scholz as labor minister - scholz is a non-ideological technocrat who wo n't disrupt the management of government with any wild escapades . the spd under beck will now enter a new phase in the struggle for political power , while franz müntefering will enter retirement - at the age of 67 . peter stützle heads dw-radio 's capital bureau in berlin -lrb- jc -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bloc , which now holds the narrowest possible majority , had 94 seats before the elections . the 90th vote for the coalition came from the faroe islands , a danish territory , and was n't counted until early wednesday morning , clinching the coalition 's razor-thin majority . " it 's historic that for the third election in a row the liberals are denmark 's biggest party , " said rasmussen on tuesday after most of the votes had been counted .

13 . new vehicles that emit 100 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer or less will no longer be subject to an annual tax , according to a plan released tuesday by the german government . the car tax proposal is intended to replace the existing law , which charges car owners based on the size of their vehicle .
if approved by germany 's state governments in early december , the tax exemption would apply to vehicles admitted as of jan .
1 , 2009 . car tax coffers are intended to break even by 2013 , with high-emitters covering the lost tax revenue from new more environmentally friendly vehicles . currently , there are very few cars on the market that meet the 100-gram-per-kilometer emission standard .
starting in 2009 , a sliding tax scale would apply to new vehicles with higher co2 emissions . old vehicles would continue to be charged according to their size , but at higher rates . germany , europe seek gradual co2 reduction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tax plan is intended to influence those in the market for a new car new cars now emit an average of 170 grams of co2 per kilometer .
germany aims to cut this amount to 120 grams by 2012 .
the goal is part of a larger environment package approved by the government in august that also targets pollutant building facilities , electronic equipment and energy plants . measures are in place europe-wide to tighten emissions levels on new vehicles in 2009 and again in 2014 .
the german finance ministry 's bid would allow for an early tax exemption for those cars that already meet the planned 2009 and 2014 standards , both of which foresee a co2 limit of 100 grams per kilometer . an eu law dictating an emissions-based vehicle tax has been on the table , but has come up against resistance from eight member countries .
germany has said it would support the motion from brussels . critics decry proposal 's scope the environmentally-oriented german traffic club -lrb- vcd -rrb- has criticized germany 's new vehicle tax plan for not going far enough . vcd auto expert gerd lottsiepen said that each gram of co2 cost the same amount , gas-guzzling cars would hardly be more expensive than before , news agency dpa reported . the organization has suggested a tax advantage for vehicles with especially high gas mileage as well as low emissions . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 . the 67-year-old müntefering , known for his folksy style and good working relationship with chancellor angela merkel , was a moderate who was seen as playing a stabilizing role in the coalition .
he said he was leaving office to spend more time with his wife , who has been battling cancer for years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering chose to be with his wife , leaving german politics uncertain if müntefering 's departure is not expected to break up the already unwieldy , two-year-old " grand coalition " between merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , then it is certainly likely to increase tensions , observers said . spd leader : " we will pull no punches " cdu member jürgen rüttgers , the premier of the state of north rhine-westphalia , praised müntefering in an interview with deutschlandfunk radio on wednesday .
the spd leader always spoke directly and tried " to contribute to the success of the grand coalition , " rüttgers said . many predict that müntefering 's absence will strengthen germany 's belligerent far-left and , indeed , müntefering 's seat was barely cool when spd activists began testing waters with a stronger approach . on wednesday , spd acting vice chairwoman andrea nahles predicted a phase of increased left-right political hostility in germany . we will pull no punches , " she told rbb-inforadio noting that the spd planned to fight especially hard for a minimum wage for postal-delivery workers . minimum wage debate is key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering was known for his terse but folksy manner earlier in the week , merkel 's coalition had shot down a müntefering-backed proposal for a postal minimum wage , leading some to speculate that his decision to step down was a political one . nahles insisted that müntefering 's replacements " wo n't be giving anything away " to the cdu . " the union will have to get used to the idea that we will be obdurate in our fight for a minimum wage , " she said .
" i think ms. merkel 's grace period has come to an end . " parliamentarian olaf scholz , the spd 's former secretary general , will take müntefering 's job as labor minister , and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier will become germany 's vice chancellor while retaining his current duties . meanwhile , spd parliamentary group leader peter struck also foresaw difficult battles ahead , noting in an interview with deutschlandfunk that müntefering was " one of the pillars of the coalition . " some foresee stagnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp 's westerwelle expects a stalemate still , officials from both parties have said they have no desire to call early elections before 2009 because neither of the traditional rivals could win a majority with their coalition partner of choice and would likely end up again having to govern together . the leader of the opposition free-market liberal fdp , guido westerwelle , predicted stagnation in berlin . " the coalition is formally still in office , but it has long stopped governing , " he said .
" it is bad for germany because we will now have a months-long , and if we are unlucky two-year-long , general election campaign ahead of us . " a representative of the opposition green party said the cabinet changes indicated that leading government members no longer believe in continuity of the coalition . volker beck , the green party 's secretary general , told the dpa news service that the fact that spd party chief kurt beck decided not to take over the vice chancellor and labor minister positions was a clear sign " that beck does not trust the peace in berlin . " " dramatic challenge " for the coalition if beck were to join in the coalition cabinet , it would undercut his ability to wage a campaign opposing the cdu in the next national elections , the green party politician said . müntefering 's departure " dramatically damaged " the coalition 's situation , giving each party a chance to try and push its own agenda further , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck turned down the cabinet job for his part , cdu parliamentary group leader norbert röttgen told ard public broadcaster that he did n't expect the minimum-wage debate to remain the central point of contention for the next two years . he also cast doubt on the forecasts that government debate would become increasingly hostile . if that were the case , the politicians who step into müntefering 's shoes would be letting him down by turning their back on what meant most to the politician : his conviction that the spd " should be part of the grand coalition , and should be identified with its successes .

he said canadian troops in the kandahar province stopped handing over prisoners until their safety and human rights could be guaranteed . the general added that isaf rules of engagement agreed to by the nato council required soldiers to convey prisoners to the afghan security officials within 96 hours . " i now expect politicians to become active and influence the afghan government to change things , " ramms told deutsche welle .
" if we obey the rules agreed on and given to us , it is terrible for the soldiers to be the ones accused of acting inappropriately . " investigation to begin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soldiers are not to blame for applying the rules given to them , ramms said afghan president hamid karzai 's government announced on wednesday that it will investigate amnesty 's claims . " an authorized commission appointed by the president will seriously investigate the issue , " the afghan foreign ministry said in a statement .
" afghanistan is against any physical and mental torture and is committed to all international human rights standards which are also stated in the afghan constitution . " isaf has 40,000 troops in afghanistan from 37 countries .
britain , canada , denmark , the netherlands and norway have signed agreements on prisoner transfers , according to amnesty .

13 , german deputy chancellor and labor minister franz müntefering said he was stepping down because of his wife 's serious illness .
dw 's peter stützle takes a look back at his career . franz müntefering is retiring at the age of 67 , were it not for the tragic circumstances of his wife 's struggle against cancer , one would be tempted to say that it 's fitting .
müntefering was the one who suggested raising the retirement age in germany from 65 to 67 . that was a bold step for a social democrat , drawing a huge outcry from labor unions and giving a central issue to the newly formed rival left party .
previously , as part of the spd-led government under gerhard schröder , müntefering had also been a major advocate of the agenda 2010 reforms , which cut back the social welfare state . but müntefering was anything but a neo-liberal capitalist .
he was also the one who accused investors of snapping up profits and destroying jobs like a plague of locusts .
müntefering was an old-school social democrat who only pushed for painful cuts to ensure that social welfare programs remained affordable . recently , müntefering had to swallow a number of political defeats .
two weeks ago , at the spd party conference , his rival kurt beck convinced social democrats to back reforms to müntefering 's agenda 2010 , and on monday , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition dismissed his idea for a minimum wage for mail deliverers . those defeats did n't mean he had to retire .
the spd may have voted against him on one issue , but the party still celebrated him as a hero , and merkel has never tired in her praise for müntefering as a stabilizing factor within the governing coalition . but even if there is no reason to doubt that müntefering 's decision to step down was a personal , and not a political one , he chose an apt juncture to do so .
germany is halfway through the current legislative period , and his successors will have enough time to make names for themselves .
moreover , party leader kurt beck will have a free hand to prepare the spd for the next election . if he is to avoid an electoral debacle in 2009 , beck will have to check the rise of the left party and free the spd from merkel 's shadow .
his most recent initiatives were aimed at doing both . but beck will have to tread carefully to avoid endangering the grand coalition .
that 's why he appointed olaf scholz as labor minister - scholz is a non-ideological technocrat who wo n't disrupt the management of government with any wild escapades . the spd under beck will now enter a new phase in the struggle for political power , while franz müntefering will enter retirement - at the age of 67 . peter stützle heads dw-radio 's capital bureau in berlin -lrb- jc -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

müntefering was the one who suggested raising the retirement age in germany from 65 to 67 . that was a bold step for a social democrat , drawing a huge outcry from labor unions and giving a central issue to the newly formed rival left party .
previously , as part of the spd-led government under gerhard schröder , müntefering had also been a major advocate of the agenda 2010 reforms , which cut back the social welfare state . but müntefering was anything but a neo-liberal capitalist .
he was also the one who accused investors of snapping up profits and destroying jobs like a plague of locusts .
müntefering was an old-school social democrat who only pushed for painful cuts to ensure that social welfare programs remained affordable . recently , müntefering had to swallow a number of political defeats .
two weeks ago , at the spd party conference , his rival kurt beck convinced social democrats to back reforms to müntefering 's agenda 2010 , and on monday , chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition dismissed his idea for a minimum wage for mail deliverers . those defeats did n't mean he had to retire .
the spd may have voted against him on one issue , but the party still celebrated him as a hero , and merkel has never tired in her praise for müntefering as a stabilizing factor within the governing coalition . but even if there is no reason to doubt that müntefering 's decision to step down was a personal , and not a political one , he chose an apt juncture to do so .
germany is halfway through the current legislative period , and his successors will have enough time to make names for themselves .
moreover , party leader kurt beck will have a free hand to prepare the spd for the next election . if he is to avoid an electoral debacle in 2009 , beck will have to check the rise of the left party and free the spd from merkel 's shadow .
his most recent initiatives were aimed at doing both . but beck will have to tread carefully to avoid endangering the grand coalition .
that 's why he appointed olaf scholz as labor minister - scholz is a non-ideological technocrat who wo n't disrupt the management of government with any wild escapades . the spd under beck will now enter a new phase in the struggle for political power , while franz müntefering will enter retirement - at the age of 67 . peter stützle heads dw-radio 's capital bureau in berlin -lrb- jc -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 , retaining its hold on government despite losing parliamentary seats overall . prime minister anders fogh rasmussen 's liberal-conservative coalition and its far-right ally , the danish people 's party , won 90 seats in the country 's 179-member parliament , promising voters lower taxes and a strict asylum policy .
the bloc , which now holds the narrowest possible majority , had 94 seats before the elections . the 90th vote for the coalition came from the faroe islands , a danish territory , and was n't counted until early wednesday morning , clinching the coalition 's razor-thin majority . " it 's historic that for the third election in a row the liberals are denmark 's biggest party , " said rasmussen on tuesday after most of the votes had been counted .

but on a grey , rainy day in november it 's easy to understand why this town has some of the most deprived neighbourhoods in essex .
bishops park college serves those neighbourhoods , and for the past five years it 's been a pioneer of the " small schools " movement in the uk .
the college is divided into three distinct " schools " , called windmills , lighthouses and towers .
there 's room for 250 children in each and all three have their own teaching staff who cover the whole curriculum . "
our staff have the time to build up strong relationships with the children and with their parents " peter robinson principal call for smaller schools pupils share areas like the library and the dining room , but they have lunches and breaks at different times .
the principal , peter robinson , is convinced the small-school model is particularly suited to the needs of vulnerable children .
" we do n't have the factory style model of many big schools where children can easily feel lost and isolated , " he says .
" the relationship with the teachers is absolutely pivotal .
in a large school teachers may only see a pupil once a week .
" our staff have the time to build up strong relationships with the children and with their parents .
" that makes the children feel safe and secure - and that 's the best foundation for learning . "
good relationships frances holloway , the senior teacher in charge of windmills school , says the opportunity to bond with pupils is the reason she came to bishops park .
" i 'm convinced that it 's a very powerful way to organise learning .
in my last job i probably taught 250 children a week and now i teach 80 or 90 , so i know them really well . "
' cos the classes are small the teachers get to know you better " katie a pupil " i can tell you how they are doing simply because i know them .
we work together a lot as co-learners and so that relationship is really important . "
perhaps unsurprisingly , pupils are equally positive .
" i think it stops a lot of arguments , " says 14-year-old katie .
" yes , " chimes in 13-year-old jamie , " ' cos it 's not too crowded . "
" ' cos the classes are small the teachers get to know you better , " adds 14-year-old lauren .
" i came from a traditional school and when i came here , although it was very different , i liked it and i think i learn more . "
critics argue that small schools struggle to provide a wide enough curriculum and they can find it difficult to recruit specialist teachers .
peter robinson confirms he 's had difficulty getting science teachers to bishops park and standards in science have suffered as a result .
academic challenges only 39 % of the school 's 14-year-olds reached the expected level in science in last year 's national tests .
there are signs that while the school is certainly strong in nurturing its pupils , it has performed less well academically .
there have been no permanent exclusions and no teen pregnancies - a notable success for this deprived part of essex .
but only 16 % of pupils got five good gcse 's last year , including english and maths - just over a third of the national average .
the school is also a bit too small for comfort .
the three units are supposed to have 750 pupils - but because of falling rolls in that part of essex , almost a third of the places are empty .
as a result the county council is planning to consult on a proposal to allow another school on the other side of clacton to take over bishops park .
peter robinson says he , his staff and his pupils will fight any plans to alter their small school ethos .

but on a grey , rainy day in november it 's easy to understand why this town has some of the most deprived neighbourhoods in essex .
bishops park college serves those neighbourhoods , and for the past five years it 's been a pioneer of the " small schools " movement in the uk .
the college is divided into three distinct " schools " , called windmills , lighthouses and towers .
there 's room for 250 children in each and all three have their own teaching staff who cover the whole curriculum .
our staff have the time to build up strong relationships with the children and with their parents peter robinson principal call for smaller schools pupils share areas like the library and the dining room , but they have lunches and breaks at different times .
the principal , peter robinson , is convinced the small-school model is particularly suited to the needs of vulnerable children .
" we do n't have the factory style model of many big schools where children can easily feel lost and isolated , " he says .
" the relationship with the teachers is absolutely pivotal .
in a large school teachers may only see a pupil once a week .
" our staff have the time to build up strong relationships with the children and with their parents .
" that makes the children feel safe and secure - and that 's the best foundation for learning . "
good relationships frances holloway , the senior teacher in charge of windmills school , says the opportunity to bond with pupils is the reason she came to bishops park .
" i 'm convinced that it 's a very powerful way to organise learning .
in my last job i probably taught 250 children a week and now i teach 80 or 90 , so i know them really well .
' cos the classes are small the teachers get to know you better katie a pupil " i can tell you how they are doing simply because i know them .
we work together a lot as co-learners and so that relationship is really important . "
perhaps unsurprisingly , pupils are equally positive .
" i think it stops a lot of arguments , " says 14-year-old katie .
" yes , " chimes in 13-year-old jamie , " ' cos it 's not too crowded . "
" ' cos the classes are small the teachers get to know you better , " adds 14-year-old lauren .
" i came from a traditional school and when i came here , although it was very different , i liked it and i think i learn more . "
critics argue that small schools struggle to provide a wide enough curriculum and they can find it difficult to recruit specialist teachers .
peter robinson confirms he 's had difficulty getting science teachers to bishops park and standards in science have suffered as a result .
academic challenges only 39 % of the school 's 14-year-olds reached the expected level in science in last year 's national tests .
there are signs that while the school is certainly strong in nurturing its pupils , it has performed less well academically .
there have been no permanent exclusions and no teen pregnancies - a notable success for this deprived part of essex .
but only 16 % of pupils got five good gcse 's last year , including english and maths - just over a third of the national average .
the school is also a bit too small for comfort .
the three units are supposed to have 750 pupils - but because of falling rolls in that part of essex , almost a third of the places are empty .
as a result the county council is planning to consult on a proposal to allow another school on the other side of clacton to take over bishops park .
peter robinson says he , his staff and his pupils will fight any plans to alter their small school ethos .

the us-based group says abuse of maids is rampant in the united arab emirates , saudi arabia , kuwait and lebanon .
employers routinely confiscate domestic workers ' passports and confine them to the workplace , the rights group says .
the uae has denied the charges , saying human rights watch has ignored its efforts to improve workers ' conditions .
more than 660,000 sri lankan women work abroad as maids , nearly 90 % of them in the gulf countries .
abusive employers the 131-page report - called exported and exposed - documents the serious abuses that domestic workers face at every step of the migration process .
thousands of sri lankans head overseas for work each year " governments in the gulf expose sri lankan domestic workers to abuse by refusing to guarantee a weekly rest day , limits to the workday freedom of movement and other rights that most workers take for granted , " said jennifer turner , a women 's rights researcher at human rights watch .
" too many abusive employers and unscrupulous labour agents get away with exploiting these workers without any real punishment . "
the report is based on 170 interviews with domestic workers , government officials , and labour recruiters conducted in sri lanka and in the middle east .
" domestic workers typically labour for 16 to 21 hours a day , without rest breaks or days off , for extremely low wages of 15 to 30 us cents per hour , " the report says .
' reform laws ' some domestic workers told human rights watch how they were subjected to forced confinement , food deprivation , physical and verbal abuse , forced labour , and sexual harassment and rape by their employers .
" the gulf countries need to do a lot more to stop abuse of domestic workers , " ms turner said .
" the governments of saudi arabia , kuwait and the uae should extend labour laws to domestic workers , ensure their complaints can be heard and reform immigration laws so that workers are n't tied to employers . "
the rights group has also urged the sri lankan government to improve regulation and monitoring of recruitment agents , as well as services for abused workers in consulates abroad .
the uae has dismissed the charges .
in response , it said human rights watch has " once again chosen to ignore many of the positive steps adopted by the uae in recent months to improve conditions for temporary foreign workers in the country " .
many of hrw 's recommendations have already been met or are in progress , the uae 's state news agency wam quoted anwar gargash , minister of state for federal national council affairs , as saying .
migrant workers make up the largest net foreign exchange earner for sri lanka .
the country has a huge unemployment problem , and often can not dictate terms to richer nations .

" too many abusive employers and unscrupulous labour agents get away with exploiting these workers without any real punishment . "
the report is based on 170 interviews with domestic workers , government officials , and labour recruiters conducted in sri lanka and in the middle east .
" domestic workers typically labour for 16 to 21 hours a day , without rest breaks or days off , for extremely low wages of 15 to 30 us cents per hour , " the report says .
' reform laws ' some domestic workers told human rights watch how they were subjected to forced confinement , food deprivation , physical and verbal abuse , forced labour , and sexual harassment and rape by their employers .
" the gulf countries need to do a lot more to stop abuse of domestic workers , " ms turner said .
" the governments of saudi arabia , kuwait and the uae should extend labour laws to domestic workers , ensure their complaints can be heard and reform immigration laws so that workers are n't tied to employers . "
the rights group has also urged the sri lankan government to improve regulation and monitoring of recruitment agents , as well as services for abused workers in consulates abroad .
the uae has dismissed the charges .
in response , it said human rights watch has " once again chosen to ignore many of the positive steps adopted by the uae in recent months to improve conditions for temporary foreign workers in the country " .
many of hrw 's recommendations have already been met or are in progress , the uae 's state news agency wam quoted anwar gargash , minister of state for federal national council affairs , as saying .
migrant workers make up the largest net foreign exchange earner for sri lanka .
the country has a huge unemployment problem , and often can not dictate terms to richer nations .

independent peer baroness susan greenfield will raise the issue in the house of lords on wednesday .
her intervention follows a bbc panorama programme which highlighted us research suggesting drugs are no better than therapy for adhd in the long-term .
there was also evidence that their use may stunt child growth . "
we need to find out urgently why there has been such a remarkable increase in the numbers of children being diagnosed with adhd " baroness susan greenfield the multimodal treatment study of children with adhd by the university of buffalo has been monitoring the treatment of 600 children across the us since the 1990s .
most of the estimated 500,000 children in britain with adhd receive no treatment at all .
but of those that do , most - about 55,000 last year - are prescribed stimulants like ritalin and concerta .
wide-ranging inquiry baroness greenfield will call for a wide-ranging inquiry into the huge increase in adhd diagnoses .
she said : " as well as assessing adhd drugs themselves , we also need to find out urgently why there has been such a remarkable increase in the numbers of children being diagnosed with adhd in the last 20 years or so .
" could the changes to our ways of living be contributing to this increase ?
" the time is ripe for an inquiry exploring the actual causes of adhd that goes beyond merely evaluating the pros and cons of ritalin .
" such an inquiry could consider diverse factors ranging from diet through to screen-based activity and how they may be changing the way both children and adults interact socially .
" children live a fast-paced , highly interactive , response mode type of existence , and maybe as a result when they go to school they find it harder to sit still . "
a department of health spokesperson said the national institute for health and clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- had advised that drugs should only be used to treat adhd as part of a comprehensive treatment programme , including behavioural therapy .
" careful , informed clinical decision-making , involving the parents and child should involve discussion of the benefits versus the risks of all interventions .
" we have also asked nice to develop a clinical guideline on both the pharmacological and psychological interventions to treat adhd . "

independent peer baroness susan greenfield will raise the issue in the house of lords on wednesday .
her intervention follows a bbc panorama programme which highlighted us research suggesting drugs are no better than therapy for adhd in the long-term .
there was also evidence that their use may stunt child growth .
we need to find out urgently why there has been such a remarkable increase in the numbers of children being diagnosed with adhd baroness susan greenfield the multimodal treatment study of children with adhd by the university of buffalo has been monitoring the treatment of 600 children across the us since the 1990s .
most of the estimated 500,000 children in britain with adhd receive no treatment at all .

wide-ranging inquiry baroness greenfield will call for a wide-ranging inquiry into the huge increase in adhd diagnoses .
she said : " as well as assessing adhd drugs themselves , we also need to find out urgently why there has been such a remarkable increase in the numbers of children being diagnosed with adhd in the last 20 years or so .
" could the changes to our ways of living be contributing to this increase ?
" the time is ripe for an inquiry exploring the actual causes of adhd that goes beyond merely evaluating the pros and cons of ritalin .
" such an inquiry could consider diverse factors ranging from diet through to screen-based activity and how they may be changing the way both children and adults interact socially .
" children live a fast-paced , highly interactive , response mode type of existence , and maybe as a result when they go to school they find it harder to sit still . "
a department of health spokesperson said the national institute for health and clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- had advised that drugs should only be used to treat adhd as part of a comprehensive treatment programme , including behavioural therapy .
" careful , informed clinical decision-making , involving the parents and child should involve discussion of the benefits versus the risks of all interventions .
" we have also asked nice to develop a clinical guideline on both the pharmacological and psychological interventions to treat adhd . "
